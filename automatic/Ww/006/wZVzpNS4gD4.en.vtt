a little about the ipod touch and now of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
a little about the ipod touch and now of
course<00:00:23.760> every<00:00:24.359> year<00:00:24.570> apple<00:00:24.960> updates<00:00:25.380> their

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
course every year apple updates their

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.550 
course every year apple updates their
iphone<00:00:26.340> ipod<00:00:27.060> touch<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.420> now<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.599> ipad<00:00:28.230> lines

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
iphone ipod touch and now the ipad lines

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.470 
iphone ipod touch and now the ipad lines
so<00:00:29.160> we've<00:00:29.310> got<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> good<00:00:29.670> idea<00:00:29.789> what<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.449> expect

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
now the first thing is is the Apple a5

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.080 
now the first thing is is the Apple a5
dual-core<00:00:34.079> CPU<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.670> same<00:00:35.850> way<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
dual-core CPU this is the same way it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.840 
dual-core CPU this is the same way it
came<00:00:36.239> there's<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.630> new<00:00:36.950> apple<00:00:37.950> last<00:00:38.340> year<00:00:38.520> apple

4 and finally came around the ipod touch
so<00:00:43.559> absolutely<00:00:43.950> expect<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> same

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
so absolutely expect to see the same

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
so absolutely expect to see the same
processor<00:00:45.690> from<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.050> ipad<00:00:46.410> trickle<00:00:47.129> down<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
processor from the ipad trickle down to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
processor from the ipad trickle down to
both<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> iphone<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> ipod<00:00:48.660> touch<00:00:48.930> later

both the iphone the ipod touch later

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.930 
both the iphone the ipod touch later
this<00:00:49.379> year<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.890> know<00:00:50.219> what<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> will<00:00:50.610> mean<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
this year I know what that will mean is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.010 
this year I know what that will mean is
that<00:00:50.969> internet<00:00:51.449> browser<00:00:51.600> will<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.870> much

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that internet browser will be much

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.290 
that internet browser will be much
faster<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.770> especially<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.579> gains<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
faster and especially in gains the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.939 
faster and especially in gains the
graphical<00:00:55.050> performance<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> be

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
graphical performance is going to be

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
graphical performance is going to be
much<00:00:56.340> much<00:00:56.579> superior<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> current

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
much much superior to the current

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.349 
much much superior to the current
generation<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.859> processors<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.969> iphone

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
generation of processors in the iphone

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.910 
generation of processors in the iphone
the<00:01:00.510> ipod<00:01:00.899> touch<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the ipod touch so that's going to be a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.640 
the ipod touch so that's going to be a
big<00:01:02.100> deal<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.420> far<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.660> no<00:01:03.870> gaming<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.589> all

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
big deal but as far as no gaming and all

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
big deal but as far as no gaming and all
that<00:01:04.799> kind<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> good<00:01:05.040> stuff<00:01:05.129> always<00:01:05.580> more

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
that kind of good stuff always more

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.240 
that kind of good stuff always more
speed<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> better<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.680> far<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> actual

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
speed is better now as far as the actual

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.820 
speed is better now as far as the actual
design<00:01:08.790> itself<00:01:09.150> goes<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.720> not<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.770> i

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
design itself goes up not really i

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.620 
design itself goes up not really i
wasn't<00:01:11.189> sure<00:01:11.250> there's<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> couple<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.060> people

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
wasn't sure there's a couple of people

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.690 
wasn't sure there's a couple of people
that<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.350> couple<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.740> different<00:01:14.040> ideas<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that have a couple of different ideas of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.580 
that have a couple of different ideas of
what's<00:01:15.299> floating<00:01:15.540> around<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:16.080> far<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.470> we're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
what's floating around as far what we're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
what's floating around as far what we're
going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.060> hand<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.420> might<00:01:18.509> be

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
going to see on the one hand it might be

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.660 
going to see on the one hand it might be
just<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.990> basically<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.650> super<00:01:20.159> super<00:01:20.430> minor

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
just a basically a super super minor

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.190 
just a basically a super super minor
upgrade<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.689> did<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
upgrade just like when they did with the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899 
upgrade just like when they did with the
third<00:01:22.409> generation<00:01:22.610> meaning<00:01:23.610> there's<00:01:23.759> not

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
third generation meaning there's not

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060 
third generation meaning there's not
going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.180> any<00:01:24.390> major<00:01:24.890> how<00:01:25.890> we're

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
going to be any major how we're

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.200 
going to be any major how we're
improving<00:01:26.280> survivor<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> look

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
improving survivor it's going to look

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.609 
improving survivor it's going to look
basically<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.689> same<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.080> some<00:01:28.259> internal

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
basically the same just some internal

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.140 
basically the same just some internal
stuff<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.220> speed<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.939> kind<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
stuff on speed and all that kind of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
stuff on speed and all that kind of
stuff<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.259> other<00:01:31.409> hand<00:01:31.590> though<00:01:31.799> there's<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
stuff on the other hand though there's a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.010 
stuff on the other hand though there's a
lot<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> talk<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> larger<00:01:33.420> display<00:01:33.810> on

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
lot of talk about a larger display on

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.300 
lot of talk about a larger display on
the<00:01:34.140> iphone<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.829> course<00:01:35.009> i<00:01:35.100> would<00:01:35.220> imagine

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the iphone and of course i would imagine

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
the iphone and of course i would imagine
that<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.790> trickle<00:01:36.000> down<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> ipod

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that would trickle down to the ipod

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.690 
that would trickle down to the ipod
touch<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:37.920> would<00:01:38.130> mean<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
touch so what that would mean is that a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.510 
touch so what that would mean is that a
larger<00:01:39.270> screen<00:01:39.450> press<00:01:39.750> preps<00:01:40.159> 3.7<00:01:41.159> inches<00:01:41.369> or

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
larger screen press preps 3.7 inches or

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.100 
larger screen press preps 3.7 inches or
so<00:01:41.700> maybe<00:01:42.210> even<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.540> little<00:01:42.630> bit<00:01:42.720> bigger<00:01:42.930> than

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
so maybe even a little bit bigger than

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.749 
so maybe even a little bit bigger than
that<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> same<00:01:44.130> footprint<00:01:44.610> which

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that and in the same footprint which

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.130 
that and in the same footprint which
means<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.210> basically<00:01:45.509> would<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.049> get

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
means that it basically would just get

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.480 
means that it basically would just get
rid<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.409> lot<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> bezel<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.280> kind<00:01:47.460> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
rid of a lot of the bezel just kind of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
rid of a lot of the bezel just kind of
stretch<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.240> more<00:01:48.420> which<00:01:48.960> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
stretch out a little bit more which of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.389 
stretch out a little bit more which of
course<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.380> always<00:01:49.799> good<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.189> should

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
course is always good and it should

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.969 
course is always good and it should
remain<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> Retina<00:01:51.149> display<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.500> far<00:01:52.770> as

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
remain a Retina display now as far as

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
remain a Retina display now as far as
the<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.880> goes<00:01:54.090> i'm<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> harmston<00:01:54.780> sure<00:01:54.960> if

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the that goes i'm not a harmston sure if

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
the that goes i'm not a harmston sure if
we're<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.320> see<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.770> um<00:01:56.009> i<00:01:56.340> would<00:01:56.850> i

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
we're going to see that um i would i

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.429 
we're going to see that um i would i
would<00:01:57.090> expect<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> iphone

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.929 
would expect we you see on the iphone

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.700 
but whether actually comes down to ipod
touch<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.329> how<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> ensure<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.320> better

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
touch on that how to ensure a better

touch on that how to ensure a better
area<00:02:01.950> i<00:02:02.100> don't<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.520> slightly<00:02:02.909> bigger

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299

screen<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> make<00:02:04.140> all<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.500> big<00:02:04.710> of

a<00:02:04.890> difference<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:06.030> one<00:02:06.299> thing<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.689> i<00:02:06.719> am

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
a difference and now one thing that i am

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.540 
a difference and now one thing that i am
really<00:02:07.229> really<00:02:07.469> hoping<00:02:07.890> forward<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.310> seeing

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.669 
really really hoping forward to seeing
the<00:02:08.670> next<00:02:08.879> ipod<00:02:09.209> touch<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.750> better<00:02:10.289> camera

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the next ipod touch is a better camera

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.540 
the next ipod touch is a better camera
and<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.459> course<00:02:11.520> having

and of course having
ipod<00:02:13.000> touch<00:02:13.150> that's<00:02:13.390> great<00:02:13.750> but<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.680> one<00:02:14.830> that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
ipod touch that's great but the one that

they<00:02:15.040> put<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.430> ipod<00:02:15.700> touch<00:02:15.760> 4th

megapixel stills are not good in the
slightest<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.180> don't<00:02:25.480> care<00:02:25.600> which<00:02:25.870> way<00:02:26.020> you

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
slightest I I don't care which way you

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.070 
slightest I I don't care which way you
look<00:02:26.290> at<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.740> they're<00:02:27.310> really<00:02:27.670> small<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.330> I

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
look at it on they're really small and I

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.300 
look at it on they're really small and I
just<00:02:29.290> don't<00:02:29.440> look<00:02:29.590> back<00:02:29.740> right<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.130> what<00:02:30.280> I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
just don't look back right so what I

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.180 
just don't look back right so what I
hope<00:02:30.730> for<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:31.210> they<00:02:31.990> could<00:02:32.050> increase<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.950> you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
hope for is they could increase the you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.430

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
know the camera quality at it I'm not

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.780 
know the camera quality at it I'm not
asking<00:02:35.770> for<00:02:35.920> something<00:02:36.100> as<00:02:36.310> good<00:02:36.490> as<00:02:36.610> on<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
touch a bit thicker but i really do

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.930 
touch a bit thicker but i really do
believe<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.890> they<00:02:45.130> could<00:02:45.310> make<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.640> better

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
believe that they could make a better

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.120 
believe that they could make a better
quality<00:02:46.210> camera<00:02:46.690> inside<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.170> ipod<00:02:47.500> touch<00:02:47.800> 5th

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.970 
looking for far as when we can expect to
see<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:51.970> hour<00:02:52.510> typically<00:02:53.200> we<00:02:53.410> do<00:02:53.530> see<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:53.920> in

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
see this hour typically we do see it in

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.470 
see this hour typically we do see it in
September<00:02:54.490> however<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.090> looks<00:02:55.180> like<00:02:55.390> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
September however it looks like the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.210 
September however it looks like the
iPhone<00:02:55.810> 5<00:02:56.080> is<00:02:56.110> going<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.500> be<00:02:56.560> pushed<00:02:56.830> back<00:02:57.040> to

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
iPhone 5 is going to be pushed back to

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.250 
iPhone 5 is going to be pushed back to
September<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.330> we<00:02:58.480> might<00:02:58.630> see<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:58.900> September

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
September so we might see in September

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.360 
September so we might see in September
or<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.440> might<00:02:59.530> even<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.830> little<00:02:59.890> bit<00:03:00.130> farther

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
or it might even be a little bit farther

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.100 
or it might even be a little bit farther
so<00:03:00.760> definitely<00:03:01.360> keep<00:03:01.540> an<00:03:01.600> eye<00:03:01.720> out<00:03:01.750> for<00:03:01.930> that

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
so definitely keep an eye out for that

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.600 
so definitely keep an eye out for that
but<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.440> would<00:03:02.590> imagine<00:03:02.800> would<00:03:03.130> probably<00:03:03.400> be<00:03:03.460> in

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
but I would imagine would probably be in

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.820 
but I would imagine would probably be in
the<00:03:03.640> sep<00:03:03.880> tember<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.270> october<00:03:04.660> time<00:03:04.870> frame<00:03:05.200> and

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
the sep tember to october time frame and

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.500 
the sep tember to october time frame and
then<00:03:06.040> moving<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.790> software<00:03:07.180> side<00:03:07.450> of

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
then moving on to the software side of

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.120 
then moving on to the software side of
course<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:07.990> going<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.320> apply<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.590> lot<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
course it's going to apply a lot to the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.170 
course it's going to apply a lot to the
iphone<00:03:09.460> 5<00:03:09.670> as<00:03:09.850> well<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.270> iOS<00:03:11.080> 5<00:03:11.410> now<00:03:12.310> iOS<00:03:12.610> 5<00:03:12.910> is

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
iphone 5 as well is iOS 5 now iOS 5 is

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.030 
iphone 5 as well is iOS 5 now iOS 5 is
again<00:03:13.660> something<00:03:13.960> that<00:03:14.140> we've<00:03:14.650> been<00:03:14.770> waiting

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
again something that we've been waiting

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.290 
again something that we've been waiting
for<00:03:15.190> for<00:03:15.340> quite<00:03:15.490> a<00:03:15.550> while<00:03:15.730> it's<00:03:15.940> going<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.210> be

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
for for quite a while it's going to be

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.060 
for for quite a while it's going to be
the<00:03:16.420> next<00:03:16.570> generation<00:03:17.140> operating<00:03:17.620> system<00:03:17.650> for

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
the next generation operating system for

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.830 
the next generation operating system for
both<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.400> iphone<00:03:18.820> ipod<00:03:19.450> touch<00:03:19.480> and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
both the iphone ipod touch and

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.680 
both the iphone ipod touch and
eventually<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.350> ipad<00:03:20.890> another<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:21.970> lot<00:03:22.540> of

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
eventually the ipad another a lot of

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.030 
eventually the ipad another a lot of
speculations<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.350> lot<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.709> people<00:03:23.830> who<00:03:23.950> have

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
speculations a lot of people who have

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.010 
speculations a lot of people who have
been<00:03:24.070> talking<00:03:24.459> about<00:03:24.489> iOS<00:03:24.850> 5<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.900> it's

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
been talking about iOS 5 and that it's

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
been talking about iOS 5 and that it's
probably<00:03:26.140> going<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.410> be<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.530> lot<00:03:26.770> of<00:03:26.800> big

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
probably going to be a lot of big

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.320 
probably going to be a lot of big
features<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:27.520> I'm<00:03:27.580> going<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.730> try<00:03:27.820> condense<00:03:28.209> it

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
features so I'm going to try condense it

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.490 
features so I'm going to try condense it
down<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.600> some<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.900> bigger<00:03:29.110> ones<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.470> I

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
down to some of the bigger ones that I

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.080 
down to some of the bigger ones that I
think<00:03:29.800> are<00:03:29.890> going<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.190> be<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.430> most<00:03:30.550> important

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
think are going to be the most important

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.420 
think are going to be the most important
the<00:03:31.870> first<00:03:32.080> of<00:03:32.170> which<00:03:32.230> is<00:03:32.320> widget<00:03:32.680> support<00:03:33.190> and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
the first of which is widget support and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.949 
the first of which is widget support and
this<00:03:33.820> is<00:03:33.910> not<00:03:34.060> confirmed<00:03:34.420> we<00:03:34.600> don't<00:03:34.750> know<00:03:34.840> this

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
this is not confirmed we don't know this

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.449 
this is not confirmed we don't know this
going<00:03:35.140> to<00:03:35.170> happen<00:03:35.290> but<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.680> absolutely<00:03:35.860> would

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
going to happen but I absolutely would

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.670 
going to happen but I absolutely would
really<00:03:36.790> love<00:03:37.000> if<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.840> they<00:03:38.080> bring<00:03:38.290> widgets

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
really love if that they bring widgets

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.260 
really love if that they bring widgets
over<00:03:38.950> just<00:03:39.160> like<00:03:39.220> on<00:03:39.400> Android<00:03:39.910> now<00:03:40.060> if<00:03:40.120> you've

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
over just like on Android now if you've

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.580 
over just like on Android now if you've
ever<00:03:40.330> used<00:03:40.420> an<00:03:40.720> Android<00:03:41.050> device<00:03:41.260> you'll<00:03:41.440> know

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
ever used an Android device you'll know

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.800 
ever used an Android device you'll know
that<00:03:41.620> there<00:03:42.459> are<00:03:42.520> a<00:03:42.610> wide<00:03:42.850> variety<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.330> widgets

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
that there are a wide variety of widgets

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.750 
that there are a wide variety of widgets
the<00:03:43.959> thought<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:45.190> look<00:03:45.310> at<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.489> time

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
the thought you to look at the time

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.120 
the thought you to look at the time
whether<00:03:46.209> i<00:03:46.600> turn<00:03:47.230> on<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.500> off<00:03:47.590> Wi-Fi<00:03:47.800> there's

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
whether i turn on and off Wi-Fi there's

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.590 
whether i turn on and off Wi-Fi there's
a<00:03:48.190> wide<00:03:48.459> variety<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.940> stuff<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.270> can<00:03:49.360> do<00:03:49.510> it

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
a wide variety of stuff you can do it

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.750 
a wide variety of stuff you can do it
off<00:03:49.750> straight<00:03:50.170> from<00:03:50.380> your<00:03:50.530> home<00:03:51.340> screen<00:03:51.489> so

off straight from your home screen so

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.979 
off straight from your home screen so
you<00:03:51.790> know<00:03:51.940> it's<00:03:52.090> really<00:03:52.239> quick<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.870> don't

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
you know it's really quick you don't

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.360 
you know it's really quick you don't
have<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.170> go<00:03:53.260> into<00:03:53.410> settings<00:03:53.860> not<00:03:54.070> kind<00:03:54.310> of

have to go into settings not kind of

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.550 
have to go into settings not kind of
good<00:03:54.520> stuff<00:03:54.750> something<00:03:55.750> else<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.140> expect<00:03:56.470> to

good stuff something else I expect to
see<00:03:56.709> in<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:56.890> next<00:03:56.980> version<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.459> iOS<00:03:57.580> 5<00:03:58.030> is

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
see in the next version of iOS 5 is

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.120 
see in the next version of iOS 5 is
better<00:03:59.050> Facebook<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.709> Twitter<00:03:59.890> integration

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
better Facebook and Twitter integration

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.580 
better Facebook and Twitter integration
of<00:04:00.760> course<00:04:01.480> there<00:04:01.660> are<00:04:01.810> standard<00:04:02.260> facebook

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
of course there are standard facebook

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.080 
of course there are standard facebook
and<00:04:02.739> twitter<00:04:02.860> apps<00:04:03.130> that<00:04:03.400> are<00:04:03.489> available<00:04:03.520> I

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
and twitter apps that are available I

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.880 
and twitter apps that are available I
mean<00:04:04.450> they<00:04:04.600> work<00:04:04.780> really<00:04:04.959> quite<00:04:05.230> nicely<00:04:05.470> but

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
mean they work really quite nicely but

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.020 
mean they work really quite nicely but
what<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.070> would<00:04:06.160> like<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.430> see<00:04:06.580> is<00:04:06.760> better

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
what I would like to see is better

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.180 
what I would like to see is better
integration<00:04:07.420> into<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.810> OS<00:04:08.200> itself<00:04:08.650> and

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
integration into the OS itself and

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.190 
integration into the OS itself and
there's<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.550> lot<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:10.180> know<00:04:10.540> talk<00:04:10.840> about<00:04:11.080> this

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200

has a 2 megapixel camera yeah I think
yeah<00:04:49.099> I<00:04:49.129> think<00:04:49.279> it's<00:04:49.550> somewhere<00:04:49.789> along<00:04:50.029> lines

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
yeah I think it's somewhere along lines

yeah I think it's somewhere along lines
what<00:04:50.449> I<00:04:50.479> was<00:04:50.659> thinking<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.080> mean<00:04:51.259> I<00:04:51.409> really<00:04:51.949> let

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
what I was thinking I mean I really let

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.279 
what I was thinking I mean I really let
me<00:04:52.279> think<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:52.669> we<00:04:52.789> need<00:04:52.819> 1080p<00:04:53.479> video<00:04:53.930> or<00:04:54.169> not

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
me think that we need 1080p video or not

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.629 
me think that we need 1080p video or not
a<00:04:54.319> 5<00:04:54.560> megapixel<00:04:54.710> camera<00:04:55.370> or<00:04:55.430> anything<00:04:55.610> like

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
a 5 megapixel camera or anything like

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.339 
a 5 megapixel camera or anything like
that<00:04:55.729> but<00:04:56.090> I'm<00:04:56.509> just<00:04:56.840> hoping<00:04:56.930> for<00:04:57.169> an

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
that but I'm just hoping for an

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.110 
that but I'm just hoping for an
improvement<00:04:57.889> i<00:04:58.159> mean<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.490> points<00:04:59.060> of

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
improvement i mean the points of

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.879 
improvement i mean the points of
megapixels<00:04:59.419> that's<00:04:59.900> just<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.199> mean<00:05:00.229> that<00:05:00.710> was

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
megapixels that's just I mean that was

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.240 
megapixels that's just I mean that was
okay<00:05:01.189> in<00:05:01.310> 1998<00:05:02.000> but<00:05:02.360> this<00:05:02.569> is<00:05:02.719> 2011<00:05:03.469> that<00:05:03.889> bed

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
okay in 1998 but this is 2011 that bed

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.249 
okay in 1998 but this is 2011 that bed
just<00:05:04.430> doesn't<00:05:04.669> cut<00:05:04.819> in<00:05:04.909> my<00:05:05.029> opinion<00:05:05.270> do<00:05:06.199> I

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
just doesn't cut in my opinion do I

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.379 
just doesn't cut in my opinion do I
think<00:05:06.469> it<00:05:06.529> will<00:05:06.620> cost<00:05:06.830> considerably<00:05:07.250> more<00:05:07.610> no

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
think it will cost considerably more no

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.749 
think it will cost considerably more no
I'm<00:05:08.689> pretty<00:05:09.080> sure<00:05:09.289> I<00:05:09.319> mean<00:05:09.560> they<00:05:10.279> typically

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
I'm pretty sure I mean they typically

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.339 
I'm pretty sure I mean they typically
have<00:05:10.849> always<00:05:11.300> lowered<00:05:11.569> the<00:05:11.719> price<00:05:11.930> now<00:05:12.229> with

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
have always lowered the price now with

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.779 
have always lowered the price now with
the<00:05:12.469> recent<00:05:12.620> generation<00:05:13.069> they<00:05:13.189> did<00:05:13.340> raise<00:05:13.639> it

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
the recent generation they did raise it

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.279 
the recent generation they did raise it
up<00:05:13.849> i<00:05:14.000> believe<00:05:14.240> about<00:05:14.389> thirty<00:05:14.689> dollars<00:05:15.020> or<00:05:15.139> so

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
up i believe about thirty dollars or so

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.240 
up i believe about thirty dollars or so
um<00:05:15.800> but<00:05:16.490> i<00:05:17.050> think<00:05:18.050> if<00:05:18.199> it<00:05:18.349> cost<00:05:18.740> any<00:05:18.979> more<00:05:19.189> i

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
um but i think if it cost any more i

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.740 
um but i think if it cost any more i
think<00:05:19.699> it's<00:05:19.819> going<00:05:19.939> to<00:05:20.000> be<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.150> small<00:05:20.419> amount<00:05:20.689> i

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
think it's going to be a small amount i

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.200 
think it's going to be a small amount i
don't<00:05:20.930> think<00:05:21.080> it's<00:05:21.169> going<00:05:21.319> to<00:05:21.379> be<00:05:21.500> like

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
don't think it's going to be like

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.219 
don't think it's going to be like
dramatically<00:05:23.210> more<00:05:23.240> expensive<00:05:23.839> in<00:05:23.930> fact<00:05:24.110> it

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
dramatically more expensive in fact it

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.179 
dramatically more expensive in fact it
might<00:05:24.349> even<00:05:24.409> be<00:05:24.589> a<00:05:24.650> little<00:05:24.680> bit<00:05:24.889> cheaper

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
might even be a little bit cheaper

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.399 
might even be a little bit cheaper

iOS<00:05:53.300> 5<00:05:53.629> um<00:05:53.960> i<00:05:54.469> think<00:05:54.830> it's<00:05:55.250> possible<00:05:55.550> I<00:05:56.149> mean<00:05:56.629> we

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
iOS 5 um i think it's possible I mean we

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.629 
iOS 5 um i think it's possible I mean we
oh<00:05:56.899> and<00:05:57.229> that<00:05:57.319> we<00:05:57.409> never<00:05:57.589> know<00:05:57.740> what<00:05:58.039> features

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
oh and that we never know what features

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.579 
oh and that we never know what features
they<00:05:58.669> decide<00:05:59.060> to<00:05:59.089> add<00:05:59.300> but<00:05:59.629> in<00:05:59.990> my<00:06:00.110> opinion<00:06:00.229> I

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:00.589 
they decide to add but in my opinion I

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.170 
they decide to add but in my opinion I
would<00:06:00.620> be<00:06:00.800> pretty<00:06:01.099> surprised<00:06:01.460> if<00:06:01.849> they<00:06:02.000> don't

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
would be pretty surprised if they don't

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.629 
would be pretty surprised if they don't
at<00:06:02.300> least<00:06:02.330> see<00:06:02.629> iOS<00:06:03.020> 5<00:06:03.370> they've<00:06:04.370> pretty<00:06:04.580> much

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:30.409 
of having to scroll through and it's

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:32.230 
of having to scroll through and it's
just<00:06:30.710> it's<00:06:30.889> just<00:06:30.979> not<00:06:31.250> a<00:06:31.430> seamless<00:06:32.180> experience
