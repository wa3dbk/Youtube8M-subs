00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.649
 from the end of july to the beginning of october 2014 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.030
 will be on the a 3 between the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.040
 Offenbacher cross and the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.809
 connection point obertshausen one 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.210
 Construction site for roadway rehabilitation 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.060
 a 59 kilometer long section 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.189
 The a 3 is one of the most established 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.630
 Traffic axis in Germany 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.250
 with strong supraregional 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.740
 traffic flows in the personal and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.300
 goods transport in the rhine main area 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.340
 In addition, they are one of the most important 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.119
 commuter connections 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.640
 commuter 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.770
 a key goal of hessen mobile 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.719
 it is during the required 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.760
 do not work the traffic 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.090
 safe and fluid through the bottleneck 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.989
 to guide construction site and so the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 traffic to a minimum 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.350
 to reduce 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.620
 which exists in the area of ​​the construction site 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.090
 and proven systems for dynamic 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.649
 Traffic control as the release 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.050
 of the page strip during the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.930
 peak times remain in use 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.420
 and help the traffic even during the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.050
 construction site time optimal and safe too 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.750
 control 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.240
 hessen mobil has been using it for some time now 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 digital ads called the vista 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 around the traffic participants and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.939
 Traffic participants short-term 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 Delays and alternative routes 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.290
 display as well as construction measures 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.850
 to announce 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.369
 so can the road users already 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.560
 in progress on the construction site for example 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.259
 at the frankfurter cross offenbacher cross 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.509
 and blessed city triangle early 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.170
 informed and possibly redirected 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.240
 become 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.549
 hessen mobil relies on one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.229
 comprehensive and up-to-date information of 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.360
 not only on the road 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.520
 street but also as advance 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.520
 information in the internet under 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.210
 to avoid traffic obstructions 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.340
 in hesse the rule for the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.240
 dauerbaustelle may not lane 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.030
 be locked 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.220
 to accomplish this comes during the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.780
 Construction work on the a 3 between the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.670
 Offenbacher cross and the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.960
 connection imagine a obertshausen 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.790
 another element for that 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.790
 Construction site management for use 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.130
 the change of traffic management 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.780
 Traffic management of the construction site is included 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.729
 twice a week 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.520
 adapted to changing traffic volumes 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.470
 out of the total of seven lanes 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.320
 Be the traffic in the rush hour 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.930
 in the morning in the direction of Frankfurt and 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.310
 in the afternoon in the direction of travel Würzburg 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.370
 four lanes each 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.620
 for this the middle of the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.010
 seven lane change way for the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.600
 both directions of travel released 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.459
 already at night is rebuilt with it 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.989
 in the morning four lanes in time 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.540
 for the traffic towards frankfurt 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.459
 be available 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.470
 already on the construction site 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.230
 the traffic control system on the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.630
 a3 supported by supplement the led 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.150
 join the drivers 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.209
 which lanes currently for your 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.130
 direction of travel are released 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.320
 when the rushhour is over the 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.510
 reconstructed traffic and creates so 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.640
 a lane more for the traffic 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.950
 peak of professional traffic in the afternoon 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.170
 towards a würzburg 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.600
 promising concept that one 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.330
 optimal and effective use of 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.730
 existing resources sets for less 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.760
 traffic jams and more safety on hessens 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.760
 roads
