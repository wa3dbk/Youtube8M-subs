00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
down and what we're going to tell you to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
down and what we're going to tell you to
do<00:00:57.120> here<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.690> explain<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.500> how<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.739> measure

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
do here and explain is how we measure

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.990 
do here and explain is how we measure
their<00:00:59.969> handlebar<00:01:00.600> risers<00:01:01.430> what<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.730> here

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
their handlebar risers what we do here

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.750 
their handlebar risers what we do here
is<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.840> take<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.290> tape<00:01:04.710> measure<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:05.729> I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is we take the tape measure and when I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.990 
is we take the tape measure and when I
say<00:01:06.150> measure<00:01:07.670> like<00:01:08.670> outside<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.299> riser<00:01:10.020> here

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
say measure like outside of riser here

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
say measure like outside of riser here
to<00:01:12.000> inside<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:13.140> would<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.439> three<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.890> half

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to inside here would be three and a half

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.240 
to inside here would be three and a half
on<00:01:14.369> center<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> there's<00:01:16.650> your<00:01:16.770> three<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
on center so there's your three and a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.340 
on center so there's your three and a
half<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.210> works<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.049> went<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
half and that works out if you went to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.820 
half and that works out if you went to
the<00:01:19.530> bolts<00:01:19.920> three<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.000> half<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.560> did

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the bolts three and a half or if you did

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.070 
the bolts three and a half or if you did
it<00:01:22.920> from<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> other<00:01:23.250> way<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.540> three

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it from the other way from here three

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.719 
it from the other way from here three
and<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.229> half<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> would<00:01:26.250> tell<00:01:26.490> me<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and a half so that would tell me that

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
and a half so that would tell me that
your<00:01:26.880> risers<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.630> three<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> half<00:01:28.259> on

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
your risers are three and a half on

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.770 
your risers are three and a half on
center<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> Springer's<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.540> four

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
center some of the Springer's are four

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.600 
center some of the Springer's are four
and<00:01:30.900> three-quarters<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.560> center<00:01:31.920> another

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and three-quarters on center another

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.980 
and three-quarters on center another
measurement<00:01:33.000> we're<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> ask<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.840> about

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
measurement we're going to ask you about

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.200 
measurement we're going to ask you about
is<00:01:34.439> cuz<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.400> don't<00:01:35.520> we're<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:35.790> sure<00:01:36.060> what

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
is cuz we don't we're not sure what

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
is cuz we don't we're not sure what
risers<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.659> might<00:01:36.840> have<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.200> your<00:01:37.320> bike<00:01:37.530> is

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
risers you might have on your bike is

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.730 
risers you might have on your bike is
the<00:01:38.310> outside<00:01:38.729> measurement<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.509> outside<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the outside measurement from outside to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.649 
the outside measurement from outside to
outside<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.360> five

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
outside which in this one here is five

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.190 
outside which in this one here is five
and<00:01:42.990> three-quarters<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.180> that's<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.049> critical

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and three-quarters so that's a critical

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.649 
and three-quarters so that's a critical
measurement<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.820> blankets<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.420> so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
measurement and this blankets not so

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.660 
measurement and this blankets not so
critical<00:01:48.899> because<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.799> bike<00:01:50.070> has<00:01:50.280> inch

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
critical because this this bike has inch

a half pair of handlebars with a

a half pair of handlebars with a
one-inch<00:02:03.939> piece<00:02:04.350> that's<00:02:05.350> where<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.920> outside

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
one-inch piece that's where the outside

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.130 
one-inch piece that's where the outside
measurement<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:07.330> outside<00:02:07.840> measurement

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
measurement to outside measurement

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.469

meaning<00:02:08.770> outside<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.429> riser<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:10.030> outside

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
meaning outside of riser to outside

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.259 
meaning outside of riser to outside
riser<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.920> bar<00:02:12.220> would<00:02:12.430> not<00:02:12.670> fit<00:02:12.940> on<00:02:13.060> this

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
riser this bar would not fit on this

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.640 
riser this bar would not fit on this
bike<00:02:13.709> because<00:02:14.709> it's<00:02:15.099> not<00:02:15.250> wide<00:02:15.610> enough<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:17.349> we

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
bike because it's not wide enough so we

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.830 
bike because it's not wide enough so we
would<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.250> make<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.060> bar<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> little<00:02:19.690> bit

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
would have to make this bar a little bit

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.920 
would have to make this bar a little bit
wider<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.560> accommodate<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.849> bike<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.750> one

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
wider to accommodate this bike this one

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.530 
wider to accommodate this bike this one
here<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.200> only<00:02:23.319> five<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.130> probably<00:02:24.580> 1/4<00:02:25.300> and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
here is only five and probably 1/4 and

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.160 
here is only five and probably 1/4 and
we<00:02:26.200> need<00:02:26.410> 5<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.890> 3/8<00:02:27.489> or<00:02:27.819> 5<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.420> 3/4<00:02:28.870> on<00:02:28.989> this

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
we need 5 and 3/8 or 5 and 3/4 on this

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.190 
we need 5 and 3/8 or 5 and 3/4 on this
bike<00:02:29.380> but<00:02:30.160> then<00:02:30.280> again<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.730> bike<00:02:30.970> also<00:02:31.239> has

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
bike but then again this bike also has

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.680 
bike but then again this bike also has
an<00:02:32.440> inch<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.769> quarter<00:02:32.980> handlebar<00:02:33.690> where

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
an inch and a quarter handlebar where

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.050 
an inch and a quarter handlebar where
this<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.350> 1<00:02:35.590> inch<00:02:35.830> for<00:02:36.160> most<00:02:36.190> stock<00:02:36.610> Harley's

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
this is a 1 inch for most stock Harley's

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.270 
this is a 1 inch for most stock Harley's
so<00:02:37.989> these<00:02:38.290> are<00:02:38.470> some<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.769> measurements

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
so these are some of the measurements

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.190 
so these are some of the measurements
that<00:02:39.340> we<00:02:39.489> asked<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.910> about<00:02:40.030> when<00:02:40.989> we're

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
that we asked you about when we're

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.020 
that we asked you about when we're

pretty beefy risers we have to discuss
that<00:02:54.069> make<00:02:54.910> sure<00:02:55.090> we<00:02:55.269> get<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.540> proper<00:02:55.900> ones

that make sure we get the proper ones
for<00:02:56.890> your<00:02:57.220> new<00:02:57.670> bars<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.989> when<00:02:59.320> we<00:02:59.440> ask<00:02:59.680> you<00:02:59.829> the

for your new bars so when we ask you the

center to Center measurement I always

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.020 
center to Center measurement I always
say<00:03:02.709> measure<00:03:02.950> from<00:03:03.160> outside<00:03:03.579> a<00:03:03.609> riser<00:03:03.880> to

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
say measure from outside a riser to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.210 
say measure from outside a riser to
inside<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.780> other<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.140> or<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.980> the

outside from outside to outside that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.259 
outside from outside to outside that
gives<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.859> nice<00:03:09.040> clean<00:03:09.400> custom<00:03:10.030> look

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
gives you that nice clean custom look

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.720 
gives you that nice clean custom look
where<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.959> where<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> step<00:03:12.070> down<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.549> right

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
where the where the step down is right

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.759 
where the where the step down is right
tight<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.239> risers<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.380> should<00:03:14.590> give

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
tight to the risers and that should give

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.599 
tight to the risers and that should give
you<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> real<00:03:15.250> nice<00:03:15.489> clean<00:03:17.160> look<00:03:18.160> for<00:03:18.370> your<00:03:18.489> new

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
bars so that's what we mean by when we

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.930 
bars so that's what we mean by when we
measure<00:03:21.100> up<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.700> riser<00:03:22.660> spacing<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.950> trying

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
measure up the riser spacing and trying

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.210 
measure up the riser spacing and trying
to<00:03:25.090> get<00:03:25.239> your<00:03:25.390> bar<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:25.720> really<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.829> know<00:03:26.920> look
