00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 Everything was on the one hand the seventh descent went now open and it is around 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.069
 Nimbuzz Anra's claim had been to finish the section percent because 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.210
 simply the dimensions are completely different than the other sections 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.459
 explain the mountains Andersen we started with the pelvic breakthrough and will 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:16.939
 up to six meters high 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.269
 But here too 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.919
 to build in the room 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.029
 The biggest challenge was actually the whole technology 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.970
 That's when 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.359
 Nowhere to reach our employees have to find the access 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.849
 rwe group it works out 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.230
 But small staircase companies will make you really all areas 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.710
 actually on 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.010
 she thinks it is the Matterhorn that is just this great work 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.010
 in the center of the Swiss we have an open-air stage below 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.230
 with an open-air concert 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.130
 On the spot, 20,000 pounds have been taxed that definitely for 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.430
 This work and percent are definitely on a ship altogether says three 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 For months the heirs have been alone 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 and we have a he chocolate sales 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.310
 that means they have we create a complete end product road 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.310
 with Sarah and chocolates out on which my city 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.750
 Almost two and a half years are already wearing 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.330
 actually it should start opening in 2007 if you do that 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
 September is postponed and now it is the twelfth 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.170
 What we actually thought that we have no big projects here 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.280
 Chance the moves are real challenge 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.970
 that we install many small gimmicks that means we have many many 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.829
 Mechanics built will eventually move no playgrounds moving 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.280
 around the 70 80 moving elements that no trains or cars 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.730
 so far so small technical finesse me myself the beat of the whole 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.180
 business 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.790
 right now we are so up 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.740
 The weekend can not be scheduled for 13 to 14 hours a day 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.760
 now the last days 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.810
 from out of here now 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.930
 We always have the challenge when it comes to blood 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.890
 donated 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.400
 yes, we always want to tell the technicians want to get on the 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.810
 mouth is not looking forward to opening just not too slowly 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.610
 become 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.929
 but we are sure that this time we have planned so sure that we 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.159
 that is not synonymous something 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.879
 it will be clear again 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.610
 very short nights in Steinach II
