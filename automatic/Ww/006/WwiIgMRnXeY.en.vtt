00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
Shawn Michael's and Bret Hart never even

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.509 
Shawn Michael's and Bret Hart never even
spoke<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.470> each<00:02:55.739> other<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:56.310> they're

seeing<00:02:56.760> each<00:02:56.909> other<00:02:57.060> for<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.420> first<00:02:57.659> time<00:02:57.989> I

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
seeing each other for the first time I

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.960 
seeing each other for the first time I
just<00:02:58.709> think<00:02:58.889> it<00:02:59.010> should<00:02:59.190> have<00:02:59.280> been<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.609> don't

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
just think it should have been I don't

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.009 
just think it should have been I don't
know<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.060> think<00:03:00.239> these<00:03:00.450> guys<00:03:00.569> could<00:03:00.810> have<00:03:00.900> done

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
know I think these guys could have done

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.930 
know I think these guys could have done
a<00:03:01.049> better<00:03:01.139> job<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.859> being<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.489> little<00:03:02.609> bit<00:03:02.790> more

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
a better job of being a little bit more

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.430 
a better job of being a little bit more
emotional<00:03:03.209> about<00:03:03.659> it<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.930> think<00:03:03.989> part<00:03:04.349> of

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
emotional about it and I think part of

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.259 
emotional about it and I think part of
the<00:03:04.530> reason<00:03:04.560> was<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.159> that<00:03:05.190> Bret<00:03:05.519> Hart<00:03:05.760> even

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
the reason was is that Bret Hart even

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.759 
the reason was is that Bret Hart even
though<00:03:06.359> he<00:03:06.510> was<00:03:06.659> doing<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.230> he<00:03:07.379> was<00:03:07.500> saying

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
though he was doing it and he was saying

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.800 
though he was doing it and he was saying
it<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.250> question<00:03:08.849> whether<00:03:09.030> or<00:03:09.180> not<00:03:09.299> Bret<00:03:09.629> Hart

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
it I question whether or not Bret Hart

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.720 
it I question whether or not Bret Hart
truly<00:03:10.230> believed<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.889> thought<00:03:11.220> maybe<00:03:11.430> he<00:03:11.639> was

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
truly believed it I thought maybe he was

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.610 
truly believed it I thought maybe he was
just<00:03:11.909> out<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.659> give<00:03:12.840> his<00:03:13.049> fans<00:03:13.379> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
the WWE his family can get a lot of

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.490 
the WWE his family can get a lot of
publicity<00:03:29.579> they've<00:03:30.120> done<00:03:30.269> several<00:03:30.599> Bret<00:03:31.230> Hart

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
publicity they've done several Bret Hart

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500 
publicity they've done several Bret Hart
or<00:03:31.680> Hart<00:03:31.980> family<00:03:32.190> member<00:03:32.639> DVD<00:03:33.030> since<00:03:33.359> he's

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
or Hart family member DVD since he's

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.210 
or Hart family member DVD since he's
come<00:03:33.660> back<00:03:33.720> they<00:03:34.379> were<00:03:34.440> able<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.799> get<00:03:34.889> his<00:03:35.010> dad

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
come back they were able to get his dad

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.589 
come back they were able to get his dad
into<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.489> Hall<00:03:35.699> of<00:03:35.730> Fame<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.269> shit<00:03:36.419> like<00:03:36.449> that

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
into the Hall of Fame and shit like that

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.210 
into the Hall of Fame and shit like that
so<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.019> think<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.410> lot<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.769> was<00:03:37.889> probably

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
so I think a lot of that was probably

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.949 
so I think a lot of that was probably
Brett's<00:03:38.669> motivation<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.540> when<00:03:39.690> he<00:03:39.750> came<00:03:39.900> back

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
Brett's motivation and when he came back

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.689 
Brett's motivation and when he came back
he<00:03:40.169> just<00:03:40.410> kind<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.859> sucked<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.459> said<00:03:41.669> I

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
he just kind of sucked it up and said I

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.580 
he just kind of sucked it up and said I
don't<00:03:41.910> really<00:03:42.299> trust<00:03:42.569> Vince<00:03:42.959> triple<00:03:43.319> h<00:03:43.470> er

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
don't really trust Vince triple h er

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.110 
don't really trust Vince triple h er

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
there for a few months and he worked

back<00:04:17.190> for<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.639> while<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.030> he<00:04:18.090> felt<00:04:18.269> comfortable

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
back for a while and he felt comfortable

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.629 
back for a while and he felt comfortable
and<00:04:18.930> then<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.709> know<00:04:19.799> he<00:04:19.949> felt<00:04:20.159> like<00:04:20.220> he<00:04:20.400> was<00:04:20.519> at

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639
