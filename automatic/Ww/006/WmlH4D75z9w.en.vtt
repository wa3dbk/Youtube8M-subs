external wastegate you're wanting to run

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.319 
external wastegate you're wanting to run
now<00:00:37.040> ready<00:00:37.400> so<00:00:37.670> let's<00:00:37.850> just<00:00:38.000> kind<00:00:38.090> of<00:00:38.180> go<00:00:38.300> over

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
now ready so let's just kind of go over

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.380 
now ready so let's just kind of go over
this<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.020> why<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.399> 3-volt

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
this and why a 3-volt

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.810 
this and why a 3-volt
flange<00:00:42.230> design<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:42.860> such<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.100> good<00:00:43.399> idea

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
flange design is such a good idea

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.580 
flange design is such a good idea
meaning<00:00:44.210> because<00:00:44.540> you<00:00:45.110> know<00:00:45.200> a<00:00:45.260> lot<00:00:45.290> of<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
meaning because you know a lot of the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.170 
meaning because you know a lot of the
aftermarket<00:00:46.070> manifold<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:46.850> see<00:00:47.030> out<00:00:47.149> there

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
aftermarket manifold we see out there

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360 
aftermarket manifold we see out there
are<00:00:47.809> starting<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.320> utilize<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.739> three<00:00:49.190> bolt

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
are starting to utilize a three bolt

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.720 
are starting to utilize a three bolt
flange<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:49.910> for<00:00:50.120> example<00:00:50.649> Tomei<00:00:51.649> we<00:00:52.130> know<00:00:52.370> for

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
flange so for example Tomei we know for

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.340 
flange so for example Tomei we know for
a<00:00:52.760> fact<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.420> with<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.690> total<00:00:53.960> may<00:00:54.050> because

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
a fact this with a total may because

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.080 
a fact this with a total may because
we've<00:00:54.500> installed<00:00:54.860> it<00:00:55.010> ourselves<00:00:55.219> on<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.760> Tamiya

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
we've installed it ourselves on a Tamiya

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.850 
we've installed it ourselves on a Tamiya
manifold<00:00:56.480> but<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.140> should<00:00:57.350> fit<00:00:57.559> pretty<00:00:57.739> much

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
manifold but it should fit pretty much

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.610 
manifold but it should fit pretty much
any<00:00:58.190> other<00:00:58.370> three<00:00:58.879> bolt<00:00:59.200> manifold<00:01:00.200> or<00:01:00.350> flange

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
they've include the up pipe studs there

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.489 
they've include the up pipe studs there
as<00:01:44.299> well<00:01:44.539> so<00:01:44.719> everything<00:01:44.929> you<00:01:45.259> need<00:01:45.409> to

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
as well so everything you need to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:46.779 
as well so everything you need to
install<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.829> basically<00:01:46.189> all<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.579> need<00:01:46.700> to

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
install it basically all you need to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.699 
install it basically all you need to
provide<00:01:47.060> is<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.329> external<00:01:47.929> wastegate<00:01:48.079> itself

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
provide is the external wastegate itself

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.980 
provide is the external wastegate itself
and<00:01:49.609> you<00:01:49.700> bolt<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.090> on<00:01:50.209> and<00:01:50.389> you're<00:01:50.479> good<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:50.719> go

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
and you bolt it on and you're good to go

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.289 
and you bolt it on and you're good to go
so<00:01:51.349> with<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.159> coating<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:52.579> course<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:52.939> is<00:01:53.119> a

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
so with this coating of course this is a

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.239 
so with this coating of course this is a
ceramic<00:01:53.899> coating<00:01:54.079> it<00:01:54.349> should<00:01:54.529> help<00:01:54.709> keep<00:01:54.950> heat

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
ceramic coating it should help keep heat

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.849 
ceramic coating it should help keep heat
inside<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:55.999> up<00:01:56.179> pipe<00:01:56.419> as<00:01:56.599> well<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.709> course

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
inside the up pipe as well so of course

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.260 
inside the up pipe as well so of course
I<00:01:58.009> would<00:01:58.069> highly<00:01:58.399> recommend<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.849> coating<00:01:59.149> but

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
I would highly recommend the coating but

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.819 
I would highly recommend the coating but
let's<00:01:59.389> say<00:01:59.479> for<00:01:59.509> example<00:01:59.689> you<00:02:00.409> don't<00:02:00.439> want<00:02:00.649> it

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
let's say for example you don't want it

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.010 
let's say for example you don't want it
coated<00:02:01.159> or<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.969> wanted<00:02:02.239> to<00:02:02.329> coat<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:02.599> yourself

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
coated or you wanted to coat it yourself

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.749 
coated or you wanted to coat it yourself
through<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:03.739> aftermarket<00:02:04.069> company<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.639> can

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
through and aftermarket company you can

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.219 
through and aftermarket company you can
believe<00:02:04.909> buy<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.149> uncoated<00:02:05.659> version<00:02:06.079> as<00:02:06.200> well

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
believe buy the uncoated version as well

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.499 
believe buy the uncoated version as well
and<00:02:06.649> somebody<00:02:07.369> else<00:02:07.520> could<00:02:07.700> do<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:07.909> for<00:02:08.300> you

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
and somebody else could do that for you

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.780 
and somebody else could do that for you
one<00:02:09.320> important<00:02:09.770> thing<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:10.009> note<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.369> g

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
one important thing to note is the g

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.370 
one important thing to note is the g
band<00:02:11.030> flange<00:02:11.840> design

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
band flange design

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.710 
band flange design
right<00:02:12.530> there<00:02:12.740> for<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> external<00:02:13.430> wastegate

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
right there for the external wastegate

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.020 
right there for the external wastegate
and<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.870> course<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.650> v-band<00:02:16.010> flange<00:02:16.370> or<00:02:16.850> the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
and of course the v-band flange or the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
dump tube as well and so make sure that

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.120 
dump tube as well and so make sure that
your<00:02:19.490> external<00:02:19.910> wastegate<00:02:20.030> has<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.200> same<00:02:21.470> v

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
your external wastegate has that same v

or you know even with the past couple

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.300 
or you know even with the past couple
years<00:02:29.240> have<00:02:30.050> gone<00:02:30.290> for<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.620> v-band<00:02:31.010> clamp

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
years have gone for that v-band clamp

years have gone for that v-band clamp
design<00:02:31.550> just<00:02:31.670> because<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.060> literally<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.570> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
design just because it literally is a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.150 
design just because it literally is a
superior<00:02:33.290> design<00:02:33.530> not<00:02:33.800> have<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.980> worry<00:02:34.100> about

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
superior design not have to worry about

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.010 
superior design not have to worry about
gaskets<00:02:34.730> blown<00:02:34.790> out<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.330> your<00:02:35.480> anything<00:02:35.870> like

that but really I just want to give you
guys<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.880> close-up<00:02:38.270> view<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.690> this<00:02:38.780> up<00:02:38.960> pipe<00:02:39.140> of

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
guys a close-up view of this up pipe of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.920 
guys a close-up view of this up pipe of
course<00:02:40.040> you've<00:02:40.190> got<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.400> rims<00:02:41.240> feed<00:02:41.510> logo

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
course you've got the rims feed logo

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.420 
course you've got the rims feed logo
welded<00:02:42.410> on<00:02:42.530> there<00:02:42.560> which<00:02:42.830> i<00:02:42.950> think<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.250> super

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
welded on there which i think is super

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.910 
welded on there which i think is super
cool<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:43.970> then<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.540> course<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:45.410> three<00:02:45.710> bolt

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
cool and then of course the three bolt

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.760 
cool and then of course the three bolt
flange<00:02:46.580> design<00:02:47.090> very<00:02:48.050> quite<00:02:48.320> like<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.680> way

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
flange design very quite like the way

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.550 
flange design very quite like the way
that<00:02:48.890> looks<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.220> think<00:02:49.400> maybe<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.790> this

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
that looks I think maybe the this

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.780 
that looks I think maybe the this
cemetry<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.710> it<00:02:51.860> or<00:02:52.010> something<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.490> I<00:02:52.520> like

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
cemetry of it or something that I like

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.880 
cemetry of it or something that I like
and<00:02:53.030> then<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.480> course<00:02:53.510> your<00:02:53.810> standard<00:02:54.080> Subaru

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
and then of course your standard Subaru

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.580 
and then of course your standard Subaru
flange<00:02:55.220> going<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.180> turbo<00:02:56.510> just<00:02:57.470> an

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
flange going to the turbo just an

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.250 
flange going to the turbo just an
absolutely<00:02:58.190> very<00:02:58.580> high-quality<00:02:59.030> up<00:02:59.570> pipe<00:02:59.750> of

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
absolutely very high-quality up pipe of

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.750 
absolutely very high-quality up pipe of
course<00:03:00.500> everything<00:03:00.920> grim<00:03:01.130> speed<00:03:01.370> makes<00:03:01.610> is

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
course everything grim speed makes is

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.280 
course everything grim speed makes is
just<00:03:01.970> phenomenal<00:03:02.420> one<00:03:02.630> thing<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.930> should<00:03:02.990> note

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
just phenomenal one thing I should note

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.450 
just phenomenal one thing I should note
is<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.820> actual<00:03:05.150> angle<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.920> guess<00:03:07.370> you

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
is the actual angle of the I guess you

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.770 
is the actual angle of the I guess you
want<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.730> call<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.060> wastegate<00:03:08.330> port

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
want to call it the wastegate port

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.480 
want to call it the wastegate port
itself<00:03:09.290> you'll<00:03:09.800> notice<00:03:10.010> how<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.130> comes<00:03:10.370> down

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
itself you'll notice how that comes down

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.740 
itself you'll notice how that comes down
at<00:03:10.670> an<00:03:10.760> angle<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.120> that's<00:03:11.210> actually<00:03:11.540> an

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
at an angle and that's actually an

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.600 
at an angle and that's actually an
advantage<00:03:11.870> just<00:03:12.710> because<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.040> do<00:03:13.250> want<00:03:13.430> to

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
advantage just because you do want to

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.700 
advantage just because you do want to

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
its specific for an external wastegate

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.770 
its specific for an external wastegate
and<00:03:28.850> then<00:03:28.940> one<00:03:29.060> other<00:03:29.180> thing<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.510> wanted<00:03:29.720> to
