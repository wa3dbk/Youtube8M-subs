00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
starts about here one little trick for a

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.000 
starts about here one little trick for a
sophisticated<00:01:43.150> arrangement<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.810> have<00:01:44.410> the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
sophisticated arrangement is have the

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.370 
sophisticated arrangement is have the
where<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.880> flower<00:01:46.180> starts<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:46.990> where<00:01:47.229> it

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
where the flower starts is where it

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.440 
where the flower starts is where it
should<00:01:47.590> hit<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.950> top<00:01:48.190> of<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.520> vase<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.390> I'm

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
should hit the top of the vase so I'm

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.850 
should hit the top of the vase so I'm
cutting<00:01:49.660> these<00:01:49.870> down<00:01:49.930> just<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.440> little<00:01:50.470> bit

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
cutting these down just a little bit

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.900 
cutting these down just a little bit
more<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.780> we<00:01:52.900> really<00:01:53.290> don't<00:01:53.470> see<00:01:53.650> that<00:01:54.490> kind<00:01:54.850> of

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
more so we really don't see that kind of

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.630 
more so we really don't see that kind of
not<00:01:55.119> so<00:01:55.390> attractive<00:01:55.720> stem<00:01:56.470> another<00:01:57.310> little

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
not so attractive stem another little

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.100 
not so attractive stem another little
trick<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:58.090> if<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.300> have<00:01:58.510> stems<00:01:58.869> that<00:01:59.020> are

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
trick is if you have stems that are

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.990 
trick is if you have stems that are
really<00:01:59.530> sticking<00:01:59.830> up<00:02:00.040> very<00:02:00.340> very<00:02:00.430> straight

like that and that's not so attractive

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.140 
like that and that's not so attractive
we<00:03:55.350> don't<00:03:55.500> really<00:03:55.620> enjoy<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.490> head<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.910> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
not at all attractive and if you take

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.750 
not at all attractive and if you take
them<00:04:01.170> off<00:04:01.350> sometimes<00:04:02.040> they're<00:04:02.190> too<00:04:02.340> tall<00:04:02.520> and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
they'll bend over but now that we have a

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.890 
they'll bend over but now that we have a
nice<00:04:04.530> base<00:04:05.340> for<00:04:05.850> our<00:04:05.970> flowers<00:04:06.450> these<00:04:06.840> are

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
nice base for our flowers these are

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.360 
nice base for our flowers these are
going<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.170> really<00:04:07.380> stay<00:04:07.800> in<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.070> place<00:04:08.340> that

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
going to really stay in the place that

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.510 
going to really stay in the place that
we<00:04:08.730> want<00:04:09.000> them<00:04:09.240> and<00:04:09.990> you<00:04:10.890> see<00:04:11.070> it's<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.490> same

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
we want them and you see it's the same

it's<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.930> different<00:04:19.579> sized<00:04:21.290> flower<00:04:22.290> head<00:04:23.000> that

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
it's a different sized flower head that

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.250 
it's a different sized flower head that
really<00:04:25.710> helps<00:04:26.360> make<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.510> arrangement<00:04:27.990> very

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
really helps make the arrangement very

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.590 
really helps make the arrangement very
very<00:04:28.590> interesting<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.790> other<00:04:29.820> little<00:04:30.240> tip

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
very interesting the other little tip

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.170 
very interesting the other little tip
would<00:04:30.780> be<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:31.169> find<00:04:31.800> some<00:04:32.160> of<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.490> flowers

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
would be that find some of the flowers

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.250 
would be that find some of the flowers
that<00:04:33.210> have<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.930> curve<00:04:34.320> in<00:04:34.530> them<00:04:34.680> naturally<00:04:36.260> okay

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
that have a curve in them naturally okay

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.840 
that have a curve in them naturally okay
so<00:04:37.320> this<00:04:37.560> is<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.740> straight<00:04:38.070> up<00:04:38.280> one<00:04:38.520> I'm<00:04:38.700> gonna

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
so this is a straight up one I'm gonna

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.420 
so this is a straight up one I'm gonna
put<00:04:39.030> that<00:04:39.150> more<00:04:39.360> in<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.570> center<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.430> the

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
put that more in the center of the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.909 
put that more in the center of the
arrangement<00:04:42.350> whereas<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.470> one<00:04:43.620> with<00:04:43.800> the

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
arrangement whereas the one with the

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.980 
arrangement whereas the one with the
curve<00:04:44.220> I'm<00:04:44.490> gonna<00:04:44.640> use<00:04:44.880> for<00:04:45.150> my<00:04:45.270> edges<00:04:45.720> because

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
curve I'm gonna use for my edges because

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.040 
curve I'm gonna use for my edges because
I<00:04:46.020> want<00:04:46.380> those<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.890> curve<00:04:47.130> out<00:04:47.750> there<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.870> go
