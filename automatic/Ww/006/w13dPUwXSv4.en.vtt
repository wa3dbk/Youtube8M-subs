00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:14.639
 see today's perspectives 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:21.119
 of a box in 3d top view view of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:27.330
 face and seen from below let's see how 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:30.630
 realize this on a flat surface so 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.820
 the first thing to realize we will do 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:42.839
 So the face portion we will 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:51.239
 draw a straight a horizontal like 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:55.500
 this with two points here and there that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.430
 represents the infinites you have here a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.330
 point a to a point b 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:09.500
 here and so our box our our 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.500
 box of a retted edge 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:28.760
 and here we can see two little faces here 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.960
 like a cube his finger a cube 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:39.410
 front view so him so we do not see 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:45.890
 neither the top nor the bottom is here the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:49.820
 face box so how did I 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:55.040
 as it should be here it is a little bit 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:00.560
 how would this box be perceived by 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.869
 the observer's eye well we see 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.060
 although art is is bigger more 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.110
 great that the sides are good 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.040
 Okay 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.750
 let's see now so if we were watching 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.130
 not below the box by in 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:24.680
 below the box we always have 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:30.700
 art is from the box the ends I 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.700
 reminds you that you have to go 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.120
 from point b to get 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.060
 the points 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.180
 next to know so 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.790
 so below we are going to get 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:03:00.959
 upper outermost points 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.510
 and lower right side that's after 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.099
 which is why we draw a spectrum 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.400
 from point b to have the base of 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:16.139
 the box 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:20.549
 here is the base of the box is to 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:26.819
 present the underside of the box always 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:29.930
 part of the spectrum of point b is here from 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.930
 spectrum of point 1 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:42.150
 and here is our box here 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.300
 so we saw from below with the face 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.840
 lower the upper face than the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.070
 not see and the two sides that are at 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.160
 right and left here also we 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:04.670
 notice that the art is is greater 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:08.690
 that sides we have seen in turn 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.450
 a front view a view from below 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.580
 showy present a view from above 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:20.549
 well it is simple we live 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.530
 two sub that is located above the 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.720
 front view which is in the middle and 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.470
 the top view that is in 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:34.890
 down well we'll trace back from the 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:42.090
 spectrum from the point to in the 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:46.790
 lower part of the box like this 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.790
 art is from the box 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.600
 the upper part of the box 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.020
 here 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:07.600
 and so the sides of the box now 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.310
 the top of the box 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:18.440
 I remind you that the line by two to 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:26.030
 for the right side and the left side of 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:30.370
 the box scared from the point b law we have 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.900
 realized here in perspective box 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:38.060
 so 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:40.370
 here we saw from face 2 face us 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.230
 perceive that we see or lÃ© 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:49.010
 above nil below and that art is at 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:52.030
 center seems larger than those 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.030
 which are on the sides 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:00.140
 when cards to the euro we 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:04.100
 so let's see the top of the box what 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:09.580
 corresponds to the drawing that is in 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:13.340
 below here when rotated 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.940
 to the euro we see what's going on 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:20.449
 under the box as the drawing 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:26.210
 represented above 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:29.960
 thank you for your attention let's see some 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:34.159
 words about spatial representation 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:40.449
 objects and if we can see a 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:46.300
 box swivel from below to the top 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:49.460
 and this on a horizontal axis the 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:58.580
 three-dimensional representation 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:07:03.379
 located on three axes xy and z or here 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:09.310
 we have x for the length y for the 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:11.150
 height and finally z for the depth 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:15.219
 in a simple way 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:21.189
 these three axes lies in three planes 

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:24.680
 named udder on the horizontal plane 

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:27.919
 you have all those who are at 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:32.560
 above this plane is below this 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:36.319
 plan on the vertical plane 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:40.219
 you have everything going right 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:45.680
 plan and left of the plan ie 

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:46.479
 at the ends and finally on the plane of 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.930
 face 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:54.259
 you have here everything that is 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:57.789
 behind this plan and all those who 

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:57.789
 find in front of this plane 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.690
 this court is coming to an end I you 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.990
 thank you for your attention 

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:08.560
 goodbye and see you soon for a 

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.560
 next class
