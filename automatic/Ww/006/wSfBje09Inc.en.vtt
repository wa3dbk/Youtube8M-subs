left hand side you have some additional

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.109 
left hand side you have some additional
ports<00:01:46.399> here<00:01:47.649> it<00:01:48.649> is<00:01:48.799> to<00:01:49.039> focus<00:01:49.549> here<00:01:49.939> for<00:01:50.299> you

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
ports here it is to focus here for you

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.870 
ports here it is to focus here for you
so<00:01:53.119> we<00:01:53.299> have<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:53.840> micro<00:01:54.679> USB<00:01:54.709> port<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.520> micro<00:01:55.789> HDMI
