what<00:00:28.920> did<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.070> ultimately<00:00:29.250> sort<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.849> settle

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
what did you ultimately sort of settle

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.460 
what did you ultimately sort of settle
on<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.570> how<00:00:30.750> did<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.019> come<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
on and how did you come to the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.720 
on and how did you come to the
conclusion<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.949> that's<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.520> wanted

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
conclusion that that's what you wanted

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.040 
conclusion that that's what you wanted
to<00:00:32.820> put<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.059> there<00:00:33.239> well<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.960> book

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
to put out there well I think the book

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
to put out there well I think the book
is<00:00:34.140> probably<00:00:34.500> changed<00:00:35.040> from<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.120> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
is probably changed from what I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.600 
is probably changed from what I
originally<00:00:36.390> started<00:00:36.660> writing<00:00:37.230> um<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.100> mean<00:00:38.520> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
originally started writing um I mean I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.069 
originally started writing um I mean I
really<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> children's<00:00:39.629> book<00:00:39.780> Oh

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
really want to do a children's book Oh

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.080 
really want to do a children's book Oh
No<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.280> maybe<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.730> should<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:41.969> this

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
No and then like maybe we should do this

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.549 
No and then like maybe we should do this
one<00:00:42.300> first<00:00:42.510> there's<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.079> some<00:00:43.230> fun<00:00:43.350> stories

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
one first there's just some fun stories

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.959 
one first there's just some fun stories
and<00:00:43.920> things<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.280> haven't<00:00:44.460> tweeted<00:00:44.760> about

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and things that I haven't tweeted about

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.090 
and things that I haven't tweeted about
or<00:00:45.420> things<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.170> tweeted<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.980> then

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
or things that I have tweeted but then

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.350 
or things that I have tweeted but then
it's<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.730> actually<00:00:48.030> happened

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it's like this is what actually happened

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.479 
it's like this is what actually happened
so<00:00:48.510> yeah<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> think<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.500> main<00:00:49.920> question<00:00:50.100> about

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
so yeah I think the main question about

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.600 
so yeah I think the main question about
the<00:00:50.640> book<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.390> how<00:00:52.050> many<00:00:52.610> pictures

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the book would be like how many pictures

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090 
the book would be like how many pictures
of<00:00:53.640> Steve<00:00:54.270> Jobs<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.170> expect<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
of Steve Jobs can we expect to be in the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.250 
of Steve Jobs can we expect to be in the
book<00:00:56.309> hmm<00:00:56.940> i<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.449> any<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:58.079> maybe

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
