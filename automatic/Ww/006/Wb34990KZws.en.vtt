00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.400
 yes hello people i am such break 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.500
 profi unlimited to the third consequence 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.880
 from the best to you tweaks of all time 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.880
 have fun with this video 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.539
 In this video I want to tell you this via 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.359
 twitter blogs show this costs a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.099
 dollar 99 insidious trick is still 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.449
 I think brand new two days ago 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.449
 appeared about 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.219
 and I really think it's incredible 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.170
 That's why I thought that must 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.420
 Definitely here in this series 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.370
 because that is really one of the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.280
 most ingenious tweets I ever might 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.700
 I've seen super awesome I'll show you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.410
 now what does all this we can do 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.670
 different apps use in principle 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.140
 without opening it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.640
 that means the important functions 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.930
 the app will be here with it 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.969
 operable without that for the app 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.309
 maybe it's open at all 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.719
 now a bit complicated 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.600
 for you to understand that I show you 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.790
 that's just the whole thing, for example 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.830
 works by going up or down 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150
 I recommend pointing at a map 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 I now with the news 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.740
 and helmet that completely open 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.020
 we'll see ours here 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.180
 Whole news we display 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.650
 have not read and we can 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.009
 then here again a new one 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.189
 write a message to anyone and is 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.560
 Enter everything here and we can too 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.670
 the news here as read 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.180
 so you can mark delete so you can 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.970
 say 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.590
 and yes, the whole thing works with many 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.659
 others first try it on the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.729
 Photos from here we can do that 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.829
 last photo which we shot at 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.909
 twitter facebook and twitter on twitter 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.710
 and share on facebook 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 and send the whole by mail and 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.579
 that just copy it simple 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.320
 I show that with a few more 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.780
 apps for example here at the camera 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.610
 is very ingenious and can indeed 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.530
 We will take a picture here 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.320
 without really opening it so 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.119
 Actually, everything you need in the app 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.710
 important is we can use without 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.899
 that we have the app we take 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.789
 youtube will do the whole thing the mobile 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.490
 Open page of youtube and we 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.620
 Here you can watch youtube videos 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.970
 and in the videos we just see 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.370
 the notifications to that I say 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.940
 We can do it again soon 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.010
 also use that without the now 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.600
 maps app opens we are 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.930
 of course, here somewhere in the South Atlantic 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.970
 or that's how it is with it 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.980
 very cool because we can stop that 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.810
 see weather for the whole day and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.780
 between our different cities 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.030
 I want to scroll around here I want to 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.920
 not for every single app 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.840
 show for example in the music, it is still cool 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.860
 we can here for example just 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.080
 play any song 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.990
 facebook we come to the stop 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.940
 mobile page of facebook tweet word there 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.720
 we come to taste page of 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:02.850
 twitter mail fruit clearly pure mail 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.860
 We will stop there as our new one 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.130
 mails are displayed which we then of course 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.690
 also here can update ours 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.000
 bicycles we can stop right here 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.650
 enter any address such as 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.440
 example www.youtube.com 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.240
 and then this page will be opened here 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.120
 and we can do it all here 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.570
 times in safari open that very much 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.000
 hot 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.890
 and so it goes really with 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.060
 different apps for example me 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.120
 I'll show it here today 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.610
 the calendar will be the calendar 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.530
 entries are displayed notes we can 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.980
 make a new note and as such 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.080
 stuff 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.200
 the whole thing works for standard apps 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.640
 very ingenious though with other apps 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.350
 like something I like myself 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.360
 downloaded from the app store 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.640
 kicker, for example, when we get down there 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.610
 we only see the notifications scrolling 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.560
 or here we only see the world 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.940
 So our notification can 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.590
 do not use app but we can 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.390
 see our disadvantage and the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.010
 then open here 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.050
 very cool, I think it is synonymous with the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.060
 settings we can if we are under 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.340
 skoren the whole short settings 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.959
 Brightness no problem 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.840
 flight mode or a do not disturb 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.340
 now here and all those things we do 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.820
 already probably from and settings 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.700
 and so on know here flight mode 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.050
 bluetooth regulatory services as such 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.490
 We can do things very fast 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.729
 adjust the whole on the homescreen 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.009
 are practically a kind of widgets and it 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.259
 Here is very cool solved very much 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.930
 It's awesome that it's just that one 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.940
 For example, you can go in safari 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.129
 and things can look without the app too 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.780
 open that it's a thing I have 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.580
 never in the same way with another 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.520
 seen trick and it is a great 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.699
 chic 27 concept i mean looks here 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.099
 Stylish and I think so and it 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.319
 is also in the everyday life of the 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.120
 Functionality is very ingenious 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.180
 I definitely recommend you 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.860

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.750
 great and therefore she is here in too 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.520

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.990
 all times yes that was it then already 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.750
 with the third episode of the best 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.409
 trains tricks of all time as I said one

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:20.639
