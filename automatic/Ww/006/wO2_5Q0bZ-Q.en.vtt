00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
my for my home network and it's it's

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.990 
my for my home network and it's it's
just<00:02:44.410> some<00:02:44.620> two-by-fours<00:02:44.980> but<00:02:45.459> i'll<00:02:45.580> screw

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
just some two-by-fours but i'll screw

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.270 
just some two-by-fours but i'll screw
this<00:02:46.150> into<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.840> mount<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.200> but<00:02:47.980> let's<00:02:48.160> look

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
this into it to mount it but let's look

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.729 
this into it to mount it but let's look
at<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.520> switch<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.570> unboxing<00:02:50.230> video<00:02:50.500> so

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
at the switch this is unboxing video so

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.199 
at the switch this is unboxing video so
let's<00:02:51.840> just<00:02:52.840> pull<00:02:53.080> this<00:02:53.260> out<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.650> its<00:02:54.060> out<00:02:55.060> of

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
let's just pull this out of its out of

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.640 
let's just pull this out of its out of
the<00:02:55.270> sack<00:02:55.570> here<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.020> we'll<00:02:56.140> go<00:02:56.260> get<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.590> in

the sack here and we'll go get it in

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:06.320 
the sack here and we'll go get it in
this<00:02:56.709> pool<00:02:56.980> glory<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.790> can<00:03:04.030> see<00:03:04.270> gets<00:03:04.570> up<00:03:04.840> I

this pool glory so you can see gets up I

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.660 
this pool glory so you can see gets up I
mean<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.450> know<00:03:07.570> it's<00:03:07.780> nothing<00:03:08.250> nothing<00:03:09.250> bling

this now i'm wondering if it has like
you<00:03:22.810> know<00:03:22.989> sometimes<00:03:23.440> when<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.680> get

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
you know sometimes when you get

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.720 
you know sometimes when you get
something<00:03:24.070> new<00:03:24.250> it's<00:03:24.459> got<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.670> little

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
plastic and it does so this will be fun

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.120 
plastic and it does so this will be fun
we're<00:03:27.580> going<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.730> peel<00:03:27.940> this<00:03:28.120> off<00:03:28.980> check<00:03:29.980> this

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
we're going to peel this off check this

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:42.039 
we're going to peel this off check this
out<00:03:35.160> oops
