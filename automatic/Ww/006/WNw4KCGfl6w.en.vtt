00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.189
 early last century robert thomas 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.570
 in the west of Germany 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.970
 founded a company that originally 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.689
 engaged in the production of tools and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.880
 equipment 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.590
 he immediately identified three principled 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.779
 provisions for production it 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.880
 reliability quality and safety 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.820
 precisely because of this principle the firm 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.350
 all goods became world famous 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.970
 company produced on its own 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.620
 factory in germany and passes 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.420
 multi-level quality control in one 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.620
 I have already told from past issues 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.989
 how to choose a vacuum cleaner 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.070
 but today we will focus on a specific 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.070
 models of the company Thomas 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.970
 vacuum cleaner equipped with motor power 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.920
 1600 watts that won't even wake the cat 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.229
 it is designed for wet and dry 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.420
 cleaning for vacuum cleaners with water filter 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.920
 nothing but water is very important 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.890
 notice that in vacuum cleaners thomas 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.780
 dusty air does not pass through the water 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.789
 since passing dusty 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.890
 air through the water namely this method 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.780
 used in brands of other vacuum cleaners 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.340
 do not provide a reliable level 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.940
 filtering delayed only large 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.770
 debris in aqua filter thomas air with 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.630
 dust goes through four stages of cleaning 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.130
 and the first one is the water wall of 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.590
 Four nozzles are directed to each 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.450
 other water is fed so that when 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.789
 wetted becomes heavy and sags 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.159
 in the water but remains shallow and still 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.550
 allergen i dust question how to delay it 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.800
 exactly for this there are 2 3 and 4 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.080
 degrees very air with small particles 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.509
 dust artificially curls in suspension 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.490
 water droplets fine dust passing through 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.039
 such micro cyclones get wet and stick together 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.569
 becomes large and heavy and secure 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.909
 delayed even porous 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.890
 filter on the output imagine that 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.140
 you go through the fog your clothes 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.209
 skin hair will be wet but you 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.100
 this did not sink into the water and dust 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.030
 falling into aquafilter gets wet not 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.070
 bathed in water 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.290
 it is thanks to this approach, at 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.200
 vacuum cleaners thomas with aqua-filter such 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.150
 the highest degree of filtration further 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.760
 developers have installed hepa filter 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.630
 which starts working when clogged 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.790
 coarse filter and it happens 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.829
 if at times not rinse but 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.530
 even in such a situation, nothing terrible 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.329
 this is not if the hepa filter darkens them 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.310
 just knock on hard 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.160
 surface wash it under the faucet 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.570
 dry and put back into the vacuum cleaner 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.580
 water filter used vacuum cleaners 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.600
 thomas allows you to filter the air on 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.460
 level ninety nine and nine 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.740
 percent with all that is required for 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.720
 cleaning is 1 liter of clean water after 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.190
 cleaning the water from the containers is enough 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.810
 pour into the toilet and the container itself 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.090
 rinse and dry and put back 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.010
 you won't get a dusty bag 30 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.870
 his while breathing a cloud of dust in 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.700
 vacuuming time also works as 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.410
 very powerful humidifier 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.240
 since the air after the water filter 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.100
 comes out not only clean but also 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.900
