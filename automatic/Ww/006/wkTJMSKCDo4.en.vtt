good<00:02:03.420> filling<00:02:03.899> effect<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.530> happens<00:02:05.039> with

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
good filling effect that happens with

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.190 
good filling effect that happens with
aging<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.700> time<00:02:05.940> is<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> fat<00:02:06.450> kind<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.990> just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
aging in time is the fat kind of just

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
aging in time is the fat kind of just
goes<00:02:07.380> away<00:02:07.560> with<00:02:07.890> aging<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.460> this<00:02:09.270> new<00:02:09.450> system

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
goes away with aging and this new system

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.250 
goes away with aging and this new system
allows<00:02:10.110> us<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.440> keep<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.890> fat<00:02:11.130> alive<00:02:11.490> without

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
allows us to keep that fat alive without

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.200 
allows us to keep that fat alive without
damaging<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.350> fat<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.610> get<00:02:14.850> that

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
damaging the fat so that we can get that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.090 
damaging the fat so that we can get that
full<00:02:15.510> survival<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.230> full<00:02:16.470> benefit<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.950> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
already been numbed and then we just

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.740 
already been numbed and then we just
inject<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.830> fat<00:03:35.010> end<00:03:37.519> okay<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.849> how<00:03:38.970> much<00:03:39.180> fat

in that area where there was not that
fullness<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.250> then<00:03:53.370> we<00:03:53.459> can<00:03:53.580> just<00:03:53.610> spread<00:03:53.970> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
fullness and then we can just spread it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.589 
fullness and then we can just spread it
around<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:55.099> that<00:03:56.099> completely<00:03:56.910> rejuvenates

next one oh my goodness that that's

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.900 
next one oh my goodness that that's
incredible<00:04:01.980> now<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.160> know<00:04:02.280> with<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.670> with

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
incredible now I know with it with

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.170 
incredible now I know with it with
everything<00:04:03.239> there<00:04:03.599> are<00:04:04.069> some<00:04:05.069> risks<00:04:05.430> correct

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
everything there are some risks correct

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.570 
everything there are some risks correct
yeah<00:04:06.750> there<00:04:07.110> are<00:04:07.260> very<00:04:07.680> minimal<00:04:08.190> risks

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
yeah there are very minimal risks

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.830 
yeah there are very minimal risks
associate<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.090> this<00:04:09.239> because<00:04:09.540> it's<00:04:09.720> your

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
associate with this because it's your

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.240 
associate with this because it's your
own<00:04:09.989> fat<00:04:10.290> we<00:04:10.470> don't<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.860> worry<00:04:11.069> about

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
own fat we don't have to worry about

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.360 
own fat we don't have to worry about
rejection<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.360> with<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.230> new<00:04:13.590> system<00:04:13.980> that

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
rejection and with this new system that

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.000 
rejection and with this new system that
has<00:04:14.820> been<00:04:15.000> FDA<00:04:15.299> approved<00:04:15.390> we're<00:04:16.380> able<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.799> do

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
has been FDA approved we're able to do

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.740 
has been FDA approved we're able to do
this<00:04:17.160> by<00:04:17.370> keeping<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.850> fat<00:04:18.060> completely

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
this by keeping the fat completely

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.949 
this by keeping the fat completely
without<00:04:19.669> exposing<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:20.940> air<00:04:21.150> so<00:04:21.450> we<00:04:21.750> don't

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
without exposing it to air so we don't

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.770 
without exposing it to air so we don't
really<00:04:22.169> worry<00:04:22.500> about<00:04:22.590> infection<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:24.270> that's

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
really worry about infection so that's

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.690 
really worry about infection so that's
been<00:04:25.169> all<00:04:25.470> those<00:04:26.010> have<00:04:26.160> been<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.400> risk<00:04:26.640> that

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
been all those have been the risk that

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.980 
been all those have been the risk that
we've<00:04:26.850> had<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.090> worry<00:04:27.270> about<00:04:27.360> in<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.810> past

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990
