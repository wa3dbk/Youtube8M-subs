to look really good
now<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> also<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.379> plastic

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
now on this one I also do plastic

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.220 
now on this one I also do plastic
binding<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.300> my<00:00:57.449> belt<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> legs

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
because I just find they hold their

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.189 
because I just find they hold their
shape<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.239> lot<00:01:00.359> better<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.840> they're<00:01:01.020> less

great thickness for all the belts all
around<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.670> buckle<00:01:51.630> itself<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.500> casing

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
around the buckle itself is a casing

the buckles are wider at the back at
this<00:02:07.350> portion<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.220> thinner

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
this portion and then they get thinner

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.010 
this portion and then they get thinner
if<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.819> see<00:02:09.000> they're<00:02:09.179> actually<00:02:09.420> angled

down and that one's angled up that way
it<00:02:12.569> actually<00:02:12.629> snaps<00:02:13.110> around<00:02:13.590> the

it actually snaps around the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.270 
simple design up here
I<00:03:09.030> choose<00:03:10.030> silver<00:03:10.420> for<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.440> ringlets<00:03:11.950> even

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
I choose silver for the ringlets even

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.560 
I choose silver for the ringlets even
though<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.400> know<00:03:12.550> in<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.850> game<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.270> they<00:03:13.360> look

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
though I know in the game that they look

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.540 
though I know in the game that they look
gold<00:03:13.780> I'm<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:14.410> not<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.590> fan<00:03:14.740> of<00:03:15.040> how<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.340> looks

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
gold I'm just not a fan of how it looks

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.880 
gold I'm just not a fan of how it looks
on<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.850> belt<00:03:16.290> next<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.380> these<00:03:17.530> because<00:03:17.740> I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
on the belt next to these because I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.250 
on the belt next to these because I
should<00:03:18.100> keep<00:03:18.250> these<00:03:18.520> so<00:03:18.940> close<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:19.750> loops

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
should keep these so close to loops

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.750 
should keep these so close to loops
right<00:03:20.440> here<00:03:20.740> I<00:03:20.950> just<00:03:20.980> think<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.400> gives<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.610> more

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
right here I just think it gives a more

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.730 
right here I just think it gives a more
realistic<00:03:22.060> design<00:03:22.600> sadly<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.500> haven't

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
realistic design sadly I haven't

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.830 
realistic design sadly I haven't
sculpted<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.400> buckle<00:03:24.700> for<00:03:24.880> this<00:03:25.030> one<00:03:25.209> yet<00:03:25.450> so

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
sculpted the buckle for this one yet so

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.960 
sculpted the buckle for this one yet so
I<00:03:26.200> don't<00:03:26.890> get<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.250> put<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.520> in<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.670> video<00:03:27.910> but

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
I don't get to put it in the video but

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.960 
I don't get to put it in the video but
you<00:03:28.209> can<00:03:28.300> see<00:03:28.510> it'll<00:03:28.660> be<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.870> same<00:03:29.050> snap<00:03:29.410> cover

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
you can see it'll be the same snap cover

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.250 
you can see it'll be the same snap cover
but<00:03:30.970> with<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.270> nice<00:03:31.450> squared<00:03:31.780> design<00:03:32.080> of

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
but with that nice squared design of

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.620 
but with that nice squared design of
them<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.500> circle<00:03:32.890> split<00:03:33.250> in<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.850> center<00:03:34.120> that's

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
them a circle split in the center that's

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.140 
them a circle split in the center that's
how<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:34.870> one<00:03:35.170> works<00:03:35.550> sadly<00:03:36.550> this<00:03:36.730> one<00:03:36.940> also

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
how that one works sadly this one also

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.360 
how that one works sadly this one also

the belt is currently drying on this

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.520

long-lasting
but<00:03:49.870> giving<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.890> build<00:03:51.430> an<00:03:51.580> edge<00:03:51.790> also<00:03:52.030> you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
but giving that build an edge also you

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.970 
but giving that build an edge also you
know<00:03:52.540> seals<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:53.050> off<00:03:53.200> because<00:03:53.410> I<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:53.830> to

know seals it off because I like it to

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.830 
know seals it off because I like it to
be<00:03:54.190> better<00:03:54.340> quality<00:03:54.820> but<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.750> the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
the metal on the outside I'm just a huge

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.100 
the metal on the outside I'm just a huge
fan<00:04:02.140> of<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:03.010> look<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.600> this<00:04:04.600> is<00:04:04.840> actually

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
fan of the look of it this is actually

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.930 
fan of the look of it this is actually
route<00:04:05.470> flashing<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.010> one<00:04:06.190> on<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.459> here<00:04:06.730> but<00:04:06.880> I

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
route flashing a one on in here but I

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.199 
route flashing a one on in here but I
also<00:04:07.000> use<00:04:07.450> metal<00:04:07.810> duct<00:04:08.020> tape<00:04:08.230> over<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:08.890> just

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
also use metal duct tape over it just

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.580 
also use metal duct tape over it just
didn't<00:04:10.209> sure<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:10.510> these<00:04:10.600> edges<00:04:10.780> are<00:04:11.020> super

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
didn't sure that these edges are super

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.620 
didn't sure that these edges are super
super<00:04:12.100> smooth<00:04:12.430> so<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.910> way<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.120> can't<00:04:13.450> get

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
super smooth so that way you can't get

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.150 
super smooth so that way you can't get
hurt<00:04:13.840> on<00:04:13.989> these<00:04:14.140> corners<00:04:14.470> you<00:04:14.590> can't<00:04:14.800> get<00:04:14.980> cut

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
hurt on these corners you can't get cut

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.159 
hurt on these corners you can't get cut
on<00:04:15.190> these<00:04:15.370> edges<00:04:15.790> because<00:04:16.090> no<00:04:16.299> one<00:04:16.510> wants<00:04:16.930> you

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
on these edges because no one wants you

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.039 
on these edges because no one wants you
know<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.980> bleed<00:04:18.220> for<00:04:18.430> crafts<00:04:19.000> more<00:04:19.270> than<00:04:19.570> we<00:04:19.870> do

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
know to bleed for crafts more than we do

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.030 
know to bleed for crafts more than we do
making<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.650> costumes<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.690> by<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.110> mean

making the costumes and by that I mean

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.240 
making the costumes and by that I mean
I cut<00:04:24.280> myself<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.850> lot<00:04:25.510> really<00:04:26.410> really<00:04:26.950> bad<00:04:27.100> at

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
I cut myself a lot really really bad at

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.660 
I cut myself a lot really really bad at
that<00:04:27.430> but<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:28.120> know<00:04:28.240> it's<00:04:29.110> worth<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.640> so<00:04:30.640> I

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
that but you know it's worth it so I

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.310 
that but you know it's worth it so I
like<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.300> said<00:04:31.360> this<00:04:31.720> is<00:04:31.900> currently<00:04:32.260> my

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
like I said this is currently my

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.380 
like I said this is currently my
favorite<00:04:32.410> holster<00:04:33.070> design<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.580> don't<00:04:34.090> carry

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
favorite holster design I don't carry

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
the metal all the way around the back

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.640 
the metal all the way around the back
anymore<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.550> found<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.180> as<00:04:37.390> it<00:04:37.570> got<00:04:37.810> against

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
anymore I found that as it got against

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.650 
anymore I found that as it got against
the<00:04:38.980> leg<00:04:39.280> at<00:04:39.610> all<00:04:39.730> during<00:04:40.030> movement<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.540> stuff

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
the leg at all during movement and stuff

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.380 
the leg at all during movement and stuff
that<00:04:40.720> it<00:04:40.960> could<00:04:41.260> leave<00:04:41.730> rough<00:04:42.730> edges<00:04:42.940> whereas

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
that it could leave rough edges whereas

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.210 
that it could leave rough edges whereas
what<00:04:43.540> it<00:04:43.600> was<00:04:43.720> more<00:04:43.900> forward<00:04:44.350> just<00:04:44.980> from<00:04:45.100> the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
what it was more forward just from the

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.860 
what it was more forward just from the
routers<00:04:45.550> design<00:04:45.850> it<00:04:46.000> doesn't<00:04:46.180> rub<00:04:46.450> on<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:46.720> as

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
routers design it doesn't rub on you as

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.200 
routers design it doesn't rub on you as
much<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:48.130> that's<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.490> comfort

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
much so that's a comfort

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.550 
much so that's a comfort
shoes<00:04:49.630> right<00:04:49.780> there<00:04:49.840> but<00:04:50.170> that<00:04:50.260> does<00:04:50.410> actually

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
have all the vinyl inside as well so

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.930 
have all the vinyl inside as well so
that<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.560> does<00:04:53.830> have<00:04:54.040> a<00:04:54.070> nice<00:04:54.310> finished<00:04:54.790> off

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
that it does have a nice finished off

that it does have a nice finished off
edge<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:55.420> I<00:04:55.450> do<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.690> stitching<00:04:56.050> before<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:57.430> do

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
edge and I do the stitching before I do

edge and I do the stitching before I do
all<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.300> bending<00:04:58.660> that<00:04:58.870> way<00:04:58.990> it's<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.560> know

the<00:04:59.770> metal<00:05:00.010> plating<00:05:00.310> is<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.490> between<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.910> two

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
the metal plating is in between the two

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.670 
the metal plating is in between the two
pieces<00:05:01.210> so<00:05:01.420> it's<00:05:01.660> not<00:05:01.780> going<00:05:02.020> anywhere<00:05:02.200> it's

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
close to the edge you can actually see I

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.850 
close to the edge you can actually see I
actually<00:05:10.420> love<00:05:10.840> how<00:05:11.050> it<00:05:11.230> has<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.560> bumped<00:05:11.770> up

cool you know finished off thicker look
whereas<00:05:16.030> in<00:05:16.180> this<00:05:16.360> one<00:05:16.600> you'll<00:05:16.750> see<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:16.960> keep

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
whereas in this one you'll see I keep

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.160 
whereas in this one you'll see I keep
the<00:05:17.590> metal<00:05:17.890> a<00:05:17.920> little<00:05:18.280> bit<00:05:18.520> farther<00:05:18.760> back<00:05:19.170> that

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
the metal a little bit farther back that

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.320 
the metal a little bit farther back that
way<00:05:20.410> you<00:05:21.280> know<00:05:21.400> it's<00:05:21.550> still<00:05:21.760> able<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.090> really

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
way you know it's still able to really

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.820 
way you know it's still able to really
hold<00:05:22.510> its<00:05:22.630> shape<00:05:22.720> other<00:05:23.140> than<00:05:23.200> this<00:05:23.500> one<00:05:23.650> just

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
hold its shape other than this one just

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.860 
hold its shape other than this one just
because<00:05:24.160> it's<00:05:24.400> such<00:05:24.670> pointy<00:05:25.150> edges<00:05:25.360> when<00:05:25.750> you

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
because it's such pointy edges when you

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.660 
because it's such pointy edges when you
start<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.170> bend<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.710> keeps<00:05:26.980> them<00:05:27.190> rounded

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
start to bend it it keeps them rounded

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.870 
start to bend it it keeps them rounded
and<00:05:27.940> it<00:05:28.300> keeps<00:05:28.540> them<00:05:28.750> soft<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:29.350> way<00:05:29.760> you<00:05:30.760> know

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
and it keeps them soft that way you know

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.430 
and it keeps them soft that way you know
when<00:05:31.030> anyone's<00:05:31.360> moving<00:05:31.660> around<00:05:31.840> in<00:05:32.020> it<00:05:32.200> again

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
when anyone's moving around in it again

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.810 
when anyone's moving around in it again
I<00:05:32.680> want<00:05:32.830> it<00:05:32.950> to<00:05:33.040> be<00:05:33.160> comfortable
