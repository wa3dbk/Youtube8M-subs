again and again you can choose what you
want<00:00:32.210> children<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.359> work<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.050> would

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
want children to work on so you would

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.770 
want children to work on so you would
print<00:00:34.319> them<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.649> cut<00:00:35.640> them<00:00:35.789> out<00:00:35.909> or<00:00:36.210> depending

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
print them out cut them out or depending

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.029 
print them out cut them out or depending
upon<00:00:36.929> the<00:00:37.140> age<00:00:37.199> of<00:00:37.379> the<00:00:37.440> children<00:00:37.769> they<00:00:37.890> can

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
upon the age of the children they can

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.069 
upon the age of the children they can
cut<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.339> out<00:00:38.429> themselves<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.960> can

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
cut them out themselves and as you can

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.540 
cut them out themselves and as you can
see<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.350> ever<00:00:40.499> I've<00:00:40.769> already<00:00:41.069> started<00:00:41.280> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
see if ever I've already started this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.899 
see if ever I've already started this
chain<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.889> it's<00:00:43.889> just<00:00:44.159> exactly<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.760> says

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
chain and it's just exactly what it says

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.729 
chain and it's just exactly what it says
it's<00:00:45.149> an<00:00:45.239> alphabet<00:00:45.510> sequence<00:00:46.050> chain<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it's an alphabet sequence chain so the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.479 
it's an alphabet sequence chain so the
children<00:00:47.100> would<00:00:47.280> put<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.469> letters<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:50.309> order

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
children would put the letters in order

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.739 
children would put the letters in order
so<00:00:50.699> we<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.999> a<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> b<00:00:53.089> c<00:00:54.089> d<00:00:54.350> e

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
so we have the a and we have the b c d e

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.959 
so we have the a and we have the b c d e
and<00:00:57.749> so<00:00:57.959> on<00:00:58.109> e<00:00:58.139> we<00:00:58.409> do<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.649> until<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.249> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and so on e we do it until you have the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.139 
and so on e we do it until you have the
whole<00:01:00.589> alphabet<00:01:01.589> done<00:01:02.159> and<00:01:02.399> order<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.969> so

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
whole alphabet done and order and so

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.540 
whole alphabet done and order and so
this<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.719> left<00:01:04.619> off<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:06.080> J<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
this one they left off on J so the

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.410 
this one they left off on J so the
children<00:01:08.880> would<00:01:08.970> take<00:01:09.180> their<00:01:09.330> strips<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:11.420> put

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
children would take their strips and put

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.450 
children would take their strips and put
glue<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.080> move<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.440> down<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.620> bit<00:01:13.740> move<00:01:14.100> put

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
glue I move that down a bit move put

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.810 
glue I move that down a bit move put
glue<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.730> one<00:01:14.970> end<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:17.370> they<00:01:17.490> would<00:01:17.640> loop

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
glue on one end and then they would loop

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.700 
glue on one end and then they would loop
it<00:01:18.030> through<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:20.370> previous<00:01:20.730> wetter<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> Chloe

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it through the previous wetter and Chloe

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.550 
it through the previous wetter and Chloe
cos<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:24.390> repeat<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> until<00:01:25.170> they<00:01:25.380> get

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
cos and then repeat that until they get

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.880 
cos and then repeat that until they get
all<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.930> way<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> Z<00:01:28.410> or<00:01:28.880> until<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.870> have<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
all the way to Z or until you have the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.020 
all the way to Z or until you have the
feeling<00:01:32.220> would<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.400> part<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:32.790> alphabet

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
feeling would you part of the alphabet

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.460 
feeling would you part of the alphabet
that's<00:01:33.330> fine<00:01:33.600> too<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:33.990> you're<00:01:34.140> working<00:01:34.320> on

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that's fine too if you're working on

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
that's fine too if you're working on
maybe<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.770> through<00:01:35.280> F<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:35.940> have<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
maybe a through F and just have the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.460 
maybe a through F and just have the
children<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.020> they<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
children do that or they can do the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.640 
children do that or they can do the
whole<00:01:37.620> alphabet<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.380> could<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.620> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
whole alphabet and then we could do the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.250 
whole alphabet and then we could do the
next<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.390> like<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.510> said<00:01:42.690> I<00:01:42.720> also<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.140> these

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
next one like I said I also have these

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.670 
next one like I said I also have these
available<00:01:43.580> for<00:01:44.750> numbers<00:01:45.750> too<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.230> that'll<00:01:46.530> be

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
available for numbers too and that'll be

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
available for numbers too and that'll be
with<00:01:46.980> these<00:01:47.130> patterns<00:01:47.640> together<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.380> can

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
with these patterns together so you can

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.390 
with these patterns together so you can
have<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.860> together<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.640> your<00:01:50.940> resources

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
have them together for your resources

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.280 
have them together for your resources
but<00:01:53.400> it's<00:01:53.520> great<00:01:53.760> for<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:55.080> letter

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
but it's great for the letter

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.720 
but it's great for the letter
recognition<00:01:55.620> children<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.580> be

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
recognition children they have to be

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.620 
recognition children they have to be
able<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.320> not<00:01:58.320> only<00:01:58.350> identify<00:01:59.240> the<00:02:00.240> letters

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
able to not only identify the letters
