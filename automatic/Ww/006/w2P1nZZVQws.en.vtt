00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
parting my hair the same way that I did

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.500 
parting my hair the same way that I did
before<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:51.190> instead<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.520> doing<00:02:52.790> one<00:02:52.970> big<00:02:53.000> fat

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
before and instead of doing one big fat

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.210 
before and instead of doing one big fat
choice<00:02:53.840> on<00:02:53.989> one<00:02:54.140> side<00:02:54.410> I'm<00:02:54.680> going<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.069> do

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
choice on one side I'm going to do

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.460 
choice on one side I'm going to do
smaller<00:02:55.550> ones<00:02:55.880> but<00:02:56.510> I'm<00:02:56.630> alternating<00:02:57.319> the

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
smaller ones but I'm alternating the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.960 
smaller ones but I'm alternating the
size<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:58.040> them<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:58.400> I'm<00:02:58.459> doing<00:02:58.790> one

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
size of them so I'm doing one

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.540 
size of them so I'm doing one
medium-sized<00:02:59.569> one<00:02:59.870> one<00:03:00.140> small<00:03:00.410> one<00:03:00.769> just<00:03:01.010> to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
medium-sized one one small one just to

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.009 
medium-sized one one small one just to
add<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.700> little<00:03:01.940> bit<00:03:02.090> more<00:03:02.120> dimension<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.930> the

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
add a little bit more dimension to the

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.770 
add a little bit more dimension to the
hairstyle<00:03:03.470> I'm<00:03:04.370> also<00:03:04.580> separating<00:03:05.300> my<00:03:05.480> bangs

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
hairstyle I'm also separating my bangs

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.199 
hairstyle I'm also separating my bangs
out<00:03:06.050> which<00:03:06.709> is<00:03:06.920> going<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.250> be<00:03:07.370> flat<00:03:07.610> twisted

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
out which is going to be flat twisted

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.750 
out which is going to be flat twisted
but<00:03:08.420> I'm<00:03:08.540> going<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.989> do<00:03:09.110> two<00:03:09.380> sections<00:03:10.100> just<00:03:10.310> to

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
but I'm going to do two sections just to

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:24.860 
but I'm going to do two sections just to
add<00:03:10.910> more<00:03:10.940> volume

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.110 

so<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.989> top<00:03:26.200> part<00:03:26.230> will<00:03:26.769> be<00:03:26.890> flat<00:03:27.189> twisted<00:03:27.790> and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
so the top part will be flat twisted and

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.210 
so the top part will be flat twisted and
that<00:03:28.900> section<00:03:29.409> right<00:03:29.620> there<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.040> middle

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
that section right there in the middle

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.929 
that section right there in the middle
that's<00:03:30.610> going<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.299> be<00:03:31.680> two<00:03:32.680> strength<00:03:33.310> twisted

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
that's going to be two strength twisted

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.720 
that's going to be two strength twisted
I<00:03:34.680> hope<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.859> makes<00:03:36.040> sense<00:03:36.129> a<00:03:36.459> little<00:03:36.640> bit

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
I hope that makes sense a little bit

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.300 
I hope that makes sense a little bit
confusing<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:37.569> just<00:03:38.140> watch<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.590> video<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.189> I

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
confusing but just watch the video and I

00:03:39.310 --> 00:04:02.240 
confusing but just watch the video and I
