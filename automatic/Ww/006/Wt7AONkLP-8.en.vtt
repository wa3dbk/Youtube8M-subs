00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.220
 how about people one more house for the series 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 in this case we have the first of all 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.750
 the ones that I have uploaded that does not have a pool 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.550
 It is a house somewhat different than the others 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.790
 which I really liked the area 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.350
 of the garden all that space shot of 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.010
 these white fences I liked 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.650
 quite but above all I have given 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.100
 account that many of the houses that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.379
 subo selected it mostly so 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 is the interior decoration more than for its 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.630
 aspect from outside always let me follow 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.020
 being amazed at how perfect 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.399
 those decorations remain under my eye 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.370
 point of view and I for more than believe 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.829
 home I always get the same designs 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.230
 basic but good is going to be that the point 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.020
 strong is to control freddy more 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.790
 other than creating houses that by the way 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.210
 next house showing e 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.160
 I will try to move away from all 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 these modern designs more than anything 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.710
 because I was suggested in a comment 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.390
 so so the next thing will be in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.570
 plan 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.300
 equal to medieval or whatever you want to call it 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.050
 to see what I find out there nothing more 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.050
 for the next 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.510
 or not 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.510
 yes no 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.470
 do not 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.750
 two 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.490
 two 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.490
 d 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.430
