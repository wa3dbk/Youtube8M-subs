00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
took me quite a while to get around to

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.120 
took me quite a while to get around to
but<00:05:46.040> I've<00:05:46.160> been<00:05:46.460> learning<00:05:46.760> Zora<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:48.130> maybe

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
but I've been learning Zora and maybe

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.680 
but I've been learning Zora and maybe
took<00:05:49.310> me<00:05:49.430> about<00:05:49.610> 10<00:05:49.850> kills<00:05:50.090> to<00:05:50.210> get<00:05:50.330> my<00:05:50.420> first

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
took me about 10 kills to get my first

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.020 
took me about 10 kills to get my first
kill<00:05:51.020> and<00:05:51.350> I<00:05:51.410> probably<00:05:51.980> died<00:05:52.220> about<00:05:52.430> 15<00:05:52.820> times

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
kill and I probably died about 15 times

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.070 
kill and I probably died about 15 times
getting<00:05:53.900> my<00:05:54.080> first<00:05:54.290> uh<00:05:55.390> my<00:05:56.390> first<00:05:56.540> five<00:05:56.780> kills

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
getting my first uh my first five kills

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.370 
getting my first uh my first five kills
her<00:05:57.170> so<00:05:57.320> it<00:05:57.530> was<00:05:57.560> kind<00:05:57.800> of<00:05:57.830> rough<00:05:58.040> to<00:05:58.430> to<00:05:58.790> learn

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
her so it was kind of rough to to learn

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.230 
her so it was kind of rough to to learn
but<00:05:59.530> I<00:05:59.830> am<00:06:00.040> getting<00:06:00.160> the<00:06:00.310> hang<00:06:00.460> of<00:06:00.580> it<00:06:00.730> and<00:06:01.030> I

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
but I am getting the hang of it and I

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.080 
but I am getting the hang of it and I
got<00:06:01.390> extremely<00:06:01.750> lucky<00:06:02.110> on<00:06:02.440> kill<00:06:02.770> 22<00:06:03.190> one<00:06:03.940> thing

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
got extremely lucky on kill 22 one thing

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.510 
got extremely lucky on kill 22 one thing
that<00:06:04.210> I've<00:06:04.300> been<00:06:04.330> hoping<00:06:04.840> for<00:06:05.260> is<00:06:05.620> a<00:06:05.920> certain

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
that I've been hoping for is a certain

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.460 
that I've been hoping for is a certain
time<00:06:06.670> Vistage<00:06:07.060> because<00:06:07.450> if<00:06:07.630> I<00:06:07.750> use<00:06:07.780> that<00:06:07.990> I

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
time Vistage because if I use that I

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.900 
time Vistage because if I use that I
don't<00:06:08.890> have<00:06:08.950> to<00:06:09.070> worry<00:06:09.220> about<00:06:09.310> anti-venom

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
don't have to worry about anti-venom

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.730 
don't have to worry about anti-venom
anymore<00:06:10.390> which<00:06:10.690> I<00:06:10.810> can't<00:06:11.110> make<00:06:11.320> because<00:06:11.650> my

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
anymore which I can't make because my

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.960 
anymore which I can't make because my
are<00:06:11.830> blur<00:06:11.980> level<00:06:12.220> is<00:06:12.310> a<00:06:12.370> little<00:06:12.580> bit<00:06:12.670> too<00:06:12.790> low

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
are blur level is a little bit too low

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.630
