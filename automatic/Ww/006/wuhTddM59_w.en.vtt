hello folks this is church nerd you can
see<00:00:04.200> my<00:00:04.380> IO<00:00:04.589> dock<00:00:04.980> sitting<00:00:05.430> there<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:06.600> has<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
see my IO dock sitting there it has the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.919 
see my IO dock sitting there it has the
30-pin<00:00:07.529> here<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:09.540> have<00:00:09.750> recently

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
30-pin here and I have recently

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.580 
30-pin here and I have recently
purchased<00:00:10.380> an<00:00:10.800> iPad<00:00:11.160> air<00:00:11.660> so<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.990> was<00:00:13.290> trying<00:00:13.500> to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
purchased an iPad air so I was trying to

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.259 
purchased an iPad air so I was trying to
figure<00:00:13.740> out<00:00:13.950> how<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.370> able<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.700> adapt<00:00:15.000> this

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
figure out how to be able to adapt this

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.660 
figure out how to be able to adapt this
and<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:16.500> was<00:00:16.619> also<00:00:16.949> thinking<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and I was also thinking that the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.900 
and I was also thinking that the
recording<00:00:18.210> angle<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.680> iPad<00:00:20.039> sits<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:20.699> is

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
recording angle that the iPad sits at is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.450 
recording angle that the iPad sits at is
just<00:00:21.630> not<00:00:21.869> good<00:00:22.439> enough<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.830> me<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> need<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
just not good enough for me I need it to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.370 
just not good enough for me I need it to
be<00:00:23.550> able<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.789> come<00:00:24.000> up<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> different

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
be able to come up have a different

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
be able to come up have a different
angle<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.550> much<00:00:26.789> better<00:00:27.000> for

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
angle on it so it's much better for

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.230 
angle on it so it's much better for
recording<00:00:28.189> so<00:00:29.189> here's<00:00:29.519> how<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> solved<00:00:30.179> that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
recording so here's how I solved that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.810 
recording so here's how I solved that
problem<00:00:30.650> first<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.859> all<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.250> need<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> buy<00:00:32.640> an

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
problem first of all you need to buy an

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.620 
problem first of all you need to buy an
Apple<00:00:33.110> adapter<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.820> I<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> write<00:00:36.450> up

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
Apple adapter and I have a write up

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.030 
Apple adapter and I have a write up
following<00:00:37.079> all<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.680> you'll<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.950> able

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
following all of this so you'll be able

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.500 
following all of this so you'll be able
to<00:00:38.219> tell<00:00:38.430> where<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.149> how<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.270> get

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
to tell where to get it and how to get

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.790 
to tell where to get it and how to get
it<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.690> how<00:00:39.840> long<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.590> buy<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
it and how long this is but buy the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.530 
it and how long this is but buy the
Apple<00:00:41.070> adapter<00:00:41.640> because<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.090> always<00:00:42.210> works

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
Apple adapter because it always works

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.889 
Apple adapter because it always works
okay<00:00:43.530> now<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.489> order<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.120> fit<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.660> left
