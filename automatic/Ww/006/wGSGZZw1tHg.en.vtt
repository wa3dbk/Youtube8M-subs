 let's see in this video the five 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.790
 muscles of joy that are reflected 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.250
 in the face 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.270
 at face level the general elevation 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.820
 of the transverse holes 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:20.740

 Express or produce joy in this image 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.349
 we can see the five muscles that we 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.920
 reveal if a person lives in a 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.200

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 take an optimistic attitude 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.880
 we start here with the first of the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.930
 muscles that is the dilated of the 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.930

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.210
 This muscle stress a desire 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.580

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.040
 You have to participate, it 's like when 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.650
 we breathe, we flip something that we like 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.950
 that we feel like and then we open the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.950
 add windows to suck more 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.720
 we now turn to the second of those 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.010
 muscles in the lower part of the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.810
 lips that is the episode 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.630
 the curl I express 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.909
 the degree of the degree of activity that 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.420
 the relationship satisfaction is realized 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.930

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.299
 This muscle lengthens the oral cleft and 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.880

 This muscle translates a feeling of 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.969
 pleasure as such feeling is not a 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.750
 sensation is also the muscle of the 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:11.019

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:44.989
 like when we're at a table and let's pray 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.989

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.350
