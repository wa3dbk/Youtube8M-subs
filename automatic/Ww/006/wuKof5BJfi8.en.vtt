building<00:00:09.599> our<00:00:09.990> coil<00:00:10.349> pot<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.919> after<00:00:11.519> we've

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:11.669 
building our coil pot is after we've

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.759 
building our coil pot is after we've
placed<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.480> bottom<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.959> pot<00:00:13.169> into<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
placed the bottom of the pot into the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.430 
placed the bottom of the pot into the
form<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.669> we're<00:00:14.849> going<00:00:14.999> to<00:00:15.120> be<00:00:15.299> using<00:00:15.570> what

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
form that we're going to be using what

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.279 
form that we're going to be using what
we're<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.950> do<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.310> take<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.610> tool<00:00:18.289> like

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
we're going to do is take a tool like

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.519 
we're going to do is take a tool like
this<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.800> begin<00:00:20.670> scoring<00:00:21.330> around<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.990> edge

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
this and begin scoring around the edge

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.310 
this and begin scoring around the edge
of<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.490> bottom<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.779> want<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> make

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
of this bottom and so we want to make

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.810 
of this bottom and so we want to make
just<00:00:25.619> little<00:00:26.550> deep<00:00:26.759> marks<00:00:27.179> around<00:00:27.330> here<00:00:27.929> and

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
just little deep marks around here and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.390 
just little deep marks around here and
what<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.960> allow<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
what this is going to do is allow the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.310 
what this is going to do is allow the
first<00:00:32.400> coil<00:00:32.759> along<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> slip<00:00:34.140> that

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
first coil along with the slip that

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
first coil along with the slip that
we're<00:00:34.470> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> place<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.220> this<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:36.150> bond<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
we're going to place on this to bond a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.510 
we're going to place on this to bond a
little<00:00:36.840> more<00:00:37.020> solidly<00:00:37.560> with<00:00:37.920> our<00:00:38.580> pot<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
little more solidly with our pot and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.070 
little more solidly with our pot and
gonna<00:00:41.520> let<00:00:41.700> oil<00:00:42.360> off<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.840> there<00:00:44.720> okay<00:00:45.720> so<00:00:45.780> after

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
gonna let oil off of there okay so after

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.080 
gonna let oil off of there okay so after
we've<00:00:46.380> scored<00:00:46.650> the<00:00:46.830> bottom<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> pot<00:00:47.580> what

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
we've scored the bottom of the pot what

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.970 
we've scored the bottom of the pot what
we're<00:00:48.240> going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.540> do<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.900> actually<00:00:49.110> make<00:00:49.530> our

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
we're going to do is actually make our

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
we're going to do is actually make our
first<00:00:50.340> coil<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> remember<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.990> we<00:00:52.110> did

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
first coil if you remember what we did

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.420 
first coil if you remember what we did
was<00:00:52.530> place<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.950> clay<00:00:53.190> into<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.700> extruder<00:00:55.430> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
was place the clay into the extruder and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
was place the clay into the extruder and
so<00:00:56.700> we'll<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.120> simply<00:00:57.510> operate<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
so we'll just simply operate the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.310 
so we'll just simply operate the
extruder<00:00:59.040> this<00:00:59.340> way<00:00:59.580> and<00:00:59.880> squeeze<00:01:00.750> out<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
extruder this way and squeeze out a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.490 
extruder this way and squeeze out a
piece<00:01:01.740> of<00:01:02.330> clay<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:04.320> coil<00:01:04.650> cut<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.670> off<00:01:05.850> here

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
piece of clay the coil cut it off here

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
piece of clay the coil cut it off here
and<00:01:07.500> set<00:01:07.829> it<00:01:07.979> aside<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.000> order<00:01:09.149> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and set it aside and then in order to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.080 
and set it aside and then in order to
help<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:10.049> what<00:01:10.799> I'll<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.250> take<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.759> coil

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
help this what I'll do is take this coil

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.399

is make sure that I put a little bit
more<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> slip<00:02:10.319> right<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.340> which<00:02:12.030> will

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
more of the slip right here which will

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.670 
more of the slip right here which will
help<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.840> should<00:02:13.050> have<00:02:13.170> scored<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
help and I should have scored that a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.420 
help and I should have scored that a
little<00:02:13.950> bit

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
little bit

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.179 
little bit
but<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.819> will<00:02:14.939> help<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.750> two<00:02:16.379> clay<00:02:16.620> bodies<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
but it will help the two clay bodies the

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.520 
but it will help the two clay bodies the
two<00:02:17.370> clays<00:02:17.670> attach<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.780> each<00:02:18.930> other<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.409> then

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
two clays attach to each other and then

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.360 
two clays attach to each other and then
I'll<00:02:19.680> take<00:02:19.890> this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
I'll take this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.429 
I'll take this
the<00:02:20.790> Linstrom<00:02:21.209> runt<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.569> make<00:02:21.780> sure<00:02:22.019> that<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
the Linstrom runt and make sure that the

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.959 
the Linstrom runt and make sure that the
clay<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.920> pulled<00:02:23.310> down<00:02:23.459> on<00:02:24.030> top<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.670> coil

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
clay is pulled down on top of the coil

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:33.559 
clay is pulled down on top of the coil
that's<00:02:27.180> there<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:31.639> if<00:02:32.639> you<00:02:32.760> look<00:02:32.969> at<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.299> this

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
that's there so if you look at it this

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.780 
that's there so if you look at it this
is<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.930> very<00:02:34.109> basic<00:02:34.379> beginning<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.579> what

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
is the very basic beginning of what

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.980 
is the very basic beginning of what
we're<00:02:35.939> going<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.299> call<00:02:37.170> our<00:02:37.200> coil<00:02:37.680> pot
