they've<00:02:19.189> actually<00:02:19.219> put<00:02:19.640> any<00:02:19.819> working<00:02:21.099> yeah<00:02:22.099> so

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
they've actually put any working yeah so

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.250 
they've actually put any working yeah so
they<00:02:22.430> can't<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.359> can't<00:02:23.569> be<00:02:23.689> a<00:02:23.719> master<00:02:24.049> without

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
they can't you can't be a master without

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.250 
they can't you can't be a master without
actually<00:02:24.560> applicable<00:02:25.370> applying<00:02:26.329> yourself<00:02:26.480> to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
actually applicable applying yourself to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.589 
actually applicable applying yourself to
some<00:02:27.560> real<00:02:27.739> action<00:02:28.040> first<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.700> I'd<00:02:29.329> say

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
some real action first and I'd say

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.819 
some real action first and I'd say
probably<00:02:29.720> another<00:02:30.049> defining<00:02:30.470> feature<00:02:30.650> is

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
probably another defining feature is

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.259 
probably another defining feature is
they're<00:02:31.010> afraid<00:02:31.129> of<00:02:31.519> rejection<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.180> failure

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
they're afraid of rejection and failure

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.509 
they're afraid of rejection and failure
now<00:02:33.140> they're<00:02:33.379> not<00:02:33.530> willing<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.769> take<00:02:33.950> risk<00:02:34.280> and

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
now they're not willing to take risk and

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.009 
now they're not willing to take risk and
I<00:02:34.579> want<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.909> actually<00:02:35.180> fuck<00:02:35.420> stuff<00:02:35.659> up

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
I want to actually fuck stuff up

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.390 
I want to actually fuck stuff up
like<00:02:36.230> for<00:02:36.409> example<00:02:36.470> Shay<00:02:36.889> just<00:02:36.950> fucked<00:02:37.250> up

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
like for example Shay just fucked up

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.740 
like for example Shay just fucked up
that<00:02:37.609> mumble<00:02:37.909> in<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.060> video<00:02:38.269> if<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.599> have

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
that mumble in the video if you have

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.030 
that mumble in the video if you have
like<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> big<00:02:39.109> fear<00:02:39.349> of<00:02:39.379> that<00:02:39.620> we<00:02:39.799> would<00:02:39.889> never

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
like a big fear of that we would never

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.619 
like a big fear of that we would never
be<00:02:40.129> able<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.489> produce<00:02:40.700> any<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.180> content<00:02:41.540> we

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
be able to produce any of the content we

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.569 
be able to produce any of the content we
make<00:02:41.810> yes<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.859> what<00:02:42.980> about<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.250> third<00:02:43.280> type

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
make yes and what about the third type

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.940 
make yes and what about the third type
of<00:02:43.609> guy<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:44.720> third<00:02:44.930> group<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.409> people<00:02:45.709> are

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
of guy so the third group of people are

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.470 
of guy so the third group of people are
the<00:02:46.489> people<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:46.790> are<00:02:47.000> committed<00:02:47.419> to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
the people that are committed to

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.240 
the people that are committed to
transformation<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.349> they're<00:02:48.709> on<00:02:48.889> the<00:02:49.069> path

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
transformation and they're on the path

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.759 
transformation and they're on the path
of<00:02:49.430> mastery<00:02:49.579> so<00:02:50.419> they're<00:02:50.720> actually<00:02:51.590> doing

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
of mastery so they're actually doing

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.409 
of mastery so they're actually doing
things<00:02:52.099> on<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> consistent<00:02:52.549> basis<00:02:53.120> trying

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419 
things on a consistent basis trying

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.390 
things on a consistent basis trying
things<00:02:53.750> out<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.169> really<00:02:54.709> approaching<00:02:55.280> it

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
things out and really approaching it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.490 
things out and really approaching it
from<00:02:55.430> an<00:02:55.669> open<00:02:55.909> mind<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.419> it<00:02:56.540> takes<00:02:56.720> takes<00:02:57.349> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
from an open mind and it takes takes a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.750 
from an open mind and it takes takes a
whole<00:02:57.650> bunch<00:02:57.889> of<00:02:58.010> different<00:02:58.129> attitudes<00:02:58.609> to

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
whole bunch of different attitudes to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.550 
whole bunch of different attitudes to

so this is about even taking
responsibility<00:04:21.289> I<00:04:21.409> guess<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.769> big<00:04:21.950> question

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
them it can be an important step I guess

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.390 
them it can be an important step I guess
at<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:53.900> end<00:04:53.930> of<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.169> day<00:04:54.320> this<00:04:54.889> is<00:04:55.040> about<00:04:55.220> like

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
at the end of the day this is about like

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.880 
at the end of the day this is about like
developing<00:04:56.270> some<00:04:56.840> critical<00:04:57.260> thinking<00:04:57.620> tools

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
developing some critical thinking tools

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.340 
developing some critical thinking tools
inside<00:04:58.340> yourself<00:04:58.730> and<00:04:58.880> learning<00:04:59.780> to<00:04:59.870> separate

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
inside yourself and learning to separate

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.020 
inside yourself and learning to separate
the<00:05:00.530> difference<00:05:00.890> between<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.400> dream<00:05:01.730> of

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
the difference between the dream of

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.060

transformation and the reality of

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.490 
transformation and the reality of
transformation<00:05:04.880> so<00:05:05.540> there's<00:05:06.110> many<00:05:06.350> benefits

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
transformation so there's many benefits

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.830 
transformation so there's many benefits
of<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.280> can<00:05:07.460> come<00:05:07.669> from<00:05:07.880> really<00:05:08.030> becoming

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840
