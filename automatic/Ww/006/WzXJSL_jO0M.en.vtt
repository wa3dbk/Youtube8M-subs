standing up usually there's a little bit
of<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.180> class<00:00:24.529> like<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.119> end<00:00:27.390> up

of a class like this so if you end up

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259 
of a class like this so if you end up
squatting<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.369> proper<00:00:29.820> position

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
squatting with the proper position

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
squatting with the proper position
there's<00:00:30.630> tremendous<00:00:30.840> amount<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
there's tremendous amount of a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.160 
there's tremendous amount of a
contraction<00:00:32.550> required<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.120> your<00:00:33.210> abs<00:00:33.420> you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
contraction required for your abs you

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.450 
contraction required for your abs you
get<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> lot<00:00:34.440> more<00:00:34.469> power<00:00:34.860> through<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:35.160> back

get a lot more power through your back
up<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> case<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> show<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
up to the case so I'm going to show you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.119 
up to the case so I'm going to show you
right<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:38.059> how<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.090> looks<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> have

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
right now how that looks so if you have

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.000 
right now how that looks so if you have
a<00:00:41.190> barbell<00:00:42.320> usually<00:00:43.320> when<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> squat<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
a barbell usually when you go to squat I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.110 
a barbell usually when you go to squat I
will<00:00:44.190> give<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> front<00:00:44.730> squat<00:00:44.940> down

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
will give you the front squat down

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.420 
will give you the front squat down
you've<00:00:45.629> got<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.809> barbell<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:47.280> would

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you've got a barbell here you would

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.389 
you've got a barbell here you would
bring<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.829> collapse

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
bring it up like so now if I collapse

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.220 
bring it up like so now if I collapse
you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.789> see<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.360> collapse<00:00:52.489> posture

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
you can see this here collapse posture

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
you can see this here collapse posture
collapse<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:56.160> same<00:00:56.430> thing<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.879> happen<00:00:57.059> with

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
collapse that same thing can happen with

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.389 
collapse that same thing can happen with
a<00:00:57.329> back<00:00:57.510> squat<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.620> take<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.949> off<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.100> rack

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
a back squat so you take it off the rack

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.990 
a back squat so you take it off the rack
right<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.710> there's<00:01:01.710> there's<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.460> chest<00:01:02.789> up

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
right and there's there's that chest up

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.929 
right and there's there's that chest up
and<00:01:03.690> there's<00:01:04.760> collapse<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and there's collapse you can see the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.100 
and there's collapse you can see the
barbell<00:01:09.330> moves<00:01:09.570> right<00:01:11.479> that<00:01:12.479> barbell<00:01:12.900> move

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
barbell moves right that barbell move

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.990 
barbell moves right that barbell move
obviously<00:01:13.409> would<00:01:13.920> take<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> barbell<00:01:14.460> off<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
obviously would take the barbell off the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
obviously would take the barbell off the
heel<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> would<00:01:16.439> lose<00:01:16.590> all<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
heel for one and you would lose all the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.609 
heel for one and you would lose all the
core<00:01:17.250> power<00:01:17.490> required<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.479> make<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> lift<00:01:18.960> so

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
core power required to make the lift so

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.810 
core power required to make the lift so
