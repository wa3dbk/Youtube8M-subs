00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.610
 hi come on my mobile gaming channel 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:09.310
 there I letspleyev more than 10 mobile games 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:13.570
 such as clash-of-clans world of tanks 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:16.810
 blitz heartstone vainglory saige and many 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.909
 other as well as mobile gaming reviews all 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.249
 as for mobile games you will find 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:24.749
 there is always something to see 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.749
 link to channel in description 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.100
 Hello to you all, I shaft 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.600
 Tishinsky 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.550
 and now I will tell you about two headphones 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.790
 from the same company to show me 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.280
 how my piston 3 and piston 3 yust edition 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.880
 piston 3 is such beautiful here 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.360
 packaging and there still have additional 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:56.170
 nozzles for various 30 over the ears 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.300
 a piston 3 news edishen goes to such 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.200
 normal packaging there, too, by the way there 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.500
 nozzles 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.430
 and in principle, as it were, partly 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.979
 affects the difference between piston 3 piston 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.380
 3 views are edited so that these 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.420
 look on order premio her that 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.840
 directly concerns the headphones themselves 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.160
 here they already lie before me, I compared 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.830
 the length of the lace the piston 3 skid edishen they 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.700
 little do you know see this finger 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.979
 I have the top 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.979
 he is a little further, that is, they are somewhere 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.700
 2 centimeters can be a maximum 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.630
 longer and all that concerns 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.790
 directly materials from which 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.740
 the piston 3 headphones are made 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.020
 directly themselves better they are more 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.970
 premium appearance is the first 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.060
 as if the moment of the second moment 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.530
 the headphones themselves are big talent plus ko 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.840
 all part where 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.119
 Directly microphone and adjustment 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.770
 volume button play pause answer to 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.990
 call and so on here 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.150
 multifunctional it also looks 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.189
 more premium on made from 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.709
 metal and has such here I am 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.230
 mikrofonchik you heard go further where 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.340
 she connects two ears ie shoelaces 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.730
 from two ears 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.000
 then this part of it is also made so more 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.450
 premium rather than kill with edishen and then 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.519
 there is a cloth binding ki cord and in 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.100
 at the very end we have 3 and a half 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.400
 millimeter jack which is yellowish 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.350
 but in general, as if for sure it's like 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 gilded that's how much he is there 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.549
 gilded not 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.950
 but for people who are music lovers they 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.370
 say yes for malice the best of the best 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.599
 although as a matter of fact, I would not really 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.689
 I understand what the difference is like this 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.510
 gilding there i read so many forums here 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.579
 and go as if battles 50 to 50 thousand 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.799
 half the people say it is essentially 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.379
 half the people are no different 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.040
 they say that yes it is different well who 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:03.370
 right who is to blame canon or nikon here 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.230
 samsung or apple and so on given that 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.950
 It concerns directly with the edishen 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.069
 let's start with the ears, they are exactly the same 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.659
 shapes like piston 3 i.e. standard 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.670
 you can say bonus 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.769
 only they have more plastic and 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.489
 metallic only back 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.920
 circle 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.489
 Here he is quite beautiful as a matter of fact 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.180
 would they 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.560
 if its that way to look closely to 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.489
 directly to the ear, yes of course you can see 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.829
 that piston 3 is cooler than among tires but 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.859
 when so here's an example they were with me 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:39.129
 ears to the no difference in effect 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.709
 virtually no further we have noodles 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.139
 visible laces and such here they are very 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.799
 get confused I will say so in two days 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:50.560
 I just used it with 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.900
 there is a plastic twist 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.919
 box where there are three buttons 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.780
 this is the volume up and down and play pause and 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.650
 also mikrofonchik it is all so enough 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.569
 modestly in the connection of two laces from 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.079
 ears, too, everything is quite modest 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.049
 plastic, that is, nondescript but in essence 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.180
 on practicality it can be hard and 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.970
 not affected given that they have a price in 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.400
 2 times less and directly three 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.209
 millimeter jack and himself this one here 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.240
 part 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.080
 Yes, and this one is hidden, the mechanism itself 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.650
 zapayka who distributes laces that 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.310
 nude pins are not exactly laces she is 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.810
 ordinary 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.550
 that is, it turns out so as if 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.199
 their premiums are lower 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.150
 if we talk about technical 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.190
 characteristics of 2 ears then they are completely 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.979
 identical with them 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.770
 cable length well although I would say that 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.449
 different 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.940
 the spoon feels like equally 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:51.949
 further frequency range 20 kilohertz 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.150
 20-20 resistance 32 ohm 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.300
 sensitivity 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.110
 98 decibels this way is very high and 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:05.690
 5 power output probably less watts 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:09.409
 because it turns out that at 5 mw 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.419
 but also but this is not megawatt for sure it is him 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.610
 that is, they are unlikely to be 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.550
 just 5 watts by the way yes it can be in 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.800
 aggregate 5 watts they are in principle 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.740
 quite loud and now even for the sake of 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:33.020
 of interest check if the track is audible 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:35.860
 the maximum is almost unheard of i hear 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.340
 but let's for so you here 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:47.840
 heard the track and also I connected the piston 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:50.870
 yes so that you can be yes as well 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.210
 very well, I mean that's heard 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.740
 about equally unique 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.530
 a nuance that I would probably like 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.020
 note that piston 3 is somewhere 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:04.370
 5 percent I showed that they are a little 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.380
 a little louder and if of course there is such 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.069
 the nuance is that it all depends on how they are 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.699
 inserted in the ear that is here a little bit 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:13.310
 bass sound 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.990
 although as if a little bit and going wild 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.659
 treble but this is the thing 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.789
 says lovers and plus to everything 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:22.599
 there is an equalizer nobody has canceled it 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:25.460
 is there if you like to listen there 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:27.590
 high quality music before i'm sure 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.009
 surely you need an aqua laser 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.529
 which is still further fine tune 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.270
 some subtleties depending on 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.039
 your needs on this i will 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.219
 I hope to finish my video friends 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:42.710
 it was interesting and useful for you to find out how 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:44.060
 that and other earphones that is one sound 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.909
 same track on the same 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:50.300
 smartphone and in fact it turns out we have 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:52.540
 the conclusion is very simple that is premium 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.090
 design and good sound or 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.620
 normal design and good sound and price 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.320
 almost double 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.450
 the difference if you are interested in these 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.190
 headphones and you don't know where they are 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.590
 purchase this one especially for you 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.660
 picked where the best price and but in principle 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.760
 where I acquired them and that is, I'm 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.220
 don't buy more expensive right i mean i 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.860
 always buy what is profitable and yes 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.320
 principle, that's how it happened 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.290
 so friends follow the link 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.440
 look learn in essence there and 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.760
 technical information so on and on 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.070
 write in comments your impressions 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.290
 headphone sensations how do you feel 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.120
 all learn to piston can be you 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:34.000
 some first generation ri second 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.920
 generations write about it in the comments 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.830
 It will be interesting to know how many fans 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.020
 xiaomi piston headphones and do not forget 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.610
