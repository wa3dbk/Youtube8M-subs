00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Christmas 2014. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 We are in unparalleled days because they bring us 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.000
 announce the coming of the Lord to life with people. 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.800
 When you say the word "Christmas," immediately to them 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 is on the mind: happiness, joy ... 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.200
 Some remain with external signs of happiness: fun, lights ... 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 and we Christians have to pray for all humanity 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.300
 the gift that the Lord has given us by coming and staying with us. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 Not only in personal environments, but also in family, 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.500
 so that each fireplace would be the continuation of a magnificent hearth 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 which, in spite of the poverty and scarcity of resources, was at Christmas Jubilee and Nazareth. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.300
 It is also important that we carry out the ministry that Luke speaks of the Gospel, 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.300
 when he reported that an angel had come to meet pastors, 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.400
 who were conquered - which is understandable - in front of a great story 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.400
 who gave them and they need to warn of the existence of those creatures. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.200
 The angel said to them, "I will announce the extraordinary news. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Christ was born, the Savior. " 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Well, maybe this is happening every day with the Lord, 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
 that he wants to come and stay with us. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.500
 Engaged in people who make up a part of the Christmas atmosphere. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 Jesus, all generous, all devoted, 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.000
 for the Almighty God, the God who has no limitation, 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 without delay, created a small creature by which women and men, 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.900
 in all homes, have confidence in the process and talk. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.000
 It is amazing to see how, by the grace of God, a wider example, 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 - though I ask the Lord if he does not want to remain outside - 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.300
 how it spreads to show birth in many homes. 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.600
 It does not just stay on a decoration or in a single period 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.300
 pointing toward the Lord and nothing more. 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.700
 When you love Him, He responds to that love. 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.000
 And where is the school to be able to love it? 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 In the people who accompany him, in Mary and Joseph. 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.000
 It is an amazing way in which Christ came to the world: in the stables, in the Jaslice. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 And there, without any hesitation, though he lacked all the resources, 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.000
 He had the wealth of Heaven that the Earth can not give. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 That is why Mary and Joseph had a permanent duty 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.000
 give the Lord gratefulness with his behavior, gratitude with his care, 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 responding to what they received. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 They never ceased to admire the gift they received from God at one point. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.500
 Luckily, both in the family and in the family, we are constantly achieving 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.800
 the desire to want to live focused on God and for God. 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.500
 In this way, we all get a lot of benefits, 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.500
 because through the ophod with God we have a better relationship with our colleagues, 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.000
 with our friends and also those we do not know. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.300
 I think this atmosphere of outdoor joy that we have in cities, 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 with many light decorations, the widespread achievement that we carry on that story 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.300
 which represents: that is, that it is not only an external expression, 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.300
 without which there is also a reason for fraternity and fellowship of all people. 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 We need to spend these wonderful days united with all mankind, 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.000
 especially those who, for any reason, suffer: 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 the sick, the poor, and especially the people from the countries 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.400
 in which there is no peace: not even outer peace, for wars and conflicts. 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.500
 It is understandable that we, as sons of God, and who are going to God 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.500
 who sends us to this very merciful way, 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.500
 We also want to follow these prints to get to others. 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.000
 And what you need to get started in your own family. 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.200
 We do not like humanity or other people's places 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.000
 if we do not love in Christ and for Christ all the people in our family. 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.000
 I want Christmas to be a personal celebration, 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 but also the celebration of the family as well as the celebration with all mankind. 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.000
 May God help us to be more faithful every day.
