00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello my name is anastasia 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.629
 Kulikova in this video I will show you how 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.540
 decorate baby hair bandage 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.400
 for work we need 15 squares 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.980
 5 cm wide satin ribbon 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.880
 need to fold a square and in a pile and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.880
 cut petals 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.060
 now with the help of a candle let's shape 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.980
 petals make curly edges yet 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.340
 the tape is heated i she takes any 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.340
 form 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.870
 all 15 petals are made let's proceed to 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.110
 the decoration of the foundations on the circle of felt 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.090
 3 and a half centimeters in diameter 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.150
 glue around the lace making folds 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.310
 lace width 5 centimeters to me 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.790
 it took about 20 centimeters 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.790
 lace 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.480
 the base is ready to start sticking 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.080
 satin ribbon petals first layer 9 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.280
 petals 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.280
 and in the second six and 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.900
 not 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.080
 after all 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.080
 and 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.670
 I decorated the center with a flat rose from 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.860
 tape length 5 centimeters 75 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.490
 centimeters just roll the ribbon 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.690
 half and twist it into a rose 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.700
 periodically sizing hot 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.700
 silicone glue from the gun 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.770
 cut the stem of the rose and glue it 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.770
 in the center of the flower 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:33.400
 You can also decorate the flower rhinestones 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.400
 glue them with polymer glue 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.029
 now we glue our flower but I donâ€™t 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.129
 I advise you to apply glue as it is 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:50.499
 I'm doing now as glue can 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.319
 leak through the holes on the grid and burn 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:57.210
 you better put glue on the flower and 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.210
 then stick it on the base 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.860
 with such a flower decorated our 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.899
 baby hair bandage 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.300
