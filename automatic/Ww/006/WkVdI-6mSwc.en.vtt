00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.850
 This time we will talk about the video shoot 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.600
 It is the day I took a lot 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.789
 It is not transmitted at all the pleasure that you reconsider later 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:27.170
 There is no such thing 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:34.430
 There are some tips on how to burn the excitement of that time on the film 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:36.660
 In this seminar, we will give tips and tips on how to take fun and lively video works. 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.890
 I will go 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.360
 How is this picture 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:49.540
 The camera is waiting for movement 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:55.670
 Especially on the road, I tend to shake the camera to take what I saw from the end 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:01:03.000
 It treats the camera in the same way as it looks with the naked eye 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:05.720
 At that time the photographer has ended up with hard in the forward what they are watching 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.590
 What is important when taking a video 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:14.590
 It is to think about the person who sees this picture later and take it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.300
 So how do you get a better view? 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.780
 Can you take pictures that people can see 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.030
 Let's look at the tips for that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.230
 Please look at this video 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.280
 I'm inclined a little 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.280
 There is a camera shake 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:39.950
 This video is stable 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:43.940
 Unstable video makes people feel uneasy 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.190
 Let's take it without camera shake and tilt 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.950
 N video camera of sony 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.100
 For handy cam 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:58.350
 It has anti-shake function to seg 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.810
 Fix that of fixed screen does not move the camera in the video 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.909
 Or say a fixed shot 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:12.460
 Fix accounts for over 60% of video works 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:19.270
 The stability of the screen is very important as the camera is stationary 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:23.069
 First, let's look at how to hold the camera so that you can take a stable fixed image 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:28.319
 Usually hand-held photography will be the center 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:32.680
 We will talk about the tips for taking a stable picture with your hand 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:37.260
 At first we spread foot to shoulder width 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.260
 Let's tighten the elbow and the reason firmly 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.770
 Next is how to hold the camera 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.620
 Pass the hand through the grip belt 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.620
 I want you to tighten the belt while supporting the camera in a flock 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.400
 Fit my hand 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:07.530
 Let's use properly using the LCD monitor in the surrounding situation 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:12.960
 This picture is taken in the Middle Eastern style, trying to match eyes 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:16.820
 With this, I feel tired and the tremor of my leg is transmitted to the camera 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.820
 It will be easier if you hold it around your waist 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.659
 Stable you and if take by leaning if there is a wall and trees 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.590
 It will be stable even if you put your elbow on the handrail etc. 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.680
 It becomes stable even if placed on a chair or bench 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:46.880
 Use your surroundings to stabilize your body when shooting 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:49.980
 The best way to stabilize your name is to use a tripod 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.980
 Majestic nature views and 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:59.080
 When you want to take a panoramic view of the city 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:02.680
 Also still tripod will want when you want to take a longer and events 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.920
 But travel with a lot of luggage 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.550
 Sometimes I can not hold a tripod 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.130
 At that time 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:16.639
 It has a tripod function that you can shoot easily for a long time with easy grip style 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.459
 There is also a product called shooting grip 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:24.820
 A trip with great family and friends 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.260
 Not only to pick up the opponent but also myself 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.260
 It is also useful to take in such a case
