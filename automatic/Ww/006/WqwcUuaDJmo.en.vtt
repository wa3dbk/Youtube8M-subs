00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
everything and you know taking a big

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.420 
everything and you know taking a big
injury<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.990> this<00:04:29.230> I<00:04:29.470> think<00:04:29.770> for<00:04:30.100> sure<00:04:30.130> that

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
injury like this I think for sure that

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.460 
injury like this I think for sure that
he<00:04:30.580> can<00:04:30.760> get<00:04:30.880> back<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.240> where<00:04:31.390> he<00:04:31.480> was<00:04:31.510> but<00:04:32.110> you

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
he can get back to where he was but you

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.870 
he can get back to where he was but you
know<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.590> just<00:04:32.860> hope<00:04:33.010> that<00:04:33.070> he<00:04:33.250> wants<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:33.640> enough

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
know I just hope that he wants it enough

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.220 
know I just hope that he wants it enough
because<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.360> know<00:04:34.450> things<00:04:34.660> like<00:04:34.750> that<00:04:34.900> it's

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
because you know things like that it's

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.960 
because you know things like that it's
gonna<00:04:35.320> take<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.710> lot<00:04:35.860> of<00:04:35.890> time<00:04:36.130> but<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.460> think<00:04:36.490> BK

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
gonna take a lot of time but I think BK

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.580 
gonna take a lot of time but I think BK
is<00:04:37.030> strong<00:04:37.300> enough<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:38.170> know<00:04:38.200> make<00:04:38.470> the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
is strong enough to you know make the

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.440 
is strong enough to you know make the
full<00:04:38.800> recovery<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.340> get<00:04:39.460> back<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:39.790> where<00:04:39.970> you
