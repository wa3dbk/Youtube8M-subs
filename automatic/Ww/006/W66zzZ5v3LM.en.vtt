competition cams what I had as far as a
setup<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> non<00:01:00.750> p<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> block<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.530> P<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
setup I have a non p I block with P I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.359 
setup I have a non p I block with P I
heads<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:03.539> motor<00:01:03.799> will<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> non<00:01:05.159> p<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
heads on the motor will have a non p I

heads on the motor will have a non p I
so<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> non<00:01:06.090> p<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> block<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.720> P<00:01:06.869> I

so you can have a non p I block with P I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.770 
so you can have a non p I block with P I
heads<00:01:07.250> it's<00:01:08.250> been<00:01:08.400> bored<00:01:08.640> 20<00:01:08.970> /<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.659> got

like you have a real radical camera and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.480 
like you have a real radical camera and
it's<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> super<00:01:33.420> radical<00:01:33.750> camp<00:01:34.170> um<00:01:34.490> but

ID<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.820> funny<00:01:45.119> from<00:01:45.390> what<00:01:45.570> I've<00:01:45.689> been

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
ID a little funny from what I've been

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.530 
ID a little funny from what I've been
told<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.890> I've<00:01:47.280> also<00:01:47.610> comp<00:01:47.909> cams<00:01:48.149> told<00:01:48.450> me<00:01:48.509> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
told but I've also comp cams told me I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.880 
told but I've also comp cams told me I
definitely<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> tune<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> computer

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
definitely have to tune the computer

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.490 
definitely have to tune the computer
with<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.130> even<00:01:50.250> though<00:01:50.420> their<00:01:51.420> website<00:01:52.290> says

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
with it even though their website says

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.960 
with it even though their website says
you<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.220> turn<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> computer<00:01:53.759> with

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you don't have to turn the computer with

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.160 
you don't have to turn the computer with
the<00:01:54.000> cams<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.689> they<00:01:54.780> did<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.079> much

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the cams but because they did so much

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
the cams but because they did so much
else<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.920> tell<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> computer

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
else to it I have to tell the computer

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.810 
else to it I have to tell the computer
yes<00:01:57.860> what<00:01:58.860> I've<00:01:58.979> done<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.549> need<00:01:59.759> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
yes what I've done to it so I need to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700 
yes what I've done to it so I need to
figure<00:01:59.969> out<00:02:00.090> some<00:02:00.360> tuning<00:02:00.630> software<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
figure out some tuning software and a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.709 
figure out some tuning software and a
computer<00:02:02.119> you<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.299> don't<00:02:03.360> need<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> have

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
computer you know I don't need to have

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.190 
computer you know I don't need to have
somebody<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.229> I've<00:02:04.920> been

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
somebody do it I've been

you know these pluses and minuses of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.100 
you know these pluses and minuses of
either<00:02:08.300> doing<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.570> yourself<00:02:08.630> or<00:02:08.960> having

either doing it yourself or having
somebody<00:02:09.380> do<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:10.280> don't<00:02:10.729> have<00:02:10.820> a

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
somebody do it I don't have a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.580 
somebody do it I don't have a
dynamometer<00:02:11.240> but<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.660> do<00:02:11.840> have<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.290> lot<00:02:12.560> of

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
dynamometer but I do have a lot of

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.140 
dynamometer but I do have a lot of
computer<00:02:13.040> experience<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.730> doesn't

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
computer experience so that doesn't

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150 
computer experience so that doesn't
scare<00:02:14.360> me<00:02:14.420> at<00:02:14.540> all<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.050> if<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.770> screw<00:02:15.980> up<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
scare me at all and if I screw up the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.470 
scare me at all and if I screw up the
computer<00:02:16.580> there<00:02:16.700> are<00:02:16.820> tons<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.120> these<00:02:17.240> trucks

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
computer there are tons of these trucks

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.610 
computer there are tons of these trucks
around<00:02:17.630> I'll<00:02:17.930> just<00:02:18.050> go<00:02:18.200> grab<00:02:18.350> another

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
around I'll just go grab another

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.480 
around I'll just go grab another
computer<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.170> know<00:02:21.920> not<00:02:22.130> too<00:02:22.310> concerned

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
computer so you know not too concerned

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.160 
computer so you know not too concerned
about<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:23.510> I'm<00:02:23.600> play<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.870> I'm<00:02:23.959> going<00:02:24.080> to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
about it but I'm play that I'm going to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.449 
about it but I'm play that I'm going to
get<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:24.410> registered<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.980> week<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.370> what

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
get it registered this week and what

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.150 
get it registered this week and what
have<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:26.140> runs<00:02:27.140> good<00:02:27.320> at<00:02:27.440> about<00:02:27.590> 1,200<00:02:27.890> rpm

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
have you runs good at about 1,200 rpm

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.350 
have you runs good at about 1,200 rpm
sounds<00:02:29.120> nice<00:02:29.410> exhaust<00:02:30.410> sounds<00:02:30.680> pretty<00:02:30.860> good

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
sounds nice exhaust sounds pretty good

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.520 
sounds nice exhaust sounds pretty good
still<00:02:32.360> stalls<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.840> little<00:02:33.080> bit<00:02:33.170> here<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.470> there

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
still stalls a little bit here and there

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.930 
still stalls a little bit here and there
but<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.800> think<00:02:34.010> that's<00:02:34.160> because<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.490> computer

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
but I think that's because the computer

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.940 
but I think that's because the computer
is<00:02:35.030> not<00:02:35.450> smart<00:02:36.110> enough<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.350> realize<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.860> I

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
is not smart enough to realize that I

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.500 
is not smart enough to realize that I
changed<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.430> whole<00:02:37.459> bunch<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.880> thing<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.330> have

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
changed a whole bunch of thing so I have

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.810 
changed a whole bunch of thing so I have
to<00:02:38.660> go<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:38.900> actually<00:02:39.020> tell<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.610> other<00:02:40.610> than

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
to go and actually tell it other than

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.490 
to go and actually tell it other than
that<00:02:41.000> we're<00:02:41.209> good<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.660> got<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.110> do<00:02:42.200> some<00:02:42.350> body

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
that we're good I got to do some body

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.620 
that we're good I got to do some body
work<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.070> but<00:02:43.250> she's<00:02:44.030> good<00:02:44.239> for<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.480> moment

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
work on it but she's good for the moment

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.300 
work on it but she's good for the moment
i'll<00:02:45.260> show<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.590> action<00:02:45.800> as<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:45.980> can<00:02:46.100> show<00:02:46.250> you

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
i'll show you action as you can show you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.590 
i'll show you action as you can show you
my<00:02:46.459> differential<00:02:46.850> cover<00:02:47.090> too<00:02:47.360> because<00:02:47.540> I

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
my differential cover too because I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.040 
my differential cover too because I
replaced<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:50.360> know<00:02:50.450> we're<00:02:50.690> pretty

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
replaced that so you know we're pretty

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.770 
replaced that so you know we're pretty
good<00:02:51.260> shape<00:02:51.470> for<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.770> moment<00:02:52.030> see<00:02:53.030> my<00:02:53.180> shiny

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
good shape for the moment see my shiny

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.229 
good shape for the moment see my shiny
new<00:02:53.900> differential<00:02:54.560> cover<00:02:54.709> on<00:02:54.950> there<00:02:55.160> which<00:02:56.120> I

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
new differential cover on there which I

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.699 
new differential cover on there which I
didn't<00:02:56.480> have<00:02:56.630> when<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> made<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.050> differential

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
didn't have when I made the differential

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.120 
didn't have when I made the differential
oil<00:02:57.920> change<00:02:58.610> video<00:02:59.320> so<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:00.350> went<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.890> changed

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
oil change video so I went and changed

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.710 
oil change video so I went and changed
that<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.459> let<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.820> glue<00:03:01.970> set<00:03:02.030> on<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.450> and

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
that and let the glue set on it and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.180 
that and let the glue set on it and
filled<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.230> all<00:03:03.320> up<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.470> now<00:03:09.620> really<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.040> just

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
filled it all up so now really it's just

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.800 
filled it all up so now really it's just
a<00:03:10.340> hit<00:03:10.489> or<00:03:10.640> inspected<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.269> aligned<00:03:11.570> and

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
a hit or inspected and aligned and

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.690 
a hit or inspected and aligned and
registered<00:03:12.380> insured<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:13.040> all<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.549> good

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
registered insured and all that good

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.130 
registered insured and all that good
happy<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:15.470> know<00:03:15.620> horse<00:03:16.220> crap<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.810> then
