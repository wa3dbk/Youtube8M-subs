00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
see if it's hot enough I just get a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.100 
see if it's hot enough I just get a
piece<00:00:59.120> of<00:00:59.300> cheese<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:01.540> it'll<00:01:02.540> start<00:01:02.780> doing

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
piece of cheese and it'll start doing

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.790 
piece of cheese and it'll start doing
that<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:04.509> melting<00:01:05.509> straightaway<00:01:06.110> which<00:01:06.440> is<00:01:06.590> a

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
that and melting straightaway which is a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.190 
that and melting straightaway which is a
good<00:01:07.070> temperature<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.000> I'll<00:01:08.660> put<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:08.960> cheese

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
good temperature so I'll put the cheese

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.679 
good temperature so I'll put the cheese
on

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.200 

now<00:01:17.229> we'll<00:01:17.560> start<00:01:17.829> to<00:01:17.979> smoke<00:01:18.340> up<00:01:18.579> quite<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:18.939> bit

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
now we'll start to smoke up quite a bit

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.200 
now we'll start to smoke up quite a bit
but<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.979> guys<00:01:21.159> are<00:01:21.399> probably<00:01:21.520> used<00:01:21.909> to<00:01:22.000> that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
but you guys are probably used to that

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.719 
but you guys are probably used to that
now<00:01:23.020> you'll<00:01:23.200> notice<00:01:23.469> all<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.799> fat<00:01:24.130> coming<00:01:24.549> out

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
now you'll notice all the fat coming out

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.450 
now you'll notice all the fat coming out
of<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:24.970> -<00:01:25.450> starts<00:01:25.869> contain<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.200> lot<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.560> fat<00:01:27.009> so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
of it - starts contain a lot of fat so

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.580 
of it - starts contain a lot of fat so
it's<00:01:28.000> actually<00:01:28.270> quite<00:01:29.079> healthy

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
it's actually quite healthy

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.419 
it's actually quite healthy
I<00:01:29.799> guess<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:32.259> you'll<00:01:32.439> probably<00:01:32.590> need<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.920> sharp

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
I guess now you'll probably need a sharp

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.240 
I guess now you'll probably need a sharp
knife<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:34.030> turn<00:01:34.270> these<00:01:34.539> things<00:01:35.039> so<00:01:36.039> what<00:01:36.220> I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
knife to turn these things so what I

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.200 
knife to turn these things so what I
like<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.549> do<00:01:36.789> is<00:01:36.939> get<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.240> knife<00:01:37.420> under<00:01:39.210> once

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
like to do is get the knife under once

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.910 
like to do is get the knife under once
it<00:01:40.390> starts<00:01:40.659> bubbling<00:01:40.899> all<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.380> way<00:01:41.530> through

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
it starts bubbling all the way through

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.710 
it starts bubbling all the way through
and<00:01:45.090> try<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.210> flip<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:46.600> over<00:01:48.420> might<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.569> to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
and try and flip that over might have to

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.290 
and try and flip that over might have to
use<00:01:49.869> your<00:01:50.080> fingers

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300
