because<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> mobility<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.880> get

because of the mobility they can get

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760 
because of the mobility they can get
down<00:01:33.240> into<00:01:33.390> mineral<00:01:33.780> lines<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.350> much<00:01:34.500> quicker

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
down into mineral lines so much quicker

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.550 
down into mineral lines so much quicker
um<00:01:35.390> likewise<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.420> Zerg<00:01:36.810> player<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.409> him

safe about again the fact that the map

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.010 
safe about again the fact that the map
is<00:01:46.189> fairly<00:01:47.189> large<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:48.180> notice<00:01:48.600> we've<00:01:48.780> got<00:01:48.899> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
will be in a good position to kind of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.760 
will be in a good position to kind of
duck<00:02:03.240> down<00:02:03.420> check<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.350> then<00:02:04.469> head<00:02:04.740> back

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
duck down check this and then head back

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.029 
duck down check this and then head back
up<00:02:05.280> um<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.570> why<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.200> over<00:02:07.469> here<00:02:07.500> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
up um like why is this one over here you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.859 
up um like why is this one over here you
see<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.399> actually<00:02:08.700> keeping<00:02:09.030> an<00:02:09.179> eye<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
see it's actually keeping an eye on the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.869 
see it's actually keeping an eye on the
area<00:02:10.200> down<00:02:10.500> below<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:11.370> pretty<00:02:11.580> much<00:02:11.760> just

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
area down below it's pretty much just

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.100 
area down below it's pretty much just
checking<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.300> make<00:02:12.390> sure<00:02:12.510> there's<00:02:12.870> not<00:02:12.959> going

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
checking to make sure there's not going

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.650 
checking to make sure there's not going
to<00:02:13.170> be<00:02:13.230> SC

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
to be SC

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.720 
to be SC
coming<00:02:14.080> with<00:02:14.170> Marines<00:02:14.500> for<00:02:15.070> early<00:02:15.430> pressure

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
coming with Marines for early pressure

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.790 
coming with Marines for early pressure
on<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.240> hatchery<00:02:16.750> now<00:02:17.140> down<00:02:17.410> here<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.740> the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
on the hatchery now down here in the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.290 
on the hatchery now down here in the
base<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.190> see<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.550> spawning<00:02:18.790> pool<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.240> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
base we see the spawning pool and the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.450 
base we see the spawning pool and the
gas<00:02:19.450> have<00:02:19.750> gone<00:02:19.990> down<00:02:20.290> very<00:02:20.500> likely<00:02:21.130> we're

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
gas have gone down very likely we're

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.370 
gas have gone down very likely we're
going<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.000> metabolic<00:02:22.360> boost<00:02:22.840> again

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
going to have that metabolic boost again

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.250 
going to have that metabolic boost again
as<00:02:23.620> with<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.890> Hellions<00:02:24.340> having<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.850> speed

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
as with the Hellions having that speed

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.440 
as with the Hellions having that speed
that<00:02:26.260> speed<00:02:26.650> advantage<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.940> early<00:02:28.240> game

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
that speed advantage in the early game

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.840 
that speed advantage in the early game
likewise<00:02:29.140> zerglings<00:02:29.950> with<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.520> speed

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
likewise zerglings with that speed

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.700 
likewise zerglings with that speed
really<00:02:31.300> helped<00:02:31.570> kind<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.840> counter<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.470> and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
really helped kind of counter that and

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.500 
really helped kind of counter that and
obviously<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.760> don't<00:02:34.030> want<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.270> throw<00:02:34.420> a

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
obviously you don't want to throw a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.670 
obviously you don't want to throw a
whole<00:02:34.660> bunch<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.960> zerglings<00:02:35.140> at<00:02:35.500> some

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
whole bunch of zerglings at some

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.800 
whole bunch of zerglings at some
hellions<00:02:36.040> but<00:02:36.250> still<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:37.210> know<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.390> can

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
hellions but still you know you can

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.240 
hellions but still you know you can
actually<00:02:38.140> get<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.260> good<00:02:38.320> surround<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.070> take

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
actually get a good surround and take

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.440 
actually get a good surround and take
him<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.640> way<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.940> really<00:02:40.210> all<00:02:40.420> comes

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
him out that way so it really all comes

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.660 
him out that way so it really all comes
down<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.080> positioning<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.160> very

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
down to the positioning so very

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.610 
down to the positioning so very
interesting<00:02:42.880> play<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.570> dde<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.110> going<00:02:44.410> here

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
interesting play the dde is going here

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.470 
interesting play the dde is going here
that<00:02:45.040> Hellion<00:02:45.400> opener<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:45.940> I'm<00:02:46.240> really

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
that Hellion opener and I'm really

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.180 
that Hellion opener and I'm really
looking<00:02:46.750> forward<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:47.140> seeing<00:02:47.410> how<00:02:47.710> he<00:02:47.740> goes

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
looking forward to seeing how he goes

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.460 
looking forward to seeing how he goes
about<00:02:48.220> his<00:02:48.910> transition<00:02:49.420> notice<00:02:50.170> how<00:02:50.290> he's

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
about his transition notice how he's

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.410 
about his transition notice how he's
still<00:02:50.800> mining<00:02:51.160> gas<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.640> he<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.910> gonna<00:02:52.090> be<00:02:52.210> going

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
still mining gas so he is gonna be going

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.910 
still mining gas so he is gonna be going
for<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:52.600> quicker<00:02:52.930> transition<00:02:53.530> actually

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
for a quicker transition actually

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.580 
for a quicker transition actually
claiming<00:02:54.460> his<00:02:54.700> second<00:02:55.150> geyser<00:02:55.390> as<00:02:55.720> well<00:02:55.960> so<00:02:56.410> he

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
claiming his second geyser as well so he

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.900 
claiming his second geyser as well so he
is<00:02:56.710> definitely<00:02:56.980> going<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.370> be<00:02:57.430> looking<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.820> get

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
is definitely going to be looking to get

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.450 
is definitely going to be looking to get
a<00:02:57.970> lot<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.390> gas<00:02:58.780> very<00:02:59.290> quickly<00:02:59.620> as<00:02:59.890> well<00:03:00.280> as<00:03:00.430> a

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
a lot of gas very quickly as well as a

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.870 
a lot of gas very quickly as well as a
reactor<00:03:01.000> on<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.390> barracks<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:03.520> expect

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
reactor on the barracks so I can expect

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.420 
reactor on the barracks so I can expect
a<00:03:04.030> lot<00:03:04.240> of<00:03:04.390> pressure<00:03:04.630> here<00:03:04.960> from<00:03:05.070> from<00:03:06.070> dee<00:03:06.280> dee

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
a lot of pressure here from from dee dee

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.670 
a lot of pressure here from from dee dee
crazy<00:03:07.000> moving<00:03:07.570> on<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.750> other<00:03:07.870> hand<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.440> see

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
crazy moving on the other hand you see

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.740 
crazy moving on the other hand you see
he<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.010> currently<00:03:09.340> sitting<00:03:09.820> on<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:10.480> enough

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
he is currently sitting on just enough

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.420 
he is currently sitting on just enough
gas<00:03:10.780> get<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.320> metabolic<00:03:11.560> boost<00:03:11.920> as<00:03:12.130> he<00:03:12.250> had

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
gas get that metabolic boost as he had

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.400 
gas get that metabolic boost as he had
started<00:03:12.880> that<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.000> moment<00:03:13.390> or<00:03:13.420> two<00:03:13.480> ago<00:03:13.930> has

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
started that a moment or two ago has

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.670 
started that a moment or two ago has
ceased<00:03:15.000> acquisition<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.170> vespene<00:03:17.170> gas<00:03:17.170> and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
ceased acquisition of vespene gas and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.980 
ceased acquisition of vespene gas and
has<00:03:17.800> since<00:03:18.100> continued<00:03:18.790> mining<00:03:19.480> down<00:03:19.660> here<00:03:19.870> at

has since continued mining down here at
the<00:03:20.110> natural<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:20.980> he<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.370> definitely<00:03:21.610> planning

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090
