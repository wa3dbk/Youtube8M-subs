is it's pretty thick which is perfect
for<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> beginner<00:01:00.780> because<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.620> really

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
for a beginner because it's really

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.130 
for a beginner because it's really
buoyant<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.340> easy<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.300> catch<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.780> wave<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
buoyant and easy to catch a wave and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.580 
buoyant and easy to catch a wave and
stay<00:01:04.320> afloat

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.430 

the<00:01:10.920> first<00:01:11.240> pro-pro<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.510> comes<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.930> mind<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
the first pro-pro that comes to mind is

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.399 
the first pro-pro that comes to mind is
that<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.280> extremely<00:01:14.549> cheap<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.570> only<00:01:15.780> $100

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that it's extremely cheap it's only $100

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.380 
that it's extremely cheap it's only $100
so<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> decide<00:01:17.369> surfing<00:01:17.850> isn't<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.299> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
so if you decide surfing isn't for you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.280 
so if you decide surfing isn't for you
you<00:01:18.630> haven't<00:01:19.200> wasted<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.860> $300<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.290> hard

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you haven't wasted like $300 on a hard

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.980 
you haven't wasted like $300 on a hard
surface<00:01:25.700> film<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> hit<00:01:27.630> your<00:01:27.750> head

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
surface film so if you hit your head

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
surface film so if you hit your head
you're<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.590> gonna<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.130> knocked<00:01:29.340> out<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
you're not gonna get knocked out and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.719 
you're not gonna get knocked out and
drown<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> water<00:01:33.799> another<00:01:34.799> plus<00:01:35.190> is<00:01:35.430> that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
drown in the water another plus is that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.550 
drown in the water another plus is that
if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> drop<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> bust

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
if you drop it it's not going to bust

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:48.680 
if you drop it it's not going to bust
like<00:01:37.799> your<00:01:38.490> good<00:01:38.729> old<00:01:38.880> epoxy<00:01:39.780> board

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.450 

the<00:01:49.690> only<00:01:49.870> cons<00:01:50.290> that<00:01:50.530> I<00:01:50.620> can<00:01:50.830> think<00:01:51.010> of<00:01:51.250> is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
the only cons that I can think of is

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
the only cons that I can think of is
that<00:01:51.490> I've<00:01:52.360> heard<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:53.110> someone's<00:01:53.830> wave<00:01:54.040> storm

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
that I've heard of someone's wave storm

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.880 
that I've heard of someone's wave storm
delaminating<00:01:55.480> because<00:01:56.200> he<00:01:56.320> left<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.680> out<00:01:56.800> in

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
delaminating because he left it out in

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.040 
delaminating because he left it out in
the<00:01:57.010> Sun<00:01:57.510> bottom<00:01:58.510> up<00:01:58.800> so<00:01:59.800> to<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:01.180> Stewart<00:02:01.660> to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
the Sun bottom up so to to Stewart to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.780 
the Sun bottom up so to to Stewart to
steer<00:02:02.380> clear<00:02:02.620> from<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.310> would<00:02:03.400> recommend

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
steer clear from that I would recommend

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.360 
steer clear from that I would recommend
just<00:02:03.970> keeping<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.600> foam<00:02:04.810> side<00:02:05.110> up<00:02:05.290> or<00:02:06.010> just

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
just keeping the foam side up or just

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.249 
just keeping the foam side up or just
avoid<00:02:06.820> putting<00:02:07.150> out<00:02:07.360> in<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.570> Sun<00:02:07.780> for<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.050> long

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
avoid putting out in the Sun for a long

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.990 
avoid putting out in the Sun for a long
time<00:02:09.300> also<00:02:10.300> since<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.440> foam<00:02:11.820> when<00:02:12.820> you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
time also since it is foam when you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.120 
time also since it is foam when you
strap<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.510> on<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.140> roof<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.500> your<00:02:14.590> car<00:02:14.860> and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
strap it on to the roof of your car and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.190 
strap it on to the roof of your car and
you<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.580> your<00:02:15.820> cable<00:02:16.209> straps<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.810> might<00:02:16.990> make

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you have your cable straps I might make

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.350 
you have your cable straps I might make
little<00:02:17.470> indentations<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.760> doesn't

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
little indentations but it doesn't

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.590 
little indentations but it doesn't
affect<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.900> floatation<00:02:20.530> or<00:02:20.680> anything<00:02:21.600> also

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
affect the floatation or anything also

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
affect the floatation or anything also
because<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.410> foam<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.180> could<00:02:25.180> rip<00:02:25.510> wear<00:02:26.440> like

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
because it's foam it could rip wear like

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.350 
because it's foam it could rip wear like
an<00:02:26.739> epoxy<00:02:27.040> board<00:02:27.430> will<00:02:27.580> just<00:02:27.790> scratch<00:02:28.120> or

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
an epoxy board will just scratch or

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.750 
an epoxy board will just scratch or
something<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.870> could<00:02:29.080> puncture<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.430> just

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
something you could puncture it so just

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.400 
something you could puncture it so just
be<00:02:31.090> careful<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.570> doesn't<00:02:31.660> slam<00:02:32.080> into<00:02:32.230> any

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
be careful it doesn't slam into any

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.500 
be careful it doesn't slam into any
rocks<00:02:32.709> or<00:02:32.890> anything<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.760> conclusion<00:02:34.030> you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
rocks or anything so in conclusion you

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.590 
rocks or anything so in conclusion you
should<00:02:34.600> definitely<00:02:35.380> not<00:02:35.590> by<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.890> way<00:02:36.130> storm

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
should definitely not by the way storm

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.760 
should definitely not by the way storm
just<00:02:37.600> kidding<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.080> would<00:02:38.200> highly<00:02:38.739> recommend

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
just kidding I would highly recommend

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.220 
just kidding I would highly recommend
