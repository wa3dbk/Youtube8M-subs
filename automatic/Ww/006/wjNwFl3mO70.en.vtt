 hi friends here mistakes once again and 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.560
 in barinas to this short video where I'm going 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.020
 to explain one thing they have asked 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.550
 many people and that is how to change the color 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.380
 of the physics 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.730
 watching here right now and how to change 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.339
 the color of lightning also good 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.440
 by default we the weapon the 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.850
 we will have in blue vale 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.310
 and good what we have to do is 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.190
 pressing the c key comes by default this 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.040
 key and come to this button here 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.180
 going to player model vale we give you now 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.100
 we want to change the character that 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.030
 we want to see you here we have some 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.720
 how many people that we can 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.059
 download and good then in this tab 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.460
 from here that puts colors worth here 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.340
 you can change the color of the player as 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.720
 here 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.900
 and here in short a color is the weapon of 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.300
 physical physics for example I'm going to put it 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.080
 black that happens that has not changed me 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.430
 what has to happen I have to commit suicide 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.130
 once I kill myself I'm already seeing 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.880
 that I have changed color black and the 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.010
 Thunderbolt 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.240
 the ray of transparent because it does not have 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.950
 black color 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.830
 let's try another one let's put by 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.540
 white example 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.740
 if you do not know how to kill us here 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.000
 a video link of how to commit suicide 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.430
 it's very easy that he explained it very well 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.680
 I'm seeing that for the ray also 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.590
 blank the color of the beam changes 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.600
 also with the color of facebook and 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.190
 well that's all it was very easy 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.510
 He asked a lot of people and he knows very well 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.450
 how to explain where this button was 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.140
 Well then there you have it because what 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.720
 see more from outside we go for a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.680
 camera for example 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.680
 so you can see it here and the color 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.260
 let's get in front of the camera 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.369
 it is very easy to have to press the key 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.990
 come to player model to give and here 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.420
 in model today you would be the character 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.219
 you want and here in color is the color 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.499
 of the character's post and the color of the 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.289
 physical 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.140
 so see you next video of 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.710
 see you later 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.710
 s 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.230
 the position is so simple
