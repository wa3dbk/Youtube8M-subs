00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
this in the Georgia game that I think

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.129 
this in the Georgia game that I think
the<00:05:39.139> preseason<00:05:39.620> polls<00:05:40.130> are<00:05:40.490> are<00:05:41.419> not<00:05:41.660> good<00:05:41.960> for

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
the preseason polls are are not good for

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
should be an initial poll in college

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.670 
should be an initial poll in college
football<00:05:45.889> until<00:05:46.849> the<00:05:46.970> first<00:05:47.210> week<00:05:47.360> of<00:05:47.479> October
