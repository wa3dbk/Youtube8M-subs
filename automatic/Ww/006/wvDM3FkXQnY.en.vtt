around to making videos on them I had a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750 
around to making videos on them I had a

never got around to reviewing the ones
that<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> had<00:00:45.420> purchased<00:00:45.660> myself<00:00:46.460> gubbeen<00:00:47.460> so

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that I had purchased myself gubbeen so

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.090 
that I had purchased myself gubbeen so
by<00:00:48.510> popular<00:00:48.989> demand<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> probably<00:00:49.710> one

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
by popular demand this is probably one

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.299 
by popular demand this is probably one
of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.370> most<00:00:50.550> requested<00:00:51.530> videos<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:52.829> pairs<00:00:53.100> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
of the most requested videos or pairs of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.119 
of the most requested videos or pairs of
headphones<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:55.050> received<00:00:55.289> anyway

headphones that I have received anyway

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.240 
headphones that I have received anyway
so<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.730> figured<00:00:57.390> mine<00:00:57.660> broke<00:00:58.079> through<00:00:58.920> no<00:00:59.219> fault

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
so I figured mine broke through no fault

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.920 
so I figured mine broke through no fault
of<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> headphones<00:00:59.879> actually<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.690> just

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
of the headphones actually it was just

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.910 
of the headphones actually it was just
my<00:01:01.079> wanton<00:01:01.879> misuse<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.910> them<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.449> broke<00:01:04.379> him<00:01:04.589> I'm

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
my wanton misuse of them I broke him I'm

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
my wanton misuse of them I broke him I'm
fully<00:01:05.430> admit<00:01:05.820> he'd<00:01:06.150> had<00:01:06.330> nothing<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.840> with

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
fully admit he'd had nothing to do with

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.929 
fully admit he'd had nothing to do with
the<00:01:06.990> build<00:01:07.200> quality<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.710> headphones<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.340> just
