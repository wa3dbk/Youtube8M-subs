00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.209
 convenient 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.400
 it started well 1 will be a victory 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:12.490
 quite easy anyway while at 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.450
 master level and is confident she and 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.850
 she is fit 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.720
 serena yes I am confident at the base 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.040
 it was important to win this first 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.840
 match it's always important wins the 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.460
 first match especially that it was there 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.630
 a little tension 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.940
 his last match against kerber date and 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.810
 this summer and that's the case it's the only one 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.280
 match that lost this summer 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.050
 the lure of jaw gain and s was 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.940
 constraint so there was a real 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.750
 revenge to take and that was the 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.460
 first time to play it so 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.010
 had never beaten seven young and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.909
 then it's never easy to 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.899
 go back a turn and then it's a 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.550
 turning there are not too many turns of 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.280
 not heat what is the best 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.539
 so strong right now we do not have 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.370
 does a great game but I think 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.409
 kerber either it was not obvious 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.940
 because his opponent missed a lot 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.620
 right from the start so it's a false rhythm 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.819
 so she serena is a little bit of trouble 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.799
 put in and then for a moment that 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:55.210
 essential moment in the first set 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.920
 she knew the knew go over to 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.749
 dropped his shots and then it was 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.059
 it was good it feels easier it is 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.370
 a new serena williams they 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.770
 win everything and who can stop it on 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.909
 can stop it or finally stop it is 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.590
 not in the commons because I had to 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.820
 deliver this woman and her beautiful and 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.530
 impressive really impressive 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.240
 yes the impressive since since this 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.039
 summer I went to 13 antennas and especially 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.299
 since then I was given it at the margins 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.159
 do not go exceptionally well but 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.420
 then really his game really 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.240
 put back in place because 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.109
 obviously icy snow here 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.390
 someone is going to be a day of oneself are 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.920
 the series by definition it's going a whole 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.850
 day we will try to make sure 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.049
 that they are later possible but 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.420
 it is true that she is playing very very 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.039
 good tennis and is since since 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.060
 wimbledon is undoubtedly the 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.500
 best player in the world 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.390
 but even the best time wasters 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.590
 time do we will do everything to 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.539
 this is the latest possible and is this 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.939
 that you are what you armed him in question 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.240
 on the contrary or that on the contrary that 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.170
 brave and it's positive or 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.729
 there's not interested in the challenge 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.469
 question because she does the job 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.899
 she's motivated she trains well 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.549
 every day she wants to move on it's 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.570
 outstanding at his age after winning 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.770
 so much time at two grand slam 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.579
 after having a career also after 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.319
 to have such an exceptional career 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.850
 since it is by far the most 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.069
 great champion to the activity of having 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.619
 as much hungry yet I think that's it 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.170
 that 's the key too so there is 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.750
 earlier there is no there is no 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.190
 to question there is more to 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.180
 continue to implement everything 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.010
 the days for that motivation 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.520
 endures since it is the key for her 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.560
 for 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.300
 or that she plays her best tennis but 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.300
 superman bad luck population placed
