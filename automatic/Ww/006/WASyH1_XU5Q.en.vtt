access to those hole saws a simple thing
you<00:02:07.789> can<00:02:08.000> do<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.390> drill<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.869> pilot<00:02:08.899> hole<00:02:09.289> and

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
you can do is drill a pilot hole and

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.460 
you can do is drill a pilot hole and
then<00:02:10.130> drill<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> larger<00:02:10.729> hole<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.180> use<00:02:12.170> a

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
then drill a larger hole and use a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.059 
then drill a larger hole and use a
scroll<00:02:13.010> saw<00:02:13.040> or<00:02:13.790> an<00:02:13.970> air<00:02:14.180> saw<00:02:14.830> however<00:02:15.830> you

scroll saw or an air saw however you

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.170 
scroll saw or an air saw however you
want<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.340> make<00:02:16.430> sure<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.880> hole<00:02:17.060> you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
want to make sure that the hole you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.430 
want to make sure that the hole you
drill<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.540> large<00:02:17.750> enough<00:02:17.959> for<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.170> blade<00:02:18.410> to

drill is large enough for the blade to
get<00:02:18.680> through<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:25.100> we<00:02:25.250> don't<00:02:25.400> have<00:02:25.489> power

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.520 

so<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.000> can<00:02:47.150> see<00:02:47.330> when<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.510> made<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.930> cup<00:02:48.170> with

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
so you can see when I made this cup with

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.559 
so you can see when I made this cup with
the<00:02:48.860> saw<00:02:49.069> that<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.580> abs<00:02:49.940> actually<00:02:50.270> likes<00:02:50.420> to

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
the saw that the abs actually likes to

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.390 
the saw that the abs actually likes to
melt<00:02:50.840> back<00:02:51.050> together<00:02:51.440> behind<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:52.010> blade<00:02:52.250> as

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
melt back together behind the blade as

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.880 
melt back together behind the blade as
it<00:02:52.430> passes<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.569> made<00:02:53.890> back-and-forth

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
it passes so I made back-and-forth

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.010 
it passes so I made back-and-forth
passes<00:02:55.459> as<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.790> went<00:02:55.970> along<00:02:56.180> our<00:02:56.690> outer

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
passes as I went along our outer

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.990 
passes as I went along our outer
perimeter<00:02:57.590> you'll<00:02:57.890> need<00:02:58.069> to<00:02:58.220> sand<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:58.670> smooth

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000
