let me just show you here what we've

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.100 
let me just show you here what we've
done<00:00:56.040> already<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.730> I've<00:00:57.239> actually<00:00:57.570> created

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
done already so I've actually created

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.280 
done already so I've actually created
some<00:00:58.680> eyes<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.400> of<00:00:59.460> chocolate<00:01:00.059> buttons<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
some eyes out of chocolate buttons and

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.630 
some eyes out of chocolate buttons and
with<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.220> icing<00:01:02.640> or<00:01:03.390> some<00:01:03.540> icing<00:01:03.900> pens<00:01:04.199> I

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
with some icing or some icing pens I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
with some icing or some icing pens I
actually<00:01:05.720> created<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.110> different<00:01:07.440> colored

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
actually created the different colored

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
actually created the different colored
eyes<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.150> put<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.509> in<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> fridge

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
eyes and then I put them in the fridge

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
eyes and then I put them in the fridge
so<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.710> set<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.400> they're<00:01:11.550> still

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
so that they would set but they're still

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
so that they would set but they're still
actually<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.840> gooey<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.590> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
actually a little bit gooey which you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280 
actually a little bit gooey which you
can<00:01:13.950> see<00:01:14.190> there<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> probably<00:01:15.720> should<00:01:16.050> left

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
can see there so I probably should left

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.149 
can see there so I probably should left
them<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.430> strawberries<00:01:18.030> smashing<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
them the strawberries smashing it so I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
them the strawberries smashing it so I
probably<00:01:20.460> should<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:20.850> left<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.360> maybe<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
probably should have left it maybe a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.240 
probably should have left it maybe a
little<00:01:22.440> bit<00:01:22.800> longer<00:01:23.039> so<00:01:24.979> next<00:01:25.979> time<00:01:26.100> I'll

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
little bit longer so next time I'll

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.710 
little bit longer so next time I'll
remember<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.850> leave<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.149> little<00:01:27.300> bit<00:01:27.539> longer

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
remember to leave it a little bit longer

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.240 
remember to leave it a little bit longer
maybe<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.350> needs<00:01:28.530> about<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.610> hour<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.070> are

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
maybe it needs about an hour so here are

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.550 
maybe it needs about an hour so here are
our<00:01:32.460> icing<00:01:33.300> eyes<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.840> need<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> stick<00:01:34.350> them
