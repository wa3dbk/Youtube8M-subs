00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.849
 Hey youtubers it's Charlie because it's been a few weeks since I did a Legend 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.210
 from Korra Book 3 update I thought it was time to do a nice long video to get you excited 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.640
 for 2014. 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.750
 So here are 10 great things that we need to talk about. 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.480
 Number 1 - Book 3 Footage? When will we be able to see a trailer and artwork? 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.650
 In February every year Nickelodeon does his upfronts. That's where they show excerpts 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.250
 all their programs to advertisers so that they will give them money. Practical 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.710
 point of view, this Nickelodeon is the most important event throughout the year. This will be the first one 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.489
 time someone sees which images from Book 3. 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.000
 Unfortunately because we are not advertisers we will not be able to go. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.989
 The first time ordinary people will be able to see all the new clips will be on their Press 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.500
 event in May. That's where big news outlets and bloggers are invited to see images and 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.199
 Learn about the new season directly from the makers. 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.400
 I might have a chance in that event. 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.280
 After that it is really conventions such as Comic Con where visual material is shown in public. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.040
 But next year will be a bit different because ... 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.509
 Number 2 - Book 3 will premiere much earlier than this year. 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.630
 Why? Because they started working on it as good as the book 4, right after the packaged production 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.710
 on Book 2. Meaning, by the time we were seeing Book 2 episodes, they were already animating 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.729
 book 3. 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.819
 That process takes a long time, and in New York Comic Con this October in them 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.829
 she said about half animate book 3. 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.929
 The sooner they are finished, the sooner it can air. They can even start airing episodes before 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.670
 the last few episodes are finished to be animated. 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.719
 Because the majority of Korra's audience are younger, most shows like that premiere 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.920
 during late spring early summer just because that is when these people are more likely 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.319
 to watch a lot of TV. 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:46.109
 Conservative estimate, see Book 3 episode 1 in June, possibly as early as April. 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.770
 Pretty awesome right? 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.719
 Number 3 - If they aired the season before Comic Con this summer what will they do 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.279
 to do on their panel? 

00:01:55.279 --> 00:02:00.759
 Easy, book 4. They won't even be close to the finishing animation on Book 4 by the following summer, 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.840
 but they will have had enough time to cut a trailer. So even though their Comic Con 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.399
 panel next year will cover much of the aftermath of what is happening during Book 3, they will 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.740
 tease a lot of book 4 details. 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.130
 Remember this last year they have broadcast the entire first episode during their panel. Not me 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.710
 they expect a full book 4 episode air, but i will be there just in case. 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.460
 Number 4 - What are the biggest changes in Book 3 right now? 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.280
 Usually are the addition of the spirits in the physical world and the locations. The new 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280
 locations and the changes to old locations will largely inform the new and old characters 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.430
 we will see again as well as the story. 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.200
 Republic City will still be a part of book 3, but because Korra will travel around 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.140
 the earth kingdom for most of book 3 it won't be seeing so much. 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.360
 The big change is all the spirit wilderness that will grow from those vines that make it dark 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.550
 avatar wt when he fell during the final. Those large vines will be like dwellings for spirits. 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.600
 I wonder how much rent they cost. 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.990
 Number 5 - What are those new locations? 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.320
 I already did a video about how it's going to be all about the Aarderijk, but the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.320
 actual cities we see are Ba Sing Se and Omashu. I am also holding out hope for Kyoshi 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.090
 Island. 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.900
 The problem with Korra is that there are only 13 episodes that halve the leaves 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.940
 travel to all of our favorite old places from Last Airbender. So we only see the places 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.790
 which is the most important for the story. Namely Ba Sing Se. Which means that Omashu is a long-shot 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.710
 also. Such as Kyoshi island. 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.710
 Konietzko and DiMartino confirmed an earth queen there. Watch the gender, queen. So 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.640
 the story will largely revolve around her city. 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 Number 6 - Who is the Earth Queen? 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.070
 Nothing has been confirmed, but the best theory is that it is Alyson Stoner who plays 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 a character named Opal. She originally confirmed she was expressing a sign before book 2 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.090
 but it seems that her character was meant to be an important part of book 3. 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.930
 Since Opal is a kind of precious gem, it is quite likely that this is the case since 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.190
 character names on Last Airbender tend to flow out of their traits. Just like Azula 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.010
 and her blue fire. The other possibility is that Opal can also 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.520
 are a Kyoshi warrior, but I still think it is more likely that they will be the Earth Queen. 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.020
 Although the story will be totally new, just like the previous books by Korra you can be 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.710
 always expect certiain Last Airbender themes to come back. Cage was manipulated 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.819
 by Long Feng, and just like Kooei, Opal is voiced by an actress with a really young 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.819
 sounding voice. So it is possible that Korra will have to get rid of a new Long Feng species 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.940
 character. 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.460
 Number 7 - What about Beifongs? 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.250
 One of the most important subplots will revolve entirely around Lin and her family. The only glimpse 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.370
 we got it from Toph during Legend of Korra is in flashback. She's dead in the present 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.500
 bye, but there is the largely unexplored issue of Lin's father. 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.550
 The best three theories I've seen is the duke, we've never met a new character or 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.000
 she has been approved and we will never know who her father is. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.650
 The makers have already mentioned that we have more information about Lin's parents, so I don't think so 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.620
 she was hired. But I love the idea that her father will end up being someone we have 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.610
 never met before, but it is connected to the bigger story of book 3 and what's going on 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.410
 on in Ba Sing Se in the current. 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.990
 Number 8 - Why did they wait so long to explain Beifong's Family? 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.150
 Remember how closed Toph was before she joined avatar. They eventually warmed up 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.070
 And forget Toph was one of the founders of Republic City with Aang. And what did everything 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.780
 Aang's children say about Aang as a father during Book 2. He was not a super considerate 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.850
 father. That was probably the case for Lin and Toph. 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.730
 Meaning she has some problems she still has to work through. And I suspect that since 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.750
 the Beifong's are a very famous family, the rest of her family also have some large ones 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.660
 issues we will learn about. 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.400
 Number 9 - Who is the villain? 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.910
 We don't have confirmation about who the big bad one will be, we don't even know 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.970
 vascular and the dark avatar until book 2 broadcast. But what if the medium is bad, the varrick van 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.870
 Book 3 turned out to be Lin's father. 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.100
 What is the biggest reason to never talk about your parents. If they get angry. And 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.669
 What would you do, you would probably become a law officer and dedicate your life 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:29.850
 to get rid of crime. 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.400
 It is more likely that the father Lin or her family is involved in a number of obscure matters. 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.410
 I don't think they'll be connected to who the real villain is. Even Varrick 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.290
 The other big possibility is that it plays the character Gray Delyle. She announced 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.350
 She played a dark character, but because we don't see her during book 2, it's probably 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.430
 that we will see her during book 3. 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.430
 It is important to note that she does not play Azula. It will be a new character 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.150
 we have never met. 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:02.150
 So keep sending me your Korra questions, I will probably do a Korra Q&amp;A after the holidays. I received a lot from Sherlock 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.830
 and Doctor Who to come by before that time. 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.120
 I am also looking for a few new videos from tonight that show all the special things that I come after 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.760
