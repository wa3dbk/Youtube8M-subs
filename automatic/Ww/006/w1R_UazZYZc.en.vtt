00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.500 
is really fun on the shield that's it
like<00:00:38.280> three<00:00:38.550> dollars<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> fun<00:00:39.360> little

time<00:00:40.170> waster<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:41.010> that's<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.250> pretty

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
time waster and I think that's a pretty

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.700 
time waster and I think that's a pretty
good<00:00:41.610> game<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> main<00:00:43.140> thing<00:00:43.170> about<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
good game but the main thing about the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.229 
good game but the main thing about the
shield<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.190> been<00:00:44.370> advertised<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.059> the

there<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> lot<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> pixilation<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.250> was

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
there was a lot of pixilation there was

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.399 
there was a lot of pixilation there was
a<00:01:44.369> lot<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> artifacting<00:01:45.329> wasn't<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
a lot of artifacting wasn't really a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.469 
a lot of artifacting wasn't really a
good<00:01:46.770> experience<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> shield<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.030> feels

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
good experience on the shield it feels

good experience on the shield it feels
fluid<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.229> feels<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.159> game<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.520> being

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
fluid it feels like the game is being

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.880 
fluid it feels like the game is being
played<00:01:50.970> locally<00:01:51.659> which<00:01:51.810> i<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> goal

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
like your locally playing the game so it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.240 
like your locally playing the game so it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
playing again on a computer which I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.069 
playing again on a computer which I
think<00:02:06.090> they've<00:02:06.210> accomplished<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
think they've accomplished with the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.229 
think they've accomplished with the
shield<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.649> long<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.819> hardware

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
shield as long as you have the hardware

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
shield as long as you have the hardware
that<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.750> back<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.470> being<00:02:10.709> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that can back it up that being a

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.710 
that can back it up that being a
two-part<00:02:11.700> dual<00:02:12.540> band<00:02:12.750> router<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.530> is

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
two-part dual band router that is

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.860 
two-part dual band router that is
capable<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.260> 5<00:02:14.440> gigahertz<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.190> 2.4<00:02:15.730> gigahertz

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
capable of 5 gigahertz and 2.4 gigahertz

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.030 
capable of 5 gigahertz and 2.4 gigahertz
you're<00:02:16.870> gonna<00:02:16.990> probably<00:02:17.290> want<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.710> save<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
you're gonna probably want to save the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.800 
you're gonna probably want to save the
five<00:02:18.220> gigahertz<00:02:18.550> band<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:19.270> for<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.570> shield

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
five gigahertz band just for the shield

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.090 
five gigahertz band just for the shield
that's<00:02:20.080> what<00:02:20.200> I've<00:02:20.320> done<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:20.830> seems<00:02:21.040> to

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
that's what I've done and it seems to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.580 
that's what I've done and it seems to
work<00:02:21.190> fairly<00:02:21.580> well<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> other<00:02:23.140> big<00:02:23.380> thing

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
work fairly well now the other big thing

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.560 
work fairly well now the other big thing
I<00:02:23.680> love<00:02:23.830> about<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.190> shield<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.580> emulators<00:02:25.360> now

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
I love about the shield is emulators now

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.330 
I love about the shield is emulators now
there's<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.870> lot<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.110> good<00:02:26.260> possibilities<00:02:27.100> with

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
there's a lot of good possibilities with

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.820 
there's a lot of good possibilities with
emulators<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:28.420> favor<00:02:28.660> emulators<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.590> odd

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
emulators the favor emulators is odd

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.220 
emulators the favor emulators is odd
this<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.640> shield<00:02:30.880> can<00:02:31.180> stream<00:02:31.450> anything<00:02:31.840> from

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
this the shield can stream anything from

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.800 
this the shield can stream anything from
your<00:02:32.380> PC<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.190> if<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.520> have<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.700> ps2<00:02:34.090> emulator<00:02:34.360> or

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
your PC so if you have a ps2 emulator or

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.660 
your PC so if you have a ps2 emulator or
a<00:02:34.870> wii<00:02:35.080> emulator<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.770> i<00:02:35.950> do<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.520> could

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
a wii emulator like i do you could

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.940 
a wii emulator like i do you could
actually<00:02:36.820> play<00:02:37.240> any<00:02:37.540> ps2<00:02:37.990> game<00:02:38.380> via<00:02:38.740> the

great the PSP emulator I was kind of

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.650 
great the PSP emulator I was kind of
worried<00:02:57.190> if<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.490> wasn't<00:02:57.790> gonna<00:02:57.880> run<00:02:58.120> well<00:02:58.330> has

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
worried if it wasn't gonna run well has

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.960 
worried if it wasn't gonna run well has
rant<00:02:59.050> absolutely<00:02:59.680> great<00:02:59.890> for<00:03:00.370> me<00:03:00.490> I<00:03:00.670> can

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
rant absolutely great for me I can

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.520 
rant absolutely great for me I can
actually<00:03:01.000> turn<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.780> rendering<00:03:02.320> resolution

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
actually turn the rendering resolution

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.250 
actually turn the rendering resolution
two<00:03:03.100> times<00:03:03.370> above<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.150> normal<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:05.020> it<00:03:05.230> looks

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
two times above the normal so it looks

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.580 
two times above the normal so it looks
great<00:03:05.770> in<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.190> 720p<00:03:06.880> screen<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.959> right<00:03:08.350> now<00:03:08.380> the

great in a 720p screen so right now the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.260 
great in a 720p screen so right now the
shield<00:03:08.950> honestly<00:03:09.459> took<00:03:09.790> for<00:03:10.030> two<00:03:10.120> hundred

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270
