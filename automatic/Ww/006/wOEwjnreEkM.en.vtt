00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.970
 very good to all I'm josemarÃ­a de 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.660
 last game and this time instead 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.630
 to bring you a gameplay I am going to bring you a 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.930
 small tutorial of how to erase both 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.660
 the videos and the images that we do 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.570
 with the playstation 4 share button that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.249
 well well this time it seems that 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.439
 sony did not want to heal it too much 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.269
 and he has hidden it a little bit we know that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.810
 if we give the share button we eliminate 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.030
 elche we see that he makes the videoclip although 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.920
 us the last we have done but 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.960
 The problem with these clips is that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.730
 can not be deleted from here and for 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.850
 delete them you have to go you have to go to another 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.150
 part is good then well I tell you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.400
 as age is up and appears 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.030
 the playstation menu and in this option 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.670
 we have adjustments and this is where we are going to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.090
 find the option to delete videos and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.790
 catches we have to go to management 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.950
 system storage and here we go 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.870
 to find the things we have in 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.460
 our hard drive of play 4 las 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 applications that we have lowered the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.409
 catches and saved data of the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.430
 apply 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.850
 we have to come here to catch 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.070
 and here we find all the games of 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.380
 what we have done then captures or 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.020
 videos is worth then for example I'm going 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.810
 to enter word frame and we have a 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.510
 video test that I uploaded it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.830
 relatively little to the channel and we're going to 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.360
 delete it if we had for example 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.280
 catches we'll find here and the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.770
 video clips we find them here with 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.820
 we all find here then what 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.340
 only thing to do is give the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.770
 option options button the one that is in the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.979
 top right of the play knob 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.740
 four and we will appear here if the option 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.850
 to eliminate then we're going to eliminate 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 We will not eliminate directly 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.920
 we enter a screen where we 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.500
 allows you to make a selection of different 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.420
 videos or different images even 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.130
 we can give you to select all and here 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.990
 yes we can give you here in the part of 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.960
 down right to the option to delete 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.280
 I'll show you how it would look with 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.500
 other games for example in battlefield 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.170
 4 well I have a lot more catches of 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.550
 videos of images and here it would be 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.520
 exactly the same button 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.290
 options 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.290
 the menu comes out 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.590
 and here by eliminating I can say 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.200
 I want to erase is this is for example 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.470
 and this is the four I want 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.720
 delete I'm going here the delete button 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.239
 He tells me that if I want to eliminate them and 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.129
 the expensive ones if you realize by 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.690
 example is here of 1,004 is 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.269
 going up that is another one that I have uploaded to 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.340
 youtube channel but this time it's 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.530
 that will not let us delete it because 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.159
 says there is another application we are going to 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.250
 see him 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.830
 there is another application that is using it 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.060
 for example, select east and east 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.990
 and it tells me that it can not be eliminated 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.300
 since it is being used, it is worth 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.530
 this is the way to delete captures and 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:05.470
 button videos are playstation 4 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.290
 another memory above settings 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.690
 storage management systems and 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.000
 catches and here we will find the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.300
 screenshots that we can delete with the button 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.020
 options on top of each of them 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.020
 Thank you and see you soon
