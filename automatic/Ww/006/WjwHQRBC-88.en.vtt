00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
bolted and we didn't pay enough

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.920 
bolted and we didn't pay enough
attention<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.820> their<00:00:25.029> nose<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.539> hogs<00:00:25.690> have

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
attention to their nose and hogs have

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.330 
attention to their nose and hogs have
one<00:00:26.080> of<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.230> best<00:00:26.380> noses<00:00:26.800> out<00:00:26.949> in<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.130> woods

one of the best noses out in the woods
so<00:00:27.609> we<00:00:27.640> should<00:00:27.910> have<00:00:28.029> paid<00:00:28.119> more<00:00:28.330> attention<00:00:28.359> to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779

two-liter out first so with everything
all<00:01:25.749> together<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:26.200> costs<00:01:26.499> us<00:01:26.590> about<00:01:26.709> $3<00:01:27.429> and<00:01:27.639> it

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
all together it costs us about $3 and it

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.429 
all together it costs us about $3 and it
really<00:01:27.999> saved<00:01:28.359> us<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:28.779> I'd<00:01:29.079> highly<00:01:29.409> recommend

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
really saved us so I'd highly recommend

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.260 
really saved us so I'd highly recommend
you<00:01:29.859> try<00:01:30.069> it<00:01:30.130> now<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.609> first<00:01:30.849> thing<00:01:31.029> you<00:01:31.119> want

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
you try it now the first thing you want

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.730 
you try it now the first thing you want
to<00:01:31.299> do<00:01:31.419> is<00:01:31.539> go<00:01:31.689> ahead<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:31.959> take<00:01:32.139> two<00:01:32.380> cups<00:01:32.619> of

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
to do is go ahead and take two cups of

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.589 
to do is go ahead and take two cups of
the<00:01:32.859> distilled<00:01:33.219> water<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.759> pour<00:01:34.270> that<00:01:34.299> into

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:34.599 
the distilled water and pour that into

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.480 
the distilled water and pour that into
your<00:01:34.689> 2-liter<00:01:35.169> and<00:01:35.439> then<00:01:35.979> measure<00:01:36.249> out<00:01:36.369> a

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
your 2-liter and then measure out a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.969 
your 2-liter and then measure out a
quarter<00:01:36.789> cup<00:01:37.149> of<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.450> baking<00:01:37.810> soda<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.349> pour

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
quarter cup of the baking soda and pour

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.169 
quarter cup of the baking soda and pour
that<00:01:39.159> in<00:01:39.340> there<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.609> can<00:01:39.729> use<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:39.909> piece<00:01:40.149> of

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
that in there you can use a piece of

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.819 
that in there you can use a piece of
paper<00:01:40.299> as<00:01:40.689> a<00:01:40.719> funnel<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.229> get<00:01:41.349> it<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.529> go<00:01:41.649> in

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
paper as a funnel to get it to go in

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.620 
paper as a funnel to get it to go in
once<00:01:42.729> you<00:01:42.849> get<00:01:42.999> it<00:01:43.119> in<00:01:43.209> there<00:01:43.329> go<00:01:43.479> ahead<00:01:43.539> and

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
once you get it in there go ahead and

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.300 
once you get it in there go ahead and
put<00:01:43.779> the<00:01:43.869> cap<00:01:44.079> on<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:44.289> shake<00:01:44.619> that<00:01:44.859> up<00:01:44.889> as<00:01:45.159> good

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
put the cap on and shake that up as good

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.620 
put the cap on and shake that up as good
as<00:01:45.429> you<00:01:45.549> can<00:01:45.729> you<00:01:45.880> want<00:01:45.999> to<00:01:46.060> try<00:01:46.209> and<00:01:46.329> dissolve

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
as you can you want to try and dissolve

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.359 
as you can you want to try and dissolve
all<00:01:46.869> of<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:47.169> baking<00:01:47.560> soda<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.009> there's<00:01:48.189> no

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
all of that baking soda so there's no

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.879 
all of that baking soda so there's no
powder<00:01:48.669> left<00:01:49.179> in<00:01:49.359> the<00:01:49.450> bottom<00:01:49.779> of<00:01:49.929> water<00:01:50.349> then

powder left in the bottom of water then

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:52.620 
powder left in the bottom of water then
you<00:01:51.009> can<00:01:51.130> go<00:01:51.249> ahead<00:01:51.429> and<00:01:51.520> take<00:01:51.639> your<00:01:51.789> 16<00:01:52.239> ounces

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
you can go ahead and take your 16 ounces

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
the water baking soda mixture this is

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.109 
the water baking soda mixture this is
the<00:01:57.069> part<00:01:57.249> where<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.399> could<00:01:57.609> start<00:01:57.819> to<00:01:57.939> fizz

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
the part where it could start to fizz

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.370

going<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.790> escape<00:02:10.150> so<00:02:10.360> make<00:02:10.540> sure<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.780> take<00:02:10.930> it

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
going to escape so make sure you take it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.870 
going to escape so make sure you take it
slow<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.380> have<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> towel<00:02:11.770> handy<00:02:11.800> just<00:02:12.460> paste

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
slow and have a towel handy just paste

though<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.890> try<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.250> make<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.670> mixture

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
though is to try and make this mixture

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.480 
though is to try and make this mixture
as<00:02:16.450> far<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:16.900> advance<00:02:16.990> of<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.740> hunt<00:02:17.950> as<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.250> can

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
as far in advance of the hunt as you can

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.040

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
this is going to take a while for that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.110 
this is going to take a while for that
chemical<00:02:20.320> reaction<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.070> stop<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.970> need

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
chemical reaction to stop and you need

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.400 
chemical reaction to stop and you need
to<00:02:22.210> be<00:02:22.300> able<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.540> pour<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.840> into<00:02:22.960> your<00:02:23.020> spray

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
to be able to pour it into your spray

to be able to pour it into your spray
bottle<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:23.860> put<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.250> cap<00:02:24.460> on<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:25.240> it's<00:02:25.420> not

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
bottle and put the cap on so it's not

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.360 
bottle and put the cap on so it's not
spilling<00:02:26.020> everywhere<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.590> still<00:02:27.130> venting

spilling everywhere and still venting

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.820 
spilling everywhere and still venting
gas<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.110> once<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.200> get<00:02:29.320> out<00:02:29.440> there<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.650> can

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
gas and once you get out there you can

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.800 
gas and once you get out there you can
spray<00:02:30.040> down<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.610> even<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.880> good<00:02:31.030> idea<00:02:31.360> really

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
spray down it's even a good idea really

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.930 
spray down it's even a good idea really
if<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.440> have<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.980> opportunity<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.700> go<00:02:33.820> ahead

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
stuff that will really work in under

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.910 
stuff that will really work in under
three<00:02:55.960> dollars<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.410> can't<00:02:56.620> beat<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:56.890> price
