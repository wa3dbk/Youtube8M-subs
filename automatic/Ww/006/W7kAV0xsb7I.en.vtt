00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
right here with a vehicle that I walked

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.320 
right here with a vehicle that I walked
up<00:00:15.259> to<00:00:15.440> this<00:00:15.589> Santa<00:00:16.100> Cruz<00:00:16.340> and<00:00:16.699> I<00:00:16.880> said<00:00:17.150> oh

up to this Santa Cruz and I said oh

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.830 
up to this Santa Cruz and I said oh
that's<00:00:18.170> like<00:00:18.439> you<00:00:18.619> Brad<00:00:19.250> which<00:00:19.880> there<00:00:20.660> hasn't

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
that's like you Brad which there hasn't

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.859 
that's like you Brad which there hasn't
been<00:00:20.990> a<00:00:21.109> vehicle<00:00:21.289> like<00:00:21.769> this<00:00:22.009> in<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.550> long<00:00:22.849> time

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
been a vehicle like this in a long time

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.019 
been a vehicle like this in a long time
what<00:00:24.349> is<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.710> Santa<00:00:25.009> Cruz<00:00:25.070> well<00:00:25.429> we<00:00:25.609> just<00:00:25.789> we

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
what is the Santa Cruz well we just we

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.700 
what is the Santa Cruz well we just we
start<00:00:26.539> we<00:00:26.779> start<00:00:26.990> thinking<00:00:27.320> about<00:00:27.380> visiting

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
start we start thinking about visiting

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.620 
start we start thinking about visiting
kind<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:28.220> an<00:00:28.279> old<00:00:28.429> concept<00:00:28.970> basically<00:00:29.150> with<00:00:29.599> a

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
kind of an old concept basically with a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.390 
kind of an old concept basically with a
new<00:00:29.810> approach<00:00:30.140> with<00:00:30.470> it<00:00:30.589> with<00:00:30.769> a<00:00:30.800> new<00:00:30.949> customer

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
new approach with it with a new customer

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.750 
new approach with it with a new customer
that's<00:00:31.580> out<00:00:31.730> there

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.520 

how<00:00:38.390> does<00:00:38.660> design<00:00:39.640> express<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.480> little<00:00:41.780> funky

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
how does design express the little funky

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.590 
how does design express the little funky
beach<00:00:42.800> town<00:00:43.160> of<00:00:43.370> Santa<00:00:43.760> Cruz<00:00:43.940> now<00:00:44.239> it<00:00:44.300> begins

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
beach town of Santa Cruz now it begins

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.509 
beach town of Santa Cruz now it begins
with<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:44.989> proportion<00:00:45.530> always<00:00:45.949> yeah<00:00:46.339> in

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
with the proportion always yeah in

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.099 
with the proportion always yeah in
design<00:00:46.879> anyway<00:00:47.269> with<00:00:47.420> anything<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:47.989> do

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
design anyway with anything that you do

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.020 
design anyway with anything that you do
it<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.379> design<00:00:48.710> but<00:00:48.920> it<00:00:49.010> really<00:00:49.250> really<00:00:49.670> begins

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
it in design but it really really begins

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.270 
it in design but it really really begins
I<00:00:50.180> think<00:00:50.210> with<00:00:50.539> a<00:00:50.570> really<00:00:50.930> strong<00:00:51.320> one<00:00:51.859> one

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
I think with a really strong one one

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.590 
I think with a really strong one one
statement<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:52.969> you<00:00:53.059> wanted<00:00:53.300> people<00:00:53.479> to

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
statement that you wanted people to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600 
statement that you wanted people to
remember<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.229> and<00:00:54.500> in<00:00:54.619> this<00:00:54.739> case<00:00:55.010> with<00:00:55.579> a

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
remember and and in this case with a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.399 
remember and and in this case with a
pickup<00:00:55.909> truck<00:00:56.239> it's<00:00:56.539> kind<00:00:56.719> of<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.899> metaphor

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
pickup truck it's kind of the metaphor

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.950 
pickup truck it's kind of the metaphor
of<00:00:57.440> this<00:00:57.799> idea<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.519> backpack<00:00:58.760> or<00:00:59.390> carrying

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
of this idea of a backpack or carrying

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.119 
of this idea of a backpack or carrying
on<00:01:00.079> your<00:01:00.229> shoulders<00:01:00.619> so<00:01:00.769> we<00:01:00.890> want<00:01:01.070> to

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
on your shoulders so we want to

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.889 
on your shoulders so we want to
incorporate<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.670> really<00:01:02.059> really<00:01:02.299> strong<00:01:02.600> one

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
incorporate a really really strong one

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.539 
incorporate a really really strong one
simple<00:01:03.440> line<00:01:03.589> kind<00:01:03.829> of<00:01:03.979> a<00:01:04.039> shoulder<00:01:04.280> that

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
simple line kind of a shoulder that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.399 
simple line kind of a shoulder that
comes<00:01:04.729> through<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.059> through<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.750> car<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.320> we

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
comes through the through the car and we

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.810 
comes through the through the car and we
have<00:01:06.560> this<00:01:06.680> kind<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:06.950> really<00:01:07.580> interesting

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
have this kind of really interesting

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.870 
have this kind of really interesting
intersection<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:09.049> solving<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.640> fender<00:01:10.640> form

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
intersection in solving the fender form

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.059 
intersection in solving the fender form
in<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.090> front<00:01:11.360> here<00:01:11.569> by<00:01:11.960> diving<00:01:12.319> in<00:01:12.710> here<00:01:12.950> and

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
in the front here by diving in here and

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:14.590 
in the front here by diving in here and
then<00:01:13.159> popping<00:01:13.520> back<00:01:13.819> out<00:01:14.030> here<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.420> then<00:01:14.509> we

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
then popping back out here and then we

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.660 
then popping back out here and then we
have<00:01:14.750> kind<00:01:14.990> of<00:01:15.050> a<00:01:15.170> an<00:01:15.470> intake<00:01:15.979> for<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.250> for<00:01:16.580> the

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
have kind of a an intake for the for the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.960 
have kind of a an intake for the for the
cap<00:01:17.149> actually<00:01:17.420> this<00:01:18.020> really<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:19.039> part<00:01:19.550> of<00:01:19.759> the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
cap actually this really is part of the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
cap actually this really is part of the
entire<00:01:21.100> just<00:01:22.100> movement<00:01:22.610> its<00:01:22.759> dynamic<00:01:23.450> softer

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
entire just movement its dynamic softer

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.779 
entire just movement its dynamic softer
forms<00:01:24.319> fuller<00:01:24.590> forms<00:01:24.979> now<00:01:25.159> we're<00:01:25.429> really<00:01:25.610> kind

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
forms fuller forms now we're really kind

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.430 
forms fuller forms now we're really kind
of<00:01:25.880> evolving<00:01:26.420> our<00:01:26.539> form<00:01:26.780> language<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.229> little

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
of evolving our form language a little

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.779 
of evolving our form language a little
bit<00:01:27.560> more<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.950> taking<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.280> little<00:01:28.369> bit<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.700> a

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
bit more and taking a little bit of a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.370 
bit more and taking a little bit of a
bone<00:01:29.149> structure<00:01:29.720> out<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:29.959> things<00:01:30.140> and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
bone structure out of things and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.370 
bone structure out of things and
bringing<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.860> little<00:01:31.190> bit<00:01:31.280> more<00:01:31.429> full<00:01:31.670> forms

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
bringing a little bit more full forms

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.630 
bringing a little bit more full forms
let's<00:01:33.380> look<00:01:33.560> at<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.709> front<00:01:33.950> cos<00:01:34.069> it's<00:01:34.190> very

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
let's look at the front cos it's very

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.430 
let's look at the front cos it's very
strong<00:01:35.060> we're<00:01:35.659> trying<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.990> introduce<00:01:36.140> a

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
strong we're trying to introduce a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.080 
strong we're trying to introduce a
little<00:01:36.560> bit<00:01:36.709> of<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.950> nuance<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.580> in<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.880> line

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
little bit of a nuance and in the line

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.309 
little bit of a nuance and in the line
of<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.360> car<00:01:38.509> we<00:01:38.659> call<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:38.929> a<00:01:38.990> kind<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.229> a

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
of the car we call it a kind of a

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.469 
of the car we call it a kind of a
cascade<00:01:39.860> grille<00:01:40.220> you'll<00:01:40.399> see<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.729> as<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.330> two

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
cascade grille you'll see it as the two

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.240 
cascade grille you'll see it as the two
lines<00:01:41.720> on<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:41.989> side<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.349> car<00:01:42.530> they<00:01:42.890> begin

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
lines on the side of the car they begin

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.430 
lines on the side of the car they begin
to<00:01:43.369> turn<00:01:43.580> back<00:01:43.789> outward<00:01:44.239> at<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.599> bottom<00:01:44.989> and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
to turn back outward at the bottom and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.080 
to turn back outward at the bottom and
this<00:01:45.590> is<00:01:45.709> kind<00:01:45.920> of<00:01:45.979> introducing<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.700> little<00:01:46.849> bit

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
this is kind of introducing a little bit

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.760 
this is kind of introducing a little bit
more<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.450> our<00:01:47.569> own<00:01:47.629> identity<00:01:48.259> something<00:01:48.500> that

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
more of our own identity something that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.740 
more of our own identity something that
we<00:01:48.890> can<00:01:49.099> really<00:01:49.220> own<00:01:49.520> ourselves<00:01:49.879> and<00:01:50.509> try<00:01:50.690> to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
we can really own ourselves and try to
