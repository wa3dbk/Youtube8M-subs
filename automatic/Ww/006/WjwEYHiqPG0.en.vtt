00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.230 

this<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> little<00:00:01.800> nightlight<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.550> use<00:00:02.970> in<00:00:03.120> my

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
this is a little nightlight I use in my

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.269 
this is a little nightlight I use in my
bedroom<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.870> it<00:00:04.560> just<00:00:04.740> sits<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.100> corner

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
bedroom and it just sits in the corner

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.700 
bedroom and it just sits in the corner
and<00:00:05.580> it's<00:00:06.120> not<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.420> switch<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:06.899> just<00:00:07.109> stays<00:00:07.470> lit

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
and it's not a switch it just stays lit

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.950 
and it's not a switch it just stays lit
24/7<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.880> let<00:00:09.000> me<00:00:09.090> just<00:00:09.269> turn<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> lights<00:00:09.750> off

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
24/7 and let me just turn the lights off

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.430 
24/7 and let me just turn the lights off
so<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.200> can<00:00:10.320> see<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.769> at<00:00:11.460> nighttime<00:00:12.440> it

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
so you can see that at nighttime it

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.599 
so you can see that at nighttime it
actually<00:00:13.860> looks<00:00:14.009> quite<00:00:14.099> braid<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:16.609> although

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
actually looks quite braid and although

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.910 
actually looks quite braid and although
it's<00:00:17.850> not<00:00:17.910> putting<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.330> lot<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.810> light<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
it's not putting a lot of light it a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.460 
it's not putting a lot of light it a
sing-off<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> very<00:00:21.449> dark<00:00:21.630> room<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
sing-off that in a very dark room the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.769 
sing-off that in a very dark room the
rim<00:00:22.920> will<00:00:23.100> be<00:00:23.250> lit<00:00:23.460> quite<00:00:23.760> well<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.539> see

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
rim will be lit quite well you can see

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
rim will be lit quite well you can see
everything<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> room<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.460> very

everything in the room it it's a very

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.330 
everything in the room it it's a very

so<00:02:13.770> technically<00:02:14.100> speaking<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.610> packs<00:02:14.880> only

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so technically speaking this packs only

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.210 
so technically speaking this packs only

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the full run and it kind of balances

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.090 
the full run and it kind of balances
round<00:02:21.720> about<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.230> forward<00:02:22.590> voltage<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:23.040> this

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
round about the forward voltage of this

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.400 
round about the forward voltage of this
LED<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.820> settles<00:02:24.330> out<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.960> just<00:02:24.990> sits

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.760 
there and the typical quiescent current
is<00:02:29.270> I'm<00:02:30.270> not<00:02:30.600> upset<00:02:31.050> sure<00:02:31.230> let's<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.530> what<00:02:31.710> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
is I'm not upset sure let's see what the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.600 
is I'm not upset sure let's see what the
question<00:02:32.130> current<00:02:32.490> across<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.940> as<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> moan<00:02:33.390> I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
question current across this as a moan I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.470 
question current across this as a moan I
think<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:35.760> probably<00:02:36.000> going<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.300> be<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
think it's probably going to be the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.750 
think it's probably going to be the
region<00:02:36.800> these<00:02:37.800> are<00:02:37.980> these<00:02:38.130> are<00:02:38.160> fresh<00:02:38.520> batches

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
region these are these are fresh batches

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.390 
region these are these are fresh batches

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.890 
of just percent at the moment that's
what<00:02:41.580> inspired<00:02:42.000> me<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.270> start<00:02:42.390> taking<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:42.780> to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
what inspired me to start taking this to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.500 
what inspired me to start taking this to
fits<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:43.560> what<00:02:43.710> resistor<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.510> how

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
fits and see what resistor is in it how

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.000 
fits and see what resistor is in it how
precise<00:02:45.840> forgotten<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.590> I'm<00:02:46.650> just<00:02:46.770> going<00:02:46.920> to

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.580 
precise forgotten so I'm just going to
measure<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.610> right<00:02:47.820> now<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:55.200> voltage<00:02:55.470> of

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590
