00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
like about Bon Iver in general is that

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:19.890 
like about Bon Iver in general is that
you<00:03:13.579> can't<00:03:13.910> really<00:03:14.329> pinpoint<00:03:15.940> his<00:03:17.769> genre<00:03:18.769> I

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
think you could call him as much a soul

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.509 
think you could call him as much a soul
artist<00:03:23.840> as<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.620> could<00:03:24.799> call<00:03:24.980> him<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.280> folk
