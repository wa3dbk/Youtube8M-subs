00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
off the facebook there of what i've done

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.040 
off the facebook there of what i've done
so<00:02:30.520> far<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:31.000> can<00:02:31.120> see<00:02:31.270> it's<00:02:31.660> extremely

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
so far you can see it's extremely

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.960 
so far you can see it's extremely
complex<00:02:32.380> stuff<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.010> can<00:02:33.130> be<00:02:33.220> handled<00:02:33.550> you

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
complex stuff that it can be handled you

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.390 
complex stuff that it can be handled you
know<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.480> vinyl<00:02:35.320> cutting<00:02:35.650> process<00:02:36.190> allows

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
know the vinyl cutting process allows

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.160 
know the vinyl cutting process allows
you<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.640> do<00:02:36.760> some<00:02:36.910> really<00:02:37.450> really<00:02:37.780> intricate

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
you to do some really really intricate

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.040 
you to do some really really intricate
work<00:02:38.610> whereas<00:02:39.610> printers<00:02:40.270> usually<00:02:40.720> don't<00:02:40.900> have

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
work whereas printers usually don't have

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.449 
work whereas printers usually don't have
the<00:02:41.170> same<00:02:41.350> resolution<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.010> as<00:02:42.190> long<00:02:42.280> as<00:02:42.400> you're

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
the same resolution so as long as you're

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.550 
the same resolution so as long as you're
looking<00:02:42.730> for<00:02:42.880> simple<00:02:43.180> coloration<00:02:43.780> like<00:02:43.989> one

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
looking for simple coloration like one

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.860 
looking for simple coloration like one
two<00:02:44.800> three<00:02:45.070> colors<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.580> your<00:02:45.610> design<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.209> know

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
two three colors in your design you know

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.500 
two three colors in your design you know
you<00:02:46.959> can<00:02:47.320> get<00:02:47.470> some<00:02:47.590> really<00:02:48.070> finite<00:02:49.000> complex

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
you can get some really finite complex

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.920 
you can get some really finite complex
stuff<00:02:49.780> done<00:02:50.650> from<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.100> vinyl<00:02:51.400> cutter<00:02:51.930> whereas

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
stuff done from a vinyl cutter whereas

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.630 
stuff done from a vinyl cutter whereas
if<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.080> print<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.560> even<00:02:54.070> if<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.250> highest

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
if you print it even if the highest

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.979 
if you print it even if the highest
resolution<00:02:54.850> file<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.600> doesn't<00:02:55.840> come<00:02:55.930> out

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
resolution file it doesn't come out

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.840 
resolution file it doesn't come out
looking<00:02:56.350> as<00:02:56.440> good<00:02:56.560> now<00:02:57.160> things<00:02:57.489> are<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.730> got

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
looking as good now things are you got

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.030 
looking as good now things are you got
like<00:02:58.000> gradient<00:02:58.510> colors<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.350> dozens<00:02:59.920> of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
like gradient colors and dozens of

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.220 
like gradient colors and dozens of
colors<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:01.180> know<00:03:01.300> really<00:03:01.600> really

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
colors and you know really really

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.020 
colors and you know really really
interesting<00:03:03.070> stuff<00:03:03.100> like<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.430> well<00:03:03.850> that's

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
interesting stuff like that well that's

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
place that sign their poor air i can do

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.220 
place that sign their poor air i can do
I<00:03:11.650> could<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.220> could<00:03:12.610> literally<00:03:13.030> do<00:03:13.330> that<00:03:13.630> logo<00:03:14.020> I

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
I could I could literally do that logo I

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.199 
I could I could literally do that logo I
mean<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:15.280> know<00:03:15.370> there's<00:03:15.580> only<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.820> couple<00:03:15.880> of
