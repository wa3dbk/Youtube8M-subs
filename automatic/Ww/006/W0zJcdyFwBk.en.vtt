00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:44.550 

playing<00:03:32.550> on<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.790> one

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.490 
fold them over um six envelopes six
photo<00:05:19.490> inserts<00:05:20.120> there<00:05:20.600> are<00:05:20.780> three<00:05:21.380> different

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
photo inserts there are three different

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.540

journaling<00:05:22.010> cards<00:05:22.340> three<00:05:23.200> pockets<00:05:24.200> I<00:05:24.590> think

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
journaling cards three pockets I think

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.520 
journaling cards three pockets I think
there's<00:05:25.669> a<00:05:25.760> total<00:05:26.030> of<00:05:26.090> six<00:05:26.289> circles<00:05:27.289> with

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
there's a total of six circles with

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.960 
there's a total of six circles with
writing<00:05:27.860> on<00:05:28.010> them<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:28.400> then<00:05:28.490> three<00:05:28.669> different

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
writing on them and then three different

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.710 
writing on them and then three different
designs<00:05:29.390> without<00:05:30.350> I<00:05:30.950> think<00:05:31.610> there's<00:05:32.600> probably

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
designs without I think there's probably

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.480 
designs without I think there's probably
like<00:05:33.050> 12<00:05:33.380> different<00:05:33.650> kind<00:05:33.950> of<00:05:34.010> photo<00:05:34.190> corners

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
like 12 different kind of photo corners

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.150 
like 12 different kind of photo corners
there's<00:05:34.789> a<00:05:34.850> lot<00:05:35.060> of<00:05:35.300> different<00:05:35.539> photo<00:05:35.750> corners

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
there's a lot of different photo corners

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.650 
there's a lot of different photo corners
which<00:05:37.160> are<00:05:37.310> really<00:05:37.490> nice<00:05:37.760> for<00:05:37.820> decorating<00:05:38.510> oh

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
which are really nice for decorating oh

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.170 
which are really nice for decorating oh
and<00:05:39.350> then<00:05:39.470> you<00:05:39.590> get<00:05:39.710> little<00:05:39.979> taps<00:05:40.580> too<00:05:40.850> so<00:05:41.090> if

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
and then you get little taps too so if

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.600 
and then you get little taps too so if

lot better I thought it it uh didn't
soak<00:07:16.939> up<00:07:17.089> the<00:07:17.210> ink<00:07:17.360> as<00:07:17.509> much<00:07:18.069> so<00:07:19.069> and<00:07:19.849> it's<00:07:20.060> not

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
soak up the ink as much so and it's not

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.019 
soak up the ink as much so and it's not
too<00:07:20.300> expensive<00:07:20.389> this<00:07:21.139> cost<00:07:21.649> me<00:07:21.949> there's<00:07:22.639> fifty

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:23.029 
too expensive this cost me there's fifty

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:24.219 
too expensive this cost me there's fifty
sheets<00:07:23.240> and<00:07:23.389> I<00:07:23.449> think<00:07:23.569> it<00:07:23.659> cost<00:07:23.810> me<00:07:23.960> seven

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:24.229 
sheets and I think it cost me seven

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:27.279 
sheets and I think it cost me seven
dollars<00:07:24.500> on<00:07:25.219> Amazon<00:07:25.939> so<00:07:26.389> definitely

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:27.289 
dollars on Amazon so definitely

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:28.899 
dollars on Amazon so definitely
definitely<00:07:27.889> worth<00:07:28.159> it<00:07:28.370> worth<00:07:28.460> it<00:07:28.639> for<00:07:28.669> that

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:28.909 
definitely worth it worth it for that

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:30.519 
definitely worth it worth it for that
and<00:07:29.089> it's<00:07:29.210> nice<00:07:29.389> and<00:07:29.419> thick<00:07:29.719> too<00:07:29.990> so<00:07:30.259> which<00:07:30.409> I

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:30.529 
and it's nice and thick too so which I

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.740 
and it's nice and thick too so which I
really<00:07:30.740> like<00:07:31.089> thinking<00:07:32.089> kind<00:07:32.270> of<00:07:32.330> seen<00:07:32.539> here

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750
