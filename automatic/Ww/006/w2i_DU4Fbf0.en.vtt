00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:12.289 
hey guys so in my last video I told you

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.369 
hey guys so in my last video I told you
that<00:00:12.440> my<00:00:12.619> guitar<00:00:13.519> b.o.b<00:00:14.080> had<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.169> wrong

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
that my guitar b.o.b had the wrong

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.850 
that my guitar b.o.b had the wrong
spring<00:00:15.769> in<00:00:15.889> it<00:00:16.009> so<00:00:16.699> it<00:00:16.849> was<00:00:17.680> leaking<00:00:18.680> and

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
spring in it so it was leaking and

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.300 
spring in it so it was leaking and
sucking<00:00:19.369> in<00:00:19.779> extra<00:00:20.779> air<00:00:21.410> into<00:00:21.829> the<00:00:21.949> intake

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
sucking in extra air into the intake

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.179 
sucking in extra air into the intake
that's<00:00:22.669> unmetered<00:00:23.140> so<00:00:24.140> what<00:00:24.259> I've<00:00:24.379> done<00:00:24.590> is<00:00:25.040> it

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
that's unmetered so what I've done is it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.019 
that's unmetered so what I've done is it
was<00:00:25.309> restocked<00:00:25.790> before<00:00:26.119> over<00:00:26.390> here<00:00:27.879> so<00:00:28.879> if<00:00:28.939> you

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
was restocked before over here so if you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.150 
was restocked before over here so if you
can<00:00:29.180> see<00:00:29.360> that<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:30.110> I<00:00:30.140> plugged<00:00:30.529> it<00:00:30.680> off<00:00:30.829> and

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
can see that so I plugged it off and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.260 
can see that so I plugged it off and
then<00:00:32.029> I<00:00:32.059> cut<00:00:32.509> some<00:00:32.840> of<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.110> stock<00:00:33.440> hose<00:00:34.270> which

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
then I cut some of the stock hose which

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.970 
then I cut some of the stock hose which
is<00:00:35.420> this<00:00:35.600> part<00:00:35.899> here<00:00:37.000> it<00:00:38.000> went<00:00:38.149> like<00:00:38.270> that<00:00:38.300> and

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
is this part here it went like that and

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.819 
is this part here it went like that and
they<00:00:39.980> cut<00:00:40.219> that<00:00:40.550> off<00:00:40.840> and<00:00:41.840> then<00:00:42.380> I<00:00:42.500> used<00:00:42.680> a

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
they cut that off and then I used a

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.069 
they cut that off and then I used a
boomba<00:00:43.160> Racing<00:00:43.660> adapter<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:46.960> have<00:00:47.960> it

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
boomba Racing adapter and have it

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.050 
boomba Racing adapter and have it
sitting<00:00:48.290> in<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.500> stock<00:00:48.680> pipe<00:00:48.920> there<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:49.940> it's

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
sitting in the stock pipe there but it's

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.490 
sitting in the stock pipe there but it's
now<00:00:50.239> running<00:00:50.739> vta<00:00:51.739> or<00:00:52.040> venting<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.520> atmosphere

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
now running vta or venting to atmosphere

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.040 
now running vta or venting to atmosphere
but<00:00:54.500> because<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.540> spring<00:00:56.540> isn't<00:00:56.720> strong

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
but because the spring isn't strong

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.139 
but because the spring isn't strong
enough<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:58.460> barb<00:00:59.059> is<00:00:59.210> staying<00:00:59.480> open<00:00:59.690> on<00:01:00.590> idle

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
enough the barb is staying open on idle

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.700 
enough the barb is staying open on idle
and<00:01:02.149> it's<00:01:02.300> sucking<00:01:02.540> in<00:01:02.809> unmetered<00:01:03.230> air<00:01:03.469> into

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
and it's sucking in unmetered air into

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.520 
and it's sucking in unmetered air into
the<00:01:03.829> engine<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.219> it's<00:01:04.430> clogging<00:01:05.329> and<00:01:05.540> bogging

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
the engine and it's clogging and bogging

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.830 
the engine and it's clogging and bogging
down<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.040> that<00:01:07.790> kind<00:01:07.969> of<00:01:08.000> thing<00:01:08.149> so<00:01:08.659> I'm<00:01:08.719> going

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
down and that kind of thing so I'm going

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.510 
down and that kind of thing so I'm going
to<00:01:08.899> show<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.079> how<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.259> change<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.770> spring<00:01:10.250> in

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
to show you how to change the spring in

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.230 
to show you how to change the spring in
the<00:01:11.180> tile<00:01:11.930> QR<00:01:12.829> bov<00:01:15.219> okay<00:01:16.219> so<00:01:16.280> now<00:01:16.639> we<00:01:16.700> have<00:01:16.819> our

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
the tile QR bov okay so now we have our

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.270 
the tile QR bov okay so now we have our
tile<00:01:18.170> QR<00:01:19.299> as<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:20.959> can<00:01:21.109> see<00:01:21.319> it's<00:01:21.499> the<00:01:21.709> recirc

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
tile QR as you can see it's the recirc

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.629 
tile QR as you can see it's the recirc
thing<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.649> on<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.859> bottom<00:01:25.100> there<00:01:25.219> we<00:01:25.399> have

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
thing and on the bottom there we have

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:32.440 
thing and on the bottom there we have
the<00:01:25.789> Boombah<00:01:27.219> adapter<00:01:28.219> that<00:01:28.579> we<00:01:28.729> need<00:01:31.389> okay<00:01:32.389> so

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
the Boombah adapter that we need okay so

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.510 
the Boombah adapter that we need okay so
I'm<00:01:32.689> gonna<00:01:32.779> go<00:01:32.929> ahead<00:01:32.959> and<00:01:33.350> undo<00:01:33.619> these<00:01:34.130> bolts

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
I'm gonna go ahead and undo these bolts

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:50.120 
I'm gonna go ahead and undo these bolts
on<00:01:34.609> the<00:01:34.700> top<00:01:34.729> here

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.200 

and<00:01:51.130> then<00:01:51.250> I'm<00:01:51.369> gonna<00:01:51.490> leave<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.869> opposites<00:01:54.210> in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
and then I'm gonna leave to opposites in

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:09.600 
and then I'm gonna leave to opposites in
there<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.820> then<00:02:07.090> I'm<00:02:08.080> gonna<00:02:08.229> put<00:02:08.470> pressure<00:02:08.709> on

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
there and then I'm gonna put pressure on

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:23.990 
there and then I'm gonna put pressure on
it<00:02:09.640> because<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.270> under<00:02:14.910> balancing<00:02:15.910> out

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.500 

slowly<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.630> there<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.860> 6<00:02:30.100> psi<00:02:30.610> sprint<00:02:33.510> so

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
slowly and there is the 6 psi sprint so

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.940 
slowly and there is the 6 psi sprint so
that<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.980> way<00:02:35.980> too<00:02:36.040> soft<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:40.090> attend

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
that is way too soft for the you attend

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
that is way too soft for the you attend
so<00:02:41.950> I'm<00:02:42.070> going<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.220> replace<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.549> with<00:02:42.880> this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
so I'm going to replace it with this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.449 
so I'm going to replace it with this
yellow<00:02:45.180> 11<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.299> 12<00:02:46.510> psi<00:02:46.810> spring<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.310> can

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
yellow 11 to 12 psi spring and you can

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.270 
yellow 11 to 12 psi spring and you can
see<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.700> difference<00:02:50.040> there

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
see the difference there

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.170 
see the difference there
the<00:02:51.820> yellow<00:02:51.940> one<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.150> slightly<00:02:52.390> longer<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:55.090> I'm

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
the yellow one is slightly longer so I'm

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.300 
the yellow one is slightly longer so I'm
gonna<00:02:55.299> pull<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.570> back<00:02:55.959> in<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:59.310> and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
gonna pull that back in like that and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.060 
gonna pull that back in like that and
then<00:03:00.430> I'm<00:03:00.519> gonna<00:03:00.640> put<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.880> lid<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:02.920> to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
then I'm gonna put the lid on I have to

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:11.510 
then I'm gonna put the lid on I have to
make<00:03:03.250> sure<00:03:03.519> that<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> diaphragm

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.680 

oh<00:03:11.550> my<00:03:12.360> god<00:03:12.540> that's<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:14.270> that's<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.480> lot<00:03:15.660> of

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
oh my god that's it that's a lot of

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.060 
oh my god that's it that's a lot of
pressure<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:17.490> be<00:03:17.580> quick<00:03:17.790> with<00:03:17.820> this<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.890> put

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
pressure to be quick with this to put

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.130 
pressure to be quick with this to put
that<00:03:20.220> bow<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.520> there<00:03:24.380> okay<00:03:25.380> make<00:03:25.740> sure<00:03:25.770> it's

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
that bow in there okay make sure it's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:39.980 
that bow in there okay make sure it's
aligned<00:03:36.170> in<00:03:37.220> like<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:39.450> then<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.660> get<00:03:39.810> one

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
aligned in like that and then I get one

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:49.790 
aligned in like that and then I get one
in<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.290> opposite<00:03:40.680> side<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:49.290> then<00:03:49.440> all<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.650> have

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
in the opposite side and then all I have

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.300 
in the opposite side and then all I have
to<00:03:49.890> do<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.190> go<00:03:50.370> around<00:03:50.460> the<00:03:50.760> side<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:52.310> check

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
to do is go around the side and check

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.340 
to do is go around the side and check
that<00:03:53.520> that<00:03:53.700> diaphragm<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.570> there<00:03:54.810> isn't

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
that that diaphragm in there isn't

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.410 
that that diaphragm in there isn't
poking<00:03:56.100> out<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.730> orange<00:03:57.410> rubber<00:03:58.410> diaphragm

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
poking out that orange rubber diaphragm

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.770 
poking out that orange rubber diaphragm
and<00:04:00.420> it's<00:04:00.570> not<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.920> go<00:04:02.040> ahead<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.780> start

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
and it's not so I can go ahead and start

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:22.040 
and it's not so I can go ahead and start
tightening<00:04:04.020> up<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.380> screws<00:04:04.650> again

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.760 

type

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:52.890 

I<00:04:41.879> think<00:04:42.879> so<00:04:51.210> all<00:04:52.210> right<00:04:52.270> now<00:04:52.539> I'm<00:04:52.599> just<00:04:52.720> going

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
I think so all right now I'm just going

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:24.140 
I think so all right now I'm just going
to<00:04:52.960> hand<00:04:53.409> tighten<00:04:53.650> it

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:32.279 

the<00:05:25.150> last<00:05:25.330> one<00:05:28.620> done<00:05:29.759> okay<00:05:30.759> so<00:05:30.789> now<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.960> yellow

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
the last one done okay so now the yellow

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.760 
the last one done okay so now the yellow
spring<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:32.949> in<00:05:33.099> here<00:05:33.330> which<00:05:34.330> is<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.479> 11<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.409> 12

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
spring is in here which is the 11 to 12

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.689 
spring is in here which is the 11 to 12
psi<00:05:36.159> spring<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:37.840> went<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.590> go<00:05:38.710> quickly<00:05:39.189> through

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
psi spring I went to go quickly through

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.140 
psi spring I went to go quickly through
why<00:05:40.479> I<00:05:40.509> had<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:40.960> 6<00:05:41.199> psi<00:05:41.740> spring<00:05:42.039> so<00:05:42.939> I<00:05:42.969> did<00:05:43.120> a

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
why I had the 6 psi spring so I did a

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.929 
why I had the 6 psi spring so I did a
lot<00:05:43.419> of<00:05:43.449> research<00:05:43.930> on<00:05:44.229> the<00:05:44.439> forums<00:05:45.340> and<00:05:47.939> the

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:48.939 
lot of research on the forums and the

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:52.260 
lot of research on the forums and the
the<00:05:49.389> spring<00:05:49.719> choice<00:05:50.020> was<00:05:50.349> either<00:05:50.680> 10<00:05:51.129> or<00:05:51.270> 6

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
the spring choice was either 10 or 6

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.189 
the spring choice was either 10 or 6
which<00:05:52.930> is<00:05:52.960> what<00:05:53.199> I<00:05:53.490> saw<00:05:54.599> from<00:05:55.599> most<00:05:55.840> answers

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
which is what I saw from most answers

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.439 
which is what I saw from most answers
that<00:05:56.349> were<00:05:56.440> given<00:05:56.580> and<00:05:57.580> a<00:05:57.909> lot<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.150> them<00:05:58.300> were

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
that were given and a lot of them were

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.149 
that were given and a lot of them were
the<00:05:58.719> 6<00:05:58.960> psi<00:05:59.379> spring<00:05:59.969> now<00:06:01.620> that<00:06:02.620> is<00:06:02.740> all<00:06:02.889> well

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
the 6 psi spring now that is all well

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.879 
the 6 psi spring now that is all well
and<00:06:03.190> good<00:06:03.370> if<00:06:03.729> you're<00:06:03.940> running<00:06:04.150> this<00:06:04.770> as<00:06:05.770> a

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
and good if you're running this as a

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.649 
and good if you're running this as a
recirculated<00:06:06.819> valve<00:06:07.030> because<00:06:08.669> with<00:06:09.669> the<00:06:09.879> air

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
recirculated valve because with the air

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.080 
recirculated valve because with the air
with<00:06:11.620> that<00:06:11.650> being<00:06:11.919> open<00:06:12.069> and<00:06:12.400> air<00:06:12.610> going

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
with that being open and air going

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.950 
with that being open and air going
leaking<00:06:13.990> into<00:06:14.409> the<00:06:15.270> back<00:06:16.270> into<00:06:16.479> the<00:06:16.569> intake

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
leaking into the back into the intake

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.749 
leaking into the back into the intake
even<00:06:17.650> though<00:06:17.740> it's<00:06:17.889> leaking<00:06:18.159> back<00:06:18.370> into<00:06:18.669> the

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
even though it's leaking back into the

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.360 
even though it's leaking back into the
intake<00:06:19.029> it's<00:06:19.300> been<00:06:19.479> metered<00:06:19.960> so<00:06:20.229> your<00:06:21.129> MAF

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
intake it's been metered so your MAF

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.760 
intake it's been metered so your MAF
sensor<00:06:21.960> knows<00:06:22.960> how<00:06:23.139> much<00:06:23.229> air<00:06:23.469> is<00:06:23.590> in<00:06:23.680> the

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
sensor knows how much air is in the

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.100 
sensor knows how much air is in the
engine<00:06:24.210> and<00:06:25.210> everything<00:06:25.569> is<00:06:25.840> going<00:06:25.960> to<00:06:25.990> be

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
engine and everything is going to be

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.740 
engine and everything is going to be
fine<00:06:26.379> or<00:06:27.219> as<00:06:27.370> if<00:06:27.520> you<00:06:27.729> run<00:06:28.060> it<00:06:28.330> vent<00:06:28.629> to

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
fine or as if you run it vent to

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.519 
fine or as if you run it vent to
atmosphere<00:06:30.389> it's<00:06:31.389> just<00:06:31.779> leaking<00:06:31.990> out<00:06:32.289> or

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:32.529 
atmosphere it's just leaking out or

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.390 
atmosphere it's just leaking out or
sucking<00:06:33.250> air<00:06:33.400> into<00:06:33.940> the<00:06:34.319> engine<00:06:35.319> that<00:06:36.009> hasn't

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
sucking air into the engine that hasn't

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.589 
sucking air into the engine that hasn't
gone<00:06:36.520> through<00:06:36.699> the<00:06:36.849> mass<00:06:37.000> sensor<00:06:37.330> and<00:06:37.479> been

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
gone through the mass sensor and been

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.579 
gone through the mass sensor and been
metered<00:06:38.009> so<00:06:39.009> I<00:06:39.900> don't<00:06:40.900> know<00:06:40.990> why<00:06:41.229> people

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:41.589 
metered so I don't know why people

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.879 
metered so I don't know why people
recommend<00:06:41.979> the<00:06:42.039> 6<00:06:42.219> psi<00:06:42.580> spring<00:06:42.909> but<00:06:43.210> to<00:06:43.960> me<00:06:44.139> it

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
recommend the 6 psi spring but to me it

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.469 
recommend the 6 psi spring but to me it
seems<00:06:45.129> like<00:06:45.370> anyone<00:06:45.639> should<00:06:45.909> be<00:06:46.029> getting<00:06:46.270> at

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
seems like anyone should be getting at

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.769 
seems like anyone should be getting at
least<00:06:46.509> a<00:06:46.810> 10<00:06:47.050> I<00:06:47.259> have<00:06:48.250> the<00:06:48.370> 11<00:06:48.759> in<00:06:48.849> here<00:06:49.089> just<00:06:49.629> to

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:49.779 
least a 10 I have the 11 in here just to

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:52.589 
least a 10 I have the 11 in here just to
make<00:06:49.960> sure<00:06:50.849> so<00:06:51.849> yeah<00:06:51.969> I'm<00:06:52.029> going<00:06:52.180> to<00:06:52.210> go<00:06:52.300> fit<00:06:52.509> it

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 
make sure so yeah I'm going to go fit it

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.119 
make sure so yeah I'm going to go fit it
to<00:06:52.719> the<00:06:52.810> car<00:06:53.020> and<00:06:53.289> that<00:06:54.159> will<00:06:54.430> resolve<00:06:55.029> the

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:56.129 
to the car and that will resolve the

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:59.490 
to the car and that will resolve the
math<00:06:57.129> cell<00:06:58.000> that<00:06:58.150> I<00:06:58.240> had<00:06:58.479> so<00:06:59.229> I'm<00:06:59.289> going<00:06:59.440> to

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
math cell that I had so I'm going to

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.399 
math cell that I had so I'm going to
reset<00:06:59.740> the<00:06:59.860> ECU<00:07:00.279> and<00:07:00.690> take<00:07:01.690> it<00:07:01.779> on<00:07:01.870> a<00:07:01.930> nice<00:07:02.199> long

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:02.409 
reset the ECU and take it on a nice long

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:04.290 
reset the ECU and take it on a nice long
drive<00:07:02.620> and<00:07:02.889> hopefully<00:07:03.849> everything<00:07:04.120> will<00:07:04.180> be

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
drive and hopefully everything will be

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.700 
drive and hopefully everything will be
great

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710
