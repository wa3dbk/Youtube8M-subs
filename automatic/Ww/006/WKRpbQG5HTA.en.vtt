with that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.660 
with that
and<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:58.949> his<00:00:59.190> claw<00:00:59.489> part<00:01:00.289> spins<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.550> way

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and then his claw part spins all the way

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.630 
and then his claw part spins all the way
around<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:04.739> that's<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> same<00:01:05.369> with

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

both them sell nothing to do this one

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.310 
both them sell nothing to do this one
and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:09.320> his<00:01:10.320> tail<00:01:11.119> wobbles<00:01:12.200> not<00:01:13.200> really

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
and then his tail wobbles not really

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.249 
and then his tail wobbles not really
move<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.890> pretty<00:01:17.280> stiff<00:01:17.869> but<00:01:18.869> that's<00:01:19.080> with

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
move it's pretty stiff but that's with

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.320 
move it's pretty stiff but that's with
all<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.619> his<00:01:19.770> articulation<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.090> stiff

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
all of his articulation so really stiff

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.039 
all of his articulation so really stiff
articulation<00:01:22.140> God<00:01:23.040> let's<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.880> five<00:01:24.720> points

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
articulation God let's see five points

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.539 
articulation God let's see five points
of<00:01:25.140> articulation<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.479> his<00:01:27.479> claws<00:01:27.869> I'd<00:01:28.710> say

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
of articulation and his claws I'd say

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.039 
of articulation and his claws I'd say
are<00:01:30.560> probably<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.860> least<00:01:32.670> stiff<00:01:33.240> part<00:01:33.600> and

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
are probably the least stiff part and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.710 
are probably the least stiff part and
this<00:01:34.259> towel<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.700> horribly<00:01:35.700> stiff<00:01:38.299> X<00:01:39.299> will<00:01:39.570> go

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
this towel is horribly stiff X will go

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.660 
this towel is horribly stiff X will go
into<00:01:40.100> sizing<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> let's

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.480 

I<00:01:47.170> lift<00:01:48.170> this<00:01:48.290> up<00:01:52.360> first<00:01:53.360> I'll<00:01:53.689> be<00:01:53.810> sizing<00:01:54.170> with

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
I lift this up first I'll be sizing with

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.499 
I lift this up first I'll be sizing with
Van<00:01:55.490> Dyke<00:01:55.670> creations<00:01:56.149> final<00:01:56.600> worst<00:01:56.750> Godzilla

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
Van Dyke creations final worst Godzilla

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.060 
Van Dyke creations final worst Godzilla
so<00:01:59.509> this<00:01:59.659> is<00:01:59.840> pretty<00:02:00.140> good<00:02:00.320> sizing

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
so this is pretty good sizing

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.789 
so this is pretty good sizing
I'd<00:02:01.369> say<00:02:01.700> Godzilla<00:02:02.630> needs<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.930> be<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.110> little

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
I'd say Godzilla needs to be a little

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.789 
I'd say Godzilla needs to be a little
bit<00:02:03.950> taller<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.539> a<00:02:05.539> little<00:02:05.930> bit<00:02:06.080> like<00:02:06.350> offer
