00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.000
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.000
Brightly shown the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.000
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.000
Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.000
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.500
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.000
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.000
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.300
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.000
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.170
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.490
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.000
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.819
In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.400
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing
