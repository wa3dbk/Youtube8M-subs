like<00:01:19.670> twisting<00:01:20.329> and<00:01:20.479> turning<00:01:20.630> but<00:01:20.960> once<00:01:21.110> I

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
like twisting and turning but once I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.480 
like twisting and turning but once I
start<00:01:21.409> turning<00:01:21.710> this<00:01:21.829> way<00:01:21.979> now<00:01:22.159> it's<00:01:22.280> gonna<00:01:22.399> be
