00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.320 
let it boil hard for about one minute
during<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.710> process<00:02:06.979> you're<00:02:07.970> going<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.179> get

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
during that process you're going to get

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.060 
during that process you're going to get
some<00:02:08.570> foam<00:02:08.840> rising<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.619> surface<00:02:09.800> and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
some foam rising to the surface and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.930 
some foam rising to the surface and
you're<00:02:10.190> going<00:02:10.340> you're<00:02:10.520> going<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.700> want<00:02:10.880> to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
you're going you're going to want to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.820 
you're going you're going to want to
skim<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.450> off<00:02:11.660> once<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.350> turn<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.680> burner

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
skim that off once you turn the burner

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.330 
skim that off once you turn the burner
off

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
off

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.490 
off
so<00:02:13.880> once<00:02:14.150> we've<00:02:14.330> skimmed<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.810> foam<00:02:15.050> from<00:02:15.410> the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
so once we've skimmed the foam from the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.140 
so once we've skimmed the foam from the
strawberry<00:02:15.980> mixture<00:02:16.340> it's<00:02:16.550> time<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:17.000> add<00:02:17.120> a

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
strawberry mixture it's time to add a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.610 
strawberry mixture it's time to add a
second<00:02:17.750> thickener<00:02:18.110> we're<00:02:18.320> going<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.500> add<00:02:18.590> a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
second thickener we're going to add a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.229 
second thickener we're going to add a
little<00:02:18.800> bit<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.010> cornstarch<00:02:19.610> that's<00:02:19.970> been

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
little bit of cornstarch that's been

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.420 
little bit of cornstarch that's been
thinned<00:02:20.570> with<00:02:20.690> water<00:02:21.080> we're<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.220> whisk

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
thinned with water we're going to whisk

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.260 
thinned with water we're going to whisk
that<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.980> bring<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.280> back<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> boil<00:02:25.970> and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
that in and bring it back to a boil and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.199 
that in and bring it back to a boil and
it's<00:02:26.450> going<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.810> thicken<00:02:27.140> very<00:02:27.530> very<00:02:27.770> quickly

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
it's going to thicken very very quickly

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.280 
it's going to thicken very very quickly
once<00:02:29.209> you've<00:02:29.390> got<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:29.780> mixture<00:02:30.140> is

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
once you've got this mixture is

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.780 
once you've got this mixture is
thickened<00:02:30.620> now<00:02:30.920> all<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.280> need<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.459> do<00:02:31.640> is

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
thickened now all you need to do is

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.310 
thickened now all you need to do is
flavor<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.330> we're<00:02:32.600> going<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.780> add<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.959> little

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320
