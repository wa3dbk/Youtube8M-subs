00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.270
 no no no 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.369
 these pastas are quite consumed by 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.289
 people who come alone or students 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.570
 since for its practical way of preparing 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.279
 simplifies the task of cooking only in 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.410
 a couple of minutes and they're ready to 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.579
 serve but pay close attention and today 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.579
 would be called into question 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.380
 the complexity of this situation is that 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.960
 According to some university studies 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.870
 of Harvard and the University of Eugene 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.820
 in korea would not be so beneficial and 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.830
 that the consumption of these pastes so 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.870
 less twice a week could 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.780
 generate risks mainly women 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.570
 students coles 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.670
 university students who abuse more or sometimes 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.239
 the people who are in the office that 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.400
 they are the ones who abuse the most of this daily 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.840
 do not consume more than three times to the 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.559
 week 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.960
 because if you eat a food that 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.089
 comillas only has a contribution of 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.149
 carbohydrates and the rest are 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.390
 flavors obviously you can introduce 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.390
 a factor 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.219
 damage by not consuming the food 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.259
 foods that have a quantity of 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.149
 protein vitamins 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.490
 videos that have revolutionized in terms 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.590
 culinary mainly in Japan where 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.810
 because they are quite practical and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.000
 fillers are considered as one of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.340
 the most outstanding inventions of the 21st century 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.990
 if you have never used them 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.090
 attention to the method 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.790
 first pour hot water until the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.530
 half of the container then you should cover it 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.780
 and keep it closed for 3 minutes 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.409
 then stir and you 're ready 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.039
 to eat like that is how they work 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.319
 if you have a mono diet in which 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.600
 you're only going to always have noodles and 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.630
 the flavorings and a few proteins 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.429
 going around you're not going to meet or go to 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 have the requirements that you 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.539
 body needs to be able to function 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.549
 and less what the system needs 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.130
 nervous also in the case of 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.580
 students that is the most point 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.739
 important because they by the haste 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.040
 they quickly need something fast 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.750
 ingest and continue in your activity but 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.640
 as I said these pastas would not be 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.579
 recommended mainly for 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.989
 women who would be most affected already 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.700
 that would be more exposed to suffer 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.950
 diseases like diabetes or problems 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.069
 to the heart for its cholesterol levels 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.280
 and chemicals a single food you can 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.290
 reach a state of malnutrition 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.940
 associated with malnutrition 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.579
 special because it's not malnutrition 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.019
 in which you look skinny or thin 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.090
 extremely thin but you're going to 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.250
 see even chubby because you have a 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.390
 amount of carbohydrates that does not 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.280
 it is less 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.740
 you do not have the other factors that you 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.140
 you need you that are part of the 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.040
 proteins and the amount of fatty acids 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.040
 required 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.220
 it seems wrong to me I should have the content 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.240
 should not produce this damage from a 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.340
 food 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.080
 for these snapshots that are today 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.080
 being observed by organisms of 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.640
 health for its components subject that according to 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.770
 experts from universities like harvard 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.840
 could be harmful to women 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.840
 mainly its chemicals
