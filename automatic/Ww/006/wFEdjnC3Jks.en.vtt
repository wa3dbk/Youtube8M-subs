00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
run so what I recommend doing first is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.100 
run so what I recommend doing first is
you<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.530> -<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.660> dashing

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you just - with it because with dashing

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.600 
you just - with it because with dashing
I<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.500> press<00:00:52.710> board<00:00:53.100> forward<00:00:53.460> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
I have to do is press board forward to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.220 
I have to do is press board forward to
get<00:00:53.760> out<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> actually<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:54.930> back

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
get out of it actually you know back

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.450 
get out of it actually you know back
that's<00:00:55.469> way<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.710> well<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:55.980> you'll<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.370> do

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that's way as well so you'll have to do

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.970 
that's way as well so you'll have to do
all<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.120> -<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.170> would<00:00:58.500> recommend<00:00:58.620> just

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
all this for - so I would recommend just

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.110 
all this for - so I would recommend just
asking<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.370> instead<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.850> trying<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
asking what instead of just trying to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.490 
asking what instead of just trying to
run<00:01:00.300> through<00:01:00.539> things<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> little<00:01:01.289> bit

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
run through things just a little bit

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
run through things just a little bit
more<00:01:01.710> difficult<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.520> out<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.329> people

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
more difficult to get out and for people

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
more difficult to get out and for people
who<00:01:03.660> play<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> MK<00:01:04.320> 9<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> don't<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.280> like

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
who play the MK 9 I don't really like

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.960 
who play the MK 9 I don't really like
the<00:01:05.790> run<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.030> mechanic<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.479> don't<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> down

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
the run in mechanic or don't get it down

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.510 
the run in mechanic or don't get it down
quite<00:01:08.970> yet<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.810> would<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.229> easier<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.680> -

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
quite yet it would be easier to just -

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160 
quite yet it would be easier to just -
when<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> first<00:01:12.180> learn<00:01:12.450> try<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:12.900> want<00:01:13.020> how<00:01:13.080> to

when you first learn try not want how to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.399 
when you first learn try not want how to
do<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:14.630> practice<00:01:15.630> getting<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.200> out

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
do it so just practice getting that out

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.200 
do it so just practice getting that out
do<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.040> slow<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.820> charge<00:01:18.119> this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
do it really slow so you can charge this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.820 
do it really slow so you can charge this
for<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.720> long<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.170> definitely<00:01:19.500> better<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
for really long so definitely better you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.070 
for really long so definitely better you
can<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.659> simple<00:01:21.840> just

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.490 
can just do that it's really simple just

that<00:01:41.680> after<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:42.250> get<00:01:42.369> it<00:01:42.460> get<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:42.909> down<00:01:43.150> with

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
that after you get it get it down with

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.670 
that after you get it get it down with
the<00:01:43.330> -<00:01:43.600> thing<00:01:43.840> now<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.080> want<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.320> practice<00:01:44.590> the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
the - thing now you want to practice the

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.200 
the - thing now you want to practice the
running<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.070> want<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.400> practice<00:01:45.520> getting

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
running so you want to practice getting

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.500 
running so you want to practice getting
it<00:01:46.390> with<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.570> running<00:01:46.900> so<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.000> same

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
it with the running so just the same

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.950 
it with the running so just the same
thing<00:01:49.720> with<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.990> -<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:51.070> practice<00:01:51.520> solely<00:01:51.960> then

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
thing with the - to practice solely then

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.170 
thing with the - to practice solely then

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
just run after it so after you get that

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.940 
just run after it so after you get that
down<00:01:55.420> I'm<00:01:56.080> going<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.350> try<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.470> implement<00:01:56.619> it

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
down I'm going to try to implement it

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.969 
down I'm going to try to implement it
into<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.220> string<00:01:57.550> or<00:01:57.850> combo<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:59.320> string<00:01:59.830> I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
into a string or combo so the string I

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.350 
into a string or combo so the string I
recommend<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.520> try<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.790> do<00:02:00.970> this<00:02:01.119> with

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
recommend you try to do this with

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.320 
recommend you try to do this with
because<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.840> this<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.830> longer<00:02:03.729> study<00:02:03.970> has<00:02:04.180> on

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
because of this the longer study has on

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.969 
because of this the longer study has on
it<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.600> one<00:02:05.259> one<00:02:05.409> two<00:02:05.619> like<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:06.789> see<00:02:07.210> all<00:02:07.240> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it is one one two like you see all that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.260 
it is one one two like you see all that
it's<00:02:08.979> really<00:02:09.250> easy<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.489> fall<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.820> with<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.060> so

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
it's really easy to fall it with it so

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.690 
it's really easy to fall it with it so
the<00:02:10.929> string<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.200> one<00:02:11.680> one<00:02:11.860> two<00:02:12.070> fireball

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
the string is one one two fireball

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.530 
the string is one one two fireball
cancel<00:02:13.420> into<00:02:13.690> one<00:02:14.530> one<00:02:14.739> two<00:02:15.239> back<00:02:16.239> for

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
cancel into one one two back for

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.390 
cancel into one one two back for
triangle<00:02:17.170> what<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.350> do<00:02:17.470> whatever<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:18.160> wanted

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
triangle what you do whatever you wanted

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.590 
triangle what you do whatever you wanted
but<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.880> one<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.330> one<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.480> would

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
but this one is that one I would

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.290 
but this one is that one I would
recommend<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.860> beginners<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:22.060> was<00:02:22.180> like

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
recommend for beginners so it was like

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.990 
recommend for beginners so it was like
this<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:23.620> instead<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:24.130> going<00:02:24.370> trying<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.910> go

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
this now instead just going trying to go

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.060 
this now instead just going trying to go
straight<00:02:25.540> into<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> string<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.800> want<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
straight into the string you want the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.229 
straight into the string you want the
same<00:02:27.250> thing<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.459> were<00:02:27.550> doing<00:02:27.580> earlier<00:02:27.880> you

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
same thing you were doing earlier you

same thing you were doing earlier you
just<00:02:28.420> want<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.600> do<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.560> one<00:02:30.040> one<00:02:30.250> two<00:02:30.489> two

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
just want to do the one one two two

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.670 
just want to do the one one two two
fireball<00:02:31.420> don't<00:02:31.660> even<00:02:31.840> cancel<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.260> just<00:02:32.500> make

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
fireball don't even cancel it just make

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.870 
fireball don't even cancel it just make

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.320 
stun it
so<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.000> can<00:03:25.150> continue<00:03:25.420> with<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.660> pressure<00:03:25.930> so

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
so you can continue with the pressure so

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.420 
so you can continue with the pressure so
if<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:28.570> get<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.900> first<00:03:29.380> string<00:03:29.650> down<00:03:29.830> just

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
if you get the first string down just

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.030 
if you get the first string down just
instead<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.060> doing<00:03:31.570> back<00:03:31.750> forward<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.620> just<00:03:32.890> do

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
instead of doing back forward to just do

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:43.170 
instead of doing back forward to just do
back<00:03:33.310> for<00:03:33.550> four<00:03:33.820> so<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:41.850> that's<00:03:42.850> what<00:03:43.150> I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
back for four so like so that's what I

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.000 
back for four so like so that's what I
recommend<00:03:43.300> you<00:03:43.720> doing<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.320> get<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.739> down

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
recommend you doing to get that down

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.790 
recommend you doing to get that down
just<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.610> get<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.880> full<00:03:46.480> fireball<00:03:47.410> council

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
just to get the full fireball council

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.770 
just to get the full fireball council
down<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.220> after<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.820> get<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.060> down<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.420> the

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
down and after you get that down to the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:04:00.810 
down and after you get that down to the
combo<00:03:57.390> stuff<00:03:58.390> like<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:58.750> so<00:03:59.430> as<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.640> can<00:04:00.760> see

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
combo stuff like that so as you can see

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.290 
combo stuff like that so as you can see
the<00:04:01.300> council<00:04:02.140> has<00:04:02.350> good<00:04:03.010> damage<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.670> adds<00:04:03.880> good

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
the council has good damage it adds good

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.830 
the council has good damage it adds good
mix<00:04:04.570> up<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:05.019> if<00:04:05.170> they<00:04:05.470> bought<00:04:05.769> this<00:04:06.130> part

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
mix up because if they bought this part

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.150 
mix up because if they bought this part
they<00:04:07.840> blocked<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.200> first<00:04:08.470> move<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:09.010> they<00:04:09.100> see

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
they blocked the first move and they see

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.290 
they blocked the first move and they see
that<00:04:09.370> canceled<00:04:09.850> they're<00:04:09.970> going<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.180> be

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
that canceled they're going to be

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.150 
that canceled they're going to be
shocked<00:04:10.690> enough<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:12.280> let<00:04:12.430> go<00:04:12.580> that<00:04:12.760> block<00:04:13.000> so

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
shocked enough to let go that block so

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.069 
shocked enough to let go that block so
like<00:04:15.160> so<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.610> this<00:04:16.540> move<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:16.930> actually

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
like so and this move is actually

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.800 
like so and this move is actually
overhead<00:04:17.560> so<00:04:18.549> if<00:04:18.640> they<00:04:18.760> block<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.299> low<00:04:19.450> that's

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
overhead so if they block and low that's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.460 
overhead so if they block and low that's
the<00:04:19.989> easy<00:04:20.229> follower<00:04:20.919> for<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.510> just<00:04:22.510> get<00:04:22.870> fifty

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
the easy follower for you just get fifty

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.940 
the easy follower for you just get fifty
