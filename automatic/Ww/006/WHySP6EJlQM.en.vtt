prefer it neat to adding water but

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:29.560 
prefer it neat to adding water but
adding<00:07:27.590> water<00:07:27.800> does<00:07:28.070> open<00:07:28.430> it<00:07:28.520> up<00:07:28.669> and<00:07:29.150> gives

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570 
adding water does open it up and gives

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.230 
adding water does open it up and gives
