call<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> lot<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.100> offer

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
call it but they do have a lot to offer

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.850 
call it but they do have a lot to offer
in<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.850> playbook<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.380> not<00:02:01.409> checked

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
in this playbook if you have not checked

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.200 
in this playbook if you have not checked
out<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> Chiefs<00:02:02.399> playbook<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.030> would

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
out the Chiefs playbook I would

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.609 
out the Chiefs playbook I would
definitely<00:02:03.360> recommend<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.170> offense

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
definitely recommend it on offense

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620 
definitely recommend it on offense
