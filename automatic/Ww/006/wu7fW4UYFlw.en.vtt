display now let's first rotate this one

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.260 
display now let's first rotate this one
90<00:00:46.770> degrees<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.280> move<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> bit<00:00:48.090> here

and you see we can't see anything if I

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.229 
and you see we can't see anything if I
was<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.350> texture<00:00:52.649> view<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.030> one

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
was going to texture view you can on one

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.930 
was going to texture view you can on one
side<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:55.350> let's<00:00:55.620> hit<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> Z<00:00:55.980> again<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
side now let's hit the Z again to go and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.010 
side now let's hit the Z again to go and
Z<00:00:57.270> again<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:58.050> go<00:00:58.199> into<00:00:58.469> solid<00:00:58.890> mode<00:00:59.840> let's<00:01:00.840> go

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
Z again to go into solid mode let's go

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.500 
Z again to go into solid mode let's go
here<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.230> say<00:01:01.410> textured<00:01:01.890> solid<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:03.300> see

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
here and say textured solid you see

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.390 
here and say textured solid you see
there<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.960> go

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
there we go

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
there we go
already<00:01:05.970> great<00:01:06.210> step<00:01:06.450> now<00:01:07.049> let's<00:01:07.290> scale<00:01:07.560> this

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
already great step now let's scale this

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
already great step now let's scale this
by<00:01:07.950> three<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.570> remember<00:01:09.570> you're<00:01:09.720> skilled

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
by three and remember you're skilled

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
by three and remember you're skilled

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
especially because you want the Eldar I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.950 
especially because you want the Eldar I
made<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> reference<00:01:12.990> image<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.770> big<00:01:14.960> so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
made a reference image to be as big so

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.670 
made a reference image to be as big so
there<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:18.000> let's<00:01:18.299> file<00:01:18.810> import

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
there we have this now let's file import

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.850 
there we have this now let's file import
images<00:01:20.520> planes<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.570> I'm<00:01:22.259> going<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> import

images planes and I'm going to import

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.240 
images planes and I'm going to import
the<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:23.580> view<00:01:24.049> I'm<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.500> move<00:01:26.100> them

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the right view I'm going to move them

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.859 
the right view I'm going to move them
out<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:27.590> let's<00:01:28.590> rotate<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.640> 90<00:01:29.850> degrees<00:01:30.659> on

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
out here let's rotate them 90 degrees on

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.640 
out here let's rotate them 90 degrees on

so the first thing you can do is make

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.840 
so the first thing you can do is make
them<00:02:00.540> unselectable<00:02:01.310> which<00:02:02.310> makes<00:02:02.549> them<00:02:02.729> not

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
them unselectable which makes them not

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.770 
them unselectable which makes them not
selectable<00:02:03.530> I'm<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> geez<00:02:05.100> oh<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.780> think

my graphics card is bugging of it ok so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.210 
my graphics card is bugging of it ok so
now<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.440> select<00:02:10.619> them<00:02:10.940> well

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
now we can select them well

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.820 
now we can select them well
that's<00:02:14.220> fixed<00:02:14.820> now<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:16.230> now<00:02:16.350> if<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.560> would<00:02:16.710> go

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
that's fixed now but now if I would go

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.440 
that's fixed now but now if I would go
into<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.040> few<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.240> editing<00:02:18.660> my<00:02:18.840> cube<00:02:19.440> I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
into a few and I was editing my cube I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.920 
into a few and I was editing my cube I
couldn't<00:02:21.450> see<00:02:21.980> now<00:02:22.980> let's<00:02:23.490> select<00:02:23.930> these

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
couldn't see now let's select these

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.750 
couldn't see now let's select these
planes<00:02:25.230> let's<00:02:25.890> first<00:02:26.040> take<00:02:26.220> them<00:02:26.400> selectable

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
planes let's first take them selectable

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.430 
planes let's first take them selectable
then<00:02:27.210> select<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.630> plane<00:02:27.810> go<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.290> object

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
then select the plane go to the object

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.250 
then select the plane go to the object
tab<00:02:28.910> go<00:02:29.910> into<00:02:30.120> display<00:02:30.860> hit<00:02:31.860> transparency

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
tab go into display hit transparency

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.440 
tab go into display hit transparency
same<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.459> now<00:02:36.120> look<00:02:36.330> what

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
same one on this one now look what

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.050 
same one on this one now look what
happened<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.910> kind<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.330> watch<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.750> them

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
happened you can kind of watch to them

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.490 
happened you can kind of watch to them
so<00:02:42.060> if<00:02:42.180> you'd<00:02:42.330> everything<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:43.440> not

so if you'd everything it's not
completely<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:44.880> what<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.120> want<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.420> do<00:02:45.510> is

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
completely it but what you want to do is

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.240 
completely it but what you want to do is
select<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.230> cube<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.709> hit<00:02:47.370> x-ray<00:02:48.500> now<00:02:49.500> let's

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
select the cube and hit x-ray now let's

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.430 
select the cube and hit x-ray now let's
make<00:02:50.459> them<00:02:50.700> not<00:02:50.910> selectable<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.420> launch<00:02:52.320> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
make them not selectable and launch a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.190 
make them not selectable and launch a
side<00:02:52.650> view<00:02:52.680> there<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.610> go<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.900> how<00:02:55.020> you

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
side view there you go this is how you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.460 
side view there you go this is how you
would<00:02:55.830> make<00:02:56.489> them<00:02:56.700> work<00:02:57.630> greatly<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.320> can

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
would make them work greatly you can

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.510 
would make them work greatly you can
look<00:02:58.620> through<00:02:58.770> them<00:02:58.950> and<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:02.459> you

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
look through them and this is how you

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.810 
look through them and this is how you
set<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:03.540> image<00:03:04.260> planes<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:05.070> correct<00:03:05.400> way

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
set up image planes the correct way

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.450 
set up image planes the correct way
thank
