00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
few flaws you have to consider well

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.170 
few flaws you have to consider well
again<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.200> sky<00:02:30.440> he's<00:02:30.739> six<00:02:31.069> feet<00:02:31.310> tall<00:02:31.550> which<00:02:32.060> a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
again the sky he's six feet tall which a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.910 
again the sky he's six feet tall which a
little<00:02:32.450> short<00:02:32.660> for<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.900> goalkeeper<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.560> coming

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
little short for a goalkeeper so coming

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.740 
little short for a goalkeeper so coming
out<00:02:34.070> on<00:02:34.190> corners<00:02:34.520> he<00:02:34.910> does<00:02:35.060> not<00:02:35.210> do<00:02:35.360> well<00:02:35.480> long

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
out on corners he does not do well long

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.930 
out on corners he does not do well long
shots<00:02:36.020> can<00:02:36.260> dip<00:02:36.440> over<00:02:36.590> his<00:02:36.740> head<00:02:36.920> at<00:02:37.400> times<00:02:37.700> so

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
shots can dip over his head at times so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.280 
shots can dip over his head at times so
I<00:02:37.970> would<00:02:38.270> keep<00:02:38.390> him<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.750> corners<00:02:39.110> but

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
I would keep him in that corners but

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.190 
I would keep him in that corners but
even<00:02:39.950> sometimes<00:02:40.370> wouldn't<00:02:40.670> keep<00:02:40.760> them<00:02:40.880> in

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
even sometimes wouldn't keep them in

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.300 
even sometimes wouldn't keep them in
they<00:02:42.200> go<00:02:42.320> over<00:02:42.440> his<00:02:42.560> head<00:02:42.590> as<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.950> saw<00:02:43.160> it

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
they go over his head as you saw it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.430 
they go over his head as you saw it
there<00:02:43.430> long<00:02:43.700> shot<00:02:43.970> goes<00:02:44.240> off<00:02:44.510> top<00:02:44.990> right<00:02:45.200> so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
there long shot goes off top right so

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.960 
there long shot goes off top right so
take<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:46.010> consideration<00:02:46.040> while<00:02:46.760> getting

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
take that in consideration while getting

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.270 
take that in consideration while getting
this<00:02:47.150> last<00:02:47.360> game<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.750> season<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.440> think<00:02:48.770> for

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
this last game of the season I think for

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.640 
this last game of the season I think for
now<00:02:49.460> this<00:02:50.360> guy<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.720> solid<00:02:51.140> goalkeeper<00:02:51.590> to

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
now this guy is a solid goalkeeper to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.930 
now this guy is a solid goalkeeper to
have<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:52.010> your<00:02:52.190> league<00:02:52.370> up<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:52.670> need<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.790> be<00:02:52.910> a

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
have on your league up you need to be a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.540 
have on your league up you need to be a
squad<00:02:53.240> or<00:02:53.450> your<00:02:53.600> span<00:02:53.870> squad<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:55.340> would

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
squad or your span squad and I would

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.370 
squad or your span squad and I would
definitely<00:02:56.270> recommend<00:02:56.390> getting<00:02:56.840> him<00:02:57.170> but

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
definitely recommend getting him but

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.920 
definitely recommend getting him but
he's<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> little<00:02:58.220> short<00:02:58.400> as<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.760> said<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.330> he's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
he's a little short as I said but he's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.360 
he's a little short as I said but he's
still<00:03:00.200> better<00:03:00.380> on<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.590> court<00:03:00.740> walk<00:03:01.040> coming

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
still better on the court walk coming

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.170 
still better on the court walk coming
out<00:03:02.770> much<00:03:03.770> better<00:03:03.950> courts<00:03:04.370> wah<00:03:04.520> he's<00:03:04.700> faster

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
out much better courts wah he's faster

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.120 
out much better courts wah he's faster
than<00:03:05.210> Courtois<00:03:05.750> as<00:03:05.930> well<00:03:06.170> he's<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.650> pretty<00:03:06.890> fast

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
than Courtois as well he's a pretty fast

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.460 
than Courtois as well he's a pretty fast
goalkeeper<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.180> as<00:03:08.330> I've<00:03:08.510> emphasized<00:03:09.200> good

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
goalkeeper and as I've emphasized good

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.920 
goalkeeper and as I've emphasized good
diving<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.010> good<00:03:10.190> reflexes<00:03:10.820> I'm<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.630> finesse

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
diving and good reflexes I'm a finesse

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.180 
diving and good reflexes I'm a finesse
shot<00:03:11.960> right<00:03:12.290> there<00:03:12.320> makes<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.830> save<00:03:13.010> it's

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
shot right there makes the save it's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.040 
shot right there makes the save it's
handling<00:03:13.640> or<00:03:13.850> twice<00:03:14.090> handling<00:03:14.630> is<00:03:14.780> better

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
handling or twice handling is better

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.920 
handling or twice handling is better
than<00:03:15.680> Valdez<00:03:16.310> on<00:03:16.670> he's<00:03:17.390> still<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.660> solid

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
than Valdez on he's still a solid

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.350 
than Valdez on he's still a solid
handling<00:03:18.440> but<00:03:18.530> his<00:03:18.650> handling<00:03:19.100> isn't<00:03:19.360> amazing

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
handling but his handling isn't amazing

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.270 
handling but his handling isn't amazing

have to concern those and getting this
guy<00:03:39.260> but<00:03:39.530> overall<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.040> don't<00:03:40.310> think<00:03:40.490> it<00:03:40.580> affects

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
guy but overall I don't think it affects

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.990 
guy but overall I don't think it affects
in<00:03:41.240> getting<00:03:41.930> him<00:03:42.050> he<00:03:42.200> goes<00:03:42.350> for<00:03:42.650> about<00:03:42.819> 90<00:03:43.819> care

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000

right<00:03:44.150> now<00:03:44.180> on<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.510> Xbox<00:03:44.870> 360<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.680> think

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
right now on the Xbox 360 so I think

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.200 
right now on the Xbox 360 so I think
he's<00:03:46.069> definitely<00:03:46.340> worth<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.730> money<00:03:46.910> which<00:03:47.090> is

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
he's definitely worth the money which is

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.410 
he's definitely worth the money which is
why<00:03:47.390> I'm<00:03:47.690> giving<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.170> nine<00:03:48.500> point<00:03:48.800> three
