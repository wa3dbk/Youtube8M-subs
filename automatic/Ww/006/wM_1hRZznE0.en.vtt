okay this is where

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.450 
okay this is where
we're<00:00:10.300> undertaking<00:00:10.540> this<00:00:10.930> experiment<00:00:11.470> that's

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
we're undertaking this experiment that's

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.910 
we're undertaking this experiment that's
the<00:00:12.580> Mediterranean<00:00:13.150> over<00:00:13.330> there<00:00:13.480> and<00:00:13.600> he

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
the Mediterranean over there and he

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.170 
the Mediterranean over there and he
since<00:00:15.160> the<00:00:15.280> Atlas<00:00:15.490> Mountains<00:00:15.910> of<00:00:17.070> northern

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
since the Atlas Mountains of northern

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.920 
since the Atlas Mountains of northern
Africa<00:00:19.180> and<00:00:21.119> there's<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.270> mountain<00:00:23.460> above<00:00:24.460> me

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
Africa and there's the mountain above me

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.290 
Africa and there's the mountain above me
this<00:00:25.930> is<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.170> house<00:00:26.349> on<00:00:27.420> mountains<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.730> right

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
this is the house on mountains and right

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.830 
this is the house on mountains and right
at<00:00:31.449> the<00:00:31.539> top<00:00:31.779> you<00:00:32.280> can<00:00:33.280> see<00:00:33.820> just<00:00:34.480> kind<00:00:34.720> of

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
at the top you can see just kind of

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.119 
at the top you can see just kind of
poking<00:00:35.230> out<00:00:35.350> up<00:00:35.530> there<00:00:35.739> is<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:37.860> storage<00:00:38.860> tank

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
poking out up there is the storage tank

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.890 
poking out up there is the storage tank
of<00:00:39.550> one<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.000> nethers<00:00:40.270> there's<00:00:40.660> two<00:00:40.809> up

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
of one of the nethers there's two up

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.920 
of one of the nethers there's two up
there<00:00:41.050> they're<00:00:41.260> three<00:00:41.410> thousand<00:00:41.830> liters<00:00:42.400> each

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
there they're three thousand liters each

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.570 
there they're three thousand liters each
right<00:00:43.930> so<00:00:44.199> created<00:00:44.980> this<00:00:45.100> attach<00:00:45.370> up<00:00:45.550> here<00:00:45.790> and

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
right so created this attach up here and

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.710 
right so created this attach up here and
using<00:00:48.580> the<00:00:48.670> wood<00:00:48.850> was<00:00:49.180> pretty<00:00:49.420> essential

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
using the wood was pretty essential

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.500 
using the wood was pretty essential
screw<00:00:50.170> it<00:00:50.260> in<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.379> center<00:00:50.769> and<00:00:51.150> then<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:52.360> can

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
screw it in the center and then you can

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.229 
screw it in the center and then you can
start<00:00:52.750> with<00:00:52.870> just<00:00:53.019> one<00:00:53.170> piece<00:00:53.409> not<00:00:53.650> across<00:00:53.949> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
start with just one piece not across and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.969 
start with just one piece not across and
roll<00:00:55.239> them<00:00:55.390> around<00:00:55.589> standing<00:00:56.589> on<00:00:56.680> them<00:00:56.799> as<00:00:56.890> you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
roll them around standing on them as you

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.860 
roll them around standing on them as you
do<00:00:57.129> it<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.460> then<00:00:58.239> intermittently<00:00:59.140> screw<00:01:00.870> them

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
do it and then intermittently screw them

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.469 
do it and then intermittently screw them
down<00:01:01.900> to<00:01:02.860> hold<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.339> all<00:01:03.430> together<00:01:03.549> the<00:01:04.089> second

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
down to hold it all together the second

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.930 
down to hold it all together the second
of<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:05.409> pieces<00:01:06.010> of<00:01:06.190> wood<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.490> make<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.729> cross

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
of the pieces of wood to make the cross

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.600 
of the pieces of wood to make the cross
was<00:01:07.570> put<00:01:07.810> in<00:01:07.900> when<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.200> got<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.500> about<00:01:08.830> here<00:01:08.890> and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
was put in when it got to about here and

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.370 
was put in when it got to about here and
then<00:01:10.119> it<00:01:10.210> was<00:01:10.299> getting<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.510> bit<00:01:10.540> unruly<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.320> it

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
then it was getting a bit unruly and it

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.660 
then it was getting a bit unruly and it
needs<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.619> be<00:01:11.680> held<00:01:11.920> down<00:01:11.979> in<00:01:12.280> four<00:01:12.490> places

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
needs to be held down in four places

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.060 
needs to be held down in four places
rather<00:01:13.060> than<00:01:13.210> just<00:01:13.390> two<00:01:13.600> right<00:01:14.470> connected<00:01:14.950> up

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
rather than just two right connected up

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.050 
rather than just two right connected up
and<00:01:16.030> output<00:01:16.390> there<00:01:16.659> it's<00:01:17.110> connected<00:01:18.060> very

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
and output there it's connected very

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
and output there it's connected very
temporarily<00:01:20.219> and<00:01:21.219> to<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.579> hose<00:01:21.759> which<00:01:22.509> is<00:01:22.659> here

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
temporarily and to a hose which is here

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.630 
temporarily and to a hose which is here
that<00:01:24.250> then<00:01:24.430> goes<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:26.250> output<00:01:27.250> at<00:01:27.520> the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
that then goes to the output at the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.929 
that then goes to the output at the
bottom<00:01:27.969> here<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:29.189> there's<00:01:30.189> an<00:01:30.280> underground<00:01:30.460> v

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
bottom here and there's an underground v

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.630 
bottom here and there's an underground v
that<00:01:31.689> works<00:01:31.929> its<00:01:32.170> way<00:01:32.350> up<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.280> top<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.579> the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
that works its way up to the top of the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.139 
that works its way up to the top of the
mountain<00:01:33.969> there<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.549> is<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.820> idea<00:01:37.090> of

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
mountain there this is the idea of

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.050 
mountain there this is the idea of
putting<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:38.009> plastic<00:01:39.009> tubes<00:01:39.429> on<00:01:39.640> top<00:01:39.880> of

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
putting the plastic tubes on top of

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.219 
putting the plastic tubes on top of
rusty<00:01:40.810> metal<00:01:40.840> or<00:01:41.320> maybe<00:01:41.920> painted<00:01:42.429> black<00:01:42.640> metal

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
rusty metal or maybe painted black metal

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.289 
rusty metal or maybe painted black metal
this<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:45.539> temperature<00:01:46.539> is<00:01:47.049> rising<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:48.299> 112

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
this is the temperature is rising to 112

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.480 
this is the temperature is rising to 112
now<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.530> thermometer<00:01:50.710> isn't<00:01:51.219> the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
now and that the thermometer isn't the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.919 
now and that the thermometer isn't the
right<00:01:51.640> type<00:01:51.909> really<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.329> not<00:01:52.539> in<00:01:52.719> direct

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
right type really is not in direct

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.370 
right type really is not in direct
contact<00:01:53.530> with<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:54.039> metal<00:01:54.640> but<00:01:55.359> that's<00:01:55.539> quite

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
contact with the metal but that's quite

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.639 
contact with the metal but that's quite
a<00:01:56.409> high<00:01:56.710> temperature<00:01:57.539> for<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:59.020> pipes<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.439> sit

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
a high temperature for the pipes to sit

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.399 
a high temperature for the pipes to sit
on<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.939> said<00:02:01.299> it's<00:02:01.600> certainly<00:02:01.929> too<00:02:02.109> hard<00:02:02.319> to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
on it said it's certainly too hard to

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.270 
on it said it's certainly too hard to
touch<00:02:02.649> a<00:02:03.210> temperature<00:02:04.210> away<00:02:04.990> from<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.499> rusty

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
touch a temperature away from the rusty

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.590 
touch a temperature away from the rusty
Spade<00:02:06.909> is<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:09.520> on<00:02:09.610> for<00:02:09.759> ninety<00:02:10.210> ish<00:02:10.360> I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
Spade is going on for ninety ish I

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.860 
Spade is going on for ninety ish I
suppose<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.530> top<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.920> gravel<00:02:12.810> okay<00:02:13.810> so

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
suppose on top of the gravel okay so

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.180 
suppose on top of the gravel okay so
after<00:02:14.700> about<00:02:15.700> 10<00:02:16.090> 15<00:02:16.330> minutes<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.920> pipes

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
after about 10 15 minutes the the pipes

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.059 
after about 10 15 minutes the the pipes
are<00:02:18.550> they're<00:02:19.330> hard<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.750> me<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.960> can<00:02:20.140> just

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
are they're hard to me you can just

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.250 
are they're hard to me you can just
about<00:02:21.280> keep<00:02:21.520> your<00:02:21.640> hands<00:02:21.910> on<00:02:22.030> them<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
about keep your hands on them and the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.360 
about keep your hands on them and the
water<00:02:23.849> temperature<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:26.500> says<00:02:26.860> there<00:02:27.190> that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
water temperature it says there that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.880 
water temperature it says there that
it's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
it's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.570 
it's
going<00:02:28.130> up<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.990> 105<00:02:30.280> ish

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
going up to 105 ish

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.740 
going up to 105 ish
so<00:02:32.350> obviously<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:34.610> working<00:02:34.820> it's<00:02:35.390> heating

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
so obviously it's working it's heating

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.970 
so obviously it's working it's heating
up<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.990> water<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.350> said<00:02:36.560> right<00:02:36.710> certainly

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
up the water and I said right certainly

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.510 
up the water and I said right certainly
to<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.430> what<00:02:37.580> it's<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:38.090> top<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:39.520> some

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
to see what it's like on top of some

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.660 
to see what it's like on top of some
hotter<00:02:40.970> surface<00:02:41.480> Mike<00:02:41.690> Mike<00:02:42.470> rusty<00:02:43.190> metal<00:02:43.340> a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
hotter surface Mike Mike rusty metal a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.090 
hotter surface Mike Mike rusty metal a
dark<00:02:44.150> metal

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.610 

just<00:02:48.000> testing<00:02:48.330> me<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.810> quantity<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.290> flow<00:02:49.470> that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
just testing me so quantity of flow that

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.180 
just testing me so quantity of flow that
comes<00:02:49.830> out<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:53.700> water<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.270> far<00:02:54.840> too<00:02:55.050> hot<00:02:55.320> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
comes out this water is far too hot to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.130 
comes out this water is far too hot to
put<00:02:57.090> your<00:02:57.210> hands<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.600> there<00:02:57.750> it's<00:02:57.930> really

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
put your hands in there it's really

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.670 
put your hands in there it's really
getting<00:02:58.410> hot<00:02:58.560> now<00:02:58.710> so<00:03:00.050> let<00:03:01.050> me<00:03:01.080> get<00:03:01.230> flow<00:03:01.470> like

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
getting hot now so let me get flow like

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.130 
getting hot now so let me get flow like
this<00:03:01.980> that's<00:03:02.760> 110<00:03:03.420> degrees<00:03:03.780> hundred<00:03:04.320> eleven

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
this that's 110 degrees hundred eleven

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.330 
this that's 110 degrees hundred eleven
as<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.290> say<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.620> thermometer<00:03:07.890> isn't

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
as I say this thermometer isn't

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.530 
as I say this thermometer isn't
particularly<00:03:08.670> accurate<00:03:08.910> 112<00:03:11.210> you'd<00:03:12.210> have<00:03:12.390> to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
particularly accurate 112 you'd have to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.750 
particularly accurate 112 you'd have to
add<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.990> full<00:03:13.620> fair<00:03:13.860> bit<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.100> cold<00:03:14.340> water<00:03:14.580> to

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
add a full fair bit of cold water to

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.920 
add a full fair bit of cold water to
that<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.710> I<00:03:16.710> would<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.490> thought<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.970> this

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
that and I would have thought that this

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.350 
that and I would have thought that this
is<00:03:19.140> just<00:03:19.380> after<00:03:19.560> 50<00:03:20.160> 10-15<00:03:20.730> minutes<00:03:21.260> of

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
is just after 50 10-15 minutes of

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.060 
is just after 50 10-15 minutes of
exposure<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.810> Sun<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.620> water<00:03:25.860> had

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
exposure to the Sun if this water had

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.120 
exposure to the Sun if this water had
now<00:03:26.360> through<00:03:27.360> some<00:03:27.630> sort<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:28.130> thermostatic

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
now through some sort of thermostatic

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.030 
now through some sort of thermostatic
valve<00:03:29.160> being<00:03:29.910> fed<00:03:30.150> off<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.710> the<00:03:31.710> storage

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
valve being fed off to the storage

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.390 
valve being fed off to the storage
device<00:03:32.430> as<00:03:33.230> Delta<00:03:34.230> cap<00:03:34.440> very<00:03:35.040> sensibly

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
device as Delta cap very sensibly

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.840 
device as Delta cap very sensibly
suggested<00:03:36.050> then<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:38.040> really<00:03:38.310> would<00:03:38.490> have

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
suggested then you really would have

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.910 
suggested then you really would have
some<00:03:39.180> serious<00:03:39.780> hot<00:03:39.960> water<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.620> would<00:03:40.710> last

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
some serious hot water that would last

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.680 
some serious hot water that would last
right<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.030> night<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:42.390> fact<00:03:42.570> it'll

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
right for the night in fact it'll

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.270 
right for the night in fact it'll
probably<00:03:42.750> last<00:03:43.080> for<00:03:43.350> added<00:03:43.980> properly

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
probably last for added properly

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.490 
probably last for added properly
insulated<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.060> best<00:03:45.240> for<00:03:45.450> 24<00:03:46.020> hours<00:03:46.200> so

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
insulated for the best for 24 hours so

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:55.400 
insulated for the best for 24 hours so
now<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.920> up<00:03:51.350> 214<00:03:52.520> so<00:03:53.520> I<00:03:54.110> suppose<00:03:55.110> just

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
now that is up 214 so I suppose just

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.910 
now that is up 214 so I suppose just
with<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.830> you're<00:03:57.230> sort<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.500> way<00:03:58.650> through<00:03:58.890> a

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
with that you're sort of a way through a

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.390 
with that you're sort of a way through a
shower

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
shower

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.100 
shower
I<00:03:59.550> suppose<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:01.530> cold<00:04:01.950> water<00:04:02.220> from<00:04:02.700> the

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
I suppose the cold water from the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.170 
I suppose the cold water from the
gravity-fed<00:04:04.250> tank<00:04:05.250> storytimes<00:04:05.820> at<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.000> top

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
gravity-fed tank storytimes at the top

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:14.420 
gravity-fed tank storytimes at the top
is<00:04:06.330> pushing<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:07.440> heated<00:04:07.830> water<00:04:08.780> along<00:04:13.430> 113

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
is pushing this heated water along 113

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.800 
is pushing this heated water along 113
now<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:14.880> it's<00:04:14.970> dropping<00:04:15.150> slightly<00:04:15.510> as

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
now so it's dropping slightly as

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.680 
now so it's dropping slightly as
probably<00:04:16.320> some<00:04:16.470> cold<00:04:16.680> water<00:04:16.859> starting<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.690> mix

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
probably some cold water starting to mix

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.560 
probably some cold water starting to mix
you<00:04:18.840> know<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.320> know<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.190> there's<00:04:20.520> a<00:04:20.580> you<00:04:21.510> know

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
you know I know that there's a you know

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.960 
you know I know that there's a you know
there's<00:04:21.660> more<00:04:22.250> there's<00:04:23.250> more<00:04:23.310> pipe<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
there's more there's more pipe in the

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.820 
there's more there's more pipe in the
Sun<00:04:24.150> here<00:04:24.330> including<00:04:24.840> also<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.170> yellow<00:04:25.440> pipe

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
Sun here including also the yellow pipe

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.320 
Sun here including also the yellow pipe
so<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:27.450> will<00:04:27.630> be<00:04:28.490> heating<00:04:29.490> dropping<00:04:30.180> down

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
so that will be heating dropping down

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.880 
so that will be heating dropping down
site<00:04:30.570> now<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:30.750> fits<00:04:31.110> like<00:04:31.320> dropping<00:04:31.740> down

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
site now and fits like dropping down

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.760 
site now and fits like dropping down
slightly<00:04:32.130> M<00:04:33.110> 112<00:04:35.630> still<00:04:36.630> far<00:04:37.200> too<00:04:37.230> hot<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.650> put

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
slightly M 112 still far too hot to put

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.100 
slightly M 112 still far too hot to put
your<00:04:37.890> hands<00:04:38.010> in<00:04:40.460> remember<00:04:41.460> this<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.730> only<00:04:41.790> from

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
your hands in remember this is only from

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.470 
your hands in remember this is only from
1880<00:04:43.110> meters<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:45.780> 25<00:04:46.290> mil<00:04:46.730> tube<00:04:47.730> that's<00:04:47.970> 25

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
1880 meters of of 25 mil tube that's 25

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.270 
1880 meters of of 25 mil tube that's 25
mil<00:04:48.780> external<00:04:49.290> diameter<00:04:49.470> internal<00:04:50.100> diameter

mil external diameter internal diameter

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.790 
mil external diameter internal diameter
it's<00:04:50.790> three-and-a-half<00:04:51.680> millimeters<00:04:52.680> its

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
it's three-and-a-half millimeters its

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.640 
it's three-and-a-half millimeters its
size<00:04:53.010> for<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:53.970> war<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.720> that's<00:04:55.080> seven<00:04:55.530> off

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
size for the war so that's seven off

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.010 
size for the war so that's seven off
that's<00:04:56.430> 18<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.300> radius<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.960> nine<00:05:00.020> millimeters

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
that's 18 the radius of nine millimeters

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.780 
that's 18 the radius of nine millimeters
do<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.040> maths<00:05:03.800> 106<00:05:04.800> now<00:05:05.900> yeah<00:05:06.900> just<00:05:07.500> about

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
do the maths 106 now yeah just about

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.150 
do the maths 106 now yeah just about
keep<00:05:08.790> your<00:05:08.880> hand<00:05:09.030> within<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.710> 100<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:10.740> 300<00:05:12.050> -

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
keep your hand within that 100 and 300 -

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.080 
keep your hand within that 100 and 300 -
that's<00:05:14.160> getting<00:05:14.460> on<00:05:14.550> for<00:05:14.729> blood<00:05:14.880> temperature

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
that's getting on for blood temperature

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.909 
that's getting on for blood temperature
now<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:18.030> stropping<00:05:18.300> down<00:05:18.540> now<00:05:18.750> 90<00:05:20.060> 97<00:05:21.919> still

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
now and I stropping down now 90 97 still

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.219 
now and I stropping down now 90 97 still
a<00:05:22.950> good<00:05:23.160> shower<00:05:23.400> temperature<00:05:24.020> okay<00:05:25.020> that's

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
a good shower temperature okay that's

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.050 
a good shower temperature okay that's
the<00:05:25.410> first<00:05:25.740> stage<00:05:25.979> of<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.340> experiment<00:05:26.580> over<00:05:26.910> I

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
the first stage of the experiment over I

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.200 
the first stage of the experiment over I
guess<00:05:27.410> so<00:05:28.440> we've<00:05:28.890> been<00:05:29.010> able<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.220> produce<00:05:29.850> some

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
guess so we've been able to produce some

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.750 
guess so we've been able to produce some
sort<00:05:30.419> of<00:05:30.570> silver<00:05:31.140> coil

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
sort of silver coil

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.040 
sort of silver coil
being<00:05:32.760> able<00:05:32.820> to<00:05:32.910> test<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.419> indeed<00:05:33.900> the

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
being able to test that indeed the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.510 
being able to test that indeed the
temperature<00:05:34.440> does<00:05:34.620> get<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.950> a<00:05:35.010> very<00:05:35.220> usable

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
temperature does get to a very usable

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.440 
temperature does get to a very usable
temperature<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:37.500> next<00:05:37.800> stage<00:05:38.419> will<00:05:39.419> be

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
temperature and the next stage will be

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.190 
temperature and the next stage will be
setting<00:05:40.290> it<00:05:40.380> up<00:05:40.500> so<00:05:41.190> that<00:05:41.400> it's<00:05:41.610> out<00:05:42.450> of<00:05:42.510> the

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
setting it up so that it's out of the

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.880 
setting it up so that it's out of the
way<00:05:43.350> of<00:05:43.380> everything<00:05:43.890> and<00:05:44.960> probably<00:05:45.960> having<00:05:46.710> it

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
way of everything and probably having it

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.969 
way of everything and probably having it
up<00:05:47.100> here<00:05:47.490> somewhere<00:05:47.940> so<00:05:48.470> that<00:05:49.470> it<00:05:49.620> can<00:05:49.830> be

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
up here somewhere so that it can be

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.830 
up here somewhere so that it can be
gravity<00:05:50.490> fed<00:05:50.960> down<00:05:51.960> to<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.500> house<00:05:53.840> the

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
gravity fed down to the house the

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.090 
gravity fed down to the house the
problem<00:05:55.110> were<00:05:55.169> going<00:05:55.290> to<00:05:55.350> have<00:05:55.500> of<00:05:55.620> course<00:05:55.650> is

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
problem were going to have of course is

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.920 
problem were going to have of course is
where<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.430> store<00:05:56.760> it<00:05:56.940> once<00:05:57.360> it<00:05:57.540> comes<00:05:57.720> down

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
where to store it once it comes down

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:08.460 
where to store it once it comes down
here<00:05:58.370> but<00:05:59.370> that's<00:05:59.820> the<00:05:59.970> next<00:06:00.150> stage

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.530
