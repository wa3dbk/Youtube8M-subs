00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Max TOKI 353 is the last train bound for Niigata on the Joetsu Shinkansen. This train reaches Niigata at 23:59.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Mainly business oriented travelers uses this train to the Niigata terminal.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The KITAGUNI is the overnight sleeper express train connecting Osaka and Niigata.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The KITAGUNI is one of the two JR's "regular" express train(*) and sole regular 583 Series train.

*At June 2011, JR's regular express trains are KITAGUNI (connecting Osaka and Niigata) and HAMANASU (connecting Aomori and Sapporo).

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This 583 Series train, called the world's first sleeper "electric train", is over 40 years old.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
However, the old express train remains perennial favorites, because this train consolidates many facilities like coach car, Green car (first-class seating car), A-class sleeping car (first-class double-deck bed car), and B-Class sleeping car (second-class triple-deck bed car) in one train,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
stops many stations and runs during nighttime.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.050
Just to entertain myself....

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.000
...I got on the B-class (second-class) sleeping car.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The doors is bifold type to maintain sleeper's space.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
B-class sleeping car is triple-deck bed car. There is an aisle at the center, and beds is along each side of the aisle.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I used this middle bed this time.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This is the curtain-closed middle bed. There is few height to sit up.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Passengers on the B-class car can use pillow, blanket, sheet, bathrobe(kimono), clothes hanger, and slipper.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It is too narrow for claustrophobe to use this bed.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
There is a space to vent on the curtain.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
There is a overhead reading light next to the pillow.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The small window is sliding type.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
From the outside, this window is here.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So, passengers can look at outside like periscope.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
This is the view of B-class sleeping car on the express KITAGUNI. That's it.
