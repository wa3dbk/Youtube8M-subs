00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:14.459
 hello youtube friends let's see in 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:17.830
 this time a tripod a tripod sorry 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:21.360
 home that we are going to occupy 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.950
 the base of an old disk drive 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.950
 the taste of your records 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.469
 the pure base then with the hot 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.140
 the hot silicone in case you come 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.140
 finish two leagues 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.500
 let's buy two cds caps 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.490
 a plate of 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.490
 of a cel 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.300
 and one and the top of a piece 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.300
 in front of little ball 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.250
 to cut 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:13.330
 and we also made the bases of the three 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.560
 and the covers of the shyris 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.560
 we are going to start 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.220
 I had already done it 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.220
 and we have four parts left and we have a 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.220
 part 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:34.600
 3 together with the base of it 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.610
 of the floppy disk drive and we put there apologize 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.610
 sorry we fear 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.480
 of this stage of civilians 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.640
 we do not see a cover 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.640
 and more or less we put hot silicone 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.580
 in the middle 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.689
 we put it since we put the silicone in 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.880
 the cover cover we stick to the base 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.880
 the floppy disk would be more or less like this 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:15.850
 then we take on good people 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.500
 and we also put you on with 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.120
 currently here 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.660
 and that we put the wounded in hot 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:29.230
 quickly we hit it from the ssp more or 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.230
 less in the middle of the part of this 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.680
 now we wait 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.209
 now we are waiting for a mouse and we are already waiting 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.840
 and specific we take again silicone 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.580
 hot and we put here I'm going to have to 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.349
 put pause for almost nothing I will not be able to 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.770
 but we put silicone here in the 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:02.070
 center machine center 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:06.780
 well now we take another tapa as 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:10.130
 this one and we paste it in the center it is dry 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:15.880
 we take the two elastic bands 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:19.740
 and we put them here because they are 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.460
 at every turn 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.460
 we wait 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:33.060
 since it is dry we take the last base 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:37.130
 we already have the base is 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.130
 and we are going to paste it like this 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.070
 well with the assistance they have there 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.290
 inside because we stick it 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.000
 let it dry 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.170
 l 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.870
 we take the regular measure 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.050
 in this in the courtyard of my people 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.080
 with the marker 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.410
 since we have the cell phone measurement 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.710
 we make a line at least medium 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.070
 centimeter or one centimeter shorter in 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.070
 mobile 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.730
 and here we are cutting them with some 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.370
 scissors 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:23.850
 We ordain the central part around 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:27.510
 a little bit more along the contour 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.030
 and I have cut we are going to cut little to 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.500
 little to the extent of your cell phone until 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.590
 reach and can withstand everything and then 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.420
 we continue and then since everything is 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.270
 we no longer hit and then but 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.920
 let's cut out the exact measurement of the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.110
 height of this thing 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.370
 and we shortened to be able to reverse everything 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.480
 secure now we have to bet the 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.300
 measurement of the transparent base 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.140
 all the measures we hit it get 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:04.290
 with the hot across the cell 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.290
 we paste it and then it would be ready 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.820
 but we are already operating when a door 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.550
 it opens to write 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.740
 we remember them and we're going to hit it like that 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.620
 so that it does not move 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.900
 but if we put two small ones you want 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.700
 2. 3 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.420
 this and this 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.130
 two small 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.660
 and this we already have our guys 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:36.030
 our tripods finished if they see 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.780
 I already have it with my brother 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.780
 while 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:50.050
 I just invented it I did not even 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.050
 we hope that I know a little 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.760
 in this is completely seen the 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.060
 image 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.060
 above 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:22.750
 and friends who do and comment and if 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.389
 they have other ideas that I want to lose 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.550
 let's say something and I do it good to do 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:33.970
 soon 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:37.900
 this me on the internet when he called me 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:41.820
 cold 50 thousand 6 but here alternating and 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.820
 Well, until the next friends
