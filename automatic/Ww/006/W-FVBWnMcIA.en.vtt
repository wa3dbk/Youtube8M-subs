00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.019
 with other guys here doctor moles in a 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.059
 more video of main 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:10.900
 today we will see what this little thing is for 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.049
 that here I have that is called 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.990
 Quartz is worth then that the quartz 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.619
 It will serve to make these little things the 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.619
 comparators 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.890
 I do not remember what version came out and did not 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.280
 I have an idea which we're just going to 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.210
 find in this 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.300
 in the middle 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.750
 new logics and it's going to come out that way 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.420
 then to make a comparator 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.260
 we have to use redstone torches and 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.120
 we have to put it 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.120
 in this easy way 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.050
 in base 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.290
 and then the quartz barrel that comes out 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.290
 directly 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.940
 once we have it 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.750
 and for many things 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.750
 for example 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.310
 let's use stone 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.630
 what anybody 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.990
 or no no I do not want to destroy myself and very 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.990
 little bit 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.680
 OK 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.270
 we put something that has value if you 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.259
 They want to put something 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.259
 for example tnte 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.950
 we put the chest first 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.760
 we put the chest first then we put 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.540
 the value of four diamonds 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.540
 worth not 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.170
 but what is 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.260
 we use a torch 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.630
 is here now 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.630
 once 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.840
 the value 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.840
 automatically these things 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.150
 dt 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.150
 whatever you want 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.780
 it was male uncle 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.230
 as you can see there he 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.719
 the chest we put a value what 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.189
 but wants something worthwhile places 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:05.210
 in any block of forces 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:07.410
 flat they put a comparator looking 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.410
 Y 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.010
 what is your name 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.010
 has 3 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.310
 normalizes 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.609
 have to look 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.190
 and those that have here as well as how 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.190
 like the other thing 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.350
 you look at the block 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.880
 to the 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.880
 the chest explains it 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.890
 put in another block 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.790
 will be turned off 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.320
 tnt or something that has to do with the 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.320
 ton networks then 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.670
 so you know 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.660
 so that the torches stay off 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.660
 and so 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.290
 I repeat the process for those who 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.800
 do not remember what the comparator was like 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:21.980
 but they can return the video and 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.280
 remember that's also how it is with the three 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.850
 torches here like this in this way 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.850
 Y 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.040
 three stones 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.590
 three stones like this 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.590
 a quarter in between 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:45.520
 three torches leave the corners alone 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.960
 ok then they also serve us for 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.960
 make blocks 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:57.380
 blocks very bullfighters the truth 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.380
 how were the blocks the shell 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.200
 I think they go like this 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.180
 yes perfect was born 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.690
 4 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.690
 Y 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:26.420
 for each bone that you put, then they're going to 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.420
 to give a block not 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:37.530
 7 13 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 1 2 3 4 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.349
 do not 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:51.729
 after blocks 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.420
 to drink 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:05.400
 I think so 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.400
 and so 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:17.350
 and you can not do any other type of 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:22.440
 of blocks I do not remember how they were and if 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.440
 you put all this here 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:28.449
 it comes out 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.449
 by a step 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.630
 so a step of quartz comes out 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:40.910
 I do not remember how it was anymore 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:44.150
 and well, it was already night 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.150
 well then 

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.730
 I hope you liked this video if 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:52.020
 it was like that from lake subscribe comments 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.950
 share this I hope it has served you 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.790
 I hope so 

00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:00.940
 It is worth this short because not the time 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:04.200
 to record this say that I'm here 

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.200
 well at fair 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:11.770
 I have with a little time then I'm going to 

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.770
 get out more after a while then it's worth 

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.130
 bye
