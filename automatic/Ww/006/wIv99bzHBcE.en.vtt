was I don't know what rank they are but

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.960 
was I don't know what rank they are but
that's<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.800> top<00:02:31.980> 20<00:02:32.340> team<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.760> country

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:07.099 
those guys in the locker room I guess

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:08.469

you<00:08:07.220> know<00:08:07.280> no<00:08:07.430> one<00:08:07.550> gave<00:08:07.699> us<00:08:07.819> a<00:08:07.849> chance<00:08:08.120> to<00:08:08.300> come

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.649 
in here and and then that got a little
could<00:08:10.669> pee<00:08:10.789> but<00:08:10.970> I<00:08:11.030> think<00:08:11.240> I<00:08:11.389> thought<00:08:11.569> we

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:11.659 
could pee but I think I thought we

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:14.530
