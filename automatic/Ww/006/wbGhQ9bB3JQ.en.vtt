and<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.789> means<00:00:24.029> everything<00:00:24.510> has<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.930> work

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
and that means everything has to work

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.560 
and that means everything has to work
perfectly<00:00:25.769> now<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> things<00:00:27.359> that's

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
perfectly now one of the things that's

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259 
perfectly now one of the things that's
frequently<00:00:27.990> overlooked<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.090> something<00:00:30.090> that

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
frequently overlooked is something that

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.740 
frequently overlooked is something that
most<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:31.890> most<00:00:32.099> cars<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.239> that

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
most not all but most cars have and that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.740 
most not all but most cars have and that
is<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.320> cabin<00:00:34.829> air<00:00:35.070> filter<00:00:35.579> filters<00:00:36.300> all<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is a cabin air filter filters all of the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.540 
is a cabin air filter filters all of the
air<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.140> comes<00:00:37.410> into<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> inside<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
air that comes into the inside of the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.660 
air that comes into the inside of the
car<00:00:38.760> well<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.200> dirty<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:41.250> block

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
car well as they get dirty they block

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.400 
car well as they get dirty they block
the<00:00:41.940> amount<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.300> air<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.780> circulate

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the amount of air that can circulate

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.170 
the amount of air that can circulate
through<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> car<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.250> reduces<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
through the car and that reduces the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.779 
through the car and that reduces the
cooling<00:00:46.010> efficiency<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.610> air

cooling efficiency of the air
conditioning<00:00:48.450> system<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.739> car<00:00:50.010> has<00:00:50.039> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
conditioning system so if your car has a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.700 
conditioning system so if your car has a
cabin<00:00:50.789> air<00:00:50.940> filter<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.989> AC<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.469> not

cabin air filter and the AC is not
working<00:00:52.770> properly<00:00:53.390> well<00:00:54.390> check<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> cabin

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
working properly well check the cabin

working properly well check the cabin
air<00:00:55.469> filter<00:00:55.920> first<00:00:56.250> next<00:00:57.239> thing<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.600> something

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
air filter first next thing is something

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.610 
air filter first next thing is something
that<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.469> all<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.250> time<00:00:59.489> this<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
that we see all the time this is a

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.619 
that we see all the time this is a
condenser<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.340> mounted<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:02.969> ahead<00:01:03.480> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
condenser it is mounted up here ahead of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
condenser it is mounted up here ahead of
the<00:01:03.719> radiator<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:05.040> front<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the radiator right in the very front of

the radiator right in the very front of
the<00:01:05.610> car<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:07.229> gets<00:01:07.500> rid<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.979> heat<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the car and it gets rid of the heat that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370 
the car and it gets rid of the heat that
is<00:01:08.640> picked<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.090> by<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.450> air<00:01:09.750> conditioning

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
is picked up by the air conditioning

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.820 
is picked up by the air conditioning
system<00:01:10.860> inside<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> car<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:13.049> let's<00:01:13.560> take<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
system inside the car now let's take a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
system inside the car now let's take a
peek<00:01:14.130> at<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.729> we'll<00:01:14.909> put<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.090> light

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
peek at this one we'll put a light

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.380 
peek at this one we'll put a light
behind<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.340> move<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.880> light<00:01:18.060> down

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
behind it and as we move the light down

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.990 
behind it and as we move the light down
we<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> when<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.130> down<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
we see that when we get down here in the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.480 
we see that when we get down here in the
middle<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.720> light<00:01:21.960> goes<00:01:22.290> away<00:01:22.320> nothing<00:01:23.130> is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
middle the light goes away nothing is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.160 
middle the light goes away nothing is
coming<00:01:23.790> through<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.990> means<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
coming through that means that the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.120 
coming through that means that the
center<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.950> condenser<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.320> blocked<00:01:31.320> now

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
center of this condenser is blocked now

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.319 
center of this condenser is blocked now
why<00:01:32.369> does<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> happen

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
why does that happen

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.359 
why does that happen
well<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.049> happens<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.770> there's<00:01:35.250> an

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
well it happens because there's an

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
well it happens because there's an
electric<00:01:35.790> cooling<00:01:36.180> fan<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.960> pushing

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
electric cooling fan that's pushing

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.340 
electric cooling fan that's pushing
stuff<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.220> through<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.970> spot<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.200> all

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
stuff right through this spot and it all

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.020 
stuff right through this spot and it all
collects<00:01:40.829> there<00:01:41.189> blocks

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
collects there blocks

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.960 
collects there blocks
air<00:01:42.150> flow<00:01:42.659> over<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.170> period<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.680> time<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
air flow over a period of time now the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
air flow over a period of time now the
other<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.509> happens<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.409> very

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
other thing that happens is this is very

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
other thing that happens is this is very
close<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> radiator<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.270> leaves<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
close to the radiator and leaves and

debris pile up between the condenser and
the<00:01:52.439> radiator<00:01:52.979> how<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.939> keep<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.329> clean

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the radiator how do you keep it clean

you'd<00:02:25.800> find<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.820> don't<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.690> gauge

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
you'd find that you don't have one gauge

you'd find that you don't have one gauge
you<00:02:28.800> actually<00:02:29.340> have<00:02:29.610> two<00:02:30.000> gauges<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.750> low<00:02:31.350> side

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you actually have two gauges a low side

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.910 
you actually have two gauges a low side
or<00:02:32.040> low<00:02:32.430> pressure<00:02:32.730> gauge<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:34.050> high<00:02:34.260> side<00:02:34.590> or

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
high pressure gauge and it's the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.250

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
comparison between these two that tell

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.550 
comparison between these two that tell
you<00:02:40.500> how<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.640> system<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.240> working<00:02:42.560> now

you how the system is working now
another<00:02:44.070> thing<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.270> have<00:02:45.420> no<00:02:45.660> way<00:02:45.840> to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
another thing is that you have no way to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.920 
another thing is that you have no way to
measure<00:02:46.290> how<00:02:47.070> much<00:02:47.750> refrigerant<00:02:48.750> you're

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
measure how much refrigerant you're

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.010 
measure how much refrigerant you're
putting<00:02:49.350> into<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.950> system<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.720> right

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
putting into the system and the right

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.780 
conditioning system these days is
absolutely<00:02:57.180> critical<00:02:57.590> that's<00:02:58.590> why<00:02:58.950> we<00:02:59.459> have

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
absolutely critical that's why we have

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.140 
absolutely critical that's why we have
scales<00:03:00.450> like<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.230> one<00:03:01.440> very<00:03:02.220> very<00:03:02.550> precise

scales like this one very very precise
so<00:03:04.140> precise<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.550> we<00:03:05.700> put<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.120> quarter

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
so precise that if we put this quarter

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.500 
so precise that if we put this quarter
on<00:03:06.870> here<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.920> actually<00:03:08.280> measure<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
on here we can actually measure the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.680 
on here we can actually measure the
weight<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.260> quarter<00:03:10.709> now<00:03:11.400> we<00:03:11.790> use<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.420> to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690
