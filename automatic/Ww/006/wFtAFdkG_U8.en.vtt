00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 so hanover invites you to a new video 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.940
 and this time it's not about 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.620
 tutorial or to an ultimately or 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.519
 similar but just a good one too 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.900
 know video 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.219
 I happened to have the thought myself 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.389
 can imagine the whole time 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.490
 already in the world looks a bit 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.619
 whimsical I made them myself 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.779
 namely the following namely generally so 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.789
 the raw material distribution in the ground where what 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.830
 where to find diamonds where to find 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 find redstone where to find travel 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.920
 where do you find me in front of coal and so on 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.510
 was then immediately this I mean 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.910
 randomized world taken and one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.070
 a little bit away from it you can see 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.950
 still so very roughly here, the upper the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 thing now remaining are the times 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.350
 Originally times the surface 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 have formed 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.160
 that means here was once a normal normal 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.270
 Therefore some of the organic snow is still needed 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.890
 I let everyone stand 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.660
 So blocks away about that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.000
 normal height can realize that he is the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.710
 For example, grass was floating now 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.800
 the case just yet normally the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.989
 ground and yes otherwise are first 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.120
 all or all of them are all around 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.359
 has been removed that is normal 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.510
 queenston the way gremmel has been made 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.010
 sand and clay has been made away 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.080
 be stone gone so well 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.280
 all the blocks are actually mine now 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.299
 do not like to see you when you are 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.670
 focusing on the raw material distribution 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.049
 wants to focus and among others 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.220
 you will also find dungeons here 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.070
 it has remained quiet that is 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.360
 does not disconnect itself and yes me 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.710
 but would take a break now 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.600
 fly through the individual 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.640
 mining work off what you where on 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.409
 best finds our country immediately who 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.430
 Of it also like to convince yourself 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.270
 I want to be able to get the web 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.009
 download 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.540
 I have uploaded to mediafile 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.860
 the link to it in the video description 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.530
 you can pull yourself and maybe yourself 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970
 here by bavaria and you times that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.380
 look at everything they find so 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.200
 gives 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.509
 Here we are to look we are 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.399
 now on bedrock layer positions off 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.820
 and then comparatively you will find so 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.890
 stuff 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.229
 Meanwhile, a bit further up 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.210
 directly below the surface just so convincing 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.369
 So movies follow you can do it 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.990
 already see some coal and iron there 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.219
 it in rough amounts on the surface 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.530
 if I now just so 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.000
 watch that I do a lot and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.649
 my goodness if you imagine here 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.149
 there you can already jump back and forth 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.460
 By the way , only a lot of doctors is still there 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.380
 if problem what you have removed 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.149
 that is very very generous 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.879
 you might even get spread 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.380
 not so common but really 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.420
 come a mining 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.090
 but damn often front surface so 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.460
 Here you can really see iron ore heaps 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.930
 of iron ore and coal on coal and 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.030
 everywhere coal coal became that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.190
 eye is enough you can start to 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 of course, sing an iron exactly 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.660
 the same thing I would say iron and coal 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.580
 is almost equally distributed in the crowd 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.590
 Let's start here up here 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.750
 Here is the top tip of coal 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.470
 Maybe this is the normal one 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.770
 level 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.540
 we are now on layer 69 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.600
 and down you will find a lot 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.430
 generates accordingly at mountains 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.810
 it would have to follow would have to be there 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.940
 the raw materials still a bit further 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.160
 pulled up over the normal with just 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.200
 you will see here in the background that is 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.210
 also anna bergspitze I say now 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.650
 which is above the normal height I will 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.330
 also find coal as for example 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.910
 Of course, these are clear again 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.160
 continue above 74 paragraph clearly further 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.260
 but it looks different 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.990
 okay so if you have a bit 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.330
 we still find each one lower 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.860
 lots of other things preferred then comes 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.090
 I think so first of all from the height 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.440
 pay attention if you break such a 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.540
 gold goes down and love is coming 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.620
 So slow in the area you will be like that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.400
 say player 31 or so is love is already 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.860
 to find 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.630
 Gold is also about as of the 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.330
 area must be on the y coordinates 1 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.380
 30 that's the way it is or you can 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.640
 find the 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:43.190
 I might look a little 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:45.360
 clock forward yes 30 also 31 here 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.980
 So essentially area then comes 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.200
 it's the gold or love is 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.600
 area below will be natural then 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.820
 a little more interesting then we come 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.740
 even the area under redstone 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.240
 other and I would start like that 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.290
 If I'm always so here I can 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.910
 If you look at the really nice this 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.560
 delimits schott mainz then right and 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.360
 kind of funny is yes is the kts 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.580
 border I think so the top border 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.650
 which can be reached in the sense of 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.620
 Maybe redstone would be like that 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.140
 to yes here in the three I 'll put you 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.550
 a little bit on this up here like here 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.660
 there is nothing left now that is off 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.700
 empty 16 or lower, there is redstone 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.460
 then of course the same then applies 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.960
 probably also for diamonds otherwise us 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.260
 already find all the doctors by diamond 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.420
 because here, for example 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.520
 We've just got to watch there 13 times 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.750
 just to find anything what 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.490
 maybe it has to be higher here 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.350
 once diamond is on layer 14 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.140
 So always say so under the 16 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.580
 We must therefore look dior if if 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.520
 you do mine then I would already 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.310
 so softlayer 10 or so do jamann 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.330
 also 13 bit further back 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.620
 we would also have a look here 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.030
 13 more than 13 in the range 10 to 13 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.150
 In time I would say quite a time 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.400
 very good place for the us-banner strip 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.390
 main and then be immediately 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.830
 In any case, that's what the raw material looks like 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.060
 You can always do it like that 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.190
 really nice to set one sometimes 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.810
 short cook gold border actually lies 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.750
 also empire when i am so all around 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.640
 look gold there gold here but gold 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.090
 really higher there is not any more 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.350
 So I say gold here too 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.420
 20 on the 30th 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.040
 and then of course there is 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.290
 dungeons of course a bit 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.520
 rarely distributed may rather good 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.620
 Here is one time you can ever get the 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.690
 crate must look so there is 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.090
 nice things in it are of science on 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.810
 an enchantment would be over here 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.130
 already the next dungeon against one 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.900
 a little further apart com 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.210
 relatively still quite often 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.160
 So there is nothing left so that one 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.710
 in both the dungeon and the rare 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.510
 because that's not the case anymore 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.950
 maybe my young temple so i know 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.870
 not so often you can find them now 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.620
 comparatively not like normal 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.860
 dungeons but well over here too 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.390
 ice melts are not good 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.250
 then you must be in bays 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.960
 You can see that, too 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.880
 I think I got through this 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.020
 flown with already seen that 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.300
 was a kind of small test I got there 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.100
 The fences stand relaxed and natural 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.610
 even the crates all sorts of things 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.230
 there was 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.850
 the rails are still in bochum 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.380
 I demanded the spawn I have 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.460
 that means you could say about the 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.810
 let the rough direction sign off 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.320
 yes I think so well here 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.640
 but I can still see it is think think 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.190
 i think i can fly you chance 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.420
 of course the obsidian spots though 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.520
 I've come across this somewhere 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.930
 also left 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.970
 we have to thank you too 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.889
 a lot of lava was also there where 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.569
 now here's the things that looks nice 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.520
 Almost looks like a kind 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.659
 grata what has been here times if you 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.190
 she looks up here is in fact 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:48.360
 video a no more material so here is 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.530
 now at the mine shaft they are me 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.639
 lots of them actually 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.199
 originally there 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.610
 you can look over it quickly 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.159
 what his talk always so to find everything 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.720
 Is this just you? 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.050
 bit through as the spanner spread 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.190
 are 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:04.259
 Here are diamond-even inside the
