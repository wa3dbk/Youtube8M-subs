00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello dear store buyers 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.440
 at amx.com 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.300
 now I want to show you more accurately 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.070
 video to constantly on the phone by 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.860
 skype does not tell how to 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.420
 perfect glass stick you may not 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.369
 only glass is the same technology can 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.970
 apply their sticking protective film 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.390
 for screen 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.460
 the principle is the same it is very convenient and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.740
 without even having the slightest 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.250
 experience you can easily pokleit 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:36.840
 any glass on the screen of your phone 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:37.710
 or tablet by opening the kit set in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 which has glass 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 we even see what it is 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.670
 This special gave a stream of morning with . 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.180
 which removes dust instant come back 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.100
 a little later there is a branded protective 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.329
 branded 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 microfiber cloth which is perfect 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.890
 removes everything in dewdrop thanks to round 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 the structure of its fibers 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.469
 there is respectively a glass itself 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.090
 directly which we will glue 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.689
 there is a special thing I already opened it 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.820
 a little hurried before shooting video she 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.210
 wet little wet on alcohol 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.909
 basis 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.409
 done for what it exists to 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.880
 remove grease all kinds of dirt from the screen 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.310
 your smartphone before sticking 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.140
 I have already deleted everything about everything about the boat 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.020
 perfect clean him no dust nothing 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.710
 rag this we have already used my 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.780
 we remove that we do the main idea 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.979
 I am this technology 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.810
 call it funny how it would sound 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.159
 called looped why loops on and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.759
 because we are creating two with you 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.490
 eyelets 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.149
 we will need scotch for 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.140
 all that you see now 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.970
 ordinary standard tape 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.369
 glass is perfectly applied 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.890
 pre-wipe the screen in order 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.430
 that he was already clean and applied 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.040
 glass 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.560
 the side with which we will shoot 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.009
 protective film that is here 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.630
 step 1 that is, the first will be removed 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.640
 she is 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.720
 we lie down and to the place to the place where to 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.690
 that side 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.230
 is this here strap which 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:27.960
 will unstuck with you we create 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:32.940
 loops what's that taken scotch two 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:38.210
 small leaves here they are 1 2 1 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.230
 we remove pack 2 we take ideally hands 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.510
 we expose glass so that it 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.170
 completely matched by all over all 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.959
 the contour of the smartphone i.e. to large 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.830
 and middle finger is the whole thing 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.040
 neatly fix and the other hand 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.290
 right or if you lyusha left customize 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.320
 under the screen size 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.060
 perfect for lying down when we do it 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.080
 did we have the final magic it 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.240
 lay down 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.820
 perfect as it should be all glass 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.959
 lies ideally fix it with one 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.850
 sides once stuck 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.820
 checked again she moved while i 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.820
 pasted yes it means we carefully peel off 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.110
 from the phone and move all the gaps 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.480
 distances from the left and from the right 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.660
 It was perfect as well. 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.070
 to match and near to 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.320
 near the home button but if you buttons 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.510
 home no you can not match 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.800
 then check to match 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.600
 the top of the perfect here right here 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.920
 sorry of course the quality of the recorded 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.970
 We do not really have a video 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.610
 professional equipment 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.640
 but in no case providing information 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.180
 everything will be very important for you 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.860
 everything has become set distance fix 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.830
 glued to the bottom of the smartphone 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.530
 once stuck 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.730
 Now we do the same thing. 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.730
 times top and bottom 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:17.190
 perfect distance for everything 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.180
 Coincidentally fix the same with the top 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.859
 parties 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.169
 in fact, we have just created with you 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.600
 two loops that is glass as if she 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.880
 I did not go as it were, but did not open it 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.880
 already ideally lies for what it's done 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.979
 this is done so that you don't 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.620
 everything on all videos shows how 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.289
 aim yes that's all there took this glass 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.360
 and aim there do not aim in the name of Alina 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.280
 summer experience of sticking films and glasses 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.229
 Naturally, you can aim but it 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.160
 much 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:51.770
 one hundred percent likely you are perfect 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.539
 glue it to turn down the glass to 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.940
 completely perfect again wipe 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.380
 screen 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.070
 I, of course, do it a little uncomfortable 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.280
 because I don't have adequate 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:09.030
 normal lighting also you can 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.169
 do this bathroom typing procedure 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.660
 hot water bath 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.720
 what happens is created a lot 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.039
 a pair of all the dust binds and falls then 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.560
 chances are that the dust is not 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:26.039
 gets on the screen is extremely small once again all 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.060
 this business is deleted if we see somewhere 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:34.909
 speck of dust and we are not wonderful 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.909
 rag movies caw firm and 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.900
 which perfectly removes all dust particles over 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.349
 despite the fact that while i was talking 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.940
 dust particles still fall 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:47.370
 for this, respectively, we have here 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.960
 the one thing that I said remover 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.720
 the way here is a leaf for which we 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.330
 open and then but I have dust here 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.240
 no for any example I'm you 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.370
 showing that she is done so she 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.419
 picks up the dust and leaves no 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.550
 prints 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.020
 on my own a wonderful thing but i 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.479
 I use microfiber you spend here 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.270
 practically dont use them anymore 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.979
 use when under the film falls 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.440
 dust and you need to get to lift the film 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:16.380
 when it is already glued and glued 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.870
 Now remove all the dust this thing we 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.550
 nothing on the screen, respectively 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.099
 going to happen now 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.630
 the same magic of which i told you we 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:30.060
 peel off the glass 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.940
 protective film and since loops 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.640
 lie perfect 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.090
 the glass itself will fall and now closer 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:45.270
 bring up and magicians 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:46.910
 now she herself will be dispersed 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:52.350
 all cultures 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:55.920
 can I help him a little so that the air is not 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:07:00.840
 switched to this or that side so as not to 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.760
 formed airspace in 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.250
 lap 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.590
 we are expelling this whole thing you see 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.720
 here a little bit formed on but without 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:17.430
 problems are squeezed out 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:20.570
 our loops we take a spirit rag 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.570
 wipe our screen 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:31.470
 once again perfectly wipe where 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.050
 initially pressed fingers created 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:39.710
 small airspace but by 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:44.250
 here's the fact of such movements 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:47.220
 all disappears now our screen complement 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:49.590
 normalized protected from hard scratches 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.130
 keys and the most important is your insurance 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:55.320
 from the fact that if you drop a break 

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:58.230
 but don't break the screen because 

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:01.280
 you pasted protective glass is such a 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:03.300
 elementary simple sticking technology 

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.410
 without a speck of dust 

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.520
 no single bitch and cinnamon hitch 

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.750
 thank you for making the stores 

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:15.330
 shopping in a box store com 

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:17.600
 thank you for your attention goodbye 

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.600
 shopping
