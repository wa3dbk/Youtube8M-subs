00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.860
 oh I want to make a video of tutorials 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.900
 from star wars a pretty easy thing so 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.900
 the first part will give that 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.230
 so that's pretty healthy this one at the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.230
 I start I'll get it 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:56.030
 So here it is then easy enough 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.460
 after then you will have to take 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.150
 the water the floor the octave underneath and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150
 that of the base 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.070
 so up to 25 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.080
 so excuse me I'm normal a judge 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.900
 of a village holds the camera so 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.610
 then 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.570
 so now I'm going to play all march 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.570
 all together 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.960
 ea is then after there is a sequel 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.010
 and then we start again from there 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.980
 our now we are going to rent all the 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.980
 song together 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.970
 e 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.710
