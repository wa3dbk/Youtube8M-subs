00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
today we're going to review how to do it

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.270 
today we're going to review how to do it
yourself<00:00:04.620> your<00:00:05.279> own<00:00:05.750> garden<00:00:06.750> fountain<00:00:07.280> using

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
yourself your own garden fountain using

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.180 
yourself your own garden fountain using
a<00:00:08.370> disappearing<00:00:09.000> waterfall<00:00:09.570> trick<00:00:09.980> so<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
a disappearing waterfall trick so the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.379 
a disappearing waterfall trick so the
first<00:00:11.400> thing<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.759> you're<00:00:11.910> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> need<00:00:12.240> to

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
first thing that you're going to need to

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.589 
first thing that you're going to need to
do<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:13.429> dig<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> hole<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.120> hole<00:00:15.330> should<00:00:15.540> be

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
do is dig a hole the hole should be

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.260 
do is dig a hole the hole should be
about<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.199> big<00:00:16.440> as<00:00:16.520> a<00:00:17.520> milk<00:00:18.150> crate<00:00:18.420> so

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
about as big as a milk crate so

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.640 
about as big as a milk crate so
reasonably<00:00:21.270> wide<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.510> actually<00:00:21.930> went<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
reasonably wide I actually went to the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.349 
reasonably wide I actually went to the
store<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.310> borrowed<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.850> milk<00:00:24.180> crate

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
store and just borrowed a milk crate

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.009 
store and just borrowed a milk crate
from<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> back<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.380> local<00:00:25.910> supermarket

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
from the back of the local supermarket

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.060 
from the back of the local supermarket
dig<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.140> hole<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.349> then<00:00:28.590> line<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.859> with

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
dig your hole and then line it with

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.310 
dig your hole and then line it with
plastic<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> plastic<00:00:30.750> should<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.140> nice

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
plastic so the plastic should be nice

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.709 
plastic so the plastic should be nice
and<00:00:31.529> thick<00:00:31.800> plastic<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.059> not<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.600> know

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and thick plastic so not not you know

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.479 
and thick plastic so not not you know
something<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.350> saran<00:00:34.680> wrap<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.100> should<00:00:35.340> be

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
something like saran wrap it should be

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.190 
something like saran wrap it should be
much<00:00:35.790> thicker<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.690> might<00:00:36.809> even<00:00:36.960> want<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
much thicker you might even want to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.840 
much thicker you might even want to
double<00:00:37.530> layer<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
double layer it because this is going to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.340 
double layer it because this is going to
hold<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.390> water<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.930> don't<00:00:40.110> want<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
hold your water and you don't want to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.440 
hold your water and you don't want to
get<00:00:40.440> punctured<00:00:40.940> therefore<00:00:41.940> when<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.120> stick

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
get punctured therefore when you stick

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.170 
get punctured therefore when you stick
in<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:43.079> milk<00:00:43.890> crate<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.430> sure<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.910> fits

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
in your milk crate be sure that it fits

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180 
in your milk crate be sure that it fits
easily<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> force<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.010> milk

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
easily you don't have to force the milk

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.979 
easily you don't have to force the milk
crate<00:00:47.430> into<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> hole<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.390> dig<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:48.780> hole

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
crate into the hole so dig your hole

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.630 
crate into the hole so dig your hole
nice<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.410> wide<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.800> always<00:00:49.950> backfill<00:00:50.489> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
nice and wide you can always backfill it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.630 
nice and wide you can always backfill it
later<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:51.230> put<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.410> milk<00:00:52.559> crate<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.920> cut<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
later on put your milk crate in cut a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.310 
later on put your milk crate in cut a
hole<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.660> easily<00:00:54.930> add

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
hole in it so that you can easily add

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.189 
hole in it so that you can easily add
and<00:00:56.039> remove<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:57.149> pump<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> water

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and remove your your pump for the water

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.130 
and remove your your pump for the water
that<00:00:58.590> I'm<00:00:58.859> using<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.399> low-voltage<00:00:59.879> pump<00:01:00.570> which

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that I'm using a low-voltage pump which

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.979 
that I'm using a low-voltage pump which
makes<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> very<00:01:01.620> easy<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.609> put<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> distance

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
makes it very easy to put at a distance

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
makes it very easy to put at a distance
I<00:01:04.080> don't<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> worry<00:01:04.739> about<00:01:05.010> having<00:01:05.909> an

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
I don't have to worry about having an

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030 
I don't have to worry about having an
outlet<00:01:06.180> nearby<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:07.080> run<00:01:07.290> low-voltage<00:01:07.680> line

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
outlet nearby I can run low-voltage line

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.010 
outlet nearby I can run low-voltage line
pretty<00:01:08.250> much<00:01:08.340> wherever<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.760> want<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> find

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
pretty much wherever I want to so I find

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.210 
pretty much wherever I want to so I find
the<00:01:10.110> low-voltage<00:01:10.380> pump<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.130> effective

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
the low-voltage pump is very effective

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.740 
the low-voltage pump is very effective
once<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.340> lower<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.850> bowl<00:01:15.360> tidge<00:01:15.509> pump

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
once you lower your bowl tidge pump

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
once you lower your bowl tidge pump
through<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.380> hole<00:01:16.560> you've<00:01:16.770> made<00:01:17.009> take<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
through the hole you've made take the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.090 
through the hole you've made take the
tube<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.330> run<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.810> up<00:01:18.990> through<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> cutout

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
tube and run it up through a cutout

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190 
tube and run it up through a cutout
piece<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.520> weed<00:01:20.790> stuff<00:01:21.150> that's<00:01:21.420> about<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.900> wide

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
piece of weed stuff that's about as wide

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.280 
piece of weed stuff that's about as wide
as<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:23.580> area<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.390> plastic<00:01:24.780> spreads<00:01:25.110> out

on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> weed<00:01:25.890> stop<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.909> used<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
on the weed stop is going to be used to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.080 
on the weed stop is going to be used to
stop<00:01:27.890> particles<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> rocks<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:29.610> falling

down into the pump area but the same

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.719 
down into the pump area but the same
time<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.689> let<00:01:33.810> water<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.409> through<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.460> cover

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
time will let water go through so cover

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.510 
time will let water go through so cover
it<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:35.939> weed<00:01:36.090> stuff<00:01:36.479> thread<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.680> tube

we do have reasonably cold January and

we do have reasonably cold January and
February<00:02:40.049> but<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.099> leave<00:02:41.430> mine<00:02:41.639> running

pretty much year-round the hole is deep

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.039 
pretty much year-round the hole is deep
enough<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:47.389> the<00:02:48.389> water<00:02:48.569> never<00:02:48.750> fully

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
enough that it's the water never fully

enough that it's the water never fully
freezes<00:02:49.439> on<00:02:49.590> our<00:02:49.680> about<00:02:49.949> the<00:02:50.040> pump<00:02:50.280> freezing

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:50.699 
freezes on our about the pump freezing

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.179 
freezes on our about the pump freezing
and<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:52.049> water<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.349> does<00:02:52.620> come<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.889> the<00:02:53.010> top

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
and the water that does come to the top

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.729 
and the water that does come to the top
it<00:02:53.370> does<00:02:53.549> freeze<00:02:53.909> and<00:02:54.269> pay<00:02:54.659> some<00:02:54.840> very<00:02:55.230> fruity

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
it does freeze and pay some very fruity

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.479 
it does freeze and pay some very fruity
ice<00:02:57.260> patterns<00:02:58.260> if<00:02:58.469> you<00:02:58.620> will<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> actually

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
ice patterns if you will so I actually

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.250 
ice patterns if you will so I actually
think<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.849> just<00:03:00.060> adds<00:03:00.209> value<00:03:00.449> to<00:03:00.689> it<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.169> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
think that just adds value to it in the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.050 
think that just adds value to it in the
winter<00:03:01.500> time<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:02.549> make<00:03:02.669> sure<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:02.939> it

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
winter time just make sure that it

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.520 
winter time just make sure that it
doesn't<00:03:03.209> run<00:03:03.449> out<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.599> water<00:03:03.900> because<00:03:04.319> some<00:03:04.469> of

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
doesn't run out of water because some of

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.860 
doesn't run out of water because some of
the<00:03:04.590> ice<00:03:04.739> will<00:03:04.980> will<00:03:05.449> freeze<00:03:06.449> and<00:03:06.629> therefore

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
the ice will will freeze and therefore

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.059 
the ice will will freeze and therefore
you<00:03:06.930> won't<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.139> as<00:03:07.260> much<00:03:07.379> water<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.739> pump<00:03:07.859> so

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
you won't have as much water to pump so

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.080 
you won't have as much water to pump so
you<00:03:08.099> might<00:03:08.310> want<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.489> add<00:03:08.669> some<00:03:08.699> additional

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
you might want to add some additional

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.819 
you might want to add some additional
water<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.719> the<00:03:09.780> winter<00:03:09.930> time<00:03:10.199> when<00:03:10.469> you<00:03:10.680> do

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
water in the winter time when you do

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.619 
water in the winter time when you do
have<00:03:10.949> a<00:03:10.980> really<00:03:11.340> cold<00:03:11.579> weather<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.510> hope

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
have a really cold weather so I hope

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.720 
have a really cold weather so I hope
