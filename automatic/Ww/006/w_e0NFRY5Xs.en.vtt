that if you take a six volt electric
battery<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.140> open<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.369> get<00:00:20.460> out

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
battery and open it up you can get out

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.470 
battery and open it up you can get out
of<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.670> 32<00:00:21.270> double<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.840> size<00:00:22.080> batteries<00:00:23.480> let's

Lantern working six volt lantern battery
now<00:00:36.050> what<00:00:37.010> else<00:00:37.160> runs<00:00:37.309> off<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.399> six<00:00:37.579> volts

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
now what else runs off of six volts

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.030 
now what else runs off of six volts
drill<00:00:40.540> actually<00:00:41.540> it's<00:00:41.719> four<00:00:42.530> double<00:00:43.010> A

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
drill actually it's four double A

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.229 
drill actually it's four double A
batteries<00:00:43.750> now<00:00:44.829> let's<00:00:45.829> see<00:00:45.949> is<00:00:46.160> this<00:00:46.790> large

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
batteries now let's see is this large

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.020 
batteries now let's see is this large
enough<00:00:47.449> to<00:00:47.540> hold<00:00:47.660> 32<00:00:48.079> double-a<00:00:48.590> batteries

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
enough to hold 32 double-a batteries

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.080 
enough to hold 32 double-a batteries
let's<00:00:50.030> see

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.040 

it's<00:00:53.570> too<00:00:53.720> wide

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.990 

three<00:00:56.680> wide<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.879> wine<00:00:59.309> not<00:01:00.309> quite<00:01:00.520> five<00:01:00.670> wide

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
three wide for wine not quite five wide

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.340 
three wide for wine not quite five wide
but<00:01:01.899> we<00:01:02.440> can<00:01:02.559> say<00:01:02.980> for<00:01:03.340> wide<00:01:03.520> by<00:01:04.089> four<00:01:04.360> wide<00:01:04.510> 16

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
but we can say for wide by four wide 16

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.740 
but we can say for wide by four wide 16
in<00:01:05.530> two<00:01:05.920> layers<00:01:06.010> is<00:01:06.190> 32<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:07.000> may<00:01:07.119> be<00:01:07.180> big<00:01:07.690> enough

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
in two layers is 32 it may be big enough

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.570 
in two layers is 32 it may be big enough
to<00:01:07.900> hold<00:01:07.960> 32<00:01:08.229> let's<00:01:08.950> check<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.159> this<00:01:09.220> way<00:01:09.369> is<00:01:09.490> it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
to hold 32 let's check it this way is it

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.130 
to hold 32 let's check it this way is it
well<00:01:09.670> enough<00:01:09.820> set<00:01:10.720> this<00:01:10.780> on<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:10.990> ground

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
well enough set this on the ground

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.090 
well enough set this on the ground
there'll<00:01:11.530> be<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.619> layer<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.800> flash<00:01:11.950> they're

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
there'll be a layer of flash they're

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.410 
there'll be a layer of flash they're
gonna<00:01:12.190> make<00:01:12.340> this<00:01:12.430> six<00:01:12.640> volt<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.270> whole

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
gonna make this six volt the whole

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.090 
gonna make this six volt the whole
Damien<00:01:13.659> set<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.320> second<00:01:14.590> straight<00:01:14.800> on<00:01:14.890> top<00:01:14.950> of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
Damien set the second straight on top of

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.300 
Damien set the second straight on top of
it<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:16.390> difficult<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.750> see<00:01:16.840> from<00:01:16.869> here

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it and it's difficult to see from here

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.160 
it and it's difficult to see from here
with<00:01:18.310> these<00:01:18.400> six<00:01:18.729> volt<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.330> bent<00:01:19.810> legs<00:01:19.990> are

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
with these six volt the bent legs are

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.660 
with these six volt the bent legs are
slightly<00:01:20.500> higher<00:01:20.770> than<00:01:20.890> top<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.310> six<00:01:21.490> volt

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
slightly higher than top of the six volt

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.710 
slightly higher than top of the six volt
so<00:01:22.240> won't<00:01:22.479> fit<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.750> way<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:24.509> since<00:01:25.509> they

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
so won't fit that way now since they

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.719 
so won't fit that way now since they
open<00:01:25.960> it<00:01:26.020> up<00:01:26.110> in<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.259> video<00:01:26.520> well<00:01:27.520> open<00:01:27.670> this

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
open it up in the video well open this

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.180 
open it up in the video well open this
one<00:01:27.850> up<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.090> now<00:01:28.990> they<00:01:29.740> rip<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:29.950> like<00:01:29.979> laughs

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
one up to now they rip it like laughs

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.950 
one up to now they rip it like laughs
but<00:01:30.880> I'm<00:01:31.090> not<00:01:31.360> going<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.539> worry<00:01:31.660> about<00:01:31.720> taking

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
but I'm not going to worry about taking

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.910 
but I'm not going to worry about taking
the<00:01:32.140> light<00:01:32.259> off<00:01:32.410> this<00:01:32.530> because<00:01:32.740> it's<00:01:32.830> not

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
the light off this because it's not

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.620 
the light off this because it's not
really<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.160> a<00:01:33.190> way<00:01:33.310> i<00:01:33.520> can<00:01:33.940> take<00:01:34.360> off<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.479> top

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
really in a way i can take off the top

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.870 
really in a way i can take off the top
without<00:01:34.780> ripping<00:01:35.080> up<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.170> label<00:01:35.880> let's

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
without ripping up the label let's

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.910 
without ripping up the label let's
proceed<00:01:40.380> maybe<00:01:41.380> then<00:01:41.500> we'll<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:41.679> what<00:01:41.770> can<00:01:41.890> I

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
proceed maybe then we'll just what can I

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.859 
proceed maybe then we'll just what can I
thought<00:01:42.360> do<00:01:43.360> have<00:01:43.479> an<00:01:43.539> eye<00:01:43.570> for<00:01:43.600> an<00:01:43.720> eye<00:01:43.780> here

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
thought do have an eye for an eye here

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.270 
thought do have an eye for an eye here
somewhere<00:01:44.080> maybe<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:44.350> could<00:01:44.470> use<00:01:44.560> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.230 

now<00:01:51.360> let's<00:01:52.360> try<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.780> open<00:01:52.930> this<00:01:53.050> thing<00:01:53.170> up<00:01:54.240> no

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
now let's try to open this thing up no

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.520 
now let's try to open this thing up no
probably<00:01:55.810> requires<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> little<00:01:56.230> more<00:01:56.350> finesse

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
probably requires a little more finesse

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:22.820 
probably requires a little more finesse
than<00:01:56.650> this<00:01:57.870> so<00:01:58.870> let's<00:01:59.020> use<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.170> knife

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.570 

there<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.400> go<00:02:23.690> got<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> top<00:02:24.900> coming<00:02:25.140> off<00:02:25.580> and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
there we go got the top coming off and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.450 
there we go got the top coming off and
what<00:02:26.970> do<00:02:27.030> we<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.180> inside<00:02:27.330> oh<00:02:27.690> no<00:02:28.190> we're<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.250> my

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
what do we have inside oh no we're on my

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.250 
what do we have inside oh no we're on my
double<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> batteries<00:02:30.050> what<00:02:31.050> are<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.170> got
