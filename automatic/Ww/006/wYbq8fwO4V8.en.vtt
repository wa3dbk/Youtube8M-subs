will<00:02:41.050> be<00:02:41.140> plenty<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:43.090> we'll<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:43.599> bring<00:02:43.900> it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.809 

to<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> end<00:02:47.500> there<00:02:49.410> snip<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.590> off<00:02:50.739> with<00:02:51.640> my

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
to the end there snip it off with my

00:02:51.819 --> 00:03:00.720 
to the end there snip it off with my
scissors<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:57.000> there's<00:02:58.000> my<00:02:58.470> hombre<00:02:59.489> now<00:03:00.489> all<00:03:00.700> I

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
scissors and there's my hombre now all I

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.630 
scissors and there's my hombre now all I
need<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.299> is<00:03:03.209> carefully<00:03:05.130> slide<00:03:06.130> it<00:03:06.310> off<00:03:06.430> my

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
need to do is carefully slide it off my

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.210 
need to do is carefully slide it off my
screwdriver<00:03:07.769> again<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:08.799> can't<00:03:09.569> pull<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:10.599> off<00:03:11.220> or

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
screwdriver again I can't pull it off or

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.009 
screwdriver again I can't pull it off or
it'll<00:03:12.430> tighten<00:03:12.610> up<00:03:12.819> on<00:03:13.030> me<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.450> will<00:03:13.569> bind

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
it'll tighten up on me and it will bind

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.120 
it'll tighten up on me and it will bind
to<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.349> screwdriver<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.000> kind<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.330> have<00:03:16.480> to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
to the screwdriver so I kind of have to

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:25.110 
to the screwdriver so I kind of have to
push<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.340> off<00:03:19.500> like<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:21.360> now<00:03:22.360> it's<00:03:22.540> open<00:03:24.120> this

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
push it off like so now it's open this

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.729 
push it off like so now it's open this
is<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.299> real<00:03:25.799> steel<00:03:26.799> braid<00:03:27.130> here<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:27.670> isn't<00:03:27.880> a

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
is a real steel braid here this isn't a

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.430 
is a real steel braid here this isn't a
this<00:03:29.739> isn't<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.100> cheap<00:03:30.370> plastic<00:03:31.290> covering<00:03:32.290> of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
this isn't a cheap plastic covering of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.539 
this isn't a cheap plastic covering of
some<00:03:32.620> sort<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:34.060> now<00:03:34.890> I'm<00:03:35.890> going<00:03:36.070> to<00:03:36.160> cut<00:03:36.370> the

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
some sort and now I'm going to cut the

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.970 
some sort and now I'm going to cut the
tip<00:03:37.390> off<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.870> wire<00:03:38.109> so<00:03:38.560> they<00:03:38.680> don't<00:03:38.859> get

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
tip off that wire so they don't get

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.840 
tip off that wire so they don't get
bound<00:03:39.310> on<00:03:39.609> this<00:03:39.819> as<00:03:40.030> they<00:03:40.180> travel<00:03:40.600> through<00:03:40.630> and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
bound on this as they travel through and

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.190 
bound on this as they travel through and
then<00:03:42.850> I'm<00:03:43.000> going<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.209> just<00:03:43.390> push<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:43.660> right<00:03:43.989> on

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
then I'm going to just push it right on

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.990 
then I'm going to just push it right on
through<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:46.269> entire<00:03:46.690> length<00:03:47.049> of<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:49.390> wire

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
through the entire length of this wire

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.420 
through the entire length of this wire
now<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.329> don't<00:03:52.720> want<00:03:52.930> this<00:03:53.079> wire<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.590> come<00:03:53.799> all

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
now I don't want this wire to come all

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.240 
now I don't want this wire to come all
the<00:03:55.030> way<00:03:55.060> down<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.230> light<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:56.799> this<00:03:56.950> case

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
the way down to the light in this case

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.490 
the way down to the light in this case
because<00:03:58.120> it's<00:03:58.420> going<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.780> be<00:03:58.870> running<00:03:59.139> over

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
because it's going to be running over

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.479 
because it's going to be running over
the<00:03:59.620> top<00:03:59.889> of<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.880> black<00:04:01.500> caliper<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.459> I

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
the top of the black caliper and so I

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.590 
the top of the black caliper and so I
want<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:04.000> black<00:04:04.389> wire<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:05.230> blend<00:04:06.069> in<00:04:06.600> with

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
want this black wire to blend in with

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.479 
want this black wire to blend in with
the<00:04:07.870> caliper<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.440> then<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:08.889> want<00:04:09.069> my<00:04:09.130> chrome

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
the caliper and then I want my chrome

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.330 
the caliper and then I want my chrome
braid<00:04:09.819> to<00:04:10.000> start<00:04:10.299> up<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.540> little<00:04:10.780> bit<00:04:10.900> further

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
braid to start up a little bit further

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.800 
braid to start up a little bit further
so<00:04:12.340> I'm<00:04:12.519> going<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.730> go<00:04:12.910> measure<00:04:13.209> this<00:04:13.540> real

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
so I'm going to go measure this real

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.430 
so I'm going to go measure this real
quick<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.889> see<00:04:15.190> where<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:15.459> needs<00:04:15.700> to<00:04:15.819> be<00:04:19.440> and

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
quick and see where it needs to be and

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.860 
quick and see where it needs to be and
see

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
see

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.560 
see
just<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:22.680> know<00:04:22.800> about<00:04:23.100> how<00:04:23.430> much<00:04:23.699> I<00:04:24.030> need<00:04:24.300> I

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
just so I know about how much I need I

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.510 
just so I know about how much I need I
want<00:04:24.810> my<00:04:24.870> chrome<00:04:25.229> braids<00:04:25.530> essentially<00:04:26.220> start

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
want my chrome braids essentially start

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.600 
want my chrome braids essentially start
right<00:04:26.699> at<00:04:26.790> my<00:04:26.910> brake<00:04:27.240> line<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:29.160> that's<00:04:29.430> about

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
right at my brake line so that's about

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.170 
right at my brake line so that's about
this<00:04:30.120> much<00:04:30.449> here<00:04:30.919> I'm<00:04:31.919> going<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.669> leave<00:04:32.910> this

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
this much here I'm going to leave this

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.320 
this much here I'm going to leave this
much<00:04:33.710> black<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.240> then<00:04:37.130> I'm<00:04:38.130> going<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.490> hold<00:04:39.060> it

much black and then I'm going to hold it

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.510 
much black and then I'm going to hold it
right<00:04:39.510> where<00:04:40.050> I<00:04:40.080> wanted<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.380> start<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.979> I'm

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
right where I wanted to start and I'm

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.830 
right where I wanted to start and I'm
going<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.880> pull<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.240> out<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.360> gets<00:04:45.510> longer

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
going to pull it out so it gets longer

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.120 
going to pull it out so it gets longer
and<00:04:46.699> it'll<00:04:47.699> come<00:04:47.940> as<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.270> see<00:04:48.590> almost<00:04:49.590> all<00:04:49.800> the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
and it'll come as you see almost all the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.700 
and it'll come as you see almost all the
way<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.520> end<00:04:50.699> of<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.090> wire<00:04:51.710> that's

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
way to the end of the wire that's

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.610 
way to the end of the wire that's
attached<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:53.610> led<00:04:54.150> pot<00:04:54.449> and<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:55.440> have<00:04:55.590> a

attached to this led pot and we have a
nice<00:04:55.860> chrome<00:04:56.280> line<00:04:56.910> now<00:04:57.690> I'll<00:04:58.289> take<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.680> heat

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
nice chrome line now I'll take a heat

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.760 
nice chrome line now I'll take a heat
shrink<00:04:59.310> tube<00:04:59.639> and<00:05:00.330> what<00:05:00.750> I've<00:05:00.870> done<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.229> a<00:05:01.260> cut

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
shrink tube and what I've done is a cut

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.350 
shrink tube and what I've done is a cut
in<00:05:02.070> half<00:05:02.870> one<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.910> quarter<00:05:05.910> inch<00:05:06.090> heat

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
in half one of the quarter inch heat

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.580 
in half one of the quarter inch heat
shrink<00:05:07.250> tubes<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.610> provide<00:05:09.350> with<00:05:10.350> our

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
shrink tubes that we provide with our

engine kit to go over the butt
connectors<00:05:13.760> have<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:14.910> make<00:05:15.090> sure<00:05:15.120> that's<00:05:15.449> good

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
connectors have to make sure that's good

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.570

and<00:05:15.840> small<00:05:16.139> or<00:05:16.440> my<00:05:16.590> heat<00:05:16.770> shrink<00:05:17.039> isn't<00:05:17.340> going

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
and small or my heat shrink isn't going

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.020 
and small or my heat shrink isn't going
to<00:05:19.280> go<00:05:20.280> over<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:23.280> have<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.550> finesse<00:05:23.789> it

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
to go over it you have to finesse it

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.020 
to go over it you have to finesse it
just<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.570> little<00:05:24.600> bit<00:05:24.870> here<00:05:26.389> get<00:05:27.389> it<00:05:27.510> started

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
just a little bit here get it started

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.360 
just a little bit here get it started
and<00:05:30.030> I<00:05:30.180> can<00:05:30.360> hold<00:05:30.570> this<00:05:30.780> end<00:05:31.789> bring<00:05:32.789> it<00:05:32.880> down

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
and I can hold this end bring it down

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.659 
and I can hold this end bring it down
went<00:05:35.370> a<00:05:35.430> little<00:05:35.580> too<00:05:35.669> far<00:05:38.120> so<00:05:39.120> I'm<00:05:39.240> going<00:05:39.360> to

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
went a little too far so I'm going to

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.070 
went a little too far so I'm going to
twist<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.940> end<00:05:42.090> of<00:05:42.300> that<00:05:42.479> where<00:05:42.750> it's<00:05:42.930> all

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
twist the end of that where it's all

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.990 
twist the end of that where it's all
frayed<00:05:43.650> slightly<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:46.610> bring<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:47.639> heat

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
frayed slightly and bring that heat

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.830 
frayed slightly and bring that heat
shrink<00:05:48.330> up<00:05:48.510> over<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.050> like<00:05:49.650> so<00:05:50.389> cover<00:05:51.389> all<00:05:51.630> the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
shrink up over it like so cover all the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.640 
shrink up over it like so cover all the
fray<00:05:52.199> and<00:05:52.500> then<00:05:53.280> I'll<00:05:53.460> shrink<00:05:54.270> that<00:05:54.539> down<00:05:54.650> so

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
fray and then I'll shrink that down so

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.350 
fray and then I'll shrink that down so
it'll<00:05:55.800> be<00:05:55.860> nice<00:05:56.130> and<00:05:56.160> tight<00:05:56.610> let<00:05:56.849> me<00:05:56.970> find<00:05:57.180> my

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
it'll be nice and tight let me find my

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.629 
it'll be nice and tight let me find my
heat<00:05:57.660> gun<00:05:57.690> here<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:59.490> I'll<00:05:59.669> be<00:05:59.699> right<00:05:59.820> back

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
heat gun here and I'll be right back

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.939 
heat gun here and I'll be right back
before<00:06:02.639> putting<00:06:02.880> this<00:06:03.060> light<00:06:03.300> on<00:06:03.510> the<00:06:03.660> on<00:06:03.870> the

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
before putting this light on the on the

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.260 
before putting this light on the on the
caliper<00:06:04.949> there<00:06:05.400> was<00:06:05.490> one<00:06:05.639> other<00:06:05.669> thing<00:06:06.030> I<00:06:06.120> was

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
black wire that come off the lights that

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.050 
black wire that come off the lights that
isn't<00:06:16.229> covered<00:06:16.470> by<00:06:16.620> our<00:06:16.800> black<00:06:17.190> casing<00:06:17.610> right

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
here where the casing comes up to the

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.089 
here where the casing comes up to the
pod<00:06:21.060> so<00:06:21.900> what<00:06:22.080> I've<00:06:22.199> done<00:06:22.229> what<00:06:22.770> I'm<00:06:22.860> going<00:06:23.070> to

piece<00:06:24.570> of<00:06:24.750> black<00:06:24.990> heat<00:06:25.260> shrink<00:06:25.650> and<00:06:25.860> I'm<00:06:26.370> going

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
piece of black heat shrink and I'm going

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.300 
piece of black heat shrink and I'm going
to<00:06:26.639> put<00:06:26.880> it<00:06:27.000> all<00:06:27.240> the<00:06:27.539> way<00:06:27.570> down<00:06:27.960> to<00:06:28.380> that<00:06:29.039> pod

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
to put it all the way down to that pod

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.390 
to put it all the way down to that pod
so<00:06:29.610> I<00:06:29.639> cover

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
so I cover

that<00:06:31.120> red<00:06:31.870> and<00:06:32.020> black<00:06:32.199> wire<00:06:32.470> this<00:06:33.070> isn't<00:06:33.430> a

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
that red and black wire this isn't a

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.760 
that red and black wire this isn't a
safety<00:06:34.060> thing<00:06:34.090> this<00:06:34.449> is<00:06:34.660> a<00:06:34.690> this<00:06:35.560> is<00:06:35.620> a

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
safety thing this is a this is a

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.189 
safety thing this is a this is a
cosmetic<00:06:36.490> deal<00:06:36.699> this<00:06:37.479> is<00:06:37.690> just<00:06:37.810> going<00:06:37.990> to<00:06:38.080> make

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
cosmetic deal this is just going to make

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.620 
cosmetic deal this is just going to make
it<00:06:38.410> look<00:06:38.590> better<00:06:38.830> so<00:06:39.580> I<00:06:39.610> don't<00:06:39.910> see<00:06:40.180> any<00:06:40.360> red

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.170 
it look better so I don't see any red
and<00:06:40.870> black<00:06:41.050> wires<00:06:41.350> all<00:06:42.250> I<00:06:42.280> see<00:06:42.639> is<00:06:42.759> a<00:06:42.789> black

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
and black wires all I see is a black

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.400 
and black wires all I see is a black
case<00:06:43.539> all<00:06:43.870> the<00:06:44.169> way<00:06:44.320> down<00:06:45.190> to<00:06:45.220> the<00:06:45.430> light<00:06:46.410> so

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
case all the way down to the light so

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.249 
case all the way down to the light so
that's<00:06:47.949> just<00:06:48.070> a<00:06:48.370> that's<00:06:49.360> just<00:06:49.509> the<00:06:49.690> perfection
