store and it is awesome so let me demo
it<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> little<00:00:20.490> bit<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.820> show<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.180> why<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> love

it a little bit and show you why I love

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.689 
it a little bit and show you why I love
it<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:21.900> much

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
it so much

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.670 
it so much
so<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> food<00:00:24.269> ball<00:00:24.480> 1.5<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.439> has<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
so this is the food ball 1.5 it has a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.429 
so this is the food ball 1.5 it has a
1.5<00:00:26.430> millimeter<00:00:26.939> rollerball<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:28.230> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
1.5 millimeter rollerball and that is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
1.5 millimeter rollerball and that is
bigger<00:00:28.680> than<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.099> average<00:00:29.519> rollerball<00:00:30.029> that

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
bigger than the average rollerball that

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.580 
bigger than the average rollerball that
means<00:00:30.330> sometimes<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.869> see<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.199> rollerball

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
means sometimes you see that rollerball

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.880 
means sometimes you see that rollerball
is<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.040> 0.7<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.840> 1.5<00:00:34.590> so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
is going up to 0.7 and this is 1.5 so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.360 
is going up to 0.7 and this is 1.5 so
double<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.540> little<00:00:36.750> bit<00:00:36.870> more<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.370> it

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
double that and a little bit more and it

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250 
double that and a little bit more and it
just<00:00:38.579> has<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> permanent<00:00:39.180> ink<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.750> when<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
just has a permanent ink that when is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.180 
just has a permanent ink that when is
dry<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:41.070> won't<00:00:41.340> run<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.140> it<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.500> isn't<00:00:43.710> easy

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
dry it won't run and it just isn't easy

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.029 
dry it won't run and it just isn't easy
pen<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> use<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.780> flows<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
pen to use because it flows out of the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.580 
pen to use because it flows out of the
pen<00:00:47.399> very<00:00:47.820> easily<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.870> writes<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.200> acrylic

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
pen very easily and it writes on acrylic

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.290 
pen very easily and it writes on acrylic
and<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.160> you're<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.370> mixed-media<00:00:50.730> person<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and if you're a mixed-media person you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.479 
and if you're a mixed-media person you
know<00:00:51.420> how<00:00:51.660> hard<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> find<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> pen<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
know how hard it is to find a pen that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.950 
know how hard it is to find a pen that
will<00:00:53.640> write<00:00:53.879> well<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.210> acrylic<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
will write well in acrylic so this is a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.950 
will write well in acrylic so this is a
painted<00:00:55.350> tag<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.559> write<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:59.719> the<00:01:00.719> tag

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the best compliment that I can give it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.830 
the best compliment that I can give it
because<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.659> killed<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> many<00:01:20.460> pens<00:01:20.850> in

because I have killed so so many pens in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.740 
because I have killed so so many pens in
my<00:01:22.110> art<00:01:22.650> career<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:24.060> not<00:01:24.240> managed<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
kill one of these because I tend to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.179 
kill one of these because I tend to
write<00:01:26.909> over<00:01:27.350> my<00:01:28.350> pages<00:01:28.619> when<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> probably

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
write over my pages when I probably

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.859 
write over my pages when I probably
shouldn't<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.850> mean<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.479> should<00:01:30.659> probably

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
shouldn't I mean you should probably

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
shouldn't I mean you should probably
wait<00:01:31.140> till<00:01:31.350> they're<00:01:31.439> 100%<00:01:32.189> dry<00:01:32.310> before<00:01:32.729> you

write<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.390> tend<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.960> little<00:01:34.409> bit

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
write and I tend to be a little bit

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.010 
write and I tend to be a little bit
impatient<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.460> I've<00:01:35.880> been<00:01:36.090> known<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.329> write<00:01:36.750> on

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
