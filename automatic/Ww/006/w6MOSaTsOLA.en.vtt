00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello dear friends of the folded 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.240
 sheet today we do in minecraft 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.769
 blog and for that we need a sheet 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.719
 paper and a printed one 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.190
 Submit this from James Pfizer to me 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.780
 kindly allowed this too 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.550
 just use the pdf 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 button and you to download and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.600
 print out then we start with it 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.060
 to cut out the thing the model is 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.670
 very easy to fold that is the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 simple traditional water bomb after 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:39.059
 Draft superb and hold now 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.670
 we both diagonal first the one and the other 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.800
 the other after that again 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.270
 stop and the diagram what you are now 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.140
 can you again subject 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.890
 either via the video or in the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.890
 description 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.900
 beautiful exactly in the place so that too 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.920
 troop pattern beautiful so lets in now 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.490
 use colored praise is raised 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.070
 eleventh case as it now see then 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:22.570
 It fits nicely printed pattern on corner 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.549
 edge on edge and still why turn 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.560
 we now in the middle only pushes this 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.420
 pull down two pages and then 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.470
 even from the top of it pushes the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.180
 Maybe you still want to step up 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.049
 take a slow look but so difficult 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.850
 it is not 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.729
 the video you can by the way on 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.310
 Youtube on slower play park bench 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.509
 so I have here again from the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.840
 folded so it is easier later 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.210
 not very important but that's the way to go 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.330
 the making and now you see here is 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.229
 open now pointing to me completely 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.229
 this case go 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.720
 so to the point 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.000
 after doing so I angle 40 degrees 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.170
 I found the corner folded here 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.170
 already in the middle 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.920
 the pattern fits wonderfully together 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.660
 is important later we look at the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.270
 close to what I am now 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.010
 make up that wing that is 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.410
 I'll stay in the half again 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.760
 James had a lily 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.590
 printed now we take this bag 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.580
 here you open your finger and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.000
 stuck because the fold pure control 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000
 pain 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.960
 excellent I can do that now 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.790
 happens because there are several 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.670
 that's nice too 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.530
 firmly and now we repeat these 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.590
 Actually just step again 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.090
 three times at the other schools so 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.390
 only lifted case could be on the top of the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:06.790
 corner here to the center to another corner 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:11.200
 in addition to wings in the half 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:15.250
 fall after here again incident 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:20.730
 then it is put into it lighter pocket 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.730
 open and place the corner in the bag 4 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.060
 so now we turn the whole and 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.050
 to repeat 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.250
 has, as previously announced 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.310
 I think where 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.310
 here this corner is pure 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.830
 prepare the tab and the tab 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:01.670
 incident and then you can set 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:03.580
 let the wrong way off but to the 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.690
 fourth and last time we fold the 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.690
 triangle corner up there 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.300
 At not the lax first corner 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.520
 bottles half the case 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.199
 toughen 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.090
 and sink the strap 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.240
 terrific and now 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:55.819
 I keep the corners here again 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.610
 so that later the cube is nice and clean 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:02.270
 looks like you see why me 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.069
 these fold and in addition do so 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.759
 The brown side is often just the green one 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.400
 closed 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.599
 here with this model now I put 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.889
 here again the flap 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:16.460
 so that she does not look for the 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:17.419
 expression I find here air intakes and 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.879
 then we have a beautiful one 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.370
 Cube or blog are now sown 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.529
 fold quite useful I still pull 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.689
 a little bit behind 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:28.689
 and that's minecraft hole 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.130
 pretty cool so i hope you have that 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.730
 like 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:42.160
 and if you like minecraft mac and that 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.840
