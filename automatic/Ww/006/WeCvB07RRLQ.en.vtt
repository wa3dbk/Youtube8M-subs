00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
finally doing my eyebrow tutorial

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.990 
finally doing my eyebrow tutorial
obviously<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> little<00:00:08.189> silly<00:00:08.610> right<00:00:08.700> now

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
obviously a little silly right now

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.680 
obviously a little silly right now
because<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.389> only<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:10.080> one<00:00:10.440> eyebrow<00:00:11.040> done<00:00:11.880> but

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
because I only have one eyebrow done but

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.030 
because I only have one eyebrow done but
it's<00:00:12.809> because<00:00:13.019> they<00:00:13.139> don't<00:00:13.349> really<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
it's because they don't really have the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.279 
it's because they don't really have the
time<00:00:14.219> right<00:00:14.400> now<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.599> full<00:00:16.080> video

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the hang of it I believe so here goes

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.570 
the hang of it I believe so here goes
nothing

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
nothing

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.480 
nothing
umm<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.539> brush<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.930> use<00:00:28.199> forgive<00:00:28.949> me<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
umm the brush I use forgive me it's a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.640 
umm the brush I use forgive me it's a
math<00:00:29.730> brush<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> numbers<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.260> worn<00:00:31.470> off

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
math brush but the numbers are worn off

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.470 
math brush but the numbers are worn off
it<00:00:32.610> looks<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:34.370> I<00:00:35.370> think<00:00:35.730> originally<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it looks like this I think originally it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.260 
it looks like this I think originally it
was<00:00:36.630> supposed<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.140> be<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> lip<00:00:37.770> brush<00:00:38.210> but<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
was supposed to be a lip brush but I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.010 
was supposed to be a lip brush but I
really<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.260> because<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:41.309> flat<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.719> its

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
really like it because it's flat and its

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.410 
really like it because it's flat and its
relief<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.770> has<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> lot<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> control<00:00:45.059> so

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
relief then it has a lot of control so

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.380 
relief then it has a lot of control so
it's<00:00:45.629> easier<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.140> me<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.559> use<00:00:47.090> instead<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it's easier for me to use instead of the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.610 
it's easier for me to use instead of the
angled<00:00:48.809> brush<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.550> i<00:00:50.550> also<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.360> eyeshadow<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
angled brush and i also use eyeshadow of

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.889 
angled brush and i also use eyeshadow of
any<00:00:53.309> kind<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.329> depending<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.780> my

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
any kind really just depending on my

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.350 
any kind really just depending on my
hair<00:00:55.110> color<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> same<00:00:56.360> currently

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
hair color you can do the same currently

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.420 
hair color you can do the same currently
I'm<00:00:57.750> using<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:59.329> Brown<00:01:00.329> script<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.250> like

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
a fun red color that matches my eyebrows

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.950 
a fun red color that matches my eyebrows
really<00:01:06.060> nicely<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.850> I'm<00:01:08.970> gonna<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:10.790> hi

all about the brush because as you see
when<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.800> go<00:02:36.890> on<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.070> outside<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.930> kind<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:39.020> turn

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
when it go on the outside I kind of turn

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.330 
when it go on the outside I kind of turn
it<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.850> they<00:02:40.940> get<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.240> nice<00:02:41.420> line<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:43.220> then

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
it so they get the nice line and then

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.300 
it so they get the nice line and then
when<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.460> go<00:02:43.670> in<00:02:43.910> on<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.570> top<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:45.140> lay<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.770> flat

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:56.610 

and<00:02:49.310> then<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.940> go<00:02:50.150> above<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.600> brow<00:02:51.140> Lane

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.490 

and<00:02:57.129> create<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.700> shape<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:59.170> want

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.650 

sometimes<00:03:03.280> I'll<00:03:03.430> fill<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.790> more<00:03:04.000> right<00:03:04.180> here

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
sometimes I'll fill in more right here

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.920 
sometimes I'll fill in more right here
since<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.590> don't<00:03:05.650> have<00:03:05.860> hair<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.850> give<00:03:07.810> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
since I don't have hair to give the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:21.170 
since I don't have hair to give the
illusion<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.590> do

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.759 

and<00:03:21.599> then<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.110> do<00:03:22.230> my<00:03:22.349> arch<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:23.930> leave<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.590> brush

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
and then to do my arch I leave the brush

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.649 
and then to do my arch I leave the brush
sideways<00:03:26.670> at<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.650> then<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:28.920> come<00:03:29.220> up<00:03:29.659> and

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
sideways at this and then I come up and

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.589 
sideways at this and then I come up and
I<00:03:31.140> usually<00:03:31.290> try<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.739> match<00:03:32.069> my<00:03:32.879> brows<00:03:33.090> up

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
I usually try and match my brows up

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.610 
I usually try and match my brows up
they<00:03:33.720> don't<00:03:33.900> always<00:03:34.049> match<00:03:34.970> but<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:38.569> start<00:03:39.620> and

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
they don't always match but I start and

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.660 
they don't always match but I start and
sometimes<00:03:40.799> I'll<00:03:41.069> turn<00:03:41.280> my<00:03:41.459> head<00:03:41.640> sideways

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
sometimes I'll turn my head sideways

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.050 
sometimes I'll turn my head sideways
like<00:03:42.269> this<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:42.989> can<00:03:43.260> see<00:03:43.879> make<00:03:44.879> sure

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.970
