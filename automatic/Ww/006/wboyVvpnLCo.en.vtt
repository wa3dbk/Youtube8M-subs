00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.580 
grabbing their ankles so you can
actually<00:01:40.799> go<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.380> could

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
actually go here and you can you could

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.950 
actually go here and you can you could
take<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.310> actually<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.390> roll<00:01:45.659> this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
take this and actually you can roll this

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.270 
take this and actually you can roll this
on<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> outside<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:47.009> well

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
on the outside as well

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.639 
on the outside as well
whoops<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.810> fold<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.290> here

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
whoops and you can just fold this here

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.740 
whoops and you can just fold this here
okay<00:01:49.799> it'll<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.700> it'll<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.240> nice<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.420> soft

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
okay it'll be it'll be nice and soft

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.060 
okay it'll be it'll be nice and soft
there's<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.350> bit<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.530> force<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:52.920> this

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
there's a little bit of force here this

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.039 
there's a little bit of force here this
probably<00:01:53.549> wasn't<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:54.299> hot<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> probably

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
probably wasn't as hot as it probably

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.359 
probably wasn't as hot as it probably
should<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.380> been<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.189> here

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
should have been but you can see here

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.520 
should have been but you can see here
you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.640> actually<00:01:56.820> roll<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.570> thermoplastic

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
you can actually roll that thermoplastic

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.170 
you can actually roll that thermoplastic
so<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> ability<00:01:59.939> to<00:01:59.969> get

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
so you have the ability to get

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.209 
so you have the ability to get
customization<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.229> fan<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.740> skate<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.189> a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
customization and fan that skate out a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.010 
customization and fan that skate out a
little<00:02:02.490> bit<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:02.939> vice<00:02:03.299> versa<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.930> can

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
little bit or vice versa you can

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.100 
little bit or vice versa you can
actually<00:02:04.880> bring<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.180> make<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.960> little

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
actually bring it in make it a little

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.869 
actually bring it in make it a little
bit<00:02:07.320> tighter<00:02:07.560> around<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.009> ankle<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.640> want

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
bit tighter around the ankle if you want

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.630 
bit tighter around the ankle if you want
that<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:10.229> most<00:02:10.649> guys<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.550> bit

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
that but most guys like it a little bit

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.610 
that but most guys like it a little bit
looser<00:02:12.000> around<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> top

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
looser around the top

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.650 
looser around the top
as<00:02:13.860> long<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.400> ankle<00:02:14.760> fits<00:02:15.000> nice<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.300> tight

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
as long as the ankle fits nice and tight

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.990 
as long as the ankle fits nice and tight
here<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.220> anywhere<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.790> the
