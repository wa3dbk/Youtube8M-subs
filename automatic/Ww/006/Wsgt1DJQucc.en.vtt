00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
to talk to you a little bit more about

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.570 
to talk to you a little bit more about
hypertension<00:00:15.740> or<00:00:16.219> high<00:00:16.390> blood<00:00:17.390> pressure<00:00:18.080> a

goes up its associated with more illness

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.509 
goes up its associated with more illness
that's<00:00:45.230> not<00:00:45.469> because<00:00:45.620> high<00:00:45.980> blood<00:00:46.249> pressure

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
that's not because high blood pressure

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.880 
that's not because high blood pressure
causes<00:00:47.449> illness<00:00:47.629> that's<00:00:48.199> because<00:00:48.620> when<00:00:48.800> you

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
causes illness that's because when you

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.099 
causes illness that's because when you
have<00:00:49.039> a<00:00:49.069> sick<00:00:49.489> blood<00:00:49.789> vessel<00:00:50.210> system<00:00:50.420> the

have a sick blood vessel system the
blood<00:00:51.319> pressure<00:00:51.530> has<00:00:51.859> to<00:00:52.100> go<00:00:52.249> up<00:00:52.370> to

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
blood pressure has to go up to

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.549 
blood pressure has to go up to
compensate<00:00:53.210> that's<00:00:53.449> right<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:53.719> you<00:00:54.050> clog<00:00:54.350> up

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
compensate that's right you you clog up

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.700 
compensate that's right you you clog up
your<00:00:54.589> blood<00:00:54.890> vessel<00:00:55.249> system<00:00:55.460> with<00:00:56.269> fat

your blood vessel system with fat

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.700 
your blood vessel system with fat
cholesterol<00:00:58.059> blocked<00:00:59.059> arteries<00:00:59.659> spasms<00:01:00.559> that

cholesterol blocked arteries spasms that

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.309 
cholesterol blocked arteries spasms that
occur<00:01:01.069> narrowings<00:01:01.879> that<00:01:02.030> occur<00:01:02.359> blood<00:01:03.079> that

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
occur narrowings that occur blood that

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:04.899 
occur narrowings that occur blood that
sludge<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.889> you<00:01:04.040> get<00:01:04.159> all<00:01:04.190> this<00:01:04.430> peripheral

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
sludge is you get all this peripheral

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.270 
sludge is you get all this peripheral
resistance<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.080> as<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.260> result<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.920> heart

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
resistance and so as a result the heart

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.520 
resistance and so as a result the heart
has<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.880> increase<00:01:08.570> its<00:01:08.930> strength<00:01:09.140> and

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
has to increase its strength and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.410 
has to increase its strength and
activity<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:10.310> raises<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.210> blood<00:01:11.330> pressure

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
activity and raises the blood pressure

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.850 
activity and raises the blood pressure
the<00:01:11.780> whole<00:01:11.900> system<00:01:12.260> responds<00:01:12.620> that<00:01:12.740> way

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
the whole system responds that way

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.170 
the whole system responds that way
raises<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.370> blood<00:01:13.460> pressure<00:01:13.730> so<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.030> can

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
raises the blood pressure so I can

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.810 
raises the blood pressure so I can
deliver<00:01:14.540> nutrients<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.890> this<00:01:16.130> compromised

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
deliver nutrients to this compromised

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.520 
deliver nutrients to this compromised
tissue<00:01:17.360> that's<00:01:18.020> why<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.200> blood<00:01:18.350> pressure

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
tissue that's why the blood pressure

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.350 
tissue that's why the blood pressure
goes<00:01:18.800> up<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:19.670> what<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:19.910> elevated<00:01:20.270> blood

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
goes up and so what the elevated blood

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.550 
goes up and so what the elevated blood
pressure<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.780> doing<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.110> telling<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.500> that

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
pressure is doing is telling you that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.620 
pressure is doing is telling you that
your<00:01:21.860> system<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:22.370> sick<00:01:22.640> it's<00:01:23.090> not<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.510> blood

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
your system is sick it's not the blood

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.480 
your system is sick it's not the blood
pressure<00:01:23.870> is<00:01:24.050> making<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.530> system<00:01:24.710> sick<00:01:25.100> it's

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
pressure is making the system sick it's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.950 
pressure is making the system sick it's
telling<00:01:25.760> you<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:25.970> there's<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.240> problem<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
telling you that there's a problem the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.660 
telling you that there's a problem the
way<00:01:27.110> we<00:01:27.320> respond<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.830> would<00:01:27.980> give<00:01:28.130> pills<00:01:28.460> to

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
way we respond is would give pills to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.790 
way we respond is would give pills to
make<00:01:28.790> that<00:01:28.970> but<00:01:29.150> pressure<00:01:29.360> go<00:01:29.570> lower<00:01:29.810> it's<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
make that but pressure go lower it's the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.050 
make that but pressure go lower it's the
other<00:01:30.950> way<00:01:31.040> we<00:01:31.220> should<00:01:31.370> respond<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:31.940> way<00:01:31.970> we

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
other way we should respond the way we

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.180 
other way we should respond the way we
should<00:01:32.180> respond<00:01:32.720> is<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:32.990> decrease<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
should respond is to decrease the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.280 
should respond is to decrease the
peripheral<00:01:34.670> resistance<00:01:34.850> in<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.630> system<00:01:36.080> by

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
peripheral resistance in the system by

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.130 
peripheral resistance in the system by
making<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.830> system<00:01:37.280> healthy<00:01:37.870> stop<00:01:38.870> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
making the system healthy stop the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.230 
making the system healthy stop the
sludge<00:01:39.380> eat<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.740> blood<00:01:39.950> stop<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.640> spasms

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
sludge eat of the blood stop the spasms

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.480 
sludge eat of the blood stop the spasms
clear<00:01:41.840> off<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.230> narrowings<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.040> then<00:01:43.400> you

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
clear off the narrowings and then you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.860 
clear off the narrowings and then you
will<00:01:43.610> have<00:01:43.760> a<00:01:43.790> healthy<00:01:44.000> blood<00:01:44.390> vessel<00:01:44.720> system

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
will have a healthy blood vessel system

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.720 
will have a healthy blood vessel system
that's<00:01:45.230> not<00:01:45.380> going<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.650> break<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.130> turn<00:01:46.580> into

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
a stroke or a heart attack but that's

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.650 
a stroke or a heart attack but that's
not<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.880> way<00:01:49.970> you're<00:01:50.090> going<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.270> be<00:01:50.330> treated

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
not the way you're going to be treated

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.120 
not the way you're going to be treated
