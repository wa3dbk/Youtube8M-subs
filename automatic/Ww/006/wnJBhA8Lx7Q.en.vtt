up<00:00:35.519> into<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> tire<00:00:38.479> it's<00:00:39.479> important<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.930> you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
up into the tire it's important that you

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.479 
up into the tire it's important that you
put<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> little<00:00:40.559> bit<00:00:40.769> of<00:00:40.860> air<00:00:40.979> in<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> give

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
put a little bit of air in there to give

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.009 
put a little bit of air in there to give
the<00:00:41.610> tube<00:00:41.790> some<00:00:42.030> shape<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.420> stays<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.809> much

better now you're gonna start at the

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.350 
better now you're gonna start at the
valve<00:00:45.479> this<00:00:45.750> time<00:00:46.019> go<00:00:46.440> ahead<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.360> work

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
valve this time go ahead and just work

get it back into the seat there and if
you<00:00:59.009> start<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.369> the<00:00:59.460> valve<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.909> valves<00:01:00.210> going

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you start at the valve the valves going

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.299 
you start at the valve the valves going
to<00:01:00.420> hold<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> tire<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.259> so<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.830> can<00:01:01.979> just<00:01:02.129> kind

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to hold the tire in so you can just kind

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.359 
to hold the tire in so you can just kind
of<00:01:02.339> work<00:01:02.519> your<00:01:02.549> way<00:01:02.729> around<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:03.180> rest<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.509> the

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
of work your way around the rest of the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:13.609 
of work your way around the rest of the
wheel<00:01:07.640> stuff<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:12.409> it's<00:01:13.409> even

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
wheel stuff it in as you go it's even

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.050 
wheel stuff it in as you go it's even
okay<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.100> point<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.520> let<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> air<00:01:15.030> out

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
okay at this point to let that air out

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.700 
okay at this point to let that air out
that'll<00:01:15.540> make<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.869> little<00:01:16.020> easier<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> stuff

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that'll make it a little easier to stuff

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.490 
that'll make it a little easier to stuff
it<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.600> as<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.079> work<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.710> way<00:01:19.740> around<00:01:24.470> no<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it in as you work your way around no I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.880 
it in as you work your way around no I
don't<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.979> frustrated<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:27.750> next<00:01:28.080> part<00:01:28.290> can

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
don't get frustrated this next part can

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.510 
don't get frustrated this next part can
be<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.159> little<00:01:29.370> tricky<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:31.430> where<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
be a little tricky but where you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.850 
be a little tricky but where you
practice<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.090> easier<00:01:33.120> it<00:01:33.420> gets

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
practice the easier it gets

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.230 
practice the easier it gets
unfortunately<00:01:34.860> don't<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> practice<00:01:36.090> by

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
unfortunately don't want to practice by

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.430 
unfortunately don't want to practice by
getting<00:01:36.479> too<00:01:36.600> many<00:01:36.690> flats

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.539 

so<00:01:40.440> here's<00:01:40.740> we're<00:01:40.950> gonna<00:01:41.040> use<00:01:41.220> our<00:01:41.310> tire

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so here's we're gonna use our tire

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.460 
so here's we're gonna use our tire
levers<00:01:41.850> again<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:42.990> we've<00:01:43.110> got<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
levers again you can see we've got to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.170 
levers again you can see we've got to
this<00:01:43.590> point<00:01:43.830> it<00:01:44.370> might<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.670> pretty<00:01:44.850> hard<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
this point it might be pretty hard to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.730 
this point it might be pretty hard to
get<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.420> over<00:01:45.690> by<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.080> using<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.409> fingers

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
get this over by just using your fingers

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
get this over by just using your fingers
so<00:01:47.010> you're<00:01:47.610> gonna<00:01:47.729> turn<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.090> tire<00:01:48.299> lever

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
so you're gonna turn the tire lever

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.200 
so you're gonna turn the tire lever
around<00:01:49.040> once<00:01:50.040> again<00:01:50.310> stick<00:01:50.580> it<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.940> between

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
around once again stick it up in between

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.789 
around once again stick it up in between
the<00:01:51.860> wheel<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> tire<00:01:53.990> hold<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.200> part<00:01:55.560> on

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the wheel and the tire hold this part on

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.410 
the wheel and the tire hold this part on
this<00:01:56.010> side<00:01:56.190> down<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.790> doesn't<00:01:57.060> slip<00:01:57.240> off

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
this side down so it doesn't slip off

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.700 
this side down so it doesn't slip off
and<00:01:58.190> then<00:01:59.190> go<00:01:59.340> ahead<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.729> leverage<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and then go ahead and just leverage the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.610 
and then go ahead and just leverage the
tire<00:02:02.930> back<00:02:03.930> over

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.590 

you<00:02:07.580> can<00:02:07.730> see<00:02:07.940> there's<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.180> little<00:02:08.300> bit<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.540> the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
you can see there's a little bit of the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.900 
you can see there's a little bit of the
tube<00:02:08.780> sticking<00:02:09.050> out<00:02:09.320> there<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:10.460> want<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.760> go

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
tube sticking out there you want to go

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.260 
tube sticking out there you want to go
around<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.510> make<00:02:11.660> sure<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
around and make sure that you have the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.820 
around and make sure that you have the
tube<00:02:16.150> up<00:02:17.150> under<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.840> tire<00:02:18.050> there<00:02:18.470> we<00:02:18.560> go<00:02:18.710> it

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
tube up under the tire there we go it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.080 
tube up under the tire there we go it
just<00:02:18.920> takes<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.310> little<00:02:19.400> bit<00:02:19.520> of<00:02:19.700> working<00:02:20.000> to

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
just takes a little bit of working to

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.800 
just takes a little bit of working to
get<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:22.340> go<00:02:22.520> around<00:02:25.270> looks<00:02:26.270> good

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
get it so go around looks good

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.110 
get it so go around looks good
tubes<00:02:27.680> up<00:02:27.800> under<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.130> tire<00:02:28.310> not<00:02:28.700> stuck<00:02:28.970> in

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
tubes up under the tire not stuck in

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.870 
tubes up under the tire not stuck in
between<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.840> tire<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.290> rim<00:02:30.670> I'm<00:02:31.670> gonna

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
between the tire and the rim I'm gonna

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.610 
between the tire and the rim I'm gonna
show<00:02:32.030> you<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.210> easy<00:02:32.450> way<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.750> inflate<00:02:33.260> and

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
show you the easy way to inflate and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.020 
show you the easy way to inflate and
that<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.580> using<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.030> co2<00:02:35.390> system<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.910> by

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
that is using a co2 system this is by

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.820 
that is using a co2 system this is by
genuine<00:02:38.480> innovations<00:02:38.630> there's<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.590> lot<00:02:39.710> of

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
genuine innovations there's a lot of

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.030 
genuine innovations there's a lot of
other<00:02:39.980> manufacturers<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.820> make<00:02:41.000> them<00:02:42.040> okay

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
other manufacturers to make them okay

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.350 
other manufacturers to make them okay
your<00:02:43.160> co2<00:02:43.400> here<00:02:44.230> drop<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:49.150> that's<00:02:50.150> gonna

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
your co2 here drop it in that's gonna

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.600 
your co2 here drop it in that's gonna
pierce<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.930> seal<00:02:51.170> on<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.440> co2<00:02:51.650> make<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.430> nice

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
pierce the seal on the co2 make it nice

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.490 
pierce the seal on the co2 make it nice
and<00:02:52.640> easy<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.060> now<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.390> co2<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:53.960> open<00:02:54.230> once<00:02:54.410> you

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
and easy so now the co2 is open once you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.290 
and easy so now the co2 is open once you
pierce<00:02:54.770> these<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.550> have<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.880> use<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.150> whole

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
pierce these you have to use the whole

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.190 
pierce these you have to use the whole
thing<00:02:56.360> but<00:02:56.750> that's<00:02:56.960> okay<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.100> gonna<00:02:58.370> make

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
thing but that's okay this is gonna make

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.010 
thing but that's okay this is gonna make
inflating<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.350> effortless<00:03:01.720> open<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:02.840> up

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
inflating this effortless open that up

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.390 
inflating this effortless open that up
make<00:03:03.320> sure<00:03:03.350> your<00:03:03.530> valve<00:03:03.740> stems<00:03:04.010> open<00:03:06.280> go<00:03:07.280> ahead

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
make sure your valve stems open go ahead

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.790 
make sure your valve stems open go ahead
and<00:03:07.520> shove<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.910> on<00:03:08.060> there<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.590> first

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
and shove that on there and the first

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.930 
and shove that on there and the first
few<00:03:09.980> times<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.310> do<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.670> want<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.850> be

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
few times you do this you want to be

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.170 
few times you do this you want to be
careful<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:12.310> give<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.520> little<00:03:13.790> bit<00:03:14.060> of

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
careful just give it a little bit of

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.970 
careful just give it a little bit of
pressure<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.750> that's<00:03:15.080> easily<00:03:15.290> controlled<00:03:15.830> by

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
pressure and that's easily controlled by

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.460 
pressure and that's easily controlled by
using<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.340> little<00:03:16.520> trigger<00:03:16.820> there<00:03:17.320> go<00:03:18.320> ahead

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
using that little trigger there go ahead

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.580 
using that little trigger there go ahead
and<00:03:18.590> look<00:03:18.650> around<00:03:18.830> make<00:03:19.190> sure<00:03:20.350> take<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.380> look

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
and look around make sure take a look

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.550 
and look around make sure take a look
around<00:03:21.709> make<00:03:22.100> sure<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:23.020> tire<00:03:24.020> is<00:03:24.230> seated

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
around make sure that the tire is seated

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.870 
around make sure that the tire is seated
correctly<00:03:24.590> this<00:03:25.100> looks<00:03:25.340> good<00:03:25.550> there's<00:03:25.760> no

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
correctly this looks good there's no

tubes sticking out anywhere give it a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.880 
tubes sticking out anywhere give it a
little<00:03:28.730> more<00:03:31.780> check<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.870> tire<00:03:33.080> again<00:03:33.290> looking

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
little more check the tire again looking

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.580 
little more check the tire again looking
good<00:03:34.100> not<00:03:34.430> gonna<00:03:34.610> blow<00:03:34.790> off<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.330> then<00:03:36.290> just<00:03:36.470> go

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
good not gonna blow off and then just go

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.760 
good not gonna blow off and then just go
ahead<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.920> release<00:03:37.070> it<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:39.380> you're<00:03:39.500> good<00:03:39.680> to

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
ahead and release it and you're good to

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.490 
ahead and release it and you're good to
go

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500

but you do want to you do want to make
it<00:04:28.950> so<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:29.190> takes<00:04:29.400> some<00:04:29.550> effort<00:04:29.700> so<00:04:30.919> you<00:04:31.919> know

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
it so it takes some effort so you know

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.500 
it so it takes some effort so you know
just<00:04:32.340> enough<00:04:32.640> so<00:04:32.790> it<00:04:32.820> makes<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.120> mark<00:04:33.360> in<00:04:33.480> your

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
just enough so it makes a mark in your
