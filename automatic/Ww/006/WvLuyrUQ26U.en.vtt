 I think it's a small stream. 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.769
 This is not flowing. 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.450

 Well, let's draw the door to the cabin you want to know all this 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:13.510
 If you make it on the other side, you get stronger as soon as you leave the cabin. 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.170
 Yeah, it gets soaked. 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:23.190
