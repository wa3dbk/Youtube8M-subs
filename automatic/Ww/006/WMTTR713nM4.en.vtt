00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
shot at a six shooter which is obviously

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.830 
shot at a six shooter which is obviously
the<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.809> wild<00:00:58.530> west<00:00:58.980> themed<00:00:59.609> sick<00:01:00.600> shot

the kind of wild west themed sick shot

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.410 
the kind of wild west themed sick shot
so<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.170> has<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> lot<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> damage<00:01:01.920> per<00:01:02.609> round<00:01:02.969> but

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so it has a lot of damage per round but

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.630 
so it has a lot of damage per round but
it<00:01:03.539> also<00:01:03.719> only<00:01:04.110> has<00:01:04.320> six<00:01:04.619> shots<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.460> does

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it also only has six shots and it does

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.179 
it also only has six shots and it does
take<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> while<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.180> reload<00:01:06.950> compared<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
take a while to reload compared to the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
take a while to reload compared to the
other<00:01:08.340> ones<00:01:08.400> because<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.200> amount<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> ammo

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
other ones because of the amount of ammo

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.140 
other ones because of the amount of ammo
has<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.340> thought<00:01:11.520> it'd<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> lot<00:01:11.939> quicker

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
has like I thought it'd be a lot quicker

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
has like I thought it'd be a lot quicker
but<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.869> pretty<00:01:13.140> much<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> same<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.770> you're

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
but it's pretty much the same so you're

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.609 
but it's pretty much the same so you're
basically<00:01:14.549> getting<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:16.700> faster<00:01:17.700> rate<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.210> fire

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
basically getting a faster rate of fire

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.499 
basically getting a faster rate of fire
and<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.759> less<00:01:20.909> ammo<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.420> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and a little bit less ammo and as you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.940 
and a little bit less ammo and as you
can<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.810> bullets<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.229> dip<00:01:22.530> actually

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
can see the bullets do dip actually

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
can see the bullets do dip actually
slightly<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> reload<00:01:24.390> times<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.840> not

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
slightly and the reload times have not

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620 
slightly and the reload times have not
been<00:01:25.170> increased<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.450> bad

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
been increased so it's it's it's not bad

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.940 
been increased so it's it's it's not bad
i'm<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.780> gonna<00:01:27.990> lie<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.590> issue<00:01:28.740> i've

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
i'm not gonna lie the only issue i've

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.280 
i'm not gonna lie the only issue i've
had<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.060> i<00:01:30.090> miss<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.960> splash

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
had with it is that i miss is the splash

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.230 
had with it is that i miss is the splash
damage<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.770> love<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> splash<00:01:32.549> damage<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
damage I love the splash damage on the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.460 
damage I love the splash damage on the
other<00:01:33.360> peashooters<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.439> of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
other peashooters I think that's one of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.170 
other peashooters I think that's one of
the<00:01:34.560> main<00:01:34.799> things<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.610> about<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.909> because

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the main things I like about it because

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.840 
the main things I like about it because
even<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.540> miss<00:01:36.979> you<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> good

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
even if you miss you do get a good

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060 
even if you miss you do get a good
amount<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.270> damage<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.750> those<00:01:40.079> bad<00:01:40.290> boys<00:01:40.320> with

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
amount of damage on those bad boys with

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.620 
amount of damage on those bad boys with
a<00:01:41.100> little<00:01:41.400> bit<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> splash<00:01:41.729> damage<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.270> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
a little bit of splash damage so that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.499 
a little bit of splash damage so that
that's<00:01:42.869> something<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.350> take<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:43.649> account<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
that's something to take into account I

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.280 
that's something to take into account I
obviously<00:01:45.509> you're<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.720> always<00:01:45.960> one<00:01:46.229> hundred

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
obviously you're not always one hundred

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.830 
obviously you're not always one hundred
percent<00:01:46.500> accurate<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.790> if<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.270> very

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
percent accurate but if you are very

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.690 
percent accurate but if you are very
accurate<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> great<00:01:49.829> weapon<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
accurate this is a great weapon for you

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.149 
accurate this is a great weapon for you
but<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:52.020> sometimes<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:52.530> hard<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
but it's sometimes very hard to get the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.649 
but it's sometimes very hard to get the
shots<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.850> miss<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> tiny<00:01:54.329> bit<00:01:54.509> hello

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.179 
sunflower p feel me thank you
but<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:56.990> know<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.140> mean<00:01:57.409> I'm<00:01:57.530> pretty<00:01:57.560> accurate

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
but you know I mean I'm pretty accurate

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.080 
but you know I mean I'm pretty accurate
so<00:01:58.790> it's<00:01:59.119> not<00:01:59.390> too<00:01:59.780> hard<00:02:00.049> of<00:02:00.259> a<00:02:00.350> thing<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.590> do

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
so it's not too hard of a thing to do

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090 
so it's not too hard of a thing to do
but<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.270> power<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:03.049> power<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.439> actual

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
but the power the power of the actual

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.260 
but the power the power of the actual
weapon<00:02:04.340> itself<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:04.759> pretty<00:02:04.909> good<00:02:05.149> so

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
weapon itself is pretty good so

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.850 
weapon itself is pretty good so
otherwise<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.200> completely<00:02:06.560> standard

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860
