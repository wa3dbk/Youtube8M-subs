00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.980
 [music] 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.010
 so 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.880
 the second part of the video course how to collect 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.099
 Rubik's Cube 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.550
 in this part we will learn to collect 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.910
 completely first layer for this you 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.640
 should already be able to properly collect 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.619
 white cross 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.510
 if you can't do bills then you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.859
 must first see the first part 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.579
 video course 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.739
 and if you know how to collect fully 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.230
 the first layer came up with it yourself 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.420
 either watched some other lesson then 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.879
 you can calmly watch the following video 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.379
 to go to the second stage I you 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.489
 I advise you to fix properly 1 and now 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.760
 we are quick 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.399
 let's put together the cross is already the right cross on 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.489
 the white side for starters we are looking comfortable 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.149
 stickers here is a handy edge 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.300
 we put it then we put this edge 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.270
 under our center to determine where 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.570
 should stand the rest of the ribs on 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.780
 we have it conveniently and edge 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.390
 but if we put it will not stand 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.540
 under its center so she must 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.820
 become here so here we are 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.619
 we bring our edge under our edge 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.009
 I return the rib to my center 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.460
 that 2 cleaned insisted on their 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.200
 centers farther we see it comfortable 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.640
 Sticker insert it 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.939
 and it is convenient and all that is left 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.670
 the cross is assembled correctly proceed to the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.579
 assembly to collect the first layer to us 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:50.399
 need to add four corners correctly 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:56.700
 standing in their places of all such 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:02:02.500
 angles 4 we are interested in angles only those 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:06.850
 which is the white element 1 2 3 4 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.440
 they have two positions these angles can 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.480
 stand either above or below first 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.790
 we need to put those angles which 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:22.930
 is on top because they will be 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:26.230
 much easier how to put them white but 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.320
 top corner can look anywhere well 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:35.410
 can look anywhere more precisely at you 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:38.680
 up or to the right the formula for this is not 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.760
 changing the main thing we find where 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.720
 he must stand 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.989
 if we see the orange blue element on 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.550
 angle means we put this element between 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.440
 orange and blue center to 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.700
 put this angle in place 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.700
 twist bang bang and 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.690
 bang-bang formula until he gets to 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.350
 place so remember what this formula is 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.880
 right up right back up back 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.850
 check became or not became but 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.480
 rotated means we twist further to the right 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.200
 up right back up back became 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.709
 no right up right back up 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:32.350
 back up again unfolded right 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:34.720
 up right back up back right 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.840
 up right and back up back all 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.930
 we put the corner in its place looking 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.030
 top here found 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.880
 brought under their two centers green 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.660
 orange and twist bang-bang until 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.360
 until this piece becomes his 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.690
 remember to remember the place again 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:00.540
 formula who have not yet understood is very simple 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:04.530
 right up right back up back 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.250
 right up right back up back 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.380
 right up 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.670
 right back up back after 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.110
 every bang bang 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.239
 first I advise you to check 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.640
 cube position because you can 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.020
 without to 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.140
 the exact number of bang bang bang do and 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.239
 will not notice when he will fall into place 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.160
 right up right back up back 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.920
 right up right back up 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.490
 back we all put two elements on 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.880
 take your place next element is white 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.270
 red-blue means we put the dice so 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.820
 so we can see these two centers set 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:45.740
 this corner above your place and twist 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:49.669
 bang bang and got three corners into place 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:55.340
 and the last corner is green-red 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:57.080
 put between the green red center 1 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.770
 bang bang there was enough to put this 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.550
 corner i congratulate you 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.650
 the first layer is assembled on the cube assembly 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:12.339
 will be much easier 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.339
 [music]
