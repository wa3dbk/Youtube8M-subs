same to me

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
same to me
I<00:00:34.500> will<00:00:34.770> say<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:34.980> colors<00:00:35.460> might<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> little

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
I will say that colors might be a little

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.819 
I will say that colors might be a little
more<00:00:36.300> vivid<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.170> I'm<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.380> sure<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
more vivid but I'm not sure if the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.650 
more vivid but I'm not sure if the
colors<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.250> actually<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.760> vivid<00:00:39.059> or<00:00:39.210> if

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
colors are actually more vivid or if

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.840 
colors are actually more vivid or if
it's<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.290> me<00:00:40.530> being<00:00:40.800> crazy<00:00:41.070> thinking<00:00:41.670> that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
it's just me being crazy thinking that

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
it's just me being crazy thinking that
well<00:00:42.360> they<00:00:42.510> said<00:00:42.719> something's<00:00:43.110> new<00:00:43.290> therefore

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
well they said something's new therefore

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.979 
well they said something's new therefore
that<00:00:44.100> must<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.460> what's<00:00:45.180> new<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> don't<00:00:45.719> know<00:00:45.840> if

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that must be what's new I don't know if

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.010 
that must be what's new I don't know if
I'm<00:00:46.110> searching<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.239> yeah<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.780> first

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
I'm searching for it but yeah the first

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.500 
I'm searching for it but yeah the first
thing<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.800> change<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> dashboard<00:00:51.000> style

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
thing is they change the dashboard style

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
thing is they change the dashboard style
in<00:00:51.870> some<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.039> insignificant

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
in some way that is so insignificant

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.850 
in some way that is so insignificant
that<00:00:53.969> I'm<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.239> quite<00:00:54.480> sure<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.680> or

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that I'm not quite sure if I see it or

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.540 
that I'm not quite sure if I see it or
if<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.030> crazy<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.949> next<00:00:59.219> thing<00:00:59.399> they

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
if I'm just crazy the next thing they

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.790 
if I'm just crazy the next thing they
changed<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.359> they're<00:01:00.510> calling

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
changed is what they're calling

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.579 
changed is what they're calling

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
detailing exactly what that is it might

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.539 
detailing exactly what that is it might
be<00:01:06.630> smart<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.500> detail<00:01:07.830> what<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> mean

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
be smart not to detail what it is I mean

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.160 
be smart not to detail what it is I mean
I<00:01:08.610> know<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> try<00:01:09.270> not<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.630> give<00:01:09.780> away<00:01:09.990> all

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I know that I try not to give away all

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.740 
I know that I try not to give away all
the<00:01:10.290> details<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:11.119> security<00:01:12.119> systems<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the details of my security systems to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.390 
the details of my security systems to
whoever<00:01:13.049> might<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.290> listening<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:13.950> they're

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
whoever might be listening so they're

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.270 
whoever might be listening so they're
probably<00:01:14.610> doing<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.240> same<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.770> ties<00:01:17.009> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
probably doing the same but that ties in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.560 
probably doing the same but that ties in
to<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> second<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:17.970> which<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.409> xgd<00:01:19.460> 4.5

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
to the second one which is the xgd 4.5

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.789 
to the second one which is the xgd 4.5
challenge-response<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.810> you're<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.439> me<00:01:22.650> you

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
challenge-response if you're like me you

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
challenge-response if you're like me you
have<00:01:22.830> no<00:01:23.310> idea<00:01:23.340> what<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.330> did<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> whole

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
have no idea what that is I did a whole

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.830 
have no idea what that is I did a whole
bunch<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> research<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.400> turns<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
bunch of research then it turns out that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.460 
bunch of research then it turns out that
xgd<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.340> format<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.640> write<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.329> discs<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.439> I

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
xgd is a format to write to discs so I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.530 
xgd is a format to write to discs so I
can<00:01:31.799> only<00:01:31.950> assume<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.610> challenge-response

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
can only assume the challenge-response

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.749 
can only assume the challenge-response
is<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> way<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> make<00:01:34.560> sure<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.280> discs

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
is a way to make sure that the discs

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.910 
is a way to make sure that the discs
that<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:36.060> being<00:01:36.210> written<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.990> legitimate

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that are being written to are legitimate

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.140 
that are being written to are legitimate
that<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:38.400> that's<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> whole<00:01:39.119> deal

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that that's that's what the whole deal

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.219 
that that's that's what the whole deal
is<00:01:39.360> about<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.170> um<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.820> mostly<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.600> piracy

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
is about that um this is mostly a piracy

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.230 
is about that um this is mostly a piracy
update<00:01:43.590> there's<00:01:43.829> some<00:01:44.070> small<00:01:44.460> change<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
update there's some small change to the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120 
update there's some small change to the
