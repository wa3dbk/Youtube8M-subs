00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
Pearl Harbor this movie this is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.340 
Pearl Harbor this movie this is
something<00:02:03.119> Steven<00:02:03.450> Spielberg<00:02:03.840> asked<00:02:04.140> me<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
something Steven Spielberg asked me to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.410 
something Steven Spielberg asked me to
direct<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.369> worked<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> script<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.180> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
direct and we worked on a script and I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.449 
direct and we worked on a script and I
just<00:02:06.930> felt<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> wouldn't<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.649> right

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
just felt it wouldn't be right

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.800 
just felt it wouldn't be right
because<00:02:09.459> if<00:02:09.610> we<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.000> military<00:02:10.420> had<00:02:10.539> such<00:02:10.720> a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
because if we the military had such a

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.199 
because if we the military had such a
credibility<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.740> it<00:02:11.890> adds<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.370> realism<00:02:12.880> to

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
credibility and it adds to realism to

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.070 
credibility and it adds to realism to
the<00:02:13.330> movie<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:15.569> think<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.630> military<00:02:16.989> are

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
the movie and I think the military are

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.800 
the movie and I think the military are
looking<00:02:17.319> at<00:02:17.440> this<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.830> two<00:02:18.250> ways<00:02:18.400> one<00:02:18.810> it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
looking at this in two ways one it

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.320 
looking at this in two ways one it
besides<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.830> fun<00:02:21.040> factor<00:02:21.610> they're<00:02:22.000> looking

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
besides the fun factor they're looking

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.610 
besides the fun factor they're looking
at<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.599> in<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.810> serious<00:02:23.170> thing<00:02:23.349> it's<00:02:23.500> a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
at this in the serious thing it's a

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.680 
at this in the serious thing it's a
recruiting<00:02:24.220> factor<00:02:24.640> because<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.330> it's<00:02:25.569> an

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
recruiting factor because this it's an

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.110 
recruiting factor because this it's an
age<00:02:25.840> range<00:02:26.200> it's<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.069> broad<00:02:27.310> age<00:02:27.550> range<00:02:27.910> of
