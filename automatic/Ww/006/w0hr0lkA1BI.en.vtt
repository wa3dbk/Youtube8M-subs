peaceful<00:00:38.190> mode<00:00:38.930> it's<00:00:39.930> basically<00:00:40.879> founding

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
peaceful mode it's basically founding

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
peaceful mode it's basically founding
use<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.670> survival<00:00:44.670> mode<00:00:45.350> but<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:47.340> doesn't

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
use in survival mode but it doesn't

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:57.260 
use in survival mode but it doesn't
really<00:00:49.550> helps<00:00:50.809> s<00:00:53.719> acid<00:00:54.739> just<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:56.730> isn't<00:00:57.120> any

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
really helps s acid just there isn't any

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.830 
really helps s acid just there isn't any
mobs<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.930> survival<00:00:58.739> mode<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:59.399> you<00:01:00.059> switch<00:01:00.600> on

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
mobs in survival mode if you switch on

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.700 
mobs in survival mode if you switch on
on<00:01:01.140> peaceful<00:01:01.739> mood<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.149> heals

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
on peaceful mood and it heals

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.390 
on peaceful mood and it heals
automatically<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.189> read<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:07.100> but<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
automatically as you can read here but I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.539 
automatically as you can read here but I
think<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> good<00:01:10.560> update<00:01:11.400> s<00:01:12.229> as

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
think it's not really a good update s as

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.770 
think it's not really a good update s as
it<00:01:14.549> defeats<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.030> purpose<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.960> survival<00:01:16.650> mode

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
it defeats the purpose of survival mode

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.499 
it defeats the purpose of survival mode
yep<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.310> really<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.030> touch<00:01:21.270> on

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
yep so I'm not really going to touch on

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.780 
yep so I'm not really going to touch on
