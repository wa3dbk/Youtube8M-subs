it it's affordable it's a specially
built<00:02:21.550> for<00:02:21.819> this<00:02:22.060> car<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.860> got<00:02:24.280> very

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
built for this car and it is got very

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.630 
built for this car and it is got very
high<00:02:24.880> ratings<00:02:25.450> which<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.950> very<00:02:27.190> important

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
high ratings which it's very important

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
high ratings which it's very important
as<00:02:27.730> well<00:02:27.930> now<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:30.519> as<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.790> said<00:02:31.060> regarding<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
as well now so as I said regarding the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.100 
as well now so as I said regarding the
performance<00:02:32.650> difference<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:34.600> did<00:02:34.810> make<00:02:35.080> a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
performance difference it did make a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.190 
performance difference it did make a
very<00:02:35.769> very<00:02:36.190> big<00:02:36.519> difference<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.420> when<00:02:38.170> I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
very very big difference so when I

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.440 
very very big difference so when I
plugged<00:02:38.530> in<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> chip<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.280> didn't<00:02:39.970> expect<00:02:40.360> that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
plugged in the chip I didn't expect that

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.630 
plugged in the chip I didn't expect that
massive<00:02:41.260> difference<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.769> plugged<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.340> I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
massive difference I plugged it in I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640 
massive difference I plugged it in I
took<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.390> for<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.569> drive<00:02:43.600> around<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.200> block<00:02:44.319> I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
took it for a drive around the block I

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.050 
took it for a drive around the block I
didn't<00:02:45.010> feel<00:02:45.130> anything<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.640> I'll<00:02:45.730> say<00:02:45.880> well

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
didn't feel anything and I'll say well

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.990 
didn't feel anything and I'll say well
maybe<00:02:46.269> what's<00:02:46.630> going<00:02:46.900> on<00:02:47.019> it's<00:02:47.230> not<00:02:47.319> right<00:02:48.000> and

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
maybe what's going on it's not right and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.670 
maybe what's going on it's not right and
I<00:02:49.120> went<00:02:49.420> through<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.720> instructions<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.470> read

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
I went through the instructions I read

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.430 
I went through the instructions I read
the<00:02:50.829> papers<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.519> actually<00:02:52.000> start<00:02:52.360> there<00:02:52.600> once

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
the papers and actually start there once

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.110 
the papers and actually start there once
you<00:02:53.590> plug<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.670> get<00:02:54.820> your<00:02:54.970> engine

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
you plug in you have to get your engine

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.970 
you plug in you have to get your engine
warm<00:02:55.540> before<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.019> chip<00:02:56.230> will<00:02:56.380> actually<00:02:56.709> start

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
warm before the chip will actually start

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.789 
warm before the chip will actually start
to<00:02:57.190> work<00:02:57.430> because<00:02:58.170> when<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.350> engine<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.709> cold

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
to work because when the engine is cold

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.530 
to work because when the engine is cold
it's<00:03:00.250> not<00:03:00.400> going<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.610> put<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> performance

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
it's not going to put in the performance

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.140 
it's not going to put in the performance
your<00:03:02.049> car<00:03:02.290> could<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.769> capable<00:03:03.130> giving<00:03:03.700> out<00:03:03.880> as

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
your car could be capable giving out as

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.309 
your car could be capable giving out as
it's<00:03:04.390> not<00:03:04.600> good<00:03:04.780> for<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.959> engine<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:06.130> then

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
it's not good for the engine so then

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.440 
it's not good for the engine so then
I've<00:03:07.560> done<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.830> longer<00:03:08.310> drive<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.879> warmed<00:03:09.180> up<00:03:09.300> my

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
I've done a longer drive I warmed up my

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.570 
I've done a longer drive I warmed up my
engine<00:03:09.569> properly<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.379> took<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.980> out<00:03:11.040> for<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.370> nice

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.780 
engine properly I took it out for a nice
straight<00:03:11.970> line<00:03:12.000> empty<00:03:12.690> roads<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.489> had<00:03:14.489> such

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
are not bored of this car that's one of

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.400 
are not bored of this car that's one of
the<00:03:29.940> reasons<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.930> chip<00:03:31.200> it

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
the reasons is because of the chip it

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.530 
the reasons is because of the chip it
actually<00:03:32.099> gives<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.549> massive<00:03:33.180> massive

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
actually gives a massive massive

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
most common fault is people need to

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.990 
most common fault is people need to
upgrade<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.840> spark<00:04:37.260> plugs<00:04:37.620> because<00:04:38.000> when

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
upgrade the spark plugs because when

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.610 
upgrade the spark plugs because when
your<00:04:39.210> engine<00:04:39.419> is<00:04:39.690> pushing<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.169> big<00:04:40.380> power

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
your engine is pushing that big power

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.860 
your engine is pushing that big power
you<00:04:41.070> need<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.340> make<00:04:41.520> sure<00:04:41.550> your<00:04:42.030> car<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.300> firing

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
you need to make sure your car is firing

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.950 
you need to make sure your car is firing
properly<00:04:43.139> and<00:04:43.849> what<00:04:44.849> it<00:04:45.150> is<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.389> took<00:04:45.780> their

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
properly and what it is I took their

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.490 
properly and what it is I took their
advice<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.650> changed<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.810> I've<00:04:48.810> got<00:04:49.020> my<00:04:49.169> spark

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
advice I changed it I've got my spark

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.450 
advice I changed it I've got my spark
plugs<00:04:49.770> all<00:04:50.010> six<00:04:50.280> spark<00:04:50.910> plugs<00:04:51.210> changed<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.460> of

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
plugs all six spark plugs changed and of

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.969 
plugs all six spark plugs changed and of
course<00:04:53.789> when<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.419> do<00:04:54.539> do<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.900> already<00:04:55.169> make

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
course when you do do it already make

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.620 
course when you do do it already make
sure<00:04:56.190> it's<00:04:56.370> not<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.520> cheap<00:04:56.820> one<00:04:57.060> make<00:04:57.360> sure<00:04:57.389> it's

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
sure it's not a cheap one make sure it's

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.010 
sure it's not a cheap one make sure it's
a<00:04:57.750> proper<00:04:57.930> high<00:04:58.260> quality<00:04:58.770> spark<00:04:59.070> plug

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
a proper high quality spark plug

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.760 
a proper high quality spark plug
which<00:05:00.260> is<00:05:00.560> obviously<00:05:02.050> going<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.140> be<00:05:03.200> capable

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
which is obviously going to be capable

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.220 
which is obviously going to be capable
of<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.070> performance<00:05:04.610> for<00:05:04.730> this<00:05:04.880> car<00:05:05.150> so<00:05:06.140> I've

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
of the performance for this car so I've

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.010 
of the performance for this car so I've
got<00:05:06.440> that<00:05:06.590> done<00:05:07.150> car<00:05:08.150> felt<00:05:08.540> amazing

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
got that done car felt amazing

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.680 
got that done car felt amazing
afterwards<00:05:09.530> no<00:05:09.830> issues<00:05:10.190> there<00:05:10.430> felt<00:05:11.120> amazing

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
afterwards no issues there felt amazing

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.150 
afterwards no issues there felt amazing
fell<00:05:11.930> fast<00:05:12.290> felt<00:05:12.680> good

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
fell fast felt good

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.600 
fell fast felt good
loved<00:05:13.670> it<00:05:14.560> now<00:05:15.560> another<00:05:16.040> thing<00:05:16.160> I<00:05:16.370> need<00:05:16.520> to

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
loved it now another thing I need to

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.210 
loved it now another thing I need to
mention<00:05:16.760> is<00:05:17.380> obviously<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.560> way<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:18.920> tear<00:05:19.130> of

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
mention is obviously the way and tear of

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.190 
mention is obviously the way and tear of
your<00:05:19.250> car<00:05:19.550> is<00:05:19.760> going<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.000> be<00:05:20.060> more<00:05:20.540> faster

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
your car is going to be more faster

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.690 
your car is going to be more faster
basically<00:05:21.680> let's<00:05:21.890> put<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.190> this<00:05:22.220> way<00:05:22.340> if

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
basically let's put it this way if

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.400 
basically let's put it this way if
you're<00:05:22.850> going<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.090> have<00:05:23.240> more<00:05:23.690> power<00:05:23.960> into

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
you're going to have more power into

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.810 
you're going to have more power into
your<00:05:24.530> car<00:05:24.710> more<00:05:25.040> power<00:05:25.280> into<00:05:25.550> your<00:05:25.580> rear

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
your car more power into your rear

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.940 
your car more power into your rear
wheels<00:05:26.060> for<00:05:26.900> example<00:05:27.320> your<00:05:27.440> tires<00:05:27.650> are<00:05:27.860> going

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
wheels for example your tires are going

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.710 
wheels for example your tires are going
to<00:05:28.040> go<00:05:28.130> faster<00:05:28.670> that's<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:29.000> fact<00:05:29.270> because<00:05:29.450> it

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
to go faster that's a fact because it

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.060 
to go faster that's a fact because it
ties<00:05:29.870> are<00:05:30.020> going<00:05:30.140> to<00:05:30.200> spin<00:05:30.410> out<00:05:30.560> all<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.860> time

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
ties are going to spin out all the time

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.720 
ties are going to spin out all the time
which<00:05:31.940> don't<00:05:32.780> forget<00:05:33.140> fun<00:05:33.890> cost<00:05:34.250> money<00:05:34.520> you

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
which don't forget fun cost money you

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.940 
which don't forget fun cost money you
can't<00:05:34.970> have<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.480> performance<00:05:36.290> car<00:05:36.560> for<00:05:36.740> free

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
can't have a performance car for free

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.540 
can't have a performance car for free
for<00:05:37.640> cheap<00:05:37.850> now<00:05:38.570> since<00:05:39.320> I<00:05:39.440> changed<00:05:39.650> thing<00:05:39.980> my

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
for cheap now since I changed thing my

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.790 
for cheap now since I changed thing my
since<00:05:41.120> I've<00:05:41.270> put<00:05:41.480> my<00:05:41.630> chip<00:05:41.930> my<00:05:42.140> tires<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.590> go<00:05:42.740> on

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
since I've put my chip my tires I go on

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.250 
since I've put my chip my tires I go on
quicker<00:05:43.100> all<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.240> other<00:05:44.420> bits<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:44.750> bobs<00:05:44.840> is

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
quicker all the other bits and bobs is

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.720 
quicker all the other bits and bobs is
just<00:05:45.530> going<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.740> wear<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:46.100> test<00:05:46.340> slightly

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
just going to wear and test slightly

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.120 
just going to wear and test slightly
faster<00:05:47.240> it's<00:05:47.840> all<00:05:48.020> depending<00:05:48.560> how<00:05:48.680> you<00:05:48.710> drive

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
faster it's all depending how you drive
