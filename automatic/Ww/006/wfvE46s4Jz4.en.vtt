00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:24.680
 I'm going to eat today 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:24.680
 tanguy de lamotte france in title 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:46.880
 and it's going to go far so we have to 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.130
 made of a shopping list 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.080
 he actually follows ski to tanguy eating 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.720
 during the sold globe last year 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.980
 and we went on three weeks 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.660
 race for our boat and then we have 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.309
 doubled the quantities so suddenly we have 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.880
 stored in the crates that can be 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.740
 see here on each side of the boat and we 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.970
 organized it according to what there is 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.970
 had in so there are tags 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:25.470
 he stopped his mom the hiv is actually 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.490
 we do not have too much because the tanguy and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.890
 franÃ§ois does not like freeze-dried 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:37.380
 vacuum food canned and 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.780
 then standard starchy foods it is estimated to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.370
 just about the total weight embedded here 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.690
 for the jacques vabre at 200 kg of 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.700
 food but it's a choice 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.920
 that we made of having very little 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.170
 freeze-dried if we had made 100% 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.960
 lyophilized as surely have some 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.850
 teams that aims for victory one can 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.850
 reduce the weight by almost half 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:11.520
 tanguy I know he has a cute sin 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:14.010
 it's candy but eat ham 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.590
 bayonne and sweets crocos 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.720
 clothes like the meat of the GraubÃ¼nden 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.570
 a little bit of chocolate the sinkhole 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:31.890
 between sausage is good that of 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:33.420
 douarnenez we take indeed fee 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.980
 not necessarily only for the first day 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.959
 it can last a week from fresh to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.459
 edge so it's not products 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.930
 dairy that we put in the fridge for sure 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.680
 but we take eggs 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.350
 Taking vegetables fruit is 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.350
 well that one says vicious lhenry 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.210
 when it was introduced 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.000

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.280

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.920
 filter very very hungry we suck water 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.960
 of sea 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.500
 there is a jack actually that pushes the water 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.000
 through a filter and the salt is retained 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.550
 there is only pure fresh water that 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.250

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.130
 the little tank that's here the water 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.510
