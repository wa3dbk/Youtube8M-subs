permits you to then purchase I was able
to<00:01:16.049> use<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.680> find<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> feature<00:01:17.580> that

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
to use that we find the feature that

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.810 
to use that we find the feature that
lets<00:01:18.420> us<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:19.290> activate<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> card<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
lets us then activate the card that

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
lets us then activate the card that
gives<00:01:21.150> us<00:01:21.299> some<00:01:21.479> slight<00:01:21.720> benefit<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.229> having

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
gives us some slight benefit for having

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.590 
gives us some slight benefit for having
these<00:01:22.590> nine<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.850> basic<00:01:25.490> actions<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.270> or

these nine are the basic actions that or

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.620 
these nine are the basic actions that or
items<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.939> discover<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.479> any

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
items that we can discover with any

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.190 
items that we can discover with any
scenario<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:32.159> also<00:01:32.490> select

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
scenario then we will also select

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
scenario then we will also select
randomly<00:01:34.200> some<00:01:34.710> others<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.270> 35<00:01:36.270> other<00:01:36.479> ones

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
randomly some others that 35 other ones

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.149 
randomly some others that 35 other ones
