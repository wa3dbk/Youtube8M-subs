00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.760
 the emergency 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.970
 that somebody can do something again in a certain time 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.080
 and this time 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.380
 Bosnia a good impression 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.980
 especially hard 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400
 and now on all fronts at approx 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.920
 this time in Copenhagen 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.820

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.640
 socially that had 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.000

 you have 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.800
 not take place on the net and be determined in the party 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.330
 but instead there is also Super League create 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.470
 and yes there is no one now and good and happy

 Sunderland 2 0 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.770
 they could also have been Hessen's takers 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.520
 I think I do 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.160
 everyday battery filling 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.570
 the CAC 40 gave the first match point

 Just keep doing damage 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.780

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.200
 Percent more then have had to hit the "Thanks to overcome seems 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.120
 second case 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.080
 again, that's it 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.610
 because it's the last one 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 the train is headed 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.230

 Round through the place 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 everything 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.070

 on the occasion of the best player and I almost 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.269
 each 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.849
 but then there should be 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.739
 he is the perfect place to enter 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.789
 Mercedes is here

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:49.139
 location 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.769
 so who just wanted it 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.769
 both gave up the fronts why do we do the same 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.749
 not so far just wants us the other 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.479
 a strand of hair is likely to hit a meeting very much be careful that one 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.169

 it is not completely checked 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.549
 with the name had run away 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.570
 but I will be thrilling now 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.559
 for having a good way 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:42.889
 I think about now 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.989
 I'm overjoyed 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.609
 or maybe just 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.949
 and thus a possible takeover but there are not any effects 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:52.610
 led 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.639

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.300
 reached from Minden 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.529
 No 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.819
 why is there any concern that a person has introduced Reuters 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:45.710
 deductions 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.710
 on websites also made and I continue fighting 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.090
 then just the blind 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.379

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.900
 because he almost went that fast, the battery is three minutes 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.850
 William and of course that can be more biting in every episode 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.860

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.800

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.460
 This could be the pressure on me 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.860
 you can just dismiss after the "accident" 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.979
 over 30 percent 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.319

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.020
