00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
have to see the detail well by the looks

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.149 
have to see the detail well by the looks
of<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.349> uh<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:40.160> know<00:03:41.260> like<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.440> person<00:03:42.890> like<00:03:43.040> in

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
to the side where there's like less

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.940 
to the side where there's like less
light<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:59.660> that<00:03:59.840> way<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.200> reflection<00:04:00.769> of<00:04:00.829> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
light so that way the reflection of the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.349 
light so that way the reflection of the
light<00:04:00.980> won't<00:04:01.280> hit<00:04:01.459> too<00:04:01.579> much<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:01.940> graphic

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
light won't hit too much of the graphic

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.449 
light won't hit too much of the graphic
as<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.959> thing<00:04:03.140> about<00:04:03.290> graphite<00:04:03.799> don't<00:04:04.010> pencils

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
as a thing about graphite don't pencils

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.720 
as a thing about graphite don't pencils
if<00:04:05.239> light<00:04:05.629> it's<00:04:06.049> too<00:04:06.290> much<00:04:06.470> on<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.709> like<00:04:06.920> you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
if light it's too much on it like you
