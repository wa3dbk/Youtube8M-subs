00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
it um it's kind of thick it does have

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.399 
it um it's kind of thick it does have
like<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> little<00:03:16.169> bit<00:03:16.409> of<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:17.389> greasy<00:03:18.389> feel<00:03:19.139> to<00:03:19.379> it

think that that would be a good thing
because<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.370> feels<00:03:23.639> like<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:23.970> might<00:03:24.000> have<00:03:24.389> a

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
because it feels like it might have a

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.589 
because it feels like it might have a
lot<00:03:24.629> of<00:03:24.659> slip<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.069> next<00:03:26.280> item<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.209> have
