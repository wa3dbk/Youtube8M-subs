00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
Muscle Shoals and then the storms

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.280 
Muscle Shoals and then the storms
weakened<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:20.970> fizzle<00:05:21.420> as<00:05:21.570> they<00:05:21.720> move<00:05:21.900> down<00:05:22.080> to

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
weakened and fizzle as they move down to

still<00:05:23.490> yes<00:05:23.730> a<00:05:23.760> good<00:05:24.000> chance<00:05:24.240> of<00:05:24.390> rain<00:05:24.570> on

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
still yes a good chance of rain on

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.980 
still yes a good chance of rain on
Friday<00:05:25.020> but<00:05:25.170> not<00:05:25.320> an<00:05:25.470> all-day<00:05:25.800> rain<00:05:26.810> all<00:05:27.810> right

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
Friday but not an all-day rain all right

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.200 
Friday but not an all-day rain all right
so<00:05:28.290> this<00:05:28.440> is<00:05:28.500> Saturday<00:05:28.890> we're<00:05:29.850> kind<00:05:30.000> of<00:05:30.060> in

goodness<00:06:22.740> there's<00:06:22.950> not<00:06:23.160> much<00:06:23.460> this<00:06:23.730> is<00:06:23.910> the

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
goodness there's not much this is the

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.050 
goodness there's not much this is the
one<00:06:24.240> limiting<00:06:24.780> factor<00:06:25.550> now<00:06:26.550> we<00:06:26.610> all<00:06:26.820> know<00:06:27.000> you

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
one limiting factor now we all know you

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.610 
one limiting factor now we all know you
don't<00:06:27.240> have<00:06:27.390> to<00:06:27.480> have<00:06:27.600> a<00:06:27.630> lot<00:06:27.930> of<00:06:27.960> instability

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
don't have to have a lot of instability

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.200 
don't have to have a lot of instability
but<00:06:28.740> this<00:06:28.890> sure<00:06:29.100> not<00:06:29.250> much<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:29.820> it's<00:06:29.970> a<00:06:30.030> good

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
but this sure not much and it's a good

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.060 
but this sure not much and it's a good
thing<00:06:30.420> because<00:06:30.600> look<00:06:31.020> at<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.230> shear<00:06:31.500> values<00:06:31.920> I

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
thing because look at the shear values I

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.580 
thing because look at the shear values I
mean<00:06:32.100> these<00:06:32.370> are<00:06:32.520> really<00:06:32.970> high<00:06:33.470> from<00:06:34.470> the

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
mean these are really high from the

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.880 
mean these are really high from the
surface<00:06:34.979> to<00:06:35.570> 925<00:06:36.570> millibars<00:06:37.169> suggesting

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
surface to 925 millibars suggesting

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.329 
surface to 925 millibars suggesting
there<00:06:38.790> could<00:06:38.910> be<00:06:38.940> a<00:06:39.030> tornado<00:06:39.270> threat<00:06:39.780> here

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:41.339 
there could be a tornado threat here

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.519 
there could be a tornado threat here
so<00:06:41.759> it's<00:06:42.119> not<00:06:42.300> a<00:06:42.330> classic<00:06:42.899> setup<00:06:43.139> with<00:06:43.379> those

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:43.529 
so it's not a classic setup with those

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.079 
so it's not a classic setup with those
low<00:06:43.740> capes<00:06:44.039> but<00:06:44.309> clearly<00:06:44.759> we're<00:06:44.879> gonna<00:06:44.969> have

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
low capes but clearly we're gonna have

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.299 
low capes but clearly we're gonna have
to<00:06:45.180> monitor<00:06:45.569> Sunday<00:06:46.439> night<00:06:46.619> and<00:06:46.770> early<00:06:46.889> Monday

00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:47.309 
to monitor Sunday night and early Monday

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:49.129 
to monitor Sunday night and early Monday
morning<00:06:47.339> for<00:06:47.789> severe<00:06:48.149> weather<00:06:48.360> potential<00:06:48.779> is

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
morning for severe weather potential is

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.559 
morning for severe weather potential is
now<00:06:49.649> we've<00:06:49.860> got<00:06:50.039> the<00:06:50.219> jura<00:06:50.490> pian<00:06:50.789> and<00:06:50.879> the<00:06:51.029> GFS

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:51.569 
now we've got the jura pian and the GFS

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:53.629 
now we've got the jura pian and the GFS
kind<00:06:51.839> of<00:06:51.899> agreeing<00:06:52.289> that<00:06:52.529> alabama<00:06:52.919> could<00:06:53.460> very

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
kind of agreeing that alabama could very

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.299 
kind of agreeing that alabama could very
well<00:06:53.699> be<00:06:53.939> in<00:06:54.029> the<00:06:54.059> warm<00:06:54.300> sector<00:06:54.599> of<00:06:54.689> that<00:06:54.899> thing

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:55.309 
well be in the warm sector of that thing

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:57.589 
well be in the warm sector of that thing
and<00:06:56.309> that'll<00:06:56.639> be<00:06:56.729> a<00:06:56.759> good<00:06:56.909> rain<00:06:57.149> event<00:06:57.419> by<00:06:57.539> the

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
and that'll be a good rain event by the

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.299 
and that'll be a good rain event by the
way<00:06:57.809> a<00:06:57.839> rain<00:06:58.199> amounts<00:06:58.499> of<00:06:58.589> one<00:06:58.740> to<00:06:58.860> two<00:06:59.009> inches

00:06:59.299 --> 00:06:59.309 
way a rain amounts of one to two inches

way a rain amounts of one to two inches
likely<00:06:59.550> this<00:06:59.969> is<00:07:00.029> Tuesday<00:07:01.039> we're<00:07:02.039> pretty<00:07:02.219> much
