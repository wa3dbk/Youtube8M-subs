little bit more I think Ken's farther
along<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:45.030> he's<00:00:45.239> been<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.720> one<00:00:45.930> more

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
along you know he's been here one more

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.590 
along you know he's been here one more
year<00:00:46.519> he's<00:00:47.519> playing<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:48.030> faster<00:00:48.479> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
year he's playing a little faster and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.719 
year he's playing a little faster and
playing<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.229> he's<00:00:49.830> had<00:00:49.979> more<00:00:50.220> experience

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
playing I just he's had more experience

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.039 
playing I just he's had more experience
in<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> end<00:00:51.180> within<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.540> defense<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.019> the

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
in the end within the defense and the

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:53.689 
in the end within the defense and the
calls<00:00:52.290> and<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.739> type<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:52.979> thing<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.400> think

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
calls and that type of thing I think

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.460 
calls and that type of thing I think
they're<00:00:54.000> both<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.510> good<00:00:54.600> prospects<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
they're both really good prospects I

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.479 
they're both really good prospects I
think<00:00:55.619> they're<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.799> to<00:00:55.860> continue<00:00:56.159> to<00:00:56.400> get

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
think they're going to continue to get

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.759 
think they're going to continue to get
better<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.000> grow<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.989> Ken<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:58.619> is

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
better and grow I think Ken right now is

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.320 
better and grow I think Ken right now is
just<00:00:58.799> a<00:00:58.979> little<00:00:59.159> farther<00:00:59.369> along<00:00:59.610> just<00:01:00.000> from<00:01:00.239> an
