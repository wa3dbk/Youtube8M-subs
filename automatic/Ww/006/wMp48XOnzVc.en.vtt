00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.550
 today our are all are almond spurs 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.650
 and to close this matter I would like you 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.650
 follows a schematic of a cell 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.140
 watch the core 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.100
 if we scroll the compartment where we will find the genetic material of the 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.589
 cell 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.179
 quote page 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.220
 region where we will find 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.969
 organelles several perks are still quote page 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.410
 I feel pleasure in the region that lies between the nucleus located where profit 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.860
 and to the plasma membrane 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.690
 and besides next Tuesday 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.480
 involving 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 the entire region in the cell 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.780
 so let's imagine that the cell is a great 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.530
 the chef factory 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 and to the factory it has several departments 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 and also has the president of the factory 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.820
 three identical and who has the factory command 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.350
 I do not believe 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.770
 and compartments in the factory or not if he talks about the production 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.539
 another $ 100 bill that can also be called looking at them 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.680
 cytoplasmic 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.540
 so the right guy we will find several oleaginous 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.689
 with the functions 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.220
 specific 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.450
 so I have an idea that performs the breath of the cell produced without 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.320
 energy 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.480
 I have is she that 115 substances as for example 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.859
 proteins that are produced 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.289
 and has the rigor nor does she want more old substances as she stayed with warehouse 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.120
 of a factory 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.869
 and they help 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.950
 the development of cellular function 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.179
 the cell 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.490
 she gets organized and way with which it is early 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.160
 the fabric 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.660
 if it takes place it forms an organ 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.530
 and the various bodies 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.590
 of origin 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.290
 to the various systems we have both in animals 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.049
 as in vegetables 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.629
 I would like you to 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.629
 pay attention 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.349
 in this question 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.380
 malware cell membership does not work 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.459
 a resident 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.480
 how the cell participates in the operation of a year 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:32.739
 we give 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.849
 Remind the structure to roll 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.849
 the three fundamental parts of the mountain range 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:44.779
 where we will find the genetic material of the cell responsible for 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.359
 command 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.999
 by the organization of the seal naxos 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.639
 if such clarity 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.899
 region 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.139
 contained in the membrane 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.239
 I understand nuclear 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.679
 the sector up 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.510
 we found the organelles 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.940
 responsible for the different functions that we are going to study 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:08.439
 no Greek and the correct wrap 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.629
 responsible for cell protection ' 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.850
 also responsible for pec 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.159
 it was my selective ability 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.239
 the controlling property 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.099
 the incoming lia from substances in the cell 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.909
 then the three key parts and became the car 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.509
 the sector for the immigrant zone 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.720
 work together 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.290
 in order to facilitate 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.019
 the function of the week 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.439
 now we'll meet the main organ they pitoco londrina 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.189
 for being a photo 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.709
 of mitochondria 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.900
 organelle responsible for 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.099
 cellular respiration 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.539
 all our activities 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.779
 need energy 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.129
 we need in mitochondria 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.870
 it is the mountain lung responsible for the production 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:03.930
 of energy 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.889
 for the work will be narrated 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.159
 bestows on it endoplasmic reticulum we have two types of reticulum 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.980
 endoplasmic or trash 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.479
 I like 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.479
 the critical law to transport and store substances 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.849
 substances that are produced 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.080
 in the small country but how do we like it? 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.320
 the proteins 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.749
 protein synthesis 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:28.970
 and in the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.580
 we have there the production of steel 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.110
 episodes 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.229
 which also 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.919
 are called 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.249
 lipe says 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:40.319
 bauchi complex 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.639
 is another important window into the jungle responsible for storage 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.300
 substances that are produced 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.610
 in the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.580
 then the refinement with the transport 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.520
 all substances that are produced the cytoplasm 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.779
 we do not like 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.389
 these substances as the protein 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.230
 produced in the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.850
 it will be prolonged 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.850
 but if you repair it to be nothing in the complex of gomes 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.490
 proteins that can be 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.289
 It is taught that they will help digestion 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.710
 an important audience produced in the Brazilian endoplasmic reticulum 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.379
 This is it, is not the hormone 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:31.209
 which helps in controlling the rate of sandy glucose then this protein is produced 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:36.429
 an organelle the melon woman from a small baby's cell 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.339
 neither the others and windows 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.330
 and another week the participation 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.889
 of the ten actions 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.360
 bc also in a week 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.470
 doing a meal that we have there 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.860
 The entrance 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.449
 of food particles 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.550
 aquaculture when entering the cell is a solid particle 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.029
 we call feder 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.379
 with a goal of sectors and 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.819
 process where the entry of the solid particle occurs 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.279
 and this particle involved 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.229
 once in a while the mining company 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.029
 known as fargo am new 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:16.689
 one of them while wrapping the part on Holy Thursday 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:19.979
 this particle will be managed 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.110
 then the junk union consortium summed up who teaches responsible for 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.229
 digestion 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.120
 then it was one of the paid as compensation 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.159
 We'll form a bar with the name I've already been 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.949
 and this food now he said still in the interior of silk leather only in itself but 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.819
 sometimes sollus 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.180
 part of this junk food 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.569
 and the case will be eliminated through the class in the sectors and 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.509
 bowel movement 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:54.069
 the play out being that which is no longer necessary sitting
