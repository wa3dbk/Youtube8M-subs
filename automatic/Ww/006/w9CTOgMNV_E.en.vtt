00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:17.240

 I go down no no not around dinner yes yes 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:32.769
 I'm out for dinner, let's take it 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:32.769
 I missed the light mum 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:20.070
 just this fake blood really 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:23.490
 tasty almost almost so much message that 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.700
 board hello you can't understand how much I do 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.310
 be pc what right now is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.409
 I practically tasted this 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.300
 finished blood also to make the gags that between 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:41.280
 the other is really very good here 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:42.450
 it's still just spectacular and I have 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.550
 wanted to make this video because 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 lots of you after my videos of 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.030
 halloween hand asked a little where I have 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.940
 bought the fake blood the plasticine 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.460
 I buy those things there because 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.820
 however, I really like doing i 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.220
 tricks a little halloween ones a little 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.080
 monstrous though for those who may be at 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.500
 first weapons and does not want to spend so many 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.310
 I invented more money than I invented 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.920
 other I found some 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.450
 browsing this recipe on the web for 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.310
 the fake blood that by the way is a 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.190
 fake blood that you can even eat 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.610
 eatable I drank it I'm not dead 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.810
 I'm fine it's pretty much tasty too 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.700
 because it is made with maple syrup and 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.300
 therefore in addition to satisfaction 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.310
 of having created artificial blood 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.650
 also offers the possibility to enjoy e 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.650
 maple syrup in many 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.420
 Recipe costs a little a lot because it costs 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.340
 around 8 9 euros 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.350
 But I mean it lasts a lot 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.239
 you can also use it for cooking 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.120
 while any pretending that 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.850
 used that you buy lacriola type 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.319
 year I do n't know any other city 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.049
 fake blood obviously you can't 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.019
 use it to cook see it why 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.880
 even if maybe this guy would be here 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.190
 edible or in any case it can be put 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.980
 even near the ex of the mouth is not 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.410
 always nice to eat short of things 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.959
 too chemical to prepare it is 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.120
 as simple as I said syrup 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.250
 maple food coloring and then some 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.180
 of patience to mix and find the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.780
 adequate color if you are interested follow 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.790
 the tutorial 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.470
 hello to create our blood 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.720
 artificial need maple syrup 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.739
 food dyes in particular the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.340
 blue and red a cup or small bowl 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.489
 where to prepare our blood and a 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.600
 spoon spatula to mix 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.859
 if we wish we can also use a 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.480
 latex gloves because these 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.239
 food colors really mess 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.340
 so my fingers so I'm going to pour 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:53.290
 in the cup a little syrup I add 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.290
 a few drops of red dye 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:18.500
 I'm going to mix and still a little clear 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:20.480
 so I'm going to add it again seen 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.390
 what blood we have created and a lot 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.430
 clear and little halloween jano i go 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.530
 add some blue though with blue 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.720
 you have to be very careful because if not 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.020
 becomes purple from personal experience 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:41.750
 I tell you and then I go and put it 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:49.460
 with a cotton swab it's already too much 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:52.930
 probably if you see it too dark 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.930
 go add some more red 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.870
 this is how I would say we are 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.890
 however a test on the hand to see 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.550
 I would say the color is pretty good and 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.390
 happy halloween to all bye 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.830
 before closing i also wanted 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.530
 tell you how it is possible to build 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.330
 very realistic wounds a lot 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.010
 beautiful without using plasticine 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.760
 therefore at no cost we will have some 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.169
 wounds 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.900
 equally realistic as well 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.710
 beautiful you just need a tissue and 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.390
 of the false eyelash glue that or 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.220
 of vinavil but I recommend more than 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.020
 other the false eyelash glue because 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.810
 it doesn't hurt however it does nothing to 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.430
 of play pose and now I'm going to do 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.400
 see how it's done because they are there 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.570
 lots of videos showing it 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.720
 however also here another strategy 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.760
 to not 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.640
 go and spend some money, in other words 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.530
 however, the plate lasts long though 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.120
 if used once a year I don't know 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.830
 how worth it is how I have you 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.230
 said I love doing these things then 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:59.430
 you can see my plasticine I don't say 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.410
 that in half but we're almost there 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.260
 he still lacks the halloween trick 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:08.120
 and nothing I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.120
 this video in the next hello
