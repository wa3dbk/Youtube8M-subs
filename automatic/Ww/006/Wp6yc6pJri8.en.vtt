I consider this a dupe because the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.319 
I consider this a dupe because the
formula<00:03:23.130> it's<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.459> lot<00:03:23.639> of<00:03:23.670> like<00:03:23.940> the

consistency of them are very similar

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.190 
consistency of them are very similar
except<00:03:27.239> for<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.480> fact<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.930> one's<00:03:28.109> just

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200
