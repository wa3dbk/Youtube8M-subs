like<00:01:51.290> each<00:01:51.320> other

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
like each other

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.100 
like each other
it's<00:01:52.130> unbelievable<00:01:52.790> chemistry<00:01:53.330> it's<00:01:53.960> out<00:01:54.080> of

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
it's unbelievable chemistry it's out of

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.810 
it's unbelievable chemistry it's out of
this<00:01:54.260> world<00:01:54.320> we've<00:01:55.130> been<00:01:55.280> growing<00:01:55.460> up<00:01:55.670> since

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
this world we've been growing up since

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.450 
this world we've been growing up since
eight<00:01:56.330> years<00:01:56.630> open<00:01:56.780> on<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.080> same<00:01:57.229> team<00:01:57.560> we

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
eight years open on the same team we

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.219 
eight years open on the same team we
hand<00:01:58.640> out<00:01:58.760> each<00:01:58.880> other<00:01:59.090> off<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.360> field<00:01:59.600> so

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
hand out each other off the field so

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.620 
hand out each other off the field so
basically<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.280> comes<00:02:01.460> all<00:02:01.670> together<00:02:04.479> but<00:02:05.479> it

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
basically it comes all together but it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.690 
basically it comes all together but it
isn't<00:02:05.990> all<00:02:06.200> fun<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.619> games<00:02:06.800> for<00:02:07.250> Brentwood

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
isn't all fun and games for Brentwood

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.550 
isn't all fun and games for Brentwood
while<00:02:08.300> they<00:02:08.450> have<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.720> lot<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.020> talent

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
while they have a lot of talent

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.160 
while they have a lot of talent
returning<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.550> Indians<00:02:10.970> must<00:02:11.300> replace<00:02:11.690> four

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
returning the Indians must replace four

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.650 
returning the Indians must replace four
starters<00:02:12.770> including<00:02:13.160> their<00:02:13.850> goalie<00:02:14.090> from

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
starters including their goalie from

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.300 
starters including their goalie from
last<00:02:14.959> year's<00:02:15.260> title<00:02:15.560> winning<00:02:16.040> team<00:02:18.310> great

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
last year's title winning team great

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.820 
last year's title winning team great
players<00:02:19.580> but<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:20.360> think<00:02:21.050> they<00:02:21.170> can<00:02:21.230> take<00:02:21.470> their

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
players but I think they can take their

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.410 
players but I think they can take their
spots<00:02:22.160> if<00:02:22.400> they<00:02:22.670> work<00:02:22.820> really<00:02:23.030> really<00:02:23.150> hard

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
spots if they work really really hard

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.750 
spots if they work really really hard
the<00:02:24.290> four<00:02:24.530> kids<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.070> graduated<00:02:25.640> with

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
the four kids that we graduated with

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.479 
the four kids that we graduated with
quality<00:02:26.150> kids<00:02:28.870> two<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:29.959> their<00:02:30.170> captains<00:02:30.620> you

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
quality kids two of their captains you

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.890 
quality kids two of their captains you
take<00:02:31.700> quality<00:02:32.060> players<00:02:32.269> out<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.600> your<00:02:32.690> team

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
take quality players out of your team

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.970 
take quality players out of your team
you're<00:02:33.170> trying<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.470> find<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.769> same

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
you're trying to find that same

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.710 
you're trying to find that same
chemistry<00:02:34.370> from<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.150> year<00:02:35.239> before<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.600> may

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
chemistry from the year before you may

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.750 
chemistry from the year before you may
not<00:02:35.870> get<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.050> chemistry<00:02:36.530> we<00:02:36.950> not<00:02:37.100> may<00:02:37.430> not<00:02:37.610> be

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
not get that chemistry we not may not be

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.580 
not get that chemistry we not may not be
the<00:02:37.850> same<00:02:38.060> team<00:02:38.269> we<00:02:38.750> have<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.019> ability<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.440> be

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
the same team we have the ability to be

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.560 
the same team we have the ability to be
the<00:02:39.739> same<00:02:39.920> team<00:02:40.130> or<00:02:40.280> even<00:02:40.370> better<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:41.420> you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
the same team or even better but you

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.670 
the same team or even better but you
know<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.720> don't<00:02:41.900> know<00:02:42.080> until<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.380> actually

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
know you don't know until you actually

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.310 
know you don't know until you actually
play<00:02:42.800> an<00:02:42.860> opponent
