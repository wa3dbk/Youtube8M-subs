dinosaurs<00:00:03.700> get<00:00:03.790> their<00:00:03.970> names<00:00:04.150> because

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.390 
dinosaurs get their names because

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.929 
dinosaurs get their names because
paleontologists<00:00:05.260> given<00:00:05.560> their<00:00:05.710> names<00:00:05.920> so<00:00:06.399> we

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
paleontologists given their names so we

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.200 
paleontologists given their names so we
name<00:00:07.420> dinosaurs<00:00:07.899> all<00:00:08.140> the<00:00:08.320> time<00:00:08.559> and<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:10.120> know

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210 
name dinosaurs all the time and you know

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.400 
name dinosaurs all the time and you know
there's<00:00:10.450> just<00:00:10.660> different<00:00:10.780> conventions

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
there's just different conventions

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.020 
there's just different conventions
people<00:00:11.710> have<00:00:11.800> different<00:00:12.070> styles<00:00:12.310> some<00:00:12.910> of

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
people have different styles some of

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.120 
people have different styles some of
these<00:00:13.120> complex<00:00:13.690> dinosaur<00:00:14.410> names<00:00:14.710> we<00:00:14.950> know

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.130 
these complex dinosaur names we know

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.820 
these complex dinosaur names we know
just<00:00:15.430> roll<00:00:16.090> off<00:00:16.539> the<00:00:16.570> tongue<00:00:16.990> of<00:00:17.260> little<00:00:17.529> kids

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
just roll off the tongue of little kids

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.579 
just roll off the tongue of little kids
but<00:00:18.250> how<00:00:18.849> did<00:00:19.089> they<00:00:19.240> get<00:00:19.449> those<00:00:19.749> names<00:00:20.109> there's

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:20.589 
but how did they get those names there's

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.439 
but how did they get those names there's
a<00:00:20.679> nomenclature<00:00:21.160> and<00:00:21.759> there's<00:00:21.970> there<00:00:22.419> are

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
a nomenclature and there's there are

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.689 
a nomenclature and there's there are
rules<00:00:22.749> to<00:00:22.900> that<00:00:23.050> nomenclature<00:00:23.499> that<00:00:24.249> require

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
rules to that nomenclature that require

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.720 
rules to that nomenclature that require
every<00:00:25.480> dinosaur<00:00:26.169> in<00:00:26.439> fact<00:00:26.739> every<00:00:27.189> organism

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
every dinosaur in fact every organism

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.659 
every dinosaur in fact every organism
name<00:00:28.239> to<00:00:28.810> have<00:00:28.989> two<00:00:29.349> separate<00:00:29.919> names<00:00:30.220> the

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
name to have two separate names the

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.540 
name to have two separate names the
first<00:00:30.939> is<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.929> genus<00:00:32.380> name<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:33.040> it's<00:00:33.310> always

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
first is the genus name and it's always

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.020 
first is the genus name and it's always
capitalized<00:00:34.480> like<00:00:34.930> Tyrannosaurus<00:00:35.670> Rex<00:00:36.670> is

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
capitalized like Tyrannosaurus Rex is

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.120 
capitalized like Tyrannosaurus Rex is
the<00:00:37.480> species<00:00:37.960> name<00:00:38.200> that<00:00:38.440> follows<00:00:38.830> in<00:00:39.010> other

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
the species name that follows in other

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.780 
the species name that follows in other
words<00:00:39.400> there's<00:00:39.880> a<00:00:39.970> particular<00:00:40.500> species<00:00:41.500> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
words there's a particular species of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.970 
words there's a particular species of
Tyrannosaurus<00:00:42.790> called<00:00:43.660> Tyrannosaurus<00:00:44.500> Rex

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
Tyrannosaurus called Tyrannosaurus Rex

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.420 
Tyrannosaurus called Tyrannosaurus Rex
now<00:00:45.610> these<00:00:45.820> names<00:00:46.180> kind<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.810> came<00:00:47.140> from<00:00:47.500> Latin

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
now these names kind of came from Latin

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.080 
now these names kind of came from Latin
or<00:00:48.760> Greek<00:00:48.790> words<00:00:50.250> Tyrannosaurus<00:00:51.250> means

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
or Greek words Tyrannosaurus means

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.050 
or Greek words Tyrannosaurus means
terrible<00:00:52.930> lizard<00:00:53.110> and<00:00:53.860> they<00:00:54.580> can<00:00:54.820> either

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
terrible lizard and they can either

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.590 
terrible lizard and they can either
describe<00:00:55.590> some<00:00:56.590> anatomical<00:00:57.600> characteristic

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
describe some anatomical characteristic

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.350 
describe some anatomical characteristic
of<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.930> dinosaur<00:00:59.590> like<00:01:00.220> Triceratops<00:01:00.490> it's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
of the dinosaur like Triceratops it's

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.790 
of the dinosaur like Triceratops it's
named<00:01:01.570> after<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.840> three<00:01:01.960> horns<00:01:02.380> on<00:01:02.500> top<00:01:02.530> of

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
named after the three horns on top of

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.450 
named after the three horns on top of
its<00:01:02.950> head<00:01:03.010> or<00:01:03.280> they<00:01:04.030> can<00:01:04.210> be<00:01:04.540> names<00:01:05.439> that<00:01:05.890> on<00:01:06.070> or

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
its head or they can be names that on or

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.330 
its head or they can be names that on or
someone<00:01:07.090> may<00:01:07.659> be<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:08.080> person<00:01:08.560> who<00:01:08.740> collected

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
someone may be the person who collected

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.620 
someone may be the person who collected
a<00:01:09.460> lot<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:09.790> dinosaurs

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
a lot of dinosaurs

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.380 
a lot of dinosaurs
sometimes<00:01:11.760> dinosaurs<00:01:12.760> are<00:01:12.850> named<00:01:13.150> after

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
sometimes dinosaurs are named after

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.570 
sometimes dinosaurs are named after
where<00:01:13.990> they're<00:01:14.110> found<00:01:14.380> like<00:01:14.650> edmontosaurus

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
where they're found like edmontosaurus

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.490 
where they're found like edmontosaurus
is<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.850> good<00:01:16.240> example<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:16.780> mean<00:01:16.930> it's<00:01:17.050> from<00:01:17.170> near

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
is a good example I mean it's from near

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.410 
is a good example I mean it's from near
Edmonton<00:01:17.950> in<00:01:18.070> Canada<00:01:18.550> traditionally<00:01:19.270> in<00:01:19.390> the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
Edmonton in Canada traditionally in the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.300 
Edmonton in Canada traditionally in the
old<00:01:19.600> days<00:01:19.780> almost<00:01:20.200> every<00:01:20.409> dynastar<00:01:20.890> added<00:01:21.190> in

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
old days almost every dynastar added in

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.870 
old days almost every dynastar added in
soros<00:01:21.850> so<00:01:22.270> we<00:01:22.420> have<00:01:22.600> you<00:01:22.810> know<00:01:22.870> edmontosaurus

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
soros so we have you know edmontosaurus

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.670 
soros so we have you know edmontosaurus
tyrannosaurus<00:01:24.880> albertasaurus<00:01:25.630> that's<00:01:26.409> sort

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
tyrannosaurus albertasaurus that's sort

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.050 
tyrannosaurus albertasaurus that's sort
of<00:01:26.710> changed<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.100> little<00:01:27.190> bit<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.400> mean<00:01:27.520> one<00:01:27.970> of

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
of changed a little bit I mean one of

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.790 
of changed a little bit I mean one of
the<00:01:28.150> things<00:01:28.750> we<00:01:28.960> regularly<00:01:29.229> do<00:01:29.380> now<00:01:29.560> is<00:01:29.740> that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
the things we regularly do now is that

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.500 
the things we regularly do now is that
we<00:01:29.860> name<00:01:30.100> dinosaurs<00:01:30.850> are<00:01:30.940> found<00:01:31.120> in<00:01:31.240> China

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
we name dinosaurs are found in China

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.100 
we name dinosaurs are found in China
have<00:01:31.870> that<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:33.400> suffix<00:01:33.790> long<00:01:34.120> L<00:01:34.540> o<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:34.870> G

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
have that the the suffix long L o and G

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.219 
have that the the suffix long L o and G
so<00:01:35.409> like<00:01:35.880> guanlong<00:01:36.940> Kong<00:01:37.270> long<00:01:37.479> because<00:01:37.960> long

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
so like guanlong Kong long because long

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.590 
so like guanlong Kong long because long
means<00:01:38.530> dragon<00:01:39.130> in<00:01:39.370> Mandarin<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.030> this<00:01:40.420> is

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
means dragon in Mandarin and this is

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.110 
means dragon in Mandarin and this is
kind<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.080> how<00:01:41.260> these<00:01:41.530> dinosaurs<00:01:42.370> get<00:01:42.850> their

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
kind of how these dinosaurs get their

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.710 
kind of how these dinosaurs get their
names<00:01:43.510> they're<00:01:43.960> not<00:01:44.170> simply<00:01:45.390> meaningless<00:01:46.390> but

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
names they're not simply meaningless but

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.870 
names they're not simply meaningless but
they're<00:01:46.930> either<00:01:47.080> describing<00:01:47.860> some<00:01:48.100> aspect<00:01:48.729> of

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
they're either describing some aspect of

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.289 
they're either describing some aspect of
the<00:01:49.030> animal<00:01:49.600> where<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.049> was<00:01:50.200> found<00:01:50.590> or<00:01:51.299> someone

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
the animal where it was found or someone

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.480 
the animal where it was found or someone
that<00:01:52.330> was<00:01:52.600> important<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.320> its<00:01:53.530> discovery<00:01:54.190> and

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
that was important in its discovery and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.109 
that was important in its discovery and
we<00:01:55.000> have<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.270> lot<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.659> these<00:01:55.960> examples<00:01:56.860> in<00:01:57.159> the

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
we have a lot of these examples in the

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.100 
we have a lot of these examples in the
dinosaur<00:01:58.720> halls<00:01:59.049> here<00:01:59.409> at<00:01:59.500> AMNH
