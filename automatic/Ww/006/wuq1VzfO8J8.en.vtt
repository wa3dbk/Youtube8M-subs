00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.680
 and friends of youtube how about 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.180
 days 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.240
 frank from the jungle made a video 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.310
 addressed to christian gÃ¡lvez who at 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.090
 be presenting the program fence 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.619
 paula de telecinco 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.100
 and the truth is that I impact quite 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.940
 pretty impact 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.940
 why 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.600
 he was absolutely right what he said and what 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.670
 showed in his video the description of 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.280
 video I'll put the link the frank video 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.950
 jungle in the video that he gave 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.750
 all the data and it showed showing things 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.220
 that I did not know the truth because of course 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.370
 in fence fauna that I have not seen 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.970
 that program of 35 well it seems to be 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.040
 I saw the beginning and a pig that 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.100
 it came out doing some very cool things the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.370
 true 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.500
 that of course is a pet and in 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.000
 certain way then man a pig equal 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.920
 so giving him some food and so on 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.440
 well as a dog for example because 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.930
 You can teach to do certain things 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.810
 to a bird likewise bird me 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.680
 I had a bird that gave nothing of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.370
 caresses I was doing things 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.620
 but but of course a bear 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.720
 playing the trumpet 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.150
 no longer just playing the trumpet 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.830
 not just playing the trumpet pa pa pa pa 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:40.060
 I do not know anymore, he's not just fishing in the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:44.200
 river that is in the mountain from there to pass 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.140
 to play the trumpet or catch a hula hoop 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.620
 and start doing a hula hop 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.560
 hoola hoop 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.440
 as if they were the child, of course, as 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.830
 said Frank said as the jungle one 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.950
 bear you put the trumpet in his mouth 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.799
 they put the trumpet in their mouths 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.780
 and they hit him with an open hand or with a 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.840
 stick they put him in the back plan 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.110
 then clear the bear when giving the blow 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.930
 so they put the trumpet in 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.739
 lips are true and pop nose and it sounds not 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.650
 it sounds clear then when it sounds 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.260
 they give a little bit of food and the animal 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.620
 well you know when it rings when 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.500
 lehman is but they're poking him 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.769
 like other animals for example 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.410
 the chimps very used in 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.810
 movies and other 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.110
 well in the frank video of the jungle 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.440
 you can see they have fangs 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.560
 super big and if you look closely it is 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.800
 they are absolutely right when 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.730
 they smile 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.370
 when chimpanzees smile on TV 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.300
 that we have seen them many times is like 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.950
 our flat teeth according to him 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.770
 when they do like that the chimpanzee 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.230
 it's just scary it's not because it 's this 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.840
 laughing party is because he is shitty 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.530
 fear or be afraid panics 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.500
 and that gives you to think you have to think that 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.470
 is that for us to see 10 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.569
 minutes to a chimp do the grace to 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.989
 a bear playing the tambourine the trumpet 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.060
 that has to be of an animal all its 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.400
 life stuck in a cage and getting 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.190
 beatings having caught him from his mother is 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.920
 super teeny 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.660
 in which is quite sad with what 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.490
 which I honestly am not going to support that 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.490
 project that is 35 I'm not going to see it 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.909
 and the piglet and little more 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.350
 but it is true that as it says 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.620
 frank does not want to fight does not want 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.330
 to fight he wants to inform me I know 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.860
 that we for example is a channel 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.860
 super small but 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.340
 I see myself and every time I see more than 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.080
 people are very uninformed with everything 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.860
 the internet and everything we had 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.200
 people are super uninformed and things 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:26.400
 basic and very mundane things and very 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.870
 normal, people miss me 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.320
 happens but maybe because of the pace of life 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.140
 that we carry 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.200
 with which although we only 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.870
 we have 49 writers right now and we 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.990
 they listen and they see us almost considering us 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.470
 house and little else 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.000
 with only one person seeing what 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.480
 from the flower of the jungle and give me and 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.910
 Think again and think twice 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.310
 to put that telecinco program or 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.370
 to go to a circus in the circus is what 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.440
 same then and now it will be worth it 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.780
 this video with which I feel 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.950
 satisfied when 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.320
 if you give online 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.180
 you put a comment on the video that 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.550
 I hope you put some comment on 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.340
 the video and we discussed it 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.890
 because a valid penalty and a lot because 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.980
 those animals that is going to favor them 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.260
 no more no less 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.180
 so nothing that I'm going to invite you to 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.950
 everyone that you see he does not have 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.849
 waste is a little long are 15 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.189
 minutes 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.929
 or 18 minutes or something like that but it's not 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:37.320
 the frank's video is wasted 

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:39.510
 the jungle with more reason than a saint 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.780
 He says that he also stresses 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:46.830
 animals but of course they are minutes and it teaches 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:50.350
 the teaches is not manipulating a 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:54.030
 animal or the season of the year let's say 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:56.620
 for anyone's fun is for 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.570
 teach us and bring us what we 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.330
 like we could not do in life and the 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.120
 jungle have a snake or such 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.000
 so that 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:11.120
 I hope you see the video reflections a 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.520
 little on the subject and nothing to respect us 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.980
 both us and the animals that 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.050
 they also have feelings like that is that 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.230
 Greetings to all and see you in the 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.230
 following
