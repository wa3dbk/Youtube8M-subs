dance<00:02:01.030> because<00:02:01.300> I<00:02:01.420> guess<00:02:01.630> they<00:02:01.750> deem<00:02:02.080> that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
swords dance is to bring it from gym

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.500 
swords dance is to bring it from gym

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
three because you can teach or ninjask

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.960 
three because you can teach or ninjask
when<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.020> involves<00:02:23.500> at<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> certain<00:02:23.860> level<00:02:24.340> gets

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
when it involves at a certain level gets

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
swords dance as a level up move and as

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.370 
swords dance as a level up move and as
you<00:02:27.580> level<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.970> up<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.330> teacher<00:02:28.720> swords<00:02:29.200> dance

you level it up and teacher swords dance
I<00:02:29.590> believe<00:02:29.890> that's<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.190> way<00:02:30.340> she<00:02:30.550> did<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.850> get

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
I believe that's the way she did you get

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.820 
I believe that's the way she did you get
sources<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:31.900> that's<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.200> only<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.470> legally

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
sources so that's the only one legally

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.890 
sources so that's the only one legally
to<00:02:32.980> hexen<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.430> jumeirah<00:02:33.700> soy<00:02:33.910> stands<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.480> then

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
to hexen in jumeirah soy stands and then

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.420 
to hexen in jumeirah soy stands and then
you<00:02:35.019> transfer<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.440> over<00:02:35.560> because<00:02:35.920> they<00:02:36.040> deem

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
you transfer that over because they deem

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.759 
you transfer that over because they deem
that<00:02:36.459> is<00:02:36.880> legal<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.480> then<00:02:37.930> as<00:02:38.260> long<00:02:38.320> as<00:02:38.650> it's

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
that is legal and then as long as it's

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.380 
that is legal and then as long as it's
from<00:02:38.890> jin<00:02:39.130> three<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:39.519> loud<00:02:39.820> so<00:02:40.060> that's<00:02:40.239> all

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
from jin three it's loud so that's all

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.020 
from jin three it's loud so that's all
that<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.720> now<00:02:40.930> back<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.410> battle<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:42.489> lost<00:02:42.910> my

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
shedinja obviously because I have the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.110 
shedinja obviously because I have the
stupid<00:02:44.920> home<00:02:45.040> cause<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.459> I'm<00:02:45.489> gonna<00:02:45.640> go<00:02:45.820> for

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
shadow sneak instead of phantom force

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.100 
shadow sneak instead of phantom force
really<00:02:48.489> i<00:02:48.580> didn't<00:02:48.880> know<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.420> had<00:02:49.450> phantom

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
really i didn't know it had phantom

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.320 
really i didn't know it had phantom
force<00:02:50.350> before<00:02:50.560> i<00:02:50.769> made<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.370> now<00:02:51.940> i'm<00:02:52.090> gonna<00:02:52.239> go

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
force before i made it now i'm gonna go

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.060 
force before i made it now i'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.690> reteach<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.350> fan<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.560> force<00:02:53.860> because

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
ahead and reteach a fan of force because

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.100 
ahead and reteach a fan of force because
i<00:02:54.100> think<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.459> better<00:02:54.579> move<00:02:54.820> until<00:02:55.180> poke<00:02:55.930> that

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
i think is a better move until poke that

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110 
i think is a better move until poke that
comes<00:02:56.350> out<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.769> I'm<00:02:57.430> gonna<00:02:57.549> go<00:02:57.700> for<00:02:57.910> rocks

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
obviously so I can set up a hazard at
