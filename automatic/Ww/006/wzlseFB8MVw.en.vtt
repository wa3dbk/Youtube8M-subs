00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.030 
apart from the thermical stuff so let's
just<00:03:00.870> put<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.260> aside<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:03.150> will<00:03:03.269> be<00:03:03.569> back

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
just put this aside and I will be back

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.289 
just put this aside and I will be back
with<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.340> colors<00:03:05.549> removed<00:03:06.120> okay<00:03:08.060> okay<00:03:09.060> guys

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
with the colors removed okay okay guys

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.050 
with the colors removed okay okay guys
we<00:03:09.720> have<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.959> woofer<00:03:10.500> over<00:03:11.040> here<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.489> one<00:03:11.970> of

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
we have a woofer over here and one of

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.020 
we have a woofer over here and one of
the<00:03:12.150> satellites<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:14.160> we<00:03:14.489> can<00:03:14.640> see<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the satellites so we can see the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.539 
the satellites so we can see the
controls<00:03:15.510> on<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.900> buffer<00:03:16.350> itself<00:03:16.680> volume

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
controls on the buffer itself volume

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.650 
controls on the buffer itself volume
treble<00:03:18.180> bass<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.590> power<00:03:19.890> indicator<00:03:20.660> is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
treble bass and the power indicator is

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.580 
treble bass and the power indicator is
whether<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:23.030> speakers<00:03:24.030> are<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:24.329> or<00:03:24.600> not<00:03:24.780> so

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
whether the speakers are on or not so

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.620 
whether the speakers are on or not so
we'll<00:03:25.799> come<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.100> know<00:03:26.160> about<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.150> on/off

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
we'll come to know about that the on/off

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.770 
we'll come to know about that the on/off
switch<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.709> system<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.250> behind<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
switch of the system is behind the

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.819 
switch of the system is behind the
subwoofer<00:03:31.350> over<00:03:31.829> here<00:03:32.070> as<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.200> see<00:03:34.530> it

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
subwoofer over here as you can see it

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:35.840 
subwoofer over here as you can see it
it's<00:03:35.160> over<00:03:35.340> here

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
it's over here

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.509 
it's over here
so<00:03:36.079> on/off<00:03:37.079> switch<00:03:37.410> over<00:03:37.620> here<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.069> power

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
so on/off switch over here the power

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.009 
so on/off switch over here the power
cable<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:40.109> is<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.380> power<00:03:40.590> table<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:42.810> just

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
cable this is the power table we just

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.280 
cable this is the power table we just
take<00:03:43.380> off<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:44.390> okay<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.109> power

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
take off that okay so this is the power

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.069 
take off that okay so this is the power
cable<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.600> we<00:03:48.600> have<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.920> all<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.730> four

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
cable and we have the all the four

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.530 
cable and we have the all the four
satellites<00:03:52.079> hooked<00:03:52.920> up<00:03:53.100> here<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:54.299> any

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
satellites hooked up here and the any

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.490 
satellites hooked up here and the any
other<00:03:54.840> mp3<00:03:55.790> CDs<00:03:56.790> or<00:03:57.209> other<00:03:57.690> devices<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.470> be

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
other mp3 CDs or other devices to be

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.160 
other mp3 CDs or other devices to be
connected<00:03:58.620> over<00:03:59.190> here<00:03:59.510> so<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.019> very

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
connected over here so this is a very

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.990 
connected over here so this is a very
nice<00:04:01.380> system<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:03.799> this<00:04:04.799> are<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.549> other<00:04:05.730> three

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
nice system and this are the other three

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.690 
nice system and this are the other three
satellites<00:04:06.870> over<00:04:07.260> here<00:04:07.470> similar<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
satellites over here similar to the the

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.770 
satellites over here similar to the the
one<00:04:08.880> which<00:04:09.630> is<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.260> subwoofer

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
one which is on the subwoofer

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.009 
one which is on the subwoofer
as<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.110> can<00:04:13.230> see<00:04:13.440> let's<00:04:14.430> check<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.330> sound<00:04:15.660> and

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
as you can see let's check the sound and

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.080 
as you can see let's check the sound and
I<00:04:16.230> will<00:04:16.440> be<00:04:16.620> back<00:04:17.070> with<00:04:17.340> another<00:04:17.400> review<00:04:17.700> of

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
I will be back with another review of

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.680 
I will be back with another review of
the<00:04:18.389> speaker's<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:20.180> sound<00:04:21.180> quality<00:04:21.660> of

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
the speaker's of the sound quality of

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.409 
the speaker's of the sound quality of
this<00:04:21.900> pairing<00:04:22.350> with<00:04:22.650> movies<00:04:23.460> games<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.150> songs

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
this pairing with movies games and songs

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.050 
this pairing with movies games and songs
