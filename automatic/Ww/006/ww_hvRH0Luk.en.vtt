naming<00:00:01.050> compounds<00:00:01.709> now<00:00:02.220> naming<00:00:02.610> compounds

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
naming compounds now naming compounds

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.510 
naming compounds now naming compounds
from<00:00:03.210> their<00:00:03.389> chemical<00:00:03.780> symbols<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.520> similar

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
from their chemical symbols is similar

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.099 
from their chemical symbols is similar
to<00:00:05.879> what<00:00:06.089> you've<00:00:06.299> already<00:00:06.480> done

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
to what you've already done

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.960 
to what you've already done
okay<00:00:07.350> now<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.710> only<00:00:07.919> thing<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:08.460> just<00:00:08.700> the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
okay now the only thing is it's just the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.089 
okay now the only thing is it's just the
opposite<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.570> were<00:00:09.660> looking<00:00:09.990> at<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.679> five

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
opposite we were looking at the five

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.740 
opposite we were looking at the five
step<00:00:11.429> crossover<00:00:12.030> rule<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.360> we're<00:00:12.509> kind<00:00:12.690> of

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
step crossover rule so we're kind of

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.169 
step crossover rule so we're kind of
kind<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.440> rearrange<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.730> five<00:00:14.940> step

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
kind of rearrange the five step

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.150 
kind of rearrange the five step
crossover<00:00:15.690> rule<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:15.960> work<00:00:16.109> backwards<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
crossover rule and work backwards to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.310 
crossover rule and work backwards to
write<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> formulas<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.660> now<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.170> lot

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
write the formulas and now it's a lot

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.429 
write the formulas and now it's a lot
simpler<00:00:20.390> there's<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.480> simpler<00:00:21.869> way<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.289> this

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
simpler there's a simpler way to do this

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.640 
simpler there's a simpler way to do this
but<00:00:22.710> we're<00:00:23.100> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> use<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.180> reverse<00:00:24.650> order

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
but we're going to use the reverse order

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.080 
but we're going to use the reverse order
our<00:00:26.269> the<00:00:27.269> steps<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> reverse<00:00:28.680> order

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
our the steps for in the reverse order

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.089 
our the steps for in the reverse order
just<00:00:30.090> because<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.689> will<00:00:31.109> come<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.590> handy<00:00:31.769> when

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
just because it will come in handy when

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.360 
just because it will come in handy when
dealing<00:00:32.130> with<00:00:32.570> transitional<00:00:33.570> metals<00:00:34.370> so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
dealing with transitional metals so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.410 
dealing with transitional metals so
let's<00:00:35.520> look<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.790> C<00:00:36.090> a3<00:00:36.739> Picchu<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.399> first<00:00:39.149> thing

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
let's look at C a3 Picchu so first thing

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
let's look at C a3 Picchu so first thing
we<00:00:39.600> want<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:39.989> identify<00:00:40.430> metal<00:00:41.430> nonmetal

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
we want to do identify metal nonmetal

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.619 
we want to do identify metal nonmetal
before<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.600> even<00:00:42.750> start<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.030> we

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
before we even start so we and we

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.209 
before we even start so we and we
noticed<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.050> calcium<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> metal

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
noticed that calcium is a metal

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.600 
noticed that calcium is a metal
phosphide<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> nonmetal<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.370> go

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
phosphide is a nonmetal so we can go

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150 
phosphide is a nonmetal so we can go
about<00:00:50.730> separating<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> two<00:00:51.780> elements<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.410> CA

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
about separating the two elements so CA

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.099 
about separating the two elements so CA
3<00:00:53.579> P<00:00:54.420> 2<00:00:55.190> now<00:00:56.190> we're<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> add<00:00:56.699> once<00:00:57.149> with

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
3 P 2 now we're going to add once with

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.900 
3 P 2 now we're going to add once with
the<00:00:58.230> elements<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.859> no<00:00:59.280> number<00:00:59.640> or<00:00:59.850> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the elements that have no number or that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.630 
the elements that have no number or that
has<00:01:00.510> no<00:01:00.809> number<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.010> both<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> them<00:01:02.520> have

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
has no number and but both of them have

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.039 
has no number and but both of them have
a<00:01:02.670> number<00:01:02.969> already<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.390> there's<00:01:03.539> no<00:01:03.690> need<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
a number already so there's no need to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.950 
a number already so there's no need to
put<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> 1<00:01:04.500> okay<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.299> now<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> cross

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
put a 1 okay we are now going to cross

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.330 
put a 1 okay we are now going to cross
over<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.409> now<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.830> time<00:01:08.010> we're<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
over but now this time we're going to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.770 
over but now this time we're going to
cross<00:01:08.520> over<00:01:08.760> from<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> bottom<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> top

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
cross over from the bottom to the top

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
cross over from the bottom to the top
okay<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:14.159> next<00:01:14.369> step<00:01:14.460> we're<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> add

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
okay the next step we're going to add

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.820 
okay the next step we're going to add
charges<00:01:15.479> remember<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> first<00:01:16.530> one

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
charges remember that the first one

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.130 
charges remember that the first one
which<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.700> metal<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.090> positive<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
which is the metal is positive the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.929 
which is the metal is positive the
second<00:01:19.590> one<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> nonmetal<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.520> that's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
second one is a nonmetal and that's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.170 
second one is a nonmetal and that's
negative<00:01:22.430> okay<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> make<00:01:24.000> sure

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
negative okay we're going to make sure

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.880 
negative okay we're going to make sure
that<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.509> charges<00:01:24.930> match<00:01:25.170> those<00:01:25.470> found<00:01:25.740> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that the charges match those found in

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
that the charges match those found in
the<00:01:25.950> periodic<00:01:26.400> table<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.720> not

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the periodic table if they do not

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
the periodic table if they do not
multiply<00:01:28.860> both<00:01:29.460> charges<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.150> same

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
multiply both charges with the same

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.980 
multiply both charges with the same
number<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.140> find<00:01:31.409> their<00:01:31.770> true<00:01:31.799> charge<00:01:32.990> okay

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
number to find their true charge okay

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.469 
number to find their true charge okay
and<00:01:34.170> yes<00:01:34.619> both<00:01:34.920> calcium<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.700> phosphate<00:01:36.150> have

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and yes both calcium and phosphate have

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.069 
and yes both calcium and phosphate have
the<00:01:36.720> correct<00:01:37.049> charge<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.909> then<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
the correct charge on them so then the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.140 
the correct charge on them so then the
last<00:01:40.320> step<00:01:40.560> says<00:01:40.890> write<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.369> name<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> metal

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
last step says write the name the metal

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480 
last step says write the name the metal
stays<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.630> same<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> nonmetal<00:01:43.799> changes

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
stays the same but the nonmetal changes

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.460 
stays the same but the nonmetal changes
its<00:01:44.670> ending<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.360> d<00:01:46.110> e<00:01:47.119> calcium<00:01:48.119> phosphide<00:01:48.930> so

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
its ending to I d e calcium phosphide so

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230 
its ending to I d e calcium phosphide so
we<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.619> calcium<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> phosphorus<00:01:50.909> but

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
we have calcium and phosphorus but

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.620 
we have calcium and phosphorus but
phosphorus<00:01:52.049> becomes<00:01:52.439> phosphide<00:01:53.479> okay<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
phosphorus becomes phosphide okay the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.219 
phosphorus becomes phosphide okay the
nonmetal<00:01:55.820> loses<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.240> ending<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.750> becomes<00:01:58.020> AI

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
nonmetal loses the ending and becomes AI

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.609 
nonmetal loses the ending and becomes AI

that<00:02:04.649> aluminum<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> metal<00:02:06.890> BR<00:02:08.030> okay<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
that aluminum is a metal BR okay is a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.160 
that aluminum is a metal BR okay is a
nonmetal<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.700> separate<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.730> two<00:02:12.000> elements<00:02:12.450> al

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
nonmetal so separate the two elements al

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.860 
nonmetal so separate the two elements al
B

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
B

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.020 
B
our<00:02:13.930> three<00:02:14.290> next<00:02:15.250> step<00:02:15.400> we're<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:15.940> add

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
our three next step we're going to add

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.350 
our three next step we're going to add
ones<00:02:16.510> with<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.900> element<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.290> has<00:02:17.500> no<00:02:17.769> number

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
ones with the element that has no number

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.820 
ones with the element that has no number
aluminum<00:02:19.360> here<00:02:19.659> has<00:02:19.900> no<00:02:20.170> number<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.709> we're

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
aluminum here has no number so we're

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.130 
aluminum here has no number so we're
going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> put<00:02:21.190> our<00:02:21.280> one<00:02:21.459> right<00:02:21.670> there<00:02:22.140> okay

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
going to put our one right there okay

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.740 
going to put our one right there okay
next<00:02:23.590> thing<00:02:23.890> we're<00:02:24.280> going<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.640> cross<00:02:25.330> over<00:02:25.510> but

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
next thing we're going to cross over but

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.369 
next thing we're going to cross over but
this<00:02:25.930> time<00:02:26.110> from<00:02:26.290> bottom<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.099> top<00:02:28.019> okay

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
this time from bottom to the top okay

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.190 
this time from bottom to the top okay
and<00:02:30.030> next<00:02:31.030> step<00:02:31.209> we're<00:02:31.510> going<00:02:31.599> to<00:02:31.659> add<00:02:31.720> charges

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
and next step we're going to add charges

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.680 
and next step we're going to add charges
remember<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.799> first<00:02:33.010> one<00:02:33.250> becomes<00:02:33.909> positive

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
remember the first one becomes positive

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.539 
remember the first one becomes positive
because<00:02:34.959> it's<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.319> metal<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:36.220> second

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
because it's the metal and the second

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.490 
because it's the metal and the second
one<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.849> nonmetal<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.290> negative

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
one is the nonmetal and it's a negative

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.550 
one is the nonmetal and it's a negative
charge<00:02:39.720> now<00:02:40.720> we're<00:02:40.930> going<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.079> make<00:02:41.230> sure<00:02:41.409> that

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
charge now we're going to make sure that

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.990 
charge now we're going to make sure that
the<00:02:41.680> charges<00:02:42.069> match<00:02:42.250> those<00:02:42.549> found<00:02:42.819> in<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
the charges match those found in the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.690 
the charges match those found in the
periodic<00:02:43.450> table<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:43.989> yes<00:02:44.980> they<00:02:45.250> do

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
periodic table and yes they do

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.420 
periodic table and yes they do
so<00:02:45.849> there's<00:02:46.030> no<00:02:46.269> need<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.510> multiplying<00:02:47.290> as<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
so there's no need to multiplying as the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.789 
so there's no need to multiplying as the
following<00:02:48.849> step<00:02:49.090> says<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:50.019> next<00:02:50.260> step<00:02:50.440> we're

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
following step says the next step we're

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:51.930 
following step says the next step we're
going<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.950> write<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.310> name<00:02:51.430> remember<00:02:51.849> the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
going to write the name remember the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.610 
going to write the name remember the
metal<00:02:52.209> stays<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.540> same<00:02:52.569> but<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:52.989> nonmetal

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
metal stays the same but the nonmetal

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.069 
metal stays the same but the nonmetal
changes<00:02:54.340> its<00:02:54.489> ending<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.970> IDE<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.810> we<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:55.989> an

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
changes its ending to IDE so we have an

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.440 
changes its ending to IDE so we have an
aluminum<00:02:56.349> we<00:02:56.859> add<00:02:56.980> bromine<00:02:57.430> put<00:02:58.359> them

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
aluminum we add bromine put them

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.890 
aluminum we add bromine put them
together<00:02:58.629> it<00:02:58.989> becomes<00:02:59.379> aluminum<00:03:00.310> bromide

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
together it becomes aluminum bromide

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.729 
together it becomes aluminum bromide
okay<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.349> last<00:03:02.680> step<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.569> little<00:03:04.569> tricky<00:03:04.989> engi

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
okay this last step a little tricky engi

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.710 
okay this last step a little tricky engi
oh<00:03:06.569> okay

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
oh okay

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.780 
oh okay
we<00:03:07.989> know<00:03:08.170> mg<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.400> magnesium<00:03:09.849> to<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.480> metal<00:03:10.750> Oh

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
we know mg is magnesium to the metal Oh

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.699 
we know mg is magnesium to the metal Oh
nonmetal<00:03:12.840> oxygen<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.440> we're<00:03:14.530> going<00:03:14.620> to

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
nonmetal oxygen so we're going to

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.130 
nonmetal oxygen so we're going to
separate<00:03:15.129> the<00:03:15.519> two<00:03:15.700> elements<00:03:16.120> mg<00:03:16.629> you<00:03:16.959> know

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
separate the two elements mg you know

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.800 
separate the two elements mg you know
they<00:03:17.440> separate<00:03:17.889> now<00:03:18.519> next<00:03:19.180> step<00:03:19.269> says<00:03:19.630> add

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
they separate now next step says add

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.960 
they separate now next step says add
ones<00:03:20.500> with<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:20.950> element<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.280> has<00:03:21.489> no<00:03:21.669> number

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
ones with the element that has no number

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.360 
ones with the element that has no number
neither<00:03:22.419> element<00:03:22.930> has<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.079> number<00:03:23.470> okay

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
neither element has a number okay

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.400 
neither element has a number okay
remember<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:25.359> one<00:03:25.599> of<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.049> final

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
remember in one of the in the final

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.379 
remember in one of the in the final
steps<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.799> says<00:03:27.010> remove<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.700> one<00:03:27.910> so<00:03:28.209> we've

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
steps it says remove the one so we've

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.039 
steps it says remove the one so we've
removed<00:03:28.599> ones<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:30.190> get<00:03:30.340> mg<00:03:31.180> oh<00:03:31.209> now<00:03:31.930> we're

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
removed ones to get mg oh now we're

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.659 
removed ones to get mg oh now we're
going<00:03:32.139> to<00:03:32.200> add<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.709> ones<00:03:32.919> to<00:03:33.099> do<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.310> reverse

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
going to add the ones to do the reverse

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.670 
going to add the ones to do the reverse
of<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.329> five<00:03:34.540> step<00:03:34.780> crossover<00:03:35.349> rule

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
of the five step crossover rule

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.309 
of the five step crossover rule
okay<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:36.370> we're<00:03:36.489> going<00:03:36.579> to<00:03:36.639> add<00:03:36.790> ones<00:03:37.319> next

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
okay so we're going to add ones next

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.159 
okay so we're going to add ones next
step<00:03:38.669> we're<00:03:39.669> going<00:03:39.760> again<00:03:40.569> from<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.019> bottom

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
step we're going again from the bottom

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.210 
step we're going again from the bottom
to<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.650> top<00:03:43.560> okay<00:03:44.560> we're<00:03:44.799> going<00:03:44.919> to<00:03:44.980> add

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
to the top okay we're going to add

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.030 
to the top okay we're going to add
charges<00:03:46.209> remember<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.019> first<00:03:47.199> one<00:03:47.410> metal

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
charges remember the first one metal

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.170 
charges remember the first one metal
it's<00:03:48.489> positive

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
it's positive

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.319 
it's positive
second<00:03:49.599> one<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:49.930> negative<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:51.060> we're<00:03:52.060> going

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
second one is negative and we're going

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.759 
second one is negative and we're going
to<00:03:52.480> make<00:03:52.690> sure<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.139> charges<00:03:53.530> match

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
to make sure that the charges match

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.949 
to make sure that the charges match
those<00:03:54.160> now<00:03:55.079> here's<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.500> thing<00:03:56.709> okay

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
those now here's the thing okay

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.020 
those now here's the thing okay
oxygen<00:03:58.959> should<00:03:59.709> be<00:03:59.889> negative<00:04:00.400> two<00:04:01.379> okay<00:04:02.379> so

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
oxygen should be negative two okay so

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.050 
oxygen should be negative two okay so
because<00:04:04.030> oxygen<00:04:04.329> should<00:04:05.049> be<00:04:05.199> negative<00:04:05.500> two

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
because oxygen should be negative two

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.660 
because oxygen should be negative two
and<00:04:06.180> even<00:04:07.080> magnesium<00:04:07.770> is<00:04:08.190> supposed<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.550> be

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
and even magnesium is supposed to be

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.150 
and even magnesium is supposed to be
positive<00:04:08.940> too<00:04:09.420> but<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.989> thing<00:04:10.230> is<00:04:10.260> before<00:04:11.040> you

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
positive too but the thing is before you

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160 
positive too but the thing is before you
do<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.730> most<00:04:11.970> important<00:04:12.660> part<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:12.989> you

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
do the most important part that you

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.629 
do the most important part that you
should<00:04:13.380> always<00:04:13.620> be<00:04:13.920> looking<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:15.720> the

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
should always be looking for is that the

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.610 
should always be looking for is that the
nonmetal<00:04:17.639> matches<00:04:18.600> in<00:04:18.810> charge

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
nonmetal matches in charge

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.370 
nonmetal matches in charge
okay<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.639> nonmetal<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.510> most<00:04:21.780> important

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
okay the nonmetal is the most important

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.580 
okay the nonmetal is the most important
one<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.950> match<00:04:23.160> in<00:04:23.400> charge<00:04:23.720> okay<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.260> we're

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
one to match in charge okay so we're

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.629 
one to match in charge okay so we're
going<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.740> multiply<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.690> negative<00:04:27.690> 1<00:04:27.810> by<00:04:28.020> 2

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
going to multiply that negative 1 by 2

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.490 
going to multiply that negative 1 by 2
but<00:04:29.639> what<00:04:29.880> we<00:04:29.970> do<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.240> 1<00:04:30.450> we<00:04:30.900> must<00:04:31.110> do<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.290> the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
but what we do to 1 we must do to the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.520 
but what we do to 1 we must do to the
other<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.520> charge<00:04:32.760> is<00:04:32.820> now<00:04:33.060> change<00:04:33.419> so<00:04:34.050> mg

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
other so the charge is now change so mg

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.070 
other so the charge is now change so mg
is<00:04:34.620> plus<00:04:34.889> 2<00:04:35.100> o<00:04:35.310> is<00:04:35.790> negative<00:04:36.180> 2<00:04:36.330> are<00:04:36.540> they<00:04:36.810> both

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
is plus 2 o is negative 2 are they both

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.900 
is plus 2 o is negative 2 are they both
do<00:04:37.620> they<00:04:37.770> both<00:04:37.950> have<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.340> same<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.700> charge

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
do they both have the same the charge

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.490 
do they both have the same the charge
that<00:04:39.090> they're<00:04:39.210> supposed<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.479> have<00:04:39.570> yes<00:04:40.290> they

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
that they're supposed to have yes they

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.629 
that they're supposed to have yes they
do<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.060> thus<00:04:43.130> last<00:04:44.130> step

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
do and thus last step

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.310 
do and thus last step
write<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.240> name<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.600> metal<00:04:45.750> stays<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.290> same

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
write the name the metal stays the same

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.040 
write the name the metal stays the same
but<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.070> nonmetal<00:04:47.700> changes<00:04:48.090> its<00:04:48.270> ending<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.810> I

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
but the nonmetal changes its ending to I

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.340 
but the nonmetal changes its ending to I
de<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:50.460> we<00:04:51.000> have<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.120> magnesium<00:04:51.840> we<00:04:52.139> have<00:04:52.260> an

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
de so we have a magnesium we have an

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.879 
de so we have a magnesium we have an
oxygen<00:04:52.560> but<00:04:53.280> put<00:04:53.490> them<00:04:53.580> together<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:54.270> becomes

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
oxygen but put them together it becomes

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.150 
oxygen but put them together it becomes
magnesium<00:04:55.889> oxide<00:04:57.080> so<00:04:58.080> here<00:04:58.650> are<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.800> couple<00:04:58.830> of

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
magnesium oxide so here are a couple of

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.780 
magnesium oxide so here are a couple of
practice<00:04:59.700> questions<00:04:59.990> take<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.020> minute<00:05:01.380> pause

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
practice questions take a minute pause

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.840 
practice questions take a minute pause
