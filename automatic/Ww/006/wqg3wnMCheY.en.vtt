00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
and what we're going to see is this is a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.180 
and what we're going to see is this is a
first<00:00:12.049> tablet<00:00:13.049> we've<00:00:13.230> got<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.710> use<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.889> runs

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
first tablet we've got to use the runs

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.880 
first tablet we've got to use the runs
Windows<00:00:14.519> RT<00:00:14.719> as<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.780> Snapdragon<00:00:16.379> processor<00:00:16.770> we

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
Windows RT as a Snapdragon processor we

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.859 
Windows RT as a Snapdragon processor we
want<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.130> see<00:00:17.250> how<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.730> affects<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.390> boot

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
want to see how that affects the boot

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.870 
want to see how that affects the boot
time<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.770> first<00:00:20.430> we're<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.730> try

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
time so first we're going to try

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.100 
time so first we're going to try
restarting<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> see<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.470> happens

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
restarting it and see what happens

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.800 
restarting it and see what happens
hopefully<00:00:24.890> this<00:00:25.010> will<00:00:25.100> require<00:00:25.280> a<00:00:25.490> login<00:00:25.820> and

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
hopefully this will require a login and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.580 
hopefully this will require a login and
will<00:00:26.990> actually<00:00:27.110> be<00:00:27.440> able<00:00:27.590> to<00:00:27.920> see<00:00:29.260> we<00:00:30.260> start

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
will actually be able to see we start

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.770 
will actually be able to see we start
anyway<00:00:30.950> dude

wait<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.630> to<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.710> long<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.190> takes<00:00:44.460> on

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
wait here to see how long this takes on

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.080 
wait here to see how long this takes on
Windows<00:00:45.960> 8<00:00:46.170> desktop<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:47.040> laptop<00:00:47.309> running

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
Windows 8 desktop or laptop running

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.020 
Windows 8 desktop or laptop running
Intel<00:00:48.989> processor<00:00:49.590> well<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> doesn't<00:00:50.760> freeze

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
Intel processor well it doesn't freeze

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.890 
Intel processor well it doesn't freeze
like<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> normally

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.080 

that<00:00:55.200> looks<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.650> little<00:00:56.040> pink

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.790 

but

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.289 

c-can<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:03.829> hold<00:01:04.010> down<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.309> probe<00:01:04.640> no<00:01:04.820> wait<00:01:05.059> it

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
c-can you hold down the probe no wait it

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.120 
c-can you hold down the probe no wait it
did<00:01:05.510> restart<00:01:05.869> that<00:01:06.020> just<00:01:06.440> didn't<00:01:07.010> really

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
did restart that just didn't really

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.000 
did restart that just didn't really
freeze<00:01:07.549> it<00:01:07.760> just<00:01:07.909> animation<00:01:08.450> froze<00:01:08.740> all<00:01:09.740> right

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
freeze it just animation froze all right

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.280 
freeze it just animation froze all right
so<00:01:10.479> can<00:01:11.479> actually<00:01:11.780> see<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:11.990> board

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
so can actually see the board

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.140 
so can actually see the board
information<00:01:12.979> now<00:01:13.549> we're<00:01:13.700> actually<00:01:13.880> on<00:01:14.090> the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
information now we're actually on the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.670 
information now we're actually on the
rebooting<00:01:14.659> part<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.140> we're<00:01:15.259> going<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.470> count

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
rebooting part so we're going to count

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.039 
rebooting part so we're going to count
them<00:01:15.890> here<00:01:16.250> as<00:01:16.820> if<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.270> were<00:01:17.390> turning<00:01:17.690> on<00:01:17.869> your

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
them here as if you were turning on your

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.700 
them here as if you were turning on your
computer<00:01:18.530> from<00:01:19.430> cold<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:20.180> see<00:01:21.050> how<00:01:21.320> long<00:01:21.560> it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
computer from cold to see how long it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.000 
computer from cold to see how long it
takes<00:01:21.740> text<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.460> get<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:22.880> into<00:01:23.500> windows

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.700 

they'll<00:01:30.730> get<00:01:30.910> right<00:01:31.660> it's<00:01:31.990> going<00:01:32.350> it's<00:01:32.650> going

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
they'll get right it's going it's going

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.490 
they'll get right it's going it's going
but<00:01:33.700> it's<00:01:33.820> not<00:01:33.910> fast<00:01:34.210> houston<00:01:34.900> we<00:01:34.930> don't<00:01:35.290> have

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
but it's not fast houston we don't have

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.149 
but it's not fast houston we don't have
a<00:01:35.530> problem

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
a problem

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.420 
a problem
going<00:01:37.520> but<00:01:37.729> it's<00:01:37.880> not<00:01:38.060> fast<00:01:38.350> so

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.210 

still<00:01:42.120> waiting<00:01:42.510> this<00:01:42.690> video<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> really

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
still waiting this video is really

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.880 
still waiting this video is really
exciting<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.730> you<00:01:44.910> all<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.180> watch<00:01:45.330> I'm<00:01:45.570> sure

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
exciting for you all to watch I'm sure

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.830 
exciting for you all to watch I'm sure
but<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.490> living<00:01:47.850> proof<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.300> happens

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
but it's living proof of what happens

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.860 
but it's living proof of what happens
when<00:01:49.410> you<00:01:49.500> try<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.770> review<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:50.790> system<00:01:51.300> how

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
when you try to review this system how

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.190 
when you try to review this system how
long<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.260> takes<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:53.250> course<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:54.090> this

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
long it takes of course with this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
long it takes of course with this
operating<00:01:55.200> system<00:01:55.650> you<00:01:56.340> probably<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:56.970> only

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
operating system you probably not only

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.870 
operating system you probably not only
need<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.720> do<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:57.930> hard<00:01:58.290> reboot<00:01:58.470> I<00:01:59.250> mean<00:01:59.790> that's

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
need to do a hard reboot I mean that's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.280 
need to do a hard reboot I mean that's
really<00:02:00.090> true<00:02:00.390> you're<00:02:00.570> not<00:02:00.720> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> it's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
really true you're not going to it's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.410 
really true you're not going to it's
sort<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:01.740> Android<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.850> never<00:02:03.060> reboot

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
sort of like Android you never reboot

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.310 
sort of like Android you never reboot
Android<00:02:03.869> either<00:02:04.130> well<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.850> guess<00:02:06.660> I<00:02:06.900> guess<00:02:07.140> we

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
Android either well I guess I guess we

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.350 
Android either well I guess I guess we
won't<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:07.950> we'll<00:02:08.130> never<00:02:08.280> know<00:02:08.490> how<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
won't like this we'll never know how to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.820 
won't like this we'll never know how to
get<00:02:09.570> in<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.140> once<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.039> before<00:02:11.490> no<00:02:11.750> well

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
get in but once you before no well

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.440 
get in but once you before no well
whatever<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.820> would<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.030> would<00:02:15.270> have

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
whatever it is it would it would have

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.180 
whatever it is it would it would have
started<00:02:15.720> immediately<00:02:15.989> pretty<00:02:16.500> much<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.980> pond

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
started immediately pretty much on pond

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.940 
started immediately pretty much on pond
login<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:18.060> wait<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.290> looks<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.650> we<00:02:19.770> may<00:02:19.920> be

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950
