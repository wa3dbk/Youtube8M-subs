00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
 on Sunday Mrs. de la Vega those who said there was a plan b 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.640
 that the government had a plan b in case the plan to adjust the accounts 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.500
 public 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.680
 It was not enough at the same time in the little town, the salgado lady tried to 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.259
 convince the cpi international monetary fund not to 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.799
 Beijing had a plan b 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.220
 that the adjustment plan will be enough and even said 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.720
 what they would think a plan b was to confess and I quote textually the insecurity in the 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.819
 actual project 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.649
 I asked him if he would do like Havana 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.869
 trust the Spaniards in a government in which the economy minister says to the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.070
 spokesman of the government joseph Augustine 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.810
 But the thing is not there that same Sunday, which said that 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.350
 the agreement with the Basque nationalist party was closed and immediately afterwards 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.530
 to leave the erkoreka Mr. who is sitting to deny it 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.310
 and already put all said that the majority feel the socialist party 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.680
 is that Mr. cobbler was an asset but I'm going to put together the list of 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.660
 denials 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.360
 all this you said 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.160
 psoe in the same interview in the interview in which he boasted about ee 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.640
 authority 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.920
 and with the humility that both dorna said 'god yourself I'm in the center 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.170
 I am in everything 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.170
 We bathe Mrs. de la Vega by parties 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.040
 and see if it is possible to tell us with the lady left in front clearly if 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
 there is a plan b for the Spanish economy 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.920
 your plan only 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.460
 kieny a Shia group does not allow five each one in interest 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 on the shoulder as an example for citizens 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.260
 but despite the three best so say in this camera that costs them 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
 he pointed out that the point would suit us all 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.600
 nor plan b 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.420
 We already know that their plans are affected by others because this government is 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.840
 unable to approve a serious coherent plan to get Spain out of the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.380
 crisis a plan that consists does not want to make spending measures to create employment 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.710
 and reforms to restore competitiveness to the Spanish economy 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.299
 that is the alternative to the popular party but you are unable to lead 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.039
 no noble project because the government and the socialist party 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.979
 in something else 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.980
 in approving your own salvage plan a salvage plan which consists 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.990
 in saving furniture starting with the only ones that like armchairs 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.989
 thank you 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:30.259
 one
