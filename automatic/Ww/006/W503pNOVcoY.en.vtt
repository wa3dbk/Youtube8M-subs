with<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:47.320> resilience<00:00:47.829> and<00:00:47.949> the

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
with the resilience and the

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
determination of what I've come to know

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.840 
determination of what I've come to know
over<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.829> last<00:00:50.859> two<00:00:51.159> and<00:00:51.219> a<00:00:51.280> half<00:00:51.399> three<00:00:51.579> years

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
over the last two and a half three years

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.419 
over the last two and a half three years
since<00:00:51.999> would<00:00:52.239> be<00:00:52.329> Nia<00:00:52.539> so<00:00:53.260> it's<00:00:53.920> a<00:00:54.010> big<00:00:54.129> step<00:00:54.309> in

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
since would be Nia so it's a big step in

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.399 
since would be Nia so it's a big step in
the<00:00:54.489> right<00:00:54.640> direction<00:00:54.670> but<00:00:55.179> still<00:00:56.079> better<00:00:56.170> do

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
the right direction but still better do

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.979 
the right direction but still better do
