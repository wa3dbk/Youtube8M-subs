00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
are sixty percent or higher that we

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.550 
are sixty percent or higher that we
could<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.729> meet<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.210> hear<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.840> Oliver

Oliver Queen now to answer the question
a<00:02:17.880> lot<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.209> thinking<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.660> think<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
a lot of you thinking I think the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.630 
a lot of you thinking I think the
chances<00:02:19.410> are<00:02:19.530> zero<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.580> be

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
chances are zero that it's going to be

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.339

the<00:02:20.730> Oliver<00:02:21.060> Queen<00:02:21.300> from<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.780> TV<00:02:22.050> series

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
the Oliver Queen from the TV series

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.080 
the Oliver Queen from the TV series
Green<00:02:23.160> Arrow<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.520> don't<00:02:23.760> think<00:02:23.880> they're<00:02:24.000> going

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
Green Arrow I don't think they're going

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.160 
Green Arrow I don't think they're going
to<00:02:24.180> use<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.450> green<00:02:24.660> arrow<00:02:24.840> at<00:02:24.989> all<00:02:25.080> i<00:02:25.110> think

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
to use that green arrow at all i think

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.010 
to use that green arrow at all i think
there<00:02:25.440> i<00:02:25.739> think<00:02:26.160> despite<00:02:26.670> what<00:02:27.030> people<00:02:27.060> are

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
there i think despite what people are

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.900 
there i think despite what people are
suggesting<00:02:28.200> i<00:02:28.800> think<00:02:29.489> they're<00:02:29.610> going<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.790> keep

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
suggesting i think they're going to keep

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.259 
suggesting i think they're going to keep
those<00:02:30.090> universes<00:02:30.720> separate<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.230> really<00:02:31.739> do<00:02:32.269> but

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
those universes separate I really do but

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.089 
those universes separate I really do but
that<00:02:33.420> being<00:02:33.630> said<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:34.380> does<00:02:34.440> kind<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.950> make

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
that being said it does kind of make

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.370 
that being said it does kind of make
sense<00:02:35.160> cleaning<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.450> fixing<00:02:36.840> metropolis

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
sense cleaning up and fixing metropolis

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.229 
sense cleaning up and fixing metropolis
is<00:02:37.500> going<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.709> take<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> huge<00:02:38.280> effort<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
is going to take a huge effort and to

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.699 
is going to take a huge effort and to
bring<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.569> another<00:02:39.840> billionaire<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.560> an

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
bring in another billionaire like an

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.470 
bring in another billionaire like an
Oliver<00:02:40.950> Queen<00:02:41.160> seems<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.849> make<00:02:41.970> sense<00:02:42.030> I'm<00:02:42.360> not

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
Oliver Queen seems to make sense I'm not

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.550 
Oliver Queen seems to make sense I'm not
sold<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.760> think<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:46.140> kind

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
sold on it but I do think that it kind

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.050 
sold on it but I do think that it kind
of<00:02:46.650> makes<00:02:46.830> sense<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.459> would<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.790> name

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
of makes sense that that would be a name

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.520 
of makes sense that that would be a name
that<00:02:48.090> released<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.660> thrown<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.110> there<00:02:49.290> maybe

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that released be thrown in there maybe

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.720 
that released be thrown in there maybe
it's<00:02:49.680> somebody<00:02:49.799> would<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.100> introduced<00:02:50.549> in

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
it's somebody would just introduced in

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.850 
it's somebody would just introduced in
one<00:02:50.940> scene<00:02:51.269> but<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.110> agree<00:02:52.410> with<00:02:52.440> both<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.769> I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
one scene but I agree with both you I

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.750 
one scene but I agree with both you I
don't<00:02:53.069> think<00:02:53.100> we're<00:02:53.280> going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.459> see<00:02:53.489> green

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
don't think we're going to see green

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.300 
don't think we're going to see green
arrow<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.750> movie<00:02:55.200> at<00:02:55.290> all<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:55.920> maybe

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
arrow in this movie at all but maybe

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.949 
arrow in this movie at all but maybe
just<00:02:56.489> Oliver<00:02:56.790> Queen<00:02:56.970> if<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.600> liked<00:02:57.810> this
