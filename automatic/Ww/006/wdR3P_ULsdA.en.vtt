two<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.680> containers<00:01:29.159> right<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.579> those

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
two little containers right here those

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.140 
two little containers right here those
flip<00:01:30.630> open<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.259> inside<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.759> actually

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
flip open and inside of this we actually

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.440 
flip open and inside of this we actually
have<00:01:33.390> our<00:01:33.799> power<00:01:34.799> cable<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:36.299> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have our power cable right here this is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
have our power cable right here this is
going<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:36.990> screen<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.799> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
going to be for the screen so this is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.620 
going to be for the screen so this is
just<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> power<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.820> screens<00:01:39.180> right<00:01:39.390> there

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
just the power the screens right there

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990 
just the power the screens right there
so<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> set<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.350> off<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.710> side<00:01:40.950> plus<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so I set it off the side plus that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
so I set it off the side plus that
plastic<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> ground<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:43.710> we

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
plastic on the ground and then we

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.530 
plastic on the ground and then we
actually<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.490> USB<00:01:44.850> cable<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.509> there

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
actually have the USB cable right there

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.990 
actually have the USB cable right there
as<00:01:45.899> well<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.229> an<00:01:46.350> audio<00:01:46.680> input<00:01:46.890> cable<00:01:47.399> right

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
as well as an audio input cable right

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120 
as well as an audio input cable right
there<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.570> kind<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.320> different<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
there which is kind of different you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.410 
there which is kind of different you
usually<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.430> see<00:01:50.640> audio<00:01:50.970> inputs<00:01:51.299> on

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
usually don't see audio inputs on

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.569 
usually don't see audio inputs on
keyboards<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.470> uh<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:53.310> that's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
keyboards but uh that's that's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.020 
keyboards but uh that's that's
interesting<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.210> guess<00:01:54.680> okay<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.799> let's<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
interesting I guess okay so let's go and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.520 
interesting I guess okay so let's go and
take<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> key<00:01:57.390> works<00:01:57.600> out<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> box<00:01:57.960> itself

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
take the key works out of the box itself

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.469 
take the key works out of the box itself
and<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.759> looks<00:01:59.880> like<00:01:59.909> we're<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> get<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.450> more

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and it looks like we're to get one more

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.840 
and it looks like we're to get one more
thing<00:02:00.630> underneath<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:02.280> spotted<00:02:02.549> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
thing underneath here I just spotted it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.300 
thing underneath here I just spotted it
and<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> wrist<00:02:04.740> guard<00:02:05.040> to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and it's going to be a wrist guard to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.990 
and it's going to be a wrist guard to
that<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.759> know

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
is pretty nice on the back we actually

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.220 
is pretty nice on the back we actually
do<00:03:35.459> have<00:03:35.610> some<00:03:36.000> flip<00:03:36.420> out<00:03:36.570> little<00:03:36.840> mouse<00:03:36.989> right

do have some flip out little mouse right

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.440 
do have some flip out little mouse right
there<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.620> your<00:03:37.829> keyboard<00:03:38.280> will<00:03:38.760> be<00:03:39.420> a

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
there so that your keyboard will be a

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.630 
there so that your keyboard will be a
little<00:03:39.750> bit<00:03:40.200> angled<00:03:40.769> when<00:03:40.980> you're<00:03:41.100> typing<00:03:41.280> so

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
little bit angled when you're typing so

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.590 
little bit angled when you're typing so
it's<00:03:41.730> going<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:41.880> be<00:03:41.970> sitting<00:03:42.360> like<00:03:42.570> this

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
it's going to be sitting like this

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.069 
it's going to be sitting like this
instead<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.260> totally<00:03:43.650> flat<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.280> then<00:03:44.940> also<00:03:45.360> on

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
instead of totally flat and then also on

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.440 
instead of totally flat and then also on
the<00:03:46.560> back<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:47.579> looks<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:47.940> we<00:03:48.180> have<00:03:48.239> nothing

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
the back it looks like we have nothing

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.750 
the back it looks like we have nothing
else<00:03:48.750> on<00:03:48.870> there<00:03:49.100> except<00:03:50.100> for<00:03:50.130> on<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.519> side<00:03:50.730> we

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
else on there except for on this side we

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.569 
else on there except for on this side we
do<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.209> some<00:03:51.390> USB<00:03:51.720> ports<00:03:52.260> right<00:03:53.220> there<00:03:53.430> so

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
do have some USB ports right there so

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.720 
do have some USB ports right there so
you<00:03:53.670> don't<00:03:53.850> lose<00:03:54.030> any<00:03:54.209> slots<00:03:54.570> on<00:03:54.750> your<00:03:55.049> actual

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
you don't lose any slots on your actual

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.220 
you don't lose any slots on your actual
computer<00:03:56.730> when<00:03:57.269> plugging<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.720> keyword<00:03:58.049> up

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
computer when plugging this keyword up

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.190 
computer when plugging this keyword up
so<00:03:58.380> that's<00:03:58.530> really<00:03:58.650> really<00:03:58.890> nice<00:03:59.750> but<00:04:00.750> other

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
so that's really really nice but other

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.229 
so that's really really nice but other
than<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.519> really<00:04:02.519> all<00:04:02.820> we<00:04:02.940> have<00:04:03.090> on<00:04:03.180> this

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
than that really all we have on this

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.850 
than that really all we have on this
keyboard<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.720> going<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:03.959> be<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.200> screen<00:04:04.590> which

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
keyboard is going to be the screen which

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.280 
keyboard is going to be the screen which
you<00:04:05.310> can<00:04:05.459> actually<00:04:05.870> angle<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.930> different

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
you can actually angle it different

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.100 
you can actually angle it different
things<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:07.650> rotates<00:04:08.040> on<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.220> little<00:04:08.549> um
