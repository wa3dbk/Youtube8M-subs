00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
was actually blown up from that size

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.360 
was actually blown up from that size
magazine<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.400> two<00:02:20.610> parts<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:22.170> um<00:02:22.470> tell<00:02:23.190> us<00:02:23.280> a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
magazine in two parts and um tell us a

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.710 
magazine in two parts and um tell us a
lot<00:02:23.489> about<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.940> one<00:02:24.180> here<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:26.090> that's<00:02:27.090> when

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
lot about this one here then that's when

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.839 
lot about this one here then that's when
the<00:02:27.930> spectrum<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.769> relief<00:02:29.010> could<00:02:29.580> cope

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
the spectrum of that relief could cope

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.300 
the spectrum of that relief could cope
with<00:02:30.060> color<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:32.900> we<00:02:33.900> had<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.709> black<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.160> white

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
