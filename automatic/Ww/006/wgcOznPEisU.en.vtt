gold<00:00:10.950> income<00:00:11.340> increase<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.820> supports<00:00:12.210> we

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
gold income increase for supports we

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.940 
gold income increase for supports we
started<00:00:12.660> seeing<00:00:12.840> less<00:00:13.139> culprit<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.710> quince

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
started seeing less culprit and quince

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.189 
started seeing less culprit and quince
and<00:00:14.130> more<00:00:14.549> flight<00:00:14.849> HP<00:00:15.269> ones<00:00:15.480> each<00:00:15.750> one<00:00:16.020> gives

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
and more flight HP ones each one gives

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.529 
and more flight HP ones each one gives
you<00:00:16.320> 26<00:00:16.830> HP<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.550> that's<00:00:17.730> pretty<00:00:18.000> much<00:00:18.180> sums<00:00:18.449> up

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
you 26 HP so that's pretty much sums up

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.859 
you 26 HP so that's pretty much sums up
to<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> total<00:00:18.930> amount<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.560> 78<00:00:20.460> HP<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.480> rooms

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
alone meaning before a patch 4.3 you

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.460 
alone meaning before a patch 4.3 you
could<00:00:24.390> start<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.920> 178<00:00:25.920> HP<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.730> 10<00:00:27.300> HP<00:00:27.630> region

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
could start with 178 HP and 10 HP region

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.030 
could start with 178 HP and 10 HP region
so<00:00:29.039> why<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.789> shield<00:00:30.119> nerve<00:00:30.869> worthy<00:00:31.500> for
