didn't even make it to the show and I

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.440

think was a blessing for you because

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.210 
think was a blessing for you because
I've<00:02:12.660> never<00:02:12.840> seen<00:02:12.989> somebody<00:02:13.440> grow<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:14.010> you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and I think that I would be the most

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.420 
and I think that I would be the most
