the team as a whole for example just

because all of your midfielders are
great<00:02:20.400> at<00:02:20.550> dribbling<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.150> fast<00:02:21.600> doesn't<00:02:22.350> mean

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
great at dribbling and fast doesn't mean

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.830 
great at dribbling and fast doesn't mean
asking<00:02:23.280> an<00:02:23.400> oddity<00:02:23.880> forward<00:02:24.240> runs<00:02:24.450> as<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.630> good
