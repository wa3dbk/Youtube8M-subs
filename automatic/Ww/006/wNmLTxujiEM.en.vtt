00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.680
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.720
 found with a new nail art including 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.670
 I posted a picture on instagram it 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.860
 y at some time you have been 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.540
 many to ask me for a tutorial for this 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.980
 mail art that's why I come 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.279
 today show you how the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.710
 realize I combined for this reason the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.919
 nail art caviar as well as a mail art 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.560
 gradient I find the rendering very feminine 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.130
 or see even pretty sexy let's start 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.529
 this mail art 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.599
 good and good as usual we start 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.760
 always apply a base on its 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.859
 nails then applied on the set 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.190
 of your nails the color of your choice 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.600
 except on the annular indeed to 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.949
 nice and your ring finger of the same 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.190
 color that the ebit that you go 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.329
 use for the caviar varnish 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.890
 immediately after polishing your 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.679
 nail goes it's on this one 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.100
 the balls since the varnish of the 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.239
 watermelons 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.469
 the ebit will stick to your nail polish 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.019
 of course, tap your nail for 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.640
 smooth out all the marbles and make 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.129
 so that there are the least hits 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.690
 possible between this one and especially 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.369
 do not forget to put a container 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.159
 under your nail like that you can 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.570
 recover the excess logs 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.479
 you may not be able to arrive 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.400
 to fill your nail the first time 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.380
 do not panic just simply 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.450
 add polish where the beads 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.820
 did not join the first time and 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.490
 return the ebit on the nail 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.200
 again pat and make sure 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.540
 that tickets adhere well to your 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.780
 nail here at least for what 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.220
 regards the manicure caviar for the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.070
 rest of the nail art it is enough simply 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.600
 to make a gradient 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.820
 for that I put a little bit of 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.100
 black varnish on my applicator brush 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.500
 of makeup and then I started to 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 tap from the end of my 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.540
 fingernail and going up towards the middle 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.680
 to intensify the degrade I 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.990
 simply add a little varnish to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.960
 the end of my nail and done in 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.259
 kind of blur the line between and well 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.030
 the varnish and degrade it finally to 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.369
 have a gradient a little softer 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 I added my basic color on my 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.030
 applicator brush and I have everything 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.959
 simply degraded from the base of my 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.700
 nail to the middle in reality we 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.430
 just try to blur the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.650
 demarcation between my plum color and the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.220
 black color 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.049
 that's what you get at this step 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.610
 finally finished by applying your top 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.310
 coat on all of your nails 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.079
 except the ring finger besides adding 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.780
 a beautiful shine and protect your 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.390
 nail this will still blur 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.620
 the more degrade it and so that's how 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.599
