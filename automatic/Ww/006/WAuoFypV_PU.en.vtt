good hit on him below average but still

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.930 
good hit on him below average but still
close<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.900> fit<00:03:40.290> an<00:03:40.650> average<00:03:41.160> role<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.730> good

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
close to fit an average role is a good

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.650 
close to fit an average role is a good
role<00:03:42.120> Ivan<00:03:42.780> give<00:03:43.650> me<00:03:43.739> four<00:03:44.150> rolls<00:03:45.150> backwards

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
role Ivan give me four rolls backwards

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.420 
role Ivan give me four rolls backwards
of<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.349> hill<00:03:46.560> which<00:03:46.980> makes<00:03:47.280> his<00:03:49.040> front<00:03:50.040> armor

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
of the hill which makes his front armor

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.240 
of the hill which makes his front armor
less<00:03:50.700> effective<00:03:51.590> because<00:03:52.590> if<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.040> have

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
less effective because if you have

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.130 
less effective because if you have
sloped<00:03:53.819> armor<00:03:54.209> in<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.420> front<00:03:54.720> then<00:03:55.019> you

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
sloped armor in the front then you

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.530 
sloped armor in the front then you
should<00:03:55.349> never<00:03:55.620> back<00:03:56.580> up<00:03:56.610> so<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.180> slope

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
should never back up so that slope

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.660 
should never back up so that slope
becomes<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.200> little<00:03:58.440> bit<00:03:58.560> vertical<00:03:59.250> and<00:04:01.670> not

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
becomes a little bit vertical and not

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.059 
becomes a little bit vertical and not

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
sitting all the way up and in be Shannon

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:25.050 
sitting all the way up and in be Shannon
and<00:05:19.520> then<00:05:20.520> I<00:05:20.640> just<00:05:20.880> decided<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.450> roll<00:05:21.660> back

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.530 

and<00:05:25.320> that's<00:05:26.320> basically<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:27.040> game<00:05:27.550> right<00:05:27.910> now

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.750 

jump<00:05:31.540> ahead<00:05:31.690> a<00:05:31.810> little<00:05:31.900> bit<00:05:32.139> I<00:05:32.500> think<00:05:33.840> okay

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
jump ahead a little bit I think okay

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.420 
jump ahead a little bit I think okay
let's<00:05:36.760> just<00:05:37.060> watch<00:05:37.389> I<00:05:37.840> think<00:05:38.230> we<00:05:38.380> look<00:05:39.190> at<00:05:39.310> them

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
let's just watch I think we look at them

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.110 
let's just watch I think we look at them
just<00:05:39.610> ends<00:05:40.000> up<00:05:40.120> getting<00:05:41.190> kills<00:05:42.190> here<00:05:42.700> so

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
just ends up getting kills here so

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.700 
just ends up getting kills here so
there's<00:05:43.480> no<00:05:45.180> point<00:05:46.180> in<00:05:46.330> showing<00:05:46.540> it<00:05:46.720> but<00:05:46.900> let's

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
there's no point in showing it but let's

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.050 
there's no point in showing it but let's
see<00:05:47.950> it<00:05:48.040> anyway<00:05:49.200> because<00:05:50.200> there's<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.830> t28<00:05:51.820> I

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
see it anyway because there's a t28 I

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.760 
see it anyway because there's a t28 I
didn't<00:05:52.330> see<00:05:52.450> that<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.750> tank<00:05:52.990> for<00:05:53.200> this<00:05:53.470> low
