through<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.969> regular<00:00:54.329> life<00:00:54.360> how<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:54.930> were

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
through in regular life how they were

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.180

around<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.340> personal<00:04:03.730> interactions<00:04:04.299> that

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
around the personal interactions that

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.390 
around the personal interactions that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
week but for me the scene of the week is

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.129

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
though that's certainly something that

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.860 
though that's certainly something that
we<00:05:40.580> haven't<00:05:40.850> seen<00:05:41.030> before<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.570> get<00:05:41.660> them<00:05:41.780> in

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.790

this<00:05:45.260> series<00:05:45.680> big<00:05:46.010> bad<00:05:47.200> so<00:05:48.200> overall<00:05:48.440> I<00:05:48.560> thought

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.490 
let me know what you thought of this art
was<00:06:40.030> a<00:06:40.060> too<00:06:40.270> fast<00:06:40.540> too<00:06:40.780> slow<00:06:40.930> was<00:06:41.230> it<00:06:41.350> necessary

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
was a too fast too slow was it necessary

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.900 
was a too fast too slow was it necessary
I<00:06:41.920> thought<00:06:42.160> it<00:06:42.250> was<00:06:42.310> good<00:06:42.490> that<00:06:42.520> it<00:06:42.730> showed<00:06:42.880> the

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
I thought it was good that it showed the

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.970 
I thought it was good that it showed the
vague<00:06:43.150> inside<00:06:43.540> sort<00:06:44.260> of<00:06:44.350> humanizing<00:06:44.740> them

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
vague inside sort of humanizing them

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.870 
vague inside sort of humanizing them
which<00:06:45.100> is<00:06:45.220> something<00:06:45.400> that<00:06:45.520> we've<00:06:45.700> already

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
which is something that we've already

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.060 
which is something that we've already
seen<00:06:46.330> with<00:06:46.510> the<00:06:46.600> bad<00:06:46.750> guys<00:06:46.990> in<00:06:47.290> Gundam<00:06:47.860> and

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
seen with the bad guys in Gundam and

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.950 
seen with the bad guys in Gundam and
anyway<00:06:48.730> I<00:06:48.760> just<00:06:48.880> looking<00:06:49.360> forward<00:06:49.660> to<00:06:49.750> seeing

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
anyway I just looking forward to seeing

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.390 
anyway I just looking forward to seeing
more<00:06:50.020> of<00:06:50.200> the<00:06:50.470> fight<00:06:50.650> in<00:06:50.860> fighting<00:06:51.280> between

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
more of the fight in fighting between

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.220 
more of the fight in fighting between
the<00:06:51.640> generals<00:06:52.030> and<00:06:52.240> hopefully<00:06:52.990> we're<00:06:53.110> going

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.230 
the generals and hopefully we're going

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.170 
the generals and hopefully we're going
to<00:06:53.290> get<00:06:53.410> ezell<00:06:53.650> cans<00:06:53.860> reveal<00:06:54.310> relatively<00:06:55.000> soon

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
to get ezell cans reveal relatively soon

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.270

I<00:06:55.330> suppose<00:06:55.390> as<00:06:55.900> opposed<00:06:56.650> to<00:06:56.740> I<00:06:56.830> wonder<00:06:57.100> if<00:06:57.190> I'll

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
I suppose as opposed to I wonder if I'll

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.470 
I suppose as opposed to I wonder if I'll
have<00:06:57.310> to<00:06:57.520> wait<00:06:57.610> till<00:06:57.820> the<00:06:57.910> end<00:06:57.940> of<00:06:58.120> the<00:06:58.240> series

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
but overall on a human level this was

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.540 
but overall on a human level this was
good<00:07:00.730> because<00:07:00.880> it<00:07:01.000> gave<00:07:01.210> Keo<00:07:01.510> his<00:07:02.550> latifah
