00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.090
 The youtube people I'm from 2010 at 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.920
 last to bring another video to you from 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.510
 today and I know that a comparison between 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.410
 sleep ex psp samsung galaxy s four mini 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.930
 bring you 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.760
 the comparison of these two devices does not 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 I'll tell you which is the best but never 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.140
 I will point out the positives and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.330
 negative digital apparatus is good 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.430
 the two handsets are practically in the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.489
 same sort of price you can contract 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.820
 from 1,000 to 1,500 reais of the appliances and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.520
 I recommend you if you have up to 1,500 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.500
 thousand reais and approximately 1,300 reais, which 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.370
 fits if the devices do not buy 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.870
 neither 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.260
 I recommend buying the motorola motokey 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.449
 xt that splendid device is in the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.850
 same price range of the devices that 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.199
 are intermediate to 1 and x motor is top 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.920
 line but many people are also the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.350
 body 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 yes it is the canopy will be of a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.250
 known processing technology 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.479
 like motorola x8 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.310
 google search about this 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.820
 technology that you will understand better 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.659
 the appliances are of difference companies 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.970
 one from sony and one from samsung the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.580
 phones are smartphones and have 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.950
 inventions with 4g lt 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.200
 the former prince has a micro sim that 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.290
 that cut we have three steps one 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.130
 yes normal a micro if it were not the case 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.570
 the sp 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.560
 it's 524 micro send your view your turn alone 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.750
 two chips 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.829
 So you can see it's sweet, I do not know. 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.470
 if it's two micro sims 2 danou se 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.170
 but I do not believe you ever noticed if 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.090
 one of two types of s4 normal fire 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.090
 but I can not guarantee anything to you guys 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.399
 then search in there we can see that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.409
 sbt 155 grams and oeci 4107 appliances 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.740
 they are very light and I do not look much 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.650
 That's because I did not feel much 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.020
 difference 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.690
 5567 at least in my opinion the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.070
 screens have their their positive points 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.770
 and negative 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.410
 we have here the super capacitive capacitive of the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.600
 side of the four mini which is highlighted 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.450
 that people talk about it as a 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.430
 the last screen that leaves the colors 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.920
 poorly saturated 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.150
 when we talk about the tft screen that 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.240
 sp's case 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.700
 we speak of a screen with little brightness 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.740
 then what will set the purchase if the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.430
 screen was a super important thing for 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.060
 you 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.300
 What will set the purchase for you is? 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.190
 search 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.780
 watch videos on the internet there are channels 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.390
 who have already made videos of both 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.640
 and you see it is the same as 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.910
 you compare the lg 2 screen with two 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:55.459
 onyx sinks in a third for kid who is 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.380
 the case of lg 2 and another tft in the case of z 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.970
 And then you can see that the 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.430
 comparisons seek to buy assets from 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.209
 energy that already have the g1 also with today 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.770
 2 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.050
 you can see that there are digital screens 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.080
 an amount to have a quality 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.299
 greater brightness but in compensation it does not 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.870
 show the colors as they really are 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.470
 pulls to certain other colors is 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.650
 It's showing with it in red, okay? 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.739
 more targeted by little pink tea is the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.080
 features that the ipss and 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.840
 until fts are like this 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.680
 It's good they show things like how 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.920
 really are 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.120
 but has less brightness of the sony screen 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.790
 xperia sp has a 4.6 inch hd screen 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.310
 and honesty of 320 pp and more or less 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:49.500
 already the s 4min screen has 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.470
 a resolution of 540 by 960 pixels 4.3 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.380
 inches of screen and 256 pp had 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.569
 intensity per inch 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.569
 the two are very distant and up to 10 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.330
 we can see that 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.300
 south the ex psp is a cornea gorilla glass 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.430
 and technology 24 remind me of gorilla 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.890
 glass 2 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.080
 we have the touchwiz here that these 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.350
 modifications android are made in that 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.049
 4min by samsung with the interface 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.340
 touchwiz while sony mobile bravia 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.150
 engine 2 is the face that the sony of your 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.280
 gadgets 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.780
 Both handsets have a slot for 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.419
 micro sd card 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.220
 are almost four thousand and up to 64 gigs and 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.380
 ufpa 32 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.419
 the two handsets have 8 gb of 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.979
 internal storage but only five 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.530
 5.85 giga are available for the 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.160
 user used any way you want 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.440
 psp has the gb of ram and while s4n a 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.720
 day and a half 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.320
 the handsets have cameras of 8 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.740
 Megapixels your rear cameras 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:03.150
 recorded at 1080p 30 fps and its cameras 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.390
 in the case of st serious legia and 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:10.650
 in the case of 41 points nine megapixels 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:14.789
 the two devices have android and 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.940
 we can see that the sonnet ips pt 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.370
 android 4.1 and so the smn site is 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.350
 speaking it will be updated to 14.4 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:28.289
 kitkat o s4 has me 4.2 and will be updated 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.690
 to 14,371 lb 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:34.500
 the two devices have processors 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:37.820
 dagogo snapdragon side 24 mini them 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.460
 have learned 400 with the same processor 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.970
 is the same wine processing chip 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:48.830
 that we saw in the motor is spin is the inep paid 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.720
 400 s side 4min and 10 August which 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.350
 not the number is not specified 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.320
 here on the side of ex psp the devices 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:01.130
 have dual core processors of 1.7 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:09.680
 stay is discuss more the sun gpu 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:13.160
 psp is 30 years and 20 is from 4305 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.510
 then it is clear that the general processor of the 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.750
 expert sp is superior to processor s 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:23.840
 four mini splashes is not a thing 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.220
 to stick in the case the battery is not 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.610
 the non - removable battery spirits P2370 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.820
 best in the 1900's on the 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:37.520
 f4000 do not cling to battery number 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.520
 than everything depends on what the manufacturer 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.670
 party 'comparative rapid comparative 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.420
 simple so you can see 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.740
 both handsets have bluetooth gps 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.780
 wifi beauty 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.030
 So it's personal to show this 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.800
 speed is fast comparative if you like 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.950
 of chile as the favorite and describe 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.900
 brain for more videos my links 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:04.150
 channel in the description I am of view 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.150
 All about technology
