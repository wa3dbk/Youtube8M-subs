00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.870
 Hello, you are welcome 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.120
 at a recipes today a delicious 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.789
 soup on the table and although you can 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.559
 eat the soup in summer and in winter 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.380
 in summer, the soup is eaten cold 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:23.720
 and warm in the winter and indeed need 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:28.510
 We are about 750 grams of yoghurt then 250 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:33.260
 fresh spinach a zucchini 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:38.840
 one and a half tablespoons of flour a cup 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:43.100
 green lentils a mug roll big the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.860
 There is a pot in the pot then a can 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.140
 chickpeas usually you can too 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.989
 but dry all peas take 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.149
 since the very long need so dry 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.540
 I now have one from the Dose identifier 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.110
 then we need half a liter of cold 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.440
 water 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.100
 First, we will take the wheat and 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.210
 The lentils separate all the cooking until they are 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.090
 have become soft I have mine 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.090
 lips and rolling short yet tender 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.829
 cooked and the water poured off the 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.289
 I washed spinach and small 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.600
 cut and the zucchini I have 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.630
 played and cut as well 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:30.520
 Next, I give the mail in newport 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.520
 pure and great are required 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.490
 that needs to be really smooth 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.900
 then give a big pot 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.900
 my citizens are pure 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.409
 and half a liter of cold water 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.920
 then the read come in 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:29.389
 and the roll size and leave something completely 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.249
 simmer with a continuous stir 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:36.340
 that is very very important you have to 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:36.340
 endeavor that begins to come 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.780
 as soon as it starts to simmer 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.780
 the so kind with pure 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.810
 and the kitchen 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.459
 and finally my spinach 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.410
 and leave the whole then about 15 to 20 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.500
 simmer for a few minutes 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.760
 So when that starts to come 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.760
 her no longer to rest 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.120
 I cooked for about half an hour 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.970
 very important is that you have the soup 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.670
 Finally with salt to taste 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.120
 So make out with salt 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.120
 Season 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.130
 then come the fresh mint leaves 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.239
 with pure 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.239
 could cut small 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.410
 as you have seen , I have 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.110
 No margarine or butter taken 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.120
 the soup is cooked like that but who 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.980
 Of course, one more could want one 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.720
 add tablespoon of butter 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.160
 I hope you enjoyed it bank 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.960

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.800
