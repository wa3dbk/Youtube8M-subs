00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.920
 Welcome to this video about self-aligning bearing systems. 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.470
 Through this film, you will be on self-aligning bearing systems and CARB toroidal roller bearings. 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.490
 There is a certain understanding of how to further improve performance. 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.780
 Since 1907, SKF has invented all self-aligning series of roller bearings. 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.660
 We will showcase a range of applications in which SKF can be used. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.360
 In general, the use of deep groove ball bearings is a reasonable solution. 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.560
 But in some cases, they also need to adapt to misalignment. 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.200
 In response to this problem, design engineers have adopted a traditional self-aligning bearing system. 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.940
 The system consists of two self-aligning ball bearings or spherical roller bearings. 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.079
 This is a bearing with two spherical roller bearings 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.540
 Traditional self-aligning bearing system. 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.280
 They can withstand heavy loads 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.000
 And adapt to misalignment. 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.280
 During operation, the shaft temperature rises and is higher than the housing temperature. 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.340
 The floating end bearing must be able to slide inside the housing. but, 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 The force required to overcome the friction will result in additional loads and vibrations and an increase in operating temperature. 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.340
 Sliding of the bearing can cause wear and frictional corrosion. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.580
 This will result in high axial loads and eventually failure of the bearing. 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.240
 To solve these problems, SKF invented the CARB bearing. 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.000
 It can withstand high loads and adapt to misalignment. 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.360
 It also allows axial displacement inside the bearing and the friction is almost zero. 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.520
 SKF self-aligning system uses a spherical surface at the fixed end 

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:55.069
 Roller bearings with a CARB bearing on the floating end. 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.140
 It can adapt to misalignment, 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.500
 Allows almost frictionless axial displacement, 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.200
 And to prevent frictional corrosion. 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.440
 CARB bearings are interchangeable with spherical roller bearings. 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.720
 In this fan, SKF self-aligning bearing system 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.969
 Helps customers reduce vibration and 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.069
 Noise levels and double the maintenance interval. 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.580
 In this conveyor pulley, SKF self-aligning 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.650
 Bearing systems increase reliability and reduce unplanned downtime. 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.260
 In wind turbines, it can reduce the weight of the cabin weighing up to two tons. 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.580
 This reduces the weight of up to 20 tons in the tower. 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.140
 With the SKF self-aligning system, the design engineer can 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.940
 Optimize design, reduce size, avoid frictional corrosion and increase durability. 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.240
 It can be used with SKF standard housings. 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.700
 CARB bearings are available for shaft diameters from 20 mm to 2 m. 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.340
 SKF also offers sealed CARB bearings. 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.200
 Not long ago, in order to accommodate the axial expansion of the shaft, 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.180
 Every bearing system has to adopt a compromise solution. 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.220
 The CARB bearings developed by SKF have changed this situation. 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.740
 Today, with a spherical roller bearing and a CARB bearing 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.400
 SKF self-aligning bearing system allows your machine to run more smoothly while reducing vibration 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.290
 And friction and reduce maintenance needs.
