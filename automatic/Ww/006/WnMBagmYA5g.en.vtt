00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 very good all tractor firewall that 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.100
 has moved us this time is a video 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.740
 informative to tell you that today they are 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.599
 new york at 12 o'clock Spanish time 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.610
 less time in the Canarian community goes to 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.530
 presumably present what could 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.020
 be the new playstation 4 the new 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.910
 generation of consoles and good here 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.590
 below I will leave the link where you can 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.880
 see it from those hours you put in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.160
 the link that I'm going to leave the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.920
 description and there from 24 00 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.750
 then you will have the sony conference and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.640
 see if really what it presents 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.140
 and if the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.340
 playstation 4 I think they are going to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.899
 present 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.940
 I guess the event of one more hour or 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.800
 less and about that, especially the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 first part show many bullshit 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.370
 cantina is worth with the play new ips 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.590
 new games new technologies or what 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.920
 that is and almost at the end present in what 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.410
 what is the playstation 4 then good 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.850
 in this year I think so because he has 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.320
 there have been many rumors lately 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.420
 leaked many things and the more you 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.399
 they filter things closer they put the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.460
 generation then I believe that today if 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.719
 they're going to present it I think it's not going to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.670
 have all the technology that could 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.729
 have because if not its price would be 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.790
 prohibitive bands over $ 450 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.010
 or euros in our case 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.630
 because if I did it very very very good 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.060
 for the truth that I had to return some 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.920
 1000 1500 then I think it's going to 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.030
 is going to be quite more powerful than 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.040
 what we currently have in this 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.350
 generation but it's going to stay a bit 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.510
 short in respective with own 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.610
 fish and with the technology that we could 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.530
 really can really implement 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.120
 both sony and microsoft in this case 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.410
 then I think the console is enough 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.540
 a medium term is going to be quite 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.910
 powerful and in reference to what there is 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.590
 previous and not in reference to what 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.400
 could be and how could I see it because if 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.690
 not in their prices because they would be 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.490
 prohibitive as I said in 1500 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.660
 minimum dollars will be finished a console 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.650
 so he had a technology 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.140
 awesome good 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.490
 I will make another video with everything that everything 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.410
 what happened to the event 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.960
 presented all new all the data 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.280
 confirmed when all this ends in 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.500
 the next few days and well I hope that what 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.240
 you see and well here and I say goodbye as you 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.830
 I said here you have the link that the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.060
 description of the event and good see you 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.450
