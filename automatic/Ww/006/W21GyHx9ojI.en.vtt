 at this time to another area where you are 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.479
 lowers the temperature to the ice cream that is the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.680
 Cold preparation zone at this time 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.990
 we are where the tanks of 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.930
 maturation where that process is 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.400

 this moment if you allow me a parenthesis 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.270
 it is good to clarify the capacity of this 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.610
 plant this plant has 4000 liters per 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.889
 shifts about 26,000 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.289

 that plant will be in operation 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.159
 will take 30 milliliters more to 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.139
 put us in almost five million 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.210

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.139
 see here as our workers and 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.520
 workers are at this moment in 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:53.039
 basing the ice cream on the presentation of 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.779
 150cc this side we're going to take it out on 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.330

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.560
 extended in the case of venezuela coffee 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.930
 cocoa venezuela and the next ones that 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.759

 see a proposal that the 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.909
 workers 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.919
 art worker or the antennas where 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.169
 only that side we are doing 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.759
 food as you said it recently 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.710
 food for our population 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.080

 contributing to what is development 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.750
 of the country there is a proposal from our 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:43.349
 workers where is a plan for the 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.110
 development of 2013-2019 where 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.970
 would triple the production of all 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.120
 dairy products in the Andes where 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.440
 we would generate more than 5 thousand 500 jobs and 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.780
 the production would exceed 3 million 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.819
 350,000 tons a year to a million 200 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.400
 thousand tons year is the proposal that 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:04.080
 do the workers in this framework of 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.909
 growth in this frame of joy 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.960
 where are we generating these foods 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:12.030
 for the population it is important that the 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.490
 price of these ice cream goes below 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.860
 well below what is in 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.659
 the capitalist market an ice cream this 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.909
 quality costs about 15 bolivars 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:24.479
 for our case in ice cream that is going 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:26.990
 to sell sell at 950 forward
