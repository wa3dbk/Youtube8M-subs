00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.490
 hello everyone I'm a hub today I want you 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.750
 talk about the asus rog g20 which is the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.500
 second complete team that has launched 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.350
 shows for this year-end look 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.790
 and equipment for players with 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.400
 high performance but formats 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.869
 compact the g20 is the largest of the 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.599
 two with 12 5 liters of internal volume and 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.150
 still it's still a pretty system 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.489
 compact that maybe it's not for 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.860
 transport every day not much 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.059
 less but but it will free us 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.059
 enough space on the desk 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.980
 despite being a compact team it counts 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.380
 with a sprint is quite high 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.100
 to your equipped this model with a core 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.020
 and 747 90 in the normal version since 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.670
 This computer is not designed to 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 overclocking but to be a team 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.140
 compact and silent 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.180
 that is accompanied by a chipset h 97 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.360
 The storage system is double 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.310
 on the one hand a 128gb ssd disk and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.870
 below where the graphics card is 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.100
 we found a mechanical disk of two 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.280
 strips with which to improve the capacity of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.610
 storage of the system we have already 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.170
 said the processor that carries a core i7 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.660
 under this cooling system 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.690
 of double turbine that as you can see is 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:37.030
 quite silent at least when it's 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.490
 at rest now we will see it in charge 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.060
 we will not find 16 gb of ram type 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.360
 wish dyn 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.939
 and here you see a graphic card 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.630
 complete format that in this case is a 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.850
 geforce 780 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.259
 the porta maÃ±o we could even install 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.560
 de force 970 m or 980 m even by the 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.240
 consumption 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.720
 it would be perfect for this kind of 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.020
 systems since less consumption less 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.330
 heat to dissipate 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.580
 and in a compact format like this would be 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.770
 perfect 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.950
 I suppose he designed this model 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.780
 thinking the 780 because the 971 80 does not 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.560
 they had still left the market and 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.130
 surely we will see some revision 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.239
 at the beginning of the year with this model with 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.239
 those graphics chips 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.189
 As you can see, it's a pretty system 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.420
 compact I want to show you now the 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.969
 noise that turbines make when 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.849
 we load the processor because as you see 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:42.099
 at rest it is quite silent but the 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.670
 thing changes a little bit when when 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.670
 we give war 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.990
 you have to keep in mind that this noise 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.960
 with the lid open 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.300
 and subjecting all the nuclei of the 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.960
 processor to load 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.060
 when we play some noise there we go 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.360
 to cheat but for the format that it has 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.280
 it's a pretty quiet team one of 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.550
 the reasons with which this is achieved 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.270
 good performance is that asus has used a 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.150
 dissipator that practically ventilates 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.070
 part of the heat when at rest 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.050
 out directly from the box it 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.400
 take advantage of these profiles to rows that 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.740
 have this team that you can see 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.920
 photos in the review here and in the 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.480
 description of this video and the truth is 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.400
 that the system works very well in addition 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.640
 As you can see, the benchmark has just finished 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.120
 what have we passed 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.840
 and returns to a very very quiet state 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.840
 silent 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.990
 As you can see, it controls the turbines 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.510
 independent and for me the result is 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.420
 excellent is a combination of 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.780
 performance when we have to have it and 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.160
 therefore with need of refrigeration 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.270
 but then if we are working on 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.460
 windows or whatever, we'll have a 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.920
 system that behaves then with a with 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.370
 very little noise you have to say that thank you 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.570
 to this high-end graphic engine 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.070
 we will have support for 4k zinc screens 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.540
 to be support for live for experience 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.720
 anything that we can enjoy 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.120
 NVIDIA graphics on a computer 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.910
 conventional tabletop we'll have it 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.980
 here in a more compact format os 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.870
 I invite you to read the full review 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.670
 because we do intensive tests of 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.380
 this new model a lot of 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:52.100
 Photographs 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.660
 and always with our personal analysis 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.590
 as the link you have in the 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.120
 description this is all for now a 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.110
 Greetings to all I am hab 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.110
 until next time
