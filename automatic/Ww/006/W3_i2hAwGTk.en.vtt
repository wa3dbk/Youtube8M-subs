00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.440 
so just be aware that now I did add a
really<00:01:58.540> long<00:01:58.870> lanyard<00:01:59.650> and<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:01.090> put<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.390> on

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
really long lanyard and just put that on

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.440 
really long lanyard and just put that on
there<00:02:01.780> what<00:02:02.620> it<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.730> allows<00:02:04.060> me<00:02:04.300> to

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
there what it is is it allows me to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.720 
there what it is is it allows me to
maneuver<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.020> knife<00:02:05.230> and<00:02:05.530> not<00:02:06.130> really<00:02:06.550> have

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
maneuver the knife and not really have

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.270 
maneuver the knife and not really have
any<00:02:06.909> restrictions<00:02:07.570> one<00:02:08.470> time<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.800> had<00:02:08.979> put<00:02:09.250> a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
any restrictions one time I had put a

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.550 
any restrictions one time I had put a
smaller<00:02:09.700> one<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.019> one<00:02:11.019> of<00:02:11.110> my<00:02:11.200> other<00:02:11.319> knives

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
smaller one on one of my other knives

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.490 
smaller one on one of my other knives
and<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.830> wasn't<00:02:12.129> able<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.900> twist<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.319> knife

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and I wasn't able to to twist the knife

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.759 
and I wasn't able to to twist the knife
or<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.459> pull<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.569> knife<00:02:16.720> over<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.290> that

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
or to pull the knife over in that

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.300 
or to pull the knife over in that
position

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
position

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.030 
position
so<00:02:18.790> with<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.300> longer<00:02:19.600> lanyard<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.710> there<00:02:20.950> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
so with that longer lanyard on there it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.240 
so with that longer lanyard on there it
just<00:02:21.250> really<00:02:21.550> feels<00:02:21.880> nice

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
just really feels nice

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.330 
just really feels nice
more<00:02:23.640> manoeuvrable<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.450> definitely<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.380> just

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
more manoeuvrable and definitely a just

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.720
