you have a higher probability of getting

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.930 
you have a higher probability of getting
it<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:48.989> pretty<00:00:49.260> good<00:00:49.469> number<00:00:50.399> two<00:00:50.610> is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it so that's pretty good number two is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
it so that's pretty good number two is
that<00:00:51.360> when<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> buyer<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.350> searching<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:52.860> an

that when a buyer is searching for an
item<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:54.329> might<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.539> 50<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.320> them<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
item and there might be 50 of them you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.220 
item and there might be 50 of them you
are<00:00:56.219> near<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.550> top<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.660> first<00:00:57.870> one

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
are near the top it's not the first one

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.889

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
because FBA sellers are rated higher

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.770 
because FBA sellers are rated higher

that's why it works so well number five

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.100 
that's why it works so well number five
is<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:11.310> I'm<00:02:11.489> still<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> same<00:02:12.270> item

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
is if I'm still in the same item

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.050 
is if I'm still in the same item
as<00:02:13.200> an<00:02:13.380> independent<00:02:13.890> merchant<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.430> selling<00:02:14.880> I

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.050 
can ask for a higher price and there's
two<00:02:18.990> reasons<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.860> first<00:02:20.130> one<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.430> is

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
two reasons for that the first one is is

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.360 
two reasons for that the first one is is
that<00:02:21.330> an<00:02:21.450> independent<00:02:21.720> seller<00:02:22.200> has<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.190> add

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.060 
that an independent seller has to add

if<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.520> had<00:04:26.669> just<00:04:27.360> been<00:04:27.510> willing<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.930> sit<00:04:28.200> on

but<00:04:36.120> there's<00:04:36.360> more<00:04:36.570> risk<00:04:36.810> because<00:04:37.350> they're

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
but there's more risk because they're

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.560 
but there's more risk because they're
having<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.770> sit<00:04:38.010> on<00:04:38.040> their<00:04:38.250> inventory<00:04:38.880> the
