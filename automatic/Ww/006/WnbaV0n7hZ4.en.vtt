00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.330
 will break no brain now you see before 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.250
 are two games well, in general one game 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.859
 just different devices on the left 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.399
 ipad ios system right bluestacks 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.469
 system which is correct android on 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.300
 there are no differences on the main screen 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.879
 but if you go to chat 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 that's what the fuck is, I'm in that bronze 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.700
 champion again I'm in bronze through the moment 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.010
 champion 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.320
 in general, I never figured it out 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.530
 shit but not having time to wash your hands of it 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.590
 I switched to the profile and saw the picture all 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.440
 dark spel and open i thought about state thank you 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.780
 I'll go review Ohta cup still 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 brewed on the first level I'll go to another 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.520
 times today videos will be discussed 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.159
 seriously technical stuff they're such vata 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.070
 See this new dragons as 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:21.659
 beautifully lie and quests fly 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:24.900
 updates same cool nowhere 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.939
 see better write down a separate tutorial 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.689
 with sensible attacks and will not be from all 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.759
 parties looking at pets first I 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.369
 noticed the terrible imbalance of the very first 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.530
 poison spells now water bowl builds 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.780
 new tactics with which there is no 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.810
 problems at best is spent alone 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.060
 two balls on you man and then bang fuck 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.060
 mages maximum level as there was 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.990
 you can not at all lure to go to stupid 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.350
 hounds and when SS troops pray at 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.390
 This fat scum that correctly cunt 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.000
 so here is the poisoning of the whole first level 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.550
 as for the division than by 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.680
 several stages of the usual vizualka all 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.860
 also a lot of hell cups are being taken from you 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.680
 below that moment when you are looking for yourself 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.870
 do you find an opponent with cups ? 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.210
 hopelessness attacking loot say 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.280
 brains gave troops the queen beat the fence 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.250
 there will be no bombers run into one 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.620
 place to be honest and nothing has changed 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.810
 bombers still run different 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.410
 parties well now it's only at its best 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.930
 case 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.600
 sometimes they glitch utes and run to the farthest 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.270
 the fence for sure you did not catch my denunciation 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.700
 previous review so i will repeat here 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.520
 then comrades ran exploded fine 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.480
 the situation is exactly the same here 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.030
 what we see 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.670
 they ran into some jungle you 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.250
 you rub me some game smoothly 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.140
 go to the queen see the juicy base 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.850
 with the free opportunity to pick up everything 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.850
 Resa for they are located in the center 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.520
 well king instead of moving on 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.450
 storage or at least any other 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.970
 the side starts to bang the fence troops and 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.520
 hero most likely will not 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.000
 fight the walls even queen archer 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.069
 the main word here is likely 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.050
 a grand event happened 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.200
