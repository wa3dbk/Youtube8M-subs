00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.960
 good afternoon guys and there how are you? 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.670
 Today is a very sad day, we'll go. 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.670
 end our thirst how to play 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.680
 Unfortunately, people are here. It 's the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.180
 fourth episode and in this episode the people 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.820
 will do a little review and talk a 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.919
 little about pix inside of the good water 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.390
 in our series you have learned several 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.880
 cool stuff 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.010
 we learned that taking as a point 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.559
 in the streets and talents 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.140
 we learned where to start in 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.490
 forest and we also learn how to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.390
 to singer Hangu 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.790
 I think those are the points 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.910
 of django that is gang- making 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.100
 of the quota of hangu help the team thing of 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.330
 Like if you catch something like that one day. 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.050
 I think you have to catch a day. 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.060
 that helps the team know then I think this 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.640
 is the main point is something that I 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.430
 I forgot to speak during the series, but 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.170
 I would rethink now it's kind of like doing 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.210
 the day you more than I can 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.850
 Can you do it but you can do it? 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.350
 denunciations but only that you will not 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.479
 be one day you'll be a champion 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.790
 Whatever was born to be born smart 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.050
 water farm in car 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.820
 Andrew wins then what I think you 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.320
 should generally pick up at the front 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.330
 you must choose whatever 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.700
 independent video because creek 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.650
 usually he has to always be 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.000
 exposed he has to think about what time 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.760
 he needs that moment to be 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.470
 something individual but he can also 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.850
 think also what you are offering 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.710
 your team 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.840
 It's no use, you know. 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.760
 master of hangu do is focus not 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.860
 could attack or start battles 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.870
 which I think the main point of 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.850
 anders in some categories of django 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.619
 saw that you can usually choose 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.300
 have the games that are doing the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.240
 control of the forest ie they are 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.250
 killing the animals and the kind of nanda 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.890
 xp of the enemy catching havoc sometimes 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.930
 as well as type in the cross-sectional one 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.850
 if you do this and also games that already 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.800
 do not focus so much on the forest itself and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.590
 more charm in the law and because it does not have a 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.440
 control so good type usac nautilus o 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.440
 love and it's the champions who make themselves 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.450
 in battles they start I do not know if 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.510
 they are with full knowledge but they do not 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.310
 they give so much damage they do not make the game so 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.630
 easy know they do not have as much control 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.700
 what a thousand for example 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.320
 entering the nude make it very easy 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.030
 dragons can finish the dragon a lot 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.739
 easy before ten minutes and until 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.900
 cell phones 10 minutes 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.090
 now we packed up our joane these 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.880
 champions are such good habits in a hall 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.140
 the dragon so easily so I guess 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.200
 that this is the differential 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.540
 entering and asking us gang but they 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.620
 they also gain other things each one has 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.120
 your main point 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.920
 when you went to choose yours from angles 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.720
 And you should think more or less than you 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.730
 Are you looking forward to leaving here? 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.440
 low at the beginning of the state getting 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.959
 all major points of the ganglia 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.519
 that the staff takes in the competitive 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.100
 he is a professional player 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.150
 he is very famous he is one of the greatest 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.700
 that makes 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.010
 charles sting and the theoretical craft of hangu 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.780
 I trust him enough so he has my 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.340
 support if you have any questions you 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.350
 You can read the articles it or take a 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.580
 look down on the lcd tv that i 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.530
 I agree 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.450
 And for those who have started, it's good now. 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.920
 pass on the tips to you who are 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.080
 interested in looking for some champions 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.730
 there in our facebook community has 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.310
 several tabs that you might be 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.840
 following and some champions that I go 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.120
 recommend now so there's 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.920
 inscription I think if you are 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.300
 interested in getting water runs 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.040
 usually you do not have any 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.870
 champion what can i do is django 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.550
 I recommend you buy in pleasure 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.130
 more or less as a control guide 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.190
 What's the use of you catching fire and killing? 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.310
 the main monsters for example the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.810
 Dragon head for the water bill 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.700
 these things so in the year the best 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.580
 games to do this at the beginning of the game 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.440
 and it is easy it does not stay do not stay with 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.990
 little life in dilma and another year 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.480
 I think it's very good for cost-benefit or 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.610
 he is great at gangs in 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.480
 control everything is perfect it is very good 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.040
 from creek 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.140
 I think it 's a favorite target at the moment 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.000
 is the best game of the game for me and if 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.450
 You want to go further you can get 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.459
 other games also that I amoooo the ahi 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.010
 so each one with his own style then 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.570
 playing if you are interested go see the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.100
