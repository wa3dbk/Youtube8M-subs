00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.250
 for the state of Yucatan the invitation to participate in the fourth 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.820
 Festival edition of life and death traditions represents a huge 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.549
 commitment and the great opportunity to show all the wealth that in matter 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.610
 of popular culture and living traditions have uses and customs of the people 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.210
 yucateco as well as a delegation of artists and craftsmen that gastronomy 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.150
 If there is music that contributes to its dissemination and knowledge and assessment 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.699
 as something that distinguishes us and that identifies us and sisters with others 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.010
 states of our nation with which we share customs and traditions 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.130
 a festival of traditions of life and death of the two I do 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.040
 they are probably also has its space context to the paper that is the 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.450
 Family environment within the home is also a highly respectful activity 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.940
 for the Mayan families, they have always been established as days to keep 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.799
 for the above 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.059
 the Mayans think that life and death 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.420
 just as creation and destruction coexisted and complemented each other in a 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.480
 necessary dynamic opposition 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.560
 The Mayans believed in life after death as a fundamental part of a 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.680
 continuous change of generation destruction and renewal 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.960
 so the death of the individual was considered only as a step of state 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.720
 by morelos 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.680
 now there are incorporated into that transition 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.200

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.850

 of this celebration although the in all families of all peoples 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.630
 it has its origin in intimate family practice 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.420
 of connection between living relatives and the souls of the deceased in
