journalists<00:01:40.229> including<00:01:40.380> me<00:01:40.799> found<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.220> back

journalists including me found a back

journalists including me found a back
got<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> bit<00:01:41.820> flighty<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.299> those<00:01:42.420> conditions

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
got a bit flighty in those conditions

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.929 
got a bit flighty in those conditions
coming<00:01:43.140> around<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.439> gentle<00:01:44.189> fast<00:01:44.490> bend<00:01:44.790> at

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939

about 60 miles an hour not leaning over
very<00:01:47.189> far<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.759> gave<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:48.630> bit<00:01:48.720> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
very far I gave it just a little bit of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.969 
very far I gave it just a little bit of
throttle<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> road<00:01:49.380> straightened<00:01:49.860> out

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and the back end stepped up by about a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.380 
and the back end stepped up by about a
foot<00:01:52.170> before<00:01:52.710> coming<00:01:53.189> back<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:54.000> felt<00:01:54.210> like

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
foot before coming back in it felt like

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.359
