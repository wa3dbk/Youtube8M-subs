the<00:01:04.949> lipstick<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.060> optimize<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.840> hold

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the lipstick so as to optimize the hold

and<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> definition<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> lip<00:01:08.550> contour<00:01:09.030> I

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.380 

start<00:01:13.619> from<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> center<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.430> work<00:01:14.820> outwards

both<00:01:15.720> above<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.140> below<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.600> will<00:01:18.840> make<00:01:18.960> it

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
both above and below this will make it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.140 
both above and below this will make it
easier<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> outline<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> lips<00:01:20.369> symmetrically

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
I try to blend it in well so that there

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.770 
I try to blend it in well so that there
are<00:01:28.020> no<00:01:28.170> obvious<00:01:28.440> breaks<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> color<00:01:35.780> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
are no obvious breaks in the color to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
are no obvious breaks in the color to
achieve<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> full<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.770> rich<00:01:37.950> effect<00:01:38.399> that

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
looks natural at the same time I apply

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.920 
looks natural at the same time I apply
the<00:01:41.070> lipstick<00:01:41.550> directly<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> stick<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the lipstick directly with the stick and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:54.390 
the lipstick directly with the stick and
I<00:01:43.350> finished<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.800> edges<00:01:44.190> with<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> brush

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.340 

if<00:01:55.400> you've<00:01:56.180> decided<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.750> use<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.170> most

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
if you've decided to use the most

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.249 
if you've decided to use the most
classic<00:01:57.860> lipstick<00:01:58.280> color<00:01:58.520> red<00:01:59.090> it's<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.080> good

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
classic lipstick color red it's a good

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.260 
classic lipstick color red it's a good
idea<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.740> start<00:02:01.009> by<00:02:01.100> neutralizing<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:02.090> lip

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
idea to start by neutralizing the lip

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.899 
idea to start by neutralizing the lip
contour<00:02:02.720> with<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> clear<00:02:03.409> concealer<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.250> to

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
contour with a clear concealer and to

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.670 
contour with a clear concealer and to
then<00:02:05.060> outline<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.840> lip<00:02:05.990> contour<00:02:06.439> with<00:02:06.649> a

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
then outline the lip contour with a

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:23.620 
then outline the lip contour with a
pencil<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:21.760> apply<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.819> lipstick<00:02:23.330> with<00:02:23.480> the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
pencil I apply the lipstick with the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.660 
pencil I apply the lipstick with the
brush<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.170> remove<00:02:24.709> any<00:02:24.920> excess<00:02:25.400> with<00:02:25.610> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
brush and remove any excess with a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.240 
brush and remove any excess with a
tissue<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.810> will<00:02:27.019> also<00:02:27.230> help<00:02:27.590> prevent<00:02:27.950> color

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
tissue this will also help prevent color

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:41.750 
tissue this will also help prevent color
from<00:02:28.550> sticking<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.120> teeth

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.910 

for<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> more<00:02:43.000> unusual<00:02:43.209> look<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.500> combine

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
for a more unusual look you can combine

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.870 
for a more unusual look you can combine
two<00:02:45.220> different<00:02:45.250> lipstick<00:02:46.000> shades<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:47.880> this

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.210 
two different lipstick shades in this
case<00:02:49.150> I've<00:02:49.420> decided<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:50.080> use<00:02:50.349> cyclamen<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.099> the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
by blending the two colors together well

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.420

with<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.359> brush<00:03:13.689> I<00:03:13.959> can<00:03:14.290> create<00:03:14.739> an<00:03:15.010> even
