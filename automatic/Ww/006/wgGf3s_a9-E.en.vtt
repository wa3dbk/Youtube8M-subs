00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.600 

when<00:00:01.260> you<00:00:01.410> need<00:00:01.560> it<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.709> heel<00:00:02.040> flap<00:00:02.370> you

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
when you need it the heel flap you

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.190 
when you need it the heel flap you
slipped<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.090> stitch<00:00:03.360> at<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.600> beginning<00:00:04.020> of

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
slipped a stitch at the beginning of

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.980 
slipped a stitch at the beginning of
each<00:00:04.319> row<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:05.670> made<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> very<00:00:06.240> nice<00:00:06.480> chain

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
each row this made a very nice chain

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.570 
each row this made a very nice chain
through<00:00:07.319> which<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.680> can<00:00:07.859> pick<00:00:08.040> up<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.370> gusset

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
through which you can pick up the gusset

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.299 
through which you can pick up the gusset
stitches<00:00:09.349> you<00:00:10.349> can<00:00:10.530> either<00:00:10.769> pick<00:00:10.950> up<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
stitches you can either pick up the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.450 
stitches you can either pick up the
stitches<00:00:12.170> through<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> entire<00:00:13.650> chain<00:00:15.049> or

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
stitches through the entire chain or

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.420 
stitches through the entire chain or
through<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:18.630> back<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.199> each<00:00:19.500> loop<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
through the back of each loop in the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.939 
through the back of each loop in the
chain<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.150> prefer<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.170> pick<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.680> stitches

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
chain I prefer to pick up the stitches

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.800 
chain I prefer to pick up the stitches
through<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> back<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.970> each<00:00:24.090> loop<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
through the back of each loop in the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.710 
through the back of each loop in the
chain<00:00:25.519> because<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.670> makes<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.060> less<00:00:29.390> lumpy<00:00:30.390> seam

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
chain because it makes a less lumpy seam

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.479 
chain because it makes a less lumpy seam
and<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.590> bit<00:00:31.769> more<00:00:31.949> comfortable

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and I think it's a bit more comfortable

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.600 
and I think it's a bit more comfortable
to<00:00:32.669> wear

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
to wear

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.479 
to wear
so<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.910> pick<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.180> stitches<00:00:36.710> one<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:38.010> each<00:00:38.160> loop

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
so we pick up stitches one for each loop

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270 
so we pick up stitches one for each loop
in<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> chain<00:00:39.059> down<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.780> side<00:00:40.020> your<00:00:40.829> pattern

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
in the chain down the side your pattern

00:00:41.280 --> 00:01:17.330 
in the chain down the side your pattern
will<00:00:41.460> tell<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:41.969> many

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.230 

we<00:01:17.850> come<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> end<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> chain<00:01:20.240> there's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
we come to the end of the chain there's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.140 
we come to the end of the chain there's
still<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> rather<00:01:21.900> large<00:01:22.290> gap<00:01:22.760> between<00:01:23.760> this

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
still a rather large gap between this

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880 
still a rather large gap between this
stitch<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.810> where<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> instep<00:01:25.590> stitches

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
stitch and where the instep stitches

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.520 
stitch and where the instep stitches
starts<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.299> pick<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.630> an<00:01:27.780> extra<00:01:27.930> stitch

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
starts I like to pick up an extra stitch

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190 
starts I like to pick up an extra stitch
in<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> call<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.369> corner<00:01:29.970> I'm<00:01:30.200> referring

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
in what I call the corner I'm referring

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.910 
in what I call the corner I'm referring
to<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.530> area<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.909> corner<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.860> can

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
to this area as the corner and you can

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.899 
to this area as the corner and you can
actually<00:01:35.220> pick<00:01:35.580> up<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> stitch<00:01:36.180> anywhere

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
actually pick up the stitch anywhere

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.820 
actually pick up the stitch anywhere
along<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.270> corner<00:01:39.750> except<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.530> don't

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
along that corner except that you don't

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.210 
along that corner except that you don't
want<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.490> create<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.299> large<00:01:43.049> hole<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:44.100> you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
want it to create a large hole when you

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.590 
want it to create a large hole when you
pick<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.820> stitch<00:01:46.280> then<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.490> replace<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
pick up that stitch then you replace the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
pick up that stitch then you replace the
instep<00:01:49.110> stitches<00:01:49.440> on<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> needle<00:01:50.520> actually

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729

here<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:04.530> end<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.069> third<00:02:05.460> needle<00:02:05.789> by

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
here you end this third needle by

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.630 
here you end this third needle by
knitting<00:02:06.750> half<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.409> stitches<00:02:07.950> at<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.369> case

knitting half the stitches at this case

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.780 
knitting half the stitches at this case
it's<00:02:08.910> seven<00:02:09.390> from<00:02:10.380> this<00:02:10.590> heel<00:02:10.950> needle<00:02:11.370> onto

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
it's seven from this heel needle onto

slip the remaining ones to the beginning

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.350 
slip the remaining ones to the beginning
of<00:02:16.380> needle<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.220> you're<00:02:17.880> ready<00:02:18.120> to
