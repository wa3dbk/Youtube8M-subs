00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
now as you can see there are new maps

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.100 
now as you can see there are new maps
that<00:00:27.560> that<00:00:28.310> I've<00:00:28.670> added<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:29.840> game

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.170 

why<00:00:33.620> should<00:00:33.920> there's<00:00:34.070> basically<00:00:34.520> five<00:00:34.790> Maps

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
why should there's basically five Maps

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.299 
why should there's basically five Maps
it<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.629> this<00:00:35.930> one<00:00:36.320> this<00:00:36.739> this<00:00:37.220> this<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:39.309> some

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
it is this one this this this and some

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.210 
it is this one this this this and some
right<00:00:40.460> here<00:00:40.870> this<00:00:41.870> is<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.440> custom<00:00:42.860> map<00:00:42.980> that<00:00:43.190> I

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
right here this is a custom map that I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.320 
right here this is a custom map that I
made<00:00:43.400> it<00:00:43.640> was<00:00:43.760> based<00:00:44.330> on<00:00:45.460> shadow<00:00:46.460> dance<00:00:46.790> the

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
made it was based on shadow dance the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.400 
made it was based on shadow dance the
other<00:00:47.600> for<00:00:48.170> our<00:00:48.590> base<00:00:49.010> after<00:00:49.839> the<00:00:50.839> maps<00:00:51.050> are<00:00:51.290> a

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
other for our base after the maps are a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.049 
other for our base after the maps are a
in<00:00:51.650> the<00:00:51.830> game<00:00:52.040> but<00:00:52.400> you're<00:00:52.519> playing<00:00:52.670> from<00:00:52.970> the

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
in the game but you're playing from the

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.060 
in the game but you're playing from the
opposite<00:00:53.480> point<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:53.780> view<00:00:54.129> like<00:00:55.540> this<00:00:56.540> one

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
opposite point of view like this one

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.850 
opposite point of view like this one
it's<00:00:58.070> basically<00:00:58.309> convo<00:00:59.239> raid<00:00:59.479> but<00:01:00.110> you're

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
it's basically convo raid but you're

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.000 
it's basically convo raid but you're
playing<00:01:01.250> from<00:01:01.549> the<00:01:01.729> pirates<00:01:02.360> point<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.750> view

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
playing from the pirates point of view

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.520 
playing from the pirates point of view
which<00:01:04.010> is<00:01:04.220> actually<00:01:04.489> pretty<00:01:04.670> cool<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:08.530> it's

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
which is actually pretty cool and it's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.590 
which is actually pretty cool and it's
test<00:01:09.950> up<00:01:10.100> my<00:01:10.220> mind

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.060 

now<00:01:16.600> aside<00:01:16.900> from<00:01:16.930> new<00:01:17.200> maths<00:01:17.470> I've<00:01:17.740> also<00:01:17.890> added

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
now aside from new maths I've also added

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.960 
now aside from new maths I've also added
new<00:01:18.250> ships<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.409> new<00:01:20.940> crew<00:01:21.940> members<00:01:25.799> well

let's see here

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.340 
let's see here
the<00:01:29.470> ships<00:01:29.710> I'm<00:01:29.890> actually<00:01:30.700> new<00:01:31.570> ships

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
the ships I'm actually new ships

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.740 
the ships I'm actually new ships
they're<00:01:32.530> basically<00:01:32.920> ships<00:01:33.550> that<00:01:34.030> are<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
they're basically ships that are in the

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.570 
they're basically ships that are in the
game<00:01:34.960> it's<00:01:35.290> just<00:01:35.500> I've<00:01:36.570> reactivated<00:01:37.570> them<00:01:41.580> not

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
game it's just I've reactivated them not

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.920 
game it's just I've reactivated them not
that<00:01:42.790> they<00:01:42.850> weren't<00:01:43.119> active<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.720> first

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
that they weren't active in the first

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.550 
that they weren't active in the first
place

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
place

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.779 
place
it's<00:01:44.740> just<00:01:45.330> they<00:01:46.330> were<00:01:46.479> not<00:01:47.520> available<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
it's just they were not available to the

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.639 
it's just they were not available to the
player<00:01:49.800> so<00:01:50.800> let's<00:01:51.300> play<00:01:52.300> as<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.649> civilian

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
player so let's play as a civilian

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:15.580 
player so let's play as a civilian
galley<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:56.039> assigned<00:01:57.039> everything<00:01:57.520> else

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:25.460 

black<00:02:16.280> hole<00:02:17.560> recommended

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.180 

and<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.670> go<00:02:26.790> now<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.810> made<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.560> detail

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
and here we go now I made the detail

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.250 
and here we go now I made the detail
level<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.940> be<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.420> very<00:02:30.870> low<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
level to be very very low because of

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.220 
level to be very very low because of
recording<00:02:34.260> purposes<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.930> actually

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
recording purposes but it is actually

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.230 
recording purposes but it is actually
very<00:02:37.260> cool

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
very cool

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.870 
very cool
if<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.420> plant<00:02:39.690> really<00:02:39.990> high<00:02:40.200> detail<00:02:40.880> these

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
if you plant really high detail these

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.000 
if you plant really high detail these
are<00:02:42.120> some<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.360> my<00:02:42.390> new<00:02:42.450> ships<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.590> put<00:02:43.890> in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
are some of my new ships that I put in

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.430 
are some of my new ships that I put in
is<00:02:44.190> basically<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:47.390> weapons<00:02:48.390> barge<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.170> give

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
is basically a weapons barge but I give

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.290 
is basically a weapons barge but I give
them<00:02:49.500> all<00:02:49.680> heavy<00:02:49.950> weapons<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:52.350> a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
them all heavy weapons so that on a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.000 
them all heavy weapons so that on a
other<00:02:54.300> health<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.930> basically<00:02:55.680> lower<00:02:57.770> or<00:02:58.770> still

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
other health is basically lower or still

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.580 
other health is basically lower or still
the<00:02:59.100> same<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.460> got<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.640> recheck<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.230> they

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the same I got a recheck but and they

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.890 
the same I got a recheck but and they
also<00:03:04.770> move<00:03:05.070> now<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.670> they're<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.480> worth

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
also move now so they're now worth

00:03:06.900 --> 00:05:01.100 
also move now so they're now worth
bringing<00:03:08.150> but<00:03:09.150> they're<00:03:09.330> weak<00:03:09.860> incredibly
