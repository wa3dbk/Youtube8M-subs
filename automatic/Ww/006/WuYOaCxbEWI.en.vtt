00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.390 
6000 hockey shin garden so taking a look
at<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> shell<00:00:13.469> design<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.280> an

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
at the shell design this is an

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.890 
at the shell design this is an
asymmetrical<00:00:15.030> shell<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.809> more

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
asymmetrical shell so it's a little more

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.080 
asymmetrical shell so it's a little more
beefy<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.529> outside<00:00:16.890> kind<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.520> tapers<00:00:17.940> and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
beefy on the outside kind of tapers and

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.490 
beefy on the outside kind of tapers and
a<00:00:18.150> little<00:00:18.420> bit<00:00:18.539> more<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> inside<00:00:19.320> but

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
a little bit more on the inside but

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
a little bit more on the inside but
overall<00:00:19.859> still<00:00:20.550> very<00:00:20.789> generous<00:00:21.180> volume<00:00:21.600> this

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
overall still very generous volume this

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320 
overall still very generous volume this
fit<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.949> see<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.490> these<00:00:23.640> ribs<00:00:23.939> down<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
fit you can see have these ribs down the

fit you can see have these ribs down the
middle<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:25.019> giving<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.380> good

rigidity and stiffness helps to
dissipate<00:00:28.140> impact<00:00:28.650> energy<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.699> then<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:29.910> also

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
dissipate impact energy and then we also

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
dissipate impact energy and then we also
do<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.510> some<00:00:30.750> air<00:00:30.929> vent<00:00:31.170> holes<00:00:31.380> through<00:00:31.619> the
