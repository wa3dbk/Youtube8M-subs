right<00:00:56.309> here<00:00:57.140> was<00:00:58.140> very<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:59.160> funny<00:00:59.520> fun<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> do

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
right here was very very funny fun to do

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.390 
right here was very very funny fun to do
when<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.100> Sharks<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:04.400> pretty

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
when I see the Sharks it was a pretty

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.580 
when I see the Sharks it was a pretty
pretty<00:01:06.270> solid<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:08.810> think<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> might<00:01:10.439> have

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
pretty solid I think that I might have

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.820 
pretty solid I think that I might have
to<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.890> some<00:01:11.159> new<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:12.799> think<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.950> spring's

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
to get some new I think this spring's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.929 
to get some new I think this spring's
cuz<00:01:17.060> I'm<00:01:18.060> not<00:01:18.360> gonna<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:20.100> road<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
cuz I'm not gonna have this on road a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.100 
cuz I'm not gonna have this on road a
lot<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:24.030> these<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:25.790> cars<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.869> right

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
lot so I think these are cars the right

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.700 
lot so I think these are cars the right
ones<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.579> don't<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.270> i<00:01:30.650> go<00:01:31.650> to

that<00:03:28.470> was<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.040> ESC<00:03:29.670> on<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:32.280> motor<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
that was the ESC on the motor the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.270 
that was the ESC on the motor the
transmission<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.910> shocks<00:03:36.600> are<00:03:40.280> after

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
transmission and the shocks are after
