00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.140 
doing very clumsy okay there you go
it's<00:02:58.430> here<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.560> all<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:00.890> do<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.340> kind<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.940> like

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
it's here so all you do is kind of like

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.650 
it's here so all you do is kind of like
fit<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:03.430> here<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.940> basically<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.540> think

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
fit this in here so basically I think

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.250 
fit this in here so basically I think
you<00:03:09.110> you're<00:03:09.500> getting<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.950> point<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.490> it<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.260> I

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
you you're getting the point of it and I

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.540 
you you're getting the point of it and I
can<00:03:12.709> then<00:03:13.340> go<00:03:14.239> ahead<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:15.340> extend<00:03:16.340> this<00:03:16.640> oh<00:03:18.550> I

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
can then go ahead and extend this oh I

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.310 
can then go ahead and extend this oh I
probably<00:03:19.940> can't<00:03:20.330> so<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.660> just<00:03:20.870> duplicated<00:03:23.320> so

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
probably can't so I just duplicated so

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.699 
probably can't so I just duplicated so
two<00:03:24.620> three<00:03:24.830> times<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:26.530> mean<00:03:27.530> I'm<00:03:27.680> just
