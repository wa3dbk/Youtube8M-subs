rupture<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.670> target<00:03:48.880> at<00:03:49.180> all<00:03:49.390> times<00:03:49.690> the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
rupture on the target at all times the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.840 
rupture on the target at all times the
reason<00:03:50.380> we'll<00:03:50.560> keep<00:03:50.740> rupture<00:03:51.130> up<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.460> it<00:03:51.670> gives

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
reason we'll keep rupture up is it gives

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.760 
reason we'll keep rupture up is it gives
you<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.150> sanguinary<00:03:52.660> veins<00:03:52.990> buff<00:03:53.260> which<00:03:53.590> in

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
you the sanguinary veins buff which in

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.190 
you the sanguinary veins buff which in
6.2<00:03:54.250> will<00:03:54.550> increase<00:03:55.540> your<00:03:55.660> damage<00:03:55.780> done<00:03:56.170> by

to our damage make sure to keep it up at
all<00:04:00.610> times<00:04:02.100> for<00:04:03.100> slice<00:04:03.490> and<00:04:03.670> dice<00:04:03.930> gives<00:04:04.930> you

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
all times for slice and dice gives you

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.210 
all times for slice and dice gives you

of course the Watts wing extra damage

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.860 
of course the Watts wing extra damage
but<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.250> also<00:04:09.459> gives<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.030> energy<00:04:10.209> regen

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
but it also gives you the energy regen

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.040 
but it also gives you the energy regen
as<00:04:11.020> well<00:04:11.200> so<00:04:11.650> once<00:04:12.310> again<00:04:12.450> motor<00:04:13.450> G<00:04:13.690> we<00:04:13.870> have

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
as well so once again motor G we have

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.050 
as well so once again motor G we have
the<00:04:14.260> better<00:04:14.380> we<00:04:14.560> can<00:04:14.590> do<00:04:14.830> especially<00:04:15.250> with<00:04:15.670> our
