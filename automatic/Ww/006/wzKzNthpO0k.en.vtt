that I think he was even straight from
anyways<00:03:11.110> but<00:03:11.860> yeah<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.400> really<00:03:12.549> worked<00:03:12.790> out

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
anyways but yeah it really worked out

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.789 
anyways but yeah it really worked out
for<00:03:13.000> me<00:03:13.060> there<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.299> like<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:14.079> previous<00:03:14.380> rounds

for me there I like the previous rounds

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.259 
for me there I like the previous rounds
the<00:03:14.980> enemies<00:03:15.310> had<00:03:15.430> come<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.820> way<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.209> you

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
the enemies had come that way and you

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.789 
the enemies had come that way and you
really<00:03:16.480> got<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.660> be<00:03:16.720> aware<00:03:16.810> when<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.530> calling
