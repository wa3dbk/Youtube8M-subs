same now let's get orange in here as a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.270 
same now let's get orange in here as a
matter<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.939> comparison<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.840> there

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
matter of comparison you can see there

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.270 
matter of comparison you can see there
right<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> difference<00:01:41.579> when<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.600> open<00:01:42.960> them

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
right the difference when I open them

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.410 
right the difference when I open them
you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> difference<00:01:45.060> there<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
you can see the difference there and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.370 
you can see the difference there and
there's<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> different<00:01:45.869> pattern<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
there's a different pattern in the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.050 
there's a different pattern in the
background<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.640> will<00:01:47.909> match<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:50.060> faceplate

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
background that will match the faceplate

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.069 
background that will match the faceplate
that<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.299> take<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> look<00:01:51.540> at<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> second

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that will take a look at in a second

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.050 
that will take a look at in a second
otherwise<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.520> same<00:01:53.820> thing<00:01:54.030> just

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
otherwise it's very same thing just

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.990 
otherwise it's very same thing just
maroon<00:01:54.659> instead<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.170> orange<00:01:55.850> alright<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
maroon instead of orange alright so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
maroon instead of orange alright so
let's<00:01:57.149> close<00:01:57.360> those<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.780> move<00:01:58.560> them<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
let's close those up move them out the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.580 
let's close those up move them out the
way<00:02:00.860> faceplate<00:02:02.180> bujinkan<00:02:03.180> space<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.439> can

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
way faceplate bujinkan space and you can

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.639 
way faceplate bujinkan space and you can
see<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.729> pattern<00:02:06.600> dad<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.259> message<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
see this pattern dad and message the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.100 
see this pattern dad and message the
