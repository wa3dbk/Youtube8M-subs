00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 LiveMap Motorcycle Helmet with Navigation System 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.000
 Where am I? What am I doing? 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000
 My name is Pete. I am an IT expert. 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
 I have heard of some extraordinary Russian inventors who deliberately came to verify the truth. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 By the way, I am in Moscow. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 What problems will you encounter when navigating in Russia? 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.000
 The first is the language issue. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000
 There is no time to read the name of the street. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 You will stop to see the map. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 When you ask the locals 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 Some of them try to help you 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.000
 Some may not 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 There are still some, they are trying hard to help you, pointing out the general direction for you. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I count on GPS. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.000
 It is useful, but not all. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 If you need to change the road, you need to stop 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.000
 Enter a new address 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 If you missed the last voice prompt 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Need to look down and press the button 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 Please don't turn your eyes off the road for too long. This is very insecure. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 On the road, especially Russia, anything can happen. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Ok, I got to my destination. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000
 More like a factory than an office. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Many start-ups start in garages or backyards, at least in Silicon Valley. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Perhaps the emerging trend in Russia is - starting from the factory? 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 These young people showed me the engineering drawings of the helmet embedded in the navigation system. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 It looks impressive. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 We started our project five years ago and had nothing at the beginning. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Some are just an outstanding idea. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Motorcycle helmet with added time mode. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Our invention - a new era for motorcyclists. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 This is the helmet of Iron Man. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Helmet with navigation system. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Electronic board 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Micro imager 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Display 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Photosensitive device 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 battery 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 headset 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 microphone 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 The final version of the helmet will be made of carbon fiber. 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.000
 A high-strength material that is stronger than steel. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 But at the same time it is very light. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 The helmet will be certified by an international standards body. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 The helmet prototype was made by a 3D printer. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Next, what improvements have they made to the structure of the helmet? 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 It is slightly larger than a normal helmet. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 The image is projected onto the display. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Navigate the same technique used in helmets 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Also used in the new BMW car. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 We do our best to design the interface to be simple and friendly. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 The image is always in the center. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 You don't need to move the implementation from the road to the interface. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 You only need to look directly at it to see both the interface and the road. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 When you drive at high speed, you will see the least amount of information. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 The image is not large and is always centered (highlighted by the line of sight). 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 People always focus on this area. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Electronic compass 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Based on Android system. 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.000
 Map of all countries. 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Weather forecast, traffic congestion, interesting locations. 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Our helmets have a voice operating system. 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.000
 We did a series of tests under noisy environmental conditions. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Got very optimistic results. 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 The chance of successful identification is as high as 95%. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Interestingly, does it only understand the pronunciation of a Russian accent? 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Enter the address. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Please tell the street in San Francisco. 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Market Street 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 awesome! 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 In fact, the technology used here is the same as the iPhone's Siri. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 How long does the battery last? 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Battery life is always a headache. 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 But you don't have to worry about it. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 They told me that a fully charged battery is enough for a full day. 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 The long battery life is due to the use of high-capacity batteries. 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 You can charge it via a regular USB cable. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 The idea of ​​a helmet is very interesting. 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 But can these young people make their products? 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 So far we have prototypes of all the parts. 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Optical component samples, program components, motherboards, speech recognition components. 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 They already have funding and some venture capital from the Skolkovo Innovation Center. 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 The funding committee allocated a million dollars for the research and development of helmets. 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 We believe that our products have an optimistic market outlook. 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 I am fully confident that your products will be successful and I wish you good luck. 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Although the product is developed by Russia, it will be launched in the English-speaking country for the first time. 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 This is because the voice operating system uses the most popular English in the world. 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 What about the price? 2 thousand dollars. 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 But if you are "early bird" - $1,500. 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 But I hope that I can get one free of charge by participating in this promotion. 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 After that I said this invention to my friends. 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 They all like this idea. 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 I think that our invention will greatly benefit all motorcyclists. 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 I hope that you can take action to help our plan.
