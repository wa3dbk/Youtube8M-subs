00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.060
 Cormorants Hello 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:10.650
 Character good 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:12.120
 It is the morning of the hospital mak 鍼灸

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:21.020
 today 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:22.640
 I would like to introduce the muscle training that can be done without putting a load on the knee joint 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.800
 Everyone 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:33.770
 2 knees or 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:38.420
 Do you use muscle training as a prevention to prevent your knees from getting hurt 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:42.950
 Most people think of squats first 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:49.300
 It's squat, and if your knees hurt a lot 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:53.760
 Because there is that gone too much of a burden to the joint become well hurt 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:58.150
 Muscle training can be done without stressing joints 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.860
 I would like to introduce one 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.860
 Let's do it 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.450
 First of all 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.390
 You will sit on the floor in the survey 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.540
 Is it such a feeling ? 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.540
 Huh 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.700
 It is the foot 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.149
 Please give me 3 cm like this 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.800
 Taniage up and down 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.830
 1 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.830
 Good 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:38.950
 I think that is called a limited about 10 times I feel it 's 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:42.320
 The slower you go, the higher the effect. 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.200
 e 1 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:51.200
 I think that a good pace is fine 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.980
 This is where you train and it is the thigh 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:01.250
 Do not burden the joints 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.180
 In order to reduce the burden on a knee, you will also need the interest rate of Jiang that I have waited for now 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.620
 Because 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.289
 I am doing muscle training here as well 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:15.799
 In this attitude 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:18.430
 I raise my feet a little and open and close to the place I open 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:22.010
 Do not drop it once 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.830
 I lift my feet while I'm from the ground 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.860
 It is about 5 centimeters or I still meet 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.890
 We'll do that say up Close 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.250
 Well I think this should be done about 10 times 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:42.860
 It last is to 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:44.610
 Hey I did you say very much with a fried or rain seat technique from where open open 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:52.770
 Feeling that say 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:54.120
 I will do about 10 times Now I do not put a burden on the joints Even knees 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.190
 Joint 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.520
 a 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:06.590
 The thigh muscles needed to relieve stress 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:10.610
 You can train yourself, so when you do it, you have to pay attention to the posture . 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.230
 Just the right thing already 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.080
 At a right angle 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.790
 Please try to become like this- 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.319
 Huh 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:24.859
 It might be the best thing to put your back on the wall 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.560
 If you say something, it would be nice if you could get addicted 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:34.580
 Become a wind say more and more doing 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:36.069
 This is where you become to do and as much as possible to the effect that will be halved this 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.590
 In attitude 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:49.470
 I think that I want you to do something to raise and lower firmly 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.470
 If you did those, such as whether the Well full marathon by it is the goal marathon aims to finish 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:04.680
 At first I think that you want to aim at being able to do about 100 times 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:06.830
 Since the first is good even Toka 3 times were tough in the 10th floor 10th floor because it is quite hard 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.260
 Straight 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.020
 Agesage 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.240
 Spread 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:21.330
 And spread was three of guy to say I raised and lowered from the place 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:25.260
 Well you're good at three times can be a continuous one by gradually and 10 times become accustomed gradually 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:30.009
 It will be like if you do it well 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.129
 a I think the pain in my head and knees will decrease 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.129
 Hmm 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:46.460
 We introduced a simple muscle training that can be done without burdening the above 4 the joints . 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.460
 Please, try by all means be doing everyone's
