00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
like a ghost and this is a pump

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.310 
like a ghost and this is a pump
foundation<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.300> pumping<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.230> out

foundation so I'm pumping some of it out

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.270 
foundation so I'm pumping some of it out
i'm<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.800> apply<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.340> brush<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.250 
i'm going to apply it with a brush I
like<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.670> paint<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.059> my<00:00:48.270> foundation<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.050> feel

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
like to paint on my foundation I feel

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.569 
like to paint on my foundation I feel
like<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> gets<00:00:49.620> me<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> little<00:00:50.100> bit<00:00:50.309> more

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
like it gets me a little bit more

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.440 
like it gets me a little bit more
control<00:00:51.539> especially<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> liquid<00:00:52.469> based

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.850 

so<00:00:59.450> a<00:00:59.480> little<00:00:59.719> bit<00:00:59.930> goes<00:01:00.079> a<00:01:00.140> really<00:01:00.350> long<00:01:00.500> way

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
so a little bit goes a really long way

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:20.080
