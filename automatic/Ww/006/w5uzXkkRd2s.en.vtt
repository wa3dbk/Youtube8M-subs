00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.170
 very good to all people I am a machine and 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.690
 welcome to a video reviews about 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.910
 attention of my click quest for an epic 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.859
 blood and the pronunciation is studied 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.570
 so you do not eat me in the comments 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.460
 and well that is this game with this name 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.950
 so kilometer good, it's a new 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.230
 ubisoft game that was announced in the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.360
 e3 and that is currently in 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.160
 closed beta phase is a game that goes to 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.750
 be free to play and that I think is going to 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.550
 like a lot of people and that is going to be 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.230
 quite played so we're not going to see anything 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.469
 what it is about and what this 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.469
 game 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.829
 The first thing we have to know is that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.989
 in miley what were epic club 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.970
 we have to choose a character from these 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.949
 three you see on the warrior screen 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.110
 archer or magician in my case as you know 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.180
 warriors always the mechanics of the game 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.250
 it's pretty innovative and what 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.699
 you are going to explain now there are two words 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.930
 keys in this game defend and attack 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.909
 As for defending we will have to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.770
 build our own fortress will be 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.690
 other online players those who enter 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.060
 our strength and try to pass it on 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.710
 to get the final reward and in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.450
 how to attack in the same way as 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.460
 we have our strength to the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.800
 that other soldiers come to us 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 we will go to the strengths created by 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.670
 the other players to try some 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.670
 past and get the final reward 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.290
 let's start by defending well then in 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.760
 As for the defense, we will have to 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.800
 build as I said before our 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.750
 own strength at the beginning our 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.420
 Fortress is a chestnut say no 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.130
 it's worth nothing and I think it does not figure in 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.200
 the possible strengths to which they can 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.270
 access the players as we go 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.280
 winning amount of diamonds and gold 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.230
 We will improve our strength and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.940
 we will fortify so that every time 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.070
 present greater difficulty to 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.360
 players who go into it how 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.970
 we evolve to our strength 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.280
 Well, through new objects that we are going 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.280
 buying improving each one of these 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.170
 objects adding more rooms to the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.360
 strength at first they are simply 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.190
 three blocks we can increase and put 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.959
 many more blocks and create a 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.060
 kind of labyrinth and finally 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.920
 adding minions by adding monsters 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.050
 that hinder the hero that is going to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.760
 enter it successfully complete it and 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.170
 collect your reward we can also 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.690
 place different traps that 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.640
 make it difficult for the attacker to 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.920
 our strength in our strength 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.959
 we will also have the possibility to create 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.640
 the different objects we have access to 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.320
 a smithy to trastear arms and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.330
 armor and we can also create 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.230
 different potions for example options 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.730
 of health that we 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.510
 at the moment we are attacking 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.510
 a stronghold 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.490
 and as for the attack, we'll have to 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.860
 assault other strengths of others 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.570
 players all different from each other 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.060
 one with its own distribution of rooms 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.040
 some will have more maze other 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.690
 less with third more monsters other 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.670
 less besides monsters there are also 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.860
 traps that can slow us down or 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.960
 there are also species of turrets that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.640
 they are throwing fireballs at us and 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.920
 we have to try to dodge 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.420
 lose in the shortest possible life the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.310
 we can complete it in the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.590
 time we want but we will only be 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.120
 fit for the final reward if the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.560
 we finished in the time that we were 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.940
 indicates above to the right of the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.920
 screen that is a clock that is going 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.810
 finishing and the moment that is finished 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.640
 that time we are no longer fit for 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.770
 final reward the dungeon will be 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.660
 completed just as well as that 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.120
 we will not have access to that light to that 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.770
 final reward of gold and diamonds 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.660
 also during the stay in the 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.090
 dungeon each monster will go loosing 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.770
 different objects those objects the 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.080
 we can equip the character either 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.110
 weapons armor jewelery etcetera also 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.390
 they will sometimes jump balls of life that 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.860
 will come very well to heal us and added to 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.990
 we will have potions that we will have 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.470
 previously created in our own 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.470
 strength 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.269
 added to all this we will have in addition to 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.190
 the evolution of our strength the 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.050
 evolution of our hero 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.240
 our hero has certain skills 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.950
 we improve those skills and 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.840
 acquiring as we go up the 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.940
 level we can have up to a maximum of 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.530
 three special abilities that we can 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.720
 go choosing as we win 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.010
 more skills and we will also have a 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.780
 main skill with the button 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.790
 left of the mouse and one more skill 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.590
 strong with the right mouse button to 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.510
 our hero we will also equip him 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.860
 with new armors and new weapons that 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.780
 we go out in the different 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.550
 dungeons that we are completing after 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.920
 from each dungeon we can access the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.420
 booty to our inventory and see every 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.800
 object that we have achieved which one we 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.080
 we want to equip and we have 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.490
 sell when our character goes up 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.170
 level we can go talk to the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.610
 instructor and this will indicate us the 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.360
 skill or skills that we have 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.360
 got new 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.280
 the game also completes great with 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.050
 the mission system that has us 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.330
 propose different objectives to be met 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.919
 and we will be rewarded with gold gems and 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.800
 diamonds and it will also be a good way 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.389
 to try to complete new challenges to 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.550
 this adds the butler system what 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.900
 we will be able to see at all times how 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.060
 heroes delve into our strength 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.069
 and they try to overcome it on the one hand 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.689
 we can see the repetition of how that 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.580
 hero goes into our dungeon and 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.409
 complete it in order to study 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.840
 where our strength weakens and 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.159
 try to improve it in certain points and 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.020
 On the other hand we can try 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.370
 revenge by going to the fortress of 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.409
 enemy that has completed our 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.960
 dungeon and try to recover the gold and 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.910
 stolen diamonds 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.710
 and nothing more people waiting for more 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.750
 information about this game that promises 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.310
 very much do not forget to like this 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.599
