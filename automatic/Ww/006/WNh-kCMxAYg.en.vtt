00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
finally meet up sure it has a better

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.400 
finally meet up sure it has a better
window<00:03:35.070> camera<00:03:36.070> memory<00:03:36.760> speed<00:03:38.519> audio<00:03:39.519> but<00:03:40.180> uh

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
window camera memory speed audio but uh

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.550 
window camera memory speed audio but uh
terms<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.560> form<00:03:41.830> factor

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
terms a form factor

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.910 
terms a form factor
not<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.800> lot<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.750> change<00:03:46.750> there<00:03:46.989> keyboard<00:03:47.860> I

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
not a lot of change there keyboard I

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.400 
not a lot of change there keyboard I
think<00:03:48.070> it<00:03:48.130> C<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.340> more<00:03:48.519> like<00:03:48.730> flat<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:50.170> wheel

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
think it C is more like flat that wheel

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.910 
think it C is more like flat that wheel
rotates<00:03:50.950> now<00:03:51.130> whereas<00:03:51.459> before<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.940> didn't<00:03:52.920> it

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
rotates now whereas before it didn't it

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.590 
rotates now whereas before it didn't it
