00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.710
 yes 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.510
 one of the most powerful creations of 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.760
 gero doctor who would serve as 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.070
 instrument of revenge against 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.560
 goku however his personality 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.440
 peaceful and friendly was considered as 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.510
 a flaw and they never lit it until 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.430
 that was activated by the number android 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.470
 18 he is the android number 16 saga 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.269
 of the the game is one of the most bombs 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.790
 techniques of the first part of dragon ball 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.979
 z in it they make their introduction several 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.900
 quite beloved characters from 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.150
 trunks of the future to the twins 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.820
 androids but it is the giganton of number 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.860
 16 who takes the crown to the character 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.320
 more admirable because despite being 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.420
 created for destruction he pleads for 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.580
 peace and in this box author we will do 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.250
 an exclusive review of the figure of 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.159
 artificial human number 16 that thank you 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.869
 adam will arrive in Mexico the android 16 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.299
 was created by the gero doctor with a 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.920
 only goal in mind destroy goku 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.110
 for having overthrown the regime of 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.939
 red patrol in fact this be good 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.840
 modeled after the deceased son of 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.549
 doctor and 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.979
 even though it does not look very 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.439
 friendly number 16 is similar to 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.869
 Android 8 since they are both very 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.939
 calm with almost all the characters 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.490
 behaves in a gentle and courteous manner 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.469
 except with goku he goes with 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.140
 complete coldness since its programming 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.909
 orders you to eliminate it to large 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.759
 traits these are the characteristics of 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.229
 16 so now let's go to the same review 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.140
 that in his suit the predominant color 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.819
 of the packaging of 16 is the green by the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.500
 part of forward we can appreciate the 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.179
 saints window feature 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.340
 words that allows to see the content 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.500
 inside of the box on the left side 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.969
 we can see the name of the figure and the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.039
 right side you will find a 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.530
 approach to the face of the android and 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.989
 Below are several logos among them 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.939
 the one of tama ginÃ©s jones bandai and the band 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.129
 disco reader shop indicating that this 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.049
 figure is one more and web exclusive 

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:07.849
 from the back we can see the 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.009
 android in several poses some more 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:13.220
 active than others and one in conjunction with 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.349
 the other androids 17 and 18 and something 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.030
 quite peculiar is the onomatopoeia of 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.610
 center of the image 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 What do you think that means? 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.510
 to the figure as akira toriyama was 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.760
 very fan of the color orange since not 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.910
 Enough with dressing like that to Goku too 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.680
 made 16 a very orange redhead the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.170
 Hair strands sculpture is 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.959
 quite interesting and you have to admit it 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.760
 it is totally a cairn the face is 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.190
 pretty rough with very eyebrows 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.020
 pronounced light blue eyes earrings 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.080
 golden on both ears and a chin 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.940
 super square the number 16 torso 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.250
 It is also very large and the vest or 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.769
 green clothing contrasts very well with the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.750
 dark gray inside and obviously not 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.120
 could not miss the red patrol logo 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.470
 in the chest of the android something very cool 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.480
 of the figure is that the parties 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.070
 cylindrical shoulder pads can be 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.930
 move independently of the torso 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.300
 making the arms have more 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.640
 mobility in the forearms appear 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.660
 again the color green and 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.220
 definitely is machine nation no 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.380
 I could forget the fact that these 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.290
 forearms are actually tip 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.940
 stronger weapon of 16 in the legs 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.310
 we can appreciate that it is a sculpture 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.989
 totally new since the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.090
 patches knees milestones that 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.140
 premiered in the figure of cri link and 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.720
 obviously the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.730
 they are also bright green in 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.709
 Overall the figure presents a high level 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.840
 of detail to the sculpture since the 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.450
 Android costume is quite peculiar 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.090
 not to say super weird and it's 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.100
 perfectly reproduced with respect to 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.500
 colors we can see that all the parts 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.300
 greens are glossy or glossy and the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.660
 rest of the parts present colors 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.790
 opaque or matte figure of android 16 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.610
 comes with four faces four hands and 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.440
 a cairn or a set of hair one of 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.450
 the smallest accessories included is 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.730
 his face beaten and half destroyed 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.370
 porcel is on that face where we can see 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.980
 that really 16 does not have human parts 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.780
 but it is a being completely 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.640
 cybernetically like another face 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.130
 quite nice is the one who brings a 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.959
 smile thin since despite 16 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.980
 it is synthetic he has a personality 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.019
 very gentle and friendly 16 despite being 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.090
 a relatively rough figure has 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.880
 much amplitude of poses since it counts 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.830
 with 34 joints itself the figure 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.500
 has the same articulations of 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.240
 16 bits of the dragonball line since 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.950
 You can flex all your limbs 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.210
 no problem but 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.670
 chest where we see the 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.410
 most marked difference android 16 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.540
 has a spherical joint in the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.670
 chest to flex it forward and 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.070
 back and to the sides something that 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.720
 the bodies of goku do not have 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.340
 has a couple of joints in the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.920
 back to be able to move their shoulder pads 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.140
 to give it more dynamism and clear as 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.300
 has a segmented skirt every part of 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.310
 this one has a pivot on one end for 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.140
 move it one of the most 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.090
 interesting of the piece is that you can 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.610
 remove the forearms to execute 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.440
 different abilities of 16 and between 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.630
 the funniest is the attack 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.610
 made famous by the most singles rock 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.710
 &amp; boch and since we 're talking about 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.870
 remove the forearms obviously also 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.060
 it had to be possible to accommodate and pose 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.610
 to Android 16 making his attack more 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.840
 powerful with which almost eliminates do 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.840
 the gel splash 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.690
 the android 16 is one of the figures of 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.970
 biggest dragonball that have come out 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.860
 So far his height is quite 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.590
 greater than the average of the steelers since 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.870
 It measures around 17 centimeters 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.030
 obviously broli is still ultra 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.949
 gigantic but we can see that his 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.060
 height is well above those of the 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.960
 two androids 17 and 18 and they are goku 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.729
 comparatively speaking with others 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.830
 lines of tamas and nation we can 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.440
 appreciate that the android is almost the 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.840
 same size as the micros but saga 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.229
 reading blood and cancer surprise and ex 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.150
 they are figures much higher than 16 the 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.970
 figure of 16 will arrive in Mexico between 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.449
 March and April and will cost 950 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.550
 pesos 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.259
 remember that distributor any mexico does not 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.909
 makes sale to the public so for 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.030
 find your nearest store visit 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:16.159

 channel to find out more releases 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.159
 and remember that soon in 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.740
 the city of mexico will be held the 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:26.990
 machines gallery where jones 2015 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.849
 You will see these figures and many others 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.650
 so very aware of networks 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:32.180
 damm social and see you with more 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.820
