of<00:02:17.380> chicken<00:02:17.769> topped<00:02:18.519> with<00:02:18.700> avocado<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:20.110> mango

just<00:02:21.880> don't<00:02:22.570> had<00:02:22.750> those<00:02:22.930> as<00:02:23.080> well<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.500> thought

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
just don't had those as well I thought

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.590 
just don't had those as well I thought
that<00:02:24.190> they<00:02:24.340> were<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.580> highlight<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.120> our

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
that they were the highlight of our

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.960 
that they were the highlight of our
dinner<00:02:25.840> there<00:02:26.709> were<00:02:26.799> some<00:02:27.280> most<00:02:27.820> of<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
dinner there were some most of the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.970 
dinner there were some most of the
dishes<00:02:28.090> were<00:02:28.390> okay<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.350> real<00:02:29.530> standout

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
dishes were okay with the real standout

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.130 
dishes were okay with the real standout
where<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.220> chicken<00:02:30.549> mole<00:02:30.760> ate<00:02:30.940> tacos<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.630> think

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
where the chicken mole ate tacos I think

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.750 
where the chicken mole ate tacos I think
that<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.440> chef<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.040> I'm<00:02:33.130> not<00:02:33.280> sure<00:02:33.310> which<00:02:33.730> of

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
that the chef and I'm not sure which of

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.370 
that the chef and I'm not sure which of
the<00:02:33.910> brothers<00:02:34.209> was<00:02:34.239> behind<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.200> line

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
the brothers was behind the line

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.440 
the brothers was behind the line
although<00:02:35.590> one<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.890> them<00:02:35.950> clearly<00:02:36.280> was<00:02:36.549> they

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
although one of them clearly was they

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.090 
although one of them clearly was they
are<00:02:37.480> really<00:02:37.870> good<00:02:38.110> at<00:02:38.200> sauces<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
are really good at sauces and so the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.680 
are really good at sauces and so the
dishes<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.549> have<00:02:39.610> sauces<00:02:40.120> like<00:02:40.150> we<00:02:40.420> did<00:02:40.600> they

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
dishes that have sauces like we did they

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.870 
dishes that have sauces like we did they
have<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> handmade<00:02:41.290> ravioli<00:02:41.640> pesto<00:02:42.640> sauce

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
have a handmade ravioli pesto sauce

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.270 
have a handmade ravioli pesto sauce
which<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.660> thought<00:02:43.810> was<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.080> die<00:02:44.230> for<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:45.040> pasta

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
which I thought was to die for the pasta

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.070 
which I thought was to die for the pasta
was<00:02:45.519> great<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.030> sauce<00:02:46.239> again<00:02:46.510> was<00:02:46.810> great

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
was great but the sauce again was great

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.660 
was great but the sauce again was great
so<00:02:47.500> there<00:02:47.620> were<00:02:47.709> some<00:02:47.920> misses<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> menu

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
so there were some misses on the menu

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.460 
so there were some misses on the menu
it's<00:02:49.030> pretty<00:02:49.330> wide<00:02:49.570> menu<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.170> think<00:02:50.380> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
it's pretty wide menu and I think the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.840 
it's pretty wide menu and I think the
week<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:50.799> got<00:02:50.950> there<00:02:51.160> they<00:02:51.220> were<00:02:51.250> adding<00:02:51.580> steak

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
week we got there they were adding steak

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.640 
week we got there they were adding steak
to<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.090> man<00:02:52.209> yes<00:02:52.360> they<00:02:52.570> just<00:02:52.600> added<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.200> but

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
to the man yes they just added that but

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.800 
to the man yes they just added that but
the<00:02:54.070> dishes<00:02:54.250> we<00:02:54.489> had<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.910> came<00:02:55.209> with<00:02:55.390> sauces

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
the dishes we had that came with sauces

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.240 
the dishes we had that came with sauces
like<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.049> chicken<00:02:56.260> mole<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.530> i<00:02:56.830> thought<00:02:57.070> was

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
like the chicken mole a i thought was

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.650 
like the chicken mole a i thought was
probably<00:02:57.519> some<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.790> best<00:02:57.850> male<00:02:58.330> sauce

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
probably some of the best male sauce

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.870 
probably some of the best male sauce
