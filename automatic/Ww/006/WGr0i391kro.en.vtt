then<00:00:11.260> we<00:00:11.619> can<00:00:11.830> start<00:00:12.100> moving<00:00:12.309> down<00:00:12.520> to<00:00:12.699> the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:13.029 
then we can start moving down to the

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:30.609 
then we can start moving down to the
lake<00:00:13.650> please<00:00:14.650> whenever<00:00:15.309> you<00:00:15.549> need

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.430 

let's<00:00:31.619> try<00:00:31.829> to<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.510> we<00:00:33.510> should<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.199> we

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
let's try to see what we should do if we

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.689 
let's try to see what we should do if we
find<00:00:34.470> ourself

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.639 

300<00:00:41.699> kilometres<00:00:42.210> north<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> Arctic

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
300 kilometres north of the Arctic

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.279 
300 kilometres north of the Arctic
Circle<00:00:44.149> we<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> lot<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> people<00:00:46.170> who

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
Circle we see a lot of people who

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.209 
Circle we see a lot of people who
believes<00:00:46.589> everything<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> trouble<00:00:49.219> you

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
believes everything is the trouble you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.910 
believes everything is the trouble you
actually<00:00:50.399> use<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.089> break<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.539> much

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
actually use the break as much

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.299 
actually use the break as much
and<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.269> same<00:00:54.510> effect<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.769> person

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and can have the same effect as a person

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.709 
and can have the same effect as a person
with<00:00:56.489> rotten<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.120> need<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.570> is

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
with rotten what you need to do is

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.759 
with rotten what you need to do is
mutual<00:00:58.199> upset<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> balance<00:00:59.460> between<00:01:00.769> front

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
mutual upset the balance between front

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:08.060 
mutual upset the balance between front
and<00:01:01.979> rear<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:04.399> by<00:01:05.399> that<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.840> can<00:01:06.920> make<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and rear and by that you can make it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.290 
and rear and by that you can make it
possible<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:09.350> spin<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.560> car<00:01:10.799> around<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.340> 0<00:01:11.520> x

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
possible to spin the car around it 0 x

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.260 
possible to spin the car around it 0 x
and<00:01:13.540> we<00:01:14.320> all<00:01:14.470> know<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:14.800> if<00:01:15.160> you<00:01:15.190> just<00:01:15.550> turn

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
and we all know that if you just turn

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.630 
and we all know that if you just turn
the<00:01:16.450> steering<00:01:16.660> wheel

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.860 

sometimes<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.910> only<00:01:25.120> thing<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.450> don't<00:01:25.600> want

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
sometimes the only thing you don't want

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.050 
sometimes the only thing you don't want
to<00:01:25.990> speak<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.310> they<00:01:27.550> are

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
to speak and they are

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.899 
to speak and they are
break<00:01:28.659> action<00:01:28.930> come<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.560> again<00:01:29.979> just<00:01:30.729> like

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
break action come in again just like

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.179 
break action come in again just like
that<00:01:31.149> you<00:01:31.299> can<00:01:31.479> extend<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.020> drift<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:32.500> at<00:01:33.040> the

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
that you can extend the drift and at the

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.760 
that you can extend the drift and at the
same<00:01:33.369> time<00:01:33.430> take<00:01:33.880> out<00:01:34.030> too<00:01:34.299> risky

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.569 

this<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.520> something<00:01:39.299> which<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.719> difficult<00:01:40.579> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
this is something which is difficult to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.539 
this is something which is difficult to
get<00:01:41.789> able<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.780> do<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.679> when<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.039> get<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.369> onto

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
get able to do but when they get it onto

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.330 
get able to do but when they get it onto
the<00:01:44.700> skin<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.659> riding<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.170> bicycle<00:01:46.350> then

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the skin just like riding a bicycle then

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.609 
the skin just like riding a bicycle then
they<00:01:47.579> realize<00:01:47.969> how<00:01:48.210> effective<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.350> great

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
they realize how effective the great

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.100 
they realize how effective the great
action<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.189> not<00:01:50.640> only<00:01:50.819> to<00:01:51.090> slow<00:01:51.299> down<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
action is not only to slow down but you

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
action is not only to slow down but you
get<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.979> drift<00:01:54.020> extended<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.490> have

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
get the drift extended so that you have

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.270 
get the drift extended so that you have
the<00:01:56.670> right<00:01:57.000> exit<00:01:57.539> of<00:01:58.020> each<00:01:58.709> for

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the right exit of each for

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.190 
the right exit of each for
which<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.490> at<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.790> end<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.180> day<00:02:02.299> where<00:02:03.170> you

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
which is at the end of the day where you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:23.360 
which is at the end of the day where you
achieve<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.830> best<00:02:04.010> lap<00:02:04.760> time

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
