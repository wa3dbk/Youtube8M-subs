 our total enjoy stable 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.959
 psychics 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.919
 which is one of the most 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.449
 however now as in all other areas 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.649
 need to drive 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.559
 in old baggage 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:37.519
 in development 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.889
 and in new samples 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.909

 no safety 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:44.540
 mechanisms 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.510

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.739
 plastic only place on 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.419
 Izhevsk plant where progress seems 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.159
 stopped the most 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.049
 here like 200 years ago automata 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.499
 will play with his hands and more and more feminine and 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.159
 because there are no new ones in this area 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.439
