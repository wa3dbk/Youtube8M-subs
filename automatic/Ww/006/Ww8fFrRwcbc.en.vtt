00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.130
 we are here again 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.559
 Let's continue the days of scott 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.530
 and today we will go to the 6th step 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.750
 this step is fundamental perhaps one of the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.600
 most important is the most important moment 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.640
 expected during the selection process 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.289
 it's a moment of the interview is the moment 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.350
 where will you have six minutes of glory 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.939
 your minutes to exactly sell the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.369
 you are 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.590
 I would like to invite you to reflect a 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.140
 Bit about that we're going 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.149
 talk from now on this moment 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 interview is very important because 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.460
 is the contact where the company evaluator 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.219
 the psychologist will often have 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.770
 a few minutes maybe even seconds 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.059
 to capture its capital essence a 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.129
 little of its history 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.500
 so he's totally smart about our 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.739
 part that we have to prepare 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.289
 before and how does this prepare us 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.699
 advance because we are going to talk there 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.699
 ahead a little more in the next 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.790
 steps on the emotional side but is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.290
 totally connected to our interview 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
 so I would like you to think about 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.460
 one thing you really would talk about 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.799
 now at that moment 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.770
 in your interview when you selected 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.360
 ask for you so introduce yourself 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.180
 say a little because you want this 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.439
 opportunity because you want the vacancy 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.000
 exactly at this moment that you 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.740
 would speak 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.869
 is very common for people to work the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.210
 people were very moved to give in 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.799
 white were very nervous 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.930
 exactly because it's a little bit lacking 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.369
 maybe of self knowledge 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.170
 It's a little while before you meet your 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.420
 story then I would like you to 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.240
 think a little about it that you 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.280
 make notes scores 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.009
 really a piece of paper from your 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.140
 story what you really want with 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.880
 that wave what you really have 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 deliver to that company 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.820
 What are your skills? 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.619
 their skills which you have already studied 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.479
 of that company so that you can 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.640
 say that you are a bit like 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.369
 her because what you really want 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.610
 to start this question maybe the company 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.230
 you since when you enroll 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.840
 perhaps what is very common for students who 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.700
 try not to know these answers 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.040
 I say that because we have a course 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.590
 more than six years than the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.780
 of banks selection and this course he is 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.170
 totally practical where our students 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.520
 will be subjected to an entire phase of 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.430
 a selective process 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.200
 for eight hours it is experiential you 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.660
 will go through all the stages of a 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.700
 selection process and the first stage soon 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.250
 at 8 o'clock in the morning is exactly the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.040
 interview where we do a series of 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.400
 questions of a personal nature 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.590
 English technical and Spanish and is 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.960
 first moment of impact where this 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.970
 future candidate often entered 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.860
 for lack of knowledge 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.250
 I would like to leave it here to 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.420
 You this moment really stop. 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.770
 write your story write 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.840
 really what are you going to say to this 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.260
 coach pretty much in front 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.140
 use the recording technique if 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.460
 watch correct your body posture 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.860
 We already talked about the previous steps. 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.050
 about the careful costume because you have 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.280
 to match your body posture your 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.810
 body speaks a lot 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.910
 I'm sure if you dedicate yourself 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.660
 a little bit a little that you are 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.760
 to dedicate 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.690
 It will be much further than its 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.580
 competition 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.830
 so I'll leave the invitation here 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.140
 Come and take a course with us . 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.600
 banks selection looks at our agenda 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.650
