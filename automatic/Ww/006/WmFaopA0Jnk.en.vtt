00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello today I bring you a little day and 

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:08.430
 cool and good it's about the links that 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.460
 they have ties on the leg this is one 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.220
 that I bought and has small bows 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.470
 but there is only the knee 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.970
 the rest is normal and that's what I do not 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.100
 like because I want one that has in 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.800
 whole leg and that's what I'm going to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.070
 do right now for that we just need 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.430
 a normal pants in my one and it 's another 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.430
 material that stretches that in my opinion 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:37.340
 it's more comfortable and good then needles 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.420
 and I have one navy blue and one 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.140
 black 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.640
 scissors preferably the cloth but 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.790
 good if not a rule 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.700
 maybe I have the chalk tailors that are 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.570
 the best because they do not stain the stain 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.970
 in your clothes and if you can get one 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.449
 fabric of the same color as your 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.940
 pants but like I do not have then 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.800
 grab an old pole that I no longer use and 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.369
 like that with dark good curtains is a 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.850
 blue navy blue I do not think I do not think 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.850
 difference a lot 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.439
 that's it and now we start 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.509
 I've finished marking the lines there are 7 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.060
 centimeters of difference between each 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.579
 and in width they have four centimeters 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.280
 all I'm measured well accurate so 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.110
 I hope I stayed all uniform and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.210
 well now we have to cut but with 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.549
 Careful if possible you can put it 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.890
 pins or safety pins so you do not 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.140
 move and remain the same size for the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.600
 two sides if to cut 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.170
 I finished doing all the cuts to 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.810
 my gin and now I just have to grab 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.229
 each of the pieces that remained and 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.240
 fold them together so that they 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.509
 form the folds of the bows for 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.460
 that looks nicer and then with the 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.869
 thread that I mentioned at the beginning 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.119
 we simply tie a normal knot to 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.990
 already after we're going to move on to 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.990
 fix that 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.690
 how they see and arm the bows and tie them 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.940
 with the thread as I told you just 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.610
 to have them a moment and then to the pole 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.379
 old man whose stable I cut him all 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.830
 the bottom part all the sewing of 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.590
 down and is this strip then 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.650
 I just put it around the thread 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.260
 that I placed earlier and here in the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.569
 backside crazy and several times to 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.310
 that resists enough and is safe 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.459
 so that he will not go out with 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.140
 any wash or thing like that and 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.819
 they stayed like this 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.510
 does not say 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.060
 success with black in the middle looks very 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.709
 nice and good I will continue to follow me 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.060
 costing a lot but it will be very 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.620
 nice the other one I do not do it yet 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.189
 but good now I teach you the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.189
 result 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.330
 or not 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.570
 no no 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.459
 i
