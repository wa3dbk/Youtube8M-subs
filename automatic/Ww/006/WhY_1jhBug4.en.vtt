00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.410
 it is not an exercise the chapel of the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.410
 Armenian soldiers stationed in 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.140
 mazar-e-sharif burns the flame of a candle 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
 caused the fire but these men 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.049
 they do not appear worried because soon 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.049
 they will go home 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.410
 we move to the sea camp wrong 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.810
 before there were deposits here 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.430
 drinking water cold stores and 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.640
 several recreation centers for 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.640
 soldiers 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.640
 this was the favorite pizzeria of the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.470
 soldiers a small culinary luxury 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.810
 in front of the troop quantity menu 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.150
 but it was demolished by flaws in the 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.100
 construction and the locals extract the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.530
 ruin iron to sell it as 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.020
 junk and make some money the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.090
 international cooperation is more intense 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.640
 that never this army helicopter 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.750
 Danish transports them together with soldiers 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.750
 British and German 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.820
 patrol flights have been reduced 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.339
 as well as the amount of helicopters 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 but these will remain in the area until 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.840
 the end then they are indispensable for 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.840
 evacuations and transportation of patients 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.250
 in the camp started long ago 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.990
 the paradigm shift the ancients 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.510
 workshops are now used to 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.970
 dismantle vehicles the trucks by 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.550
 example are scrapped and their parts 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.470
 sold in the local market take them 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.470
 back it would be too expensive 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.579
 the unimog trucks are sold up 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.579
 for $ 2,500 to local businesses 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.799
 so they have raised until today about 2 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.390
 million euros naturally only one 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.659
 small fraction of the costs 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.899
 original purchase images like these 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.310
 they will become more and more frequent 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.799
 soldiers who return home on board 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.590
 uncomfortable military aircraft rarely 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.539
 they fly in commercial aircraft not yet 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.549
 it is clear if this army base 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.149
 German will exist when the present 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.149
 year
