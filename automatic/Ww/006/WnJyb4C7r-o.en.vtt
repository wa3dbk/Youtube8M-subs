the most polluted cities in the world

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.929 
the most polluted cities in the world
and<00:00:19.470> they've<00:00:19.560> actually<00:00:19.710> managed<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.100> clean<00:00:20.789> up

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939

the air a little bit the repression I'm

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.790 
the air a little bit the repression I'm
not<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.119> sure<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.330> not<00:00:25.199> such<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> big<00:00:25.560> favor

of limiting freedom of speech myself
puras<00:00:30.330> got<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.960> contained

puras got a little bit of a contained

puras got a little bit of a contained
semi<00:00:31.710> contain<00:00:32.070> set<00:00:32.279> up<00:00:32.340> against<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.809> it's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
semi contain set up against see and it's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.720 
semi contain set up against see and it's
really<00:00:34.410> not<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.829> too<00:00:35.010> much<00:00:35.130> though<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
really not going to do too much though I

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000 
really not going to do too much though I
think<00:00:36.239> he<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.329> wants<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.780> c<00:00:37.020> 1<00:00:37.260> c<00:00:37.290> pushes<00:00:37.860> out

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
think he just wants to c 1 c pushes out

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.770 
think he just wants to c 1 c pushes out
and<00:00:38.190> make<00:00:38.489> sure<00:00:38.520> he<00:00:39.120> has<00:00:39.210> some<00:00:39.450> things<00:00:39.600> at

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and make sure he has some things at

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.030 
and make sure he has some things at
least<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.020> pick<00:00:40.200> off<00:00:40.350> straight<00:00:40.649> tanks<00:00:40.950> or

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
least to pick off straight tanks or

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.130 
least to pick off straight tanks or
something<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.940> meanwhile<00:00:42.420> pure<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.809> taking

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
something but meanwhile pure is taking

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.360 
something but meanwhile pure is taking
off<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.260> expansion<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> nine<00:00:44.070> o'clock

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
off that expansion of the nine o'clock

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.650 
off that expansion of the nine o'clock
he's<00:00:44.550> getting<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:45.000> more<00:00:45.059> gateway<00:00:45.450> stuff

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
he's getting a lot more gateway stuff

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.180 
he's getting a lot more gateway stuff
he's<00:00:45.780> got<00:00:45.809> observers<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:47.070> time

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
he's got observers up so this time

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.010 
he's got observers up so this time
playing<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:47.700> standard<00:00:48.059> game<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> safe<00:00:48.750> game

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
playing a very standard game a safe game

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.150 
playing a very standard game a safe game
I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.620> probably<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
I think that's actually probably the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
I think that's actually probably the
best<00:00:50.340> way<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> fight<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.780> being<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
best way to fight see see being a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.510 
best way to fight see see being a
standard<00:00:52.350> player<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.590> his<00:00:52.620> own<00:00:52.860> both<00:00:53.309> players

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
standard player of his own both players

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.670 
standard player of his own both players
are<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> play<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.840> macro<00:00:55.289> game<00:00:55.469> on

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
are going to play a macro game on

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.290 
are going to play a macro game on
Andromeda<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.430> neither<00:00:56.730> player<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.180> for

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
Andromeda here neither player going for

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.790 
Andromeda here neither player going for
any<00:00:57.390> kind<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.600> risky<00:00:57.870> strategies<00:00:58.350> early<00:00:58.649> off

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
any kind of risky strategies early off

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
any kind of risky strategies early off
and<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.820> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.000> turn<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> big

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and this is going to turn out to a big

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.470 
and this is going to turn out to a big
fight<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.260> end<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.910> also<00:01:02.910> fight<00:01:03.210> over

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
fight at the end and also fight over

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.260 
fight at the end and also fight over
expansions<00:01:04.049> um<00:01:04.580> towards<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> mate<00:01:05.850> mid<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
expansions um towards the mate mid and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.609 
expansions um towards the mate mid and
late<00:01:06.390> game<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.260> assume<00:01:07.439> we're

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
late game I'm going to assume we're

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.190 
late game I'm going to assume we're
going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.950> arbiters<00:01:08.400> from<00:01:08.760> sea<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.960> pure

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
going to see arbiters from sea from pure

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.830 
going to see arbiters from sea from pure
here<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:11.130> would<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> tech<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.689> he's

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
here that would be the tech that he's

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.630 
here that would be the tech that he's
most<00:01:12.990> likely<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:14.340> trying<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
most likely to go for and see trying to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.190 
most likely to go for and see trying to
get<00:01:14.729> her<00:01:14.850> ass<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.330> those<00:01:15.450> speed<00:01:15.930> upgrade

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
get her ass in with those speed upgrade

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800 
get her ass in with those speed upgrade
vultures<00:01:16.590> we're<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:16.920> gonna<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.250> anywhere

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
vultures we're not gonna get anywhere

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
vultures we're not gonna get anywhere
yeah<00:01:18.810> there's<00:01:19.080> gonna<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.380> wiped<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> C

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
yeah there's gonna get wiped there so C

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
yeah there's gonna get wiped there so C
is<00:01:23.310> gonna<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:24.689> scans<00:01:25.049> though<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.380> he's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
is gonna have scans though and he's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.570 
is gonna have scans though and he's
probably<00:01:25.619> gonna<00:01:25.770> scan<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.220> locations

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
probably gonna scan all the locations

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 
probably gonna scan all the locations
possible<00:01:27.299> he's<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> extra

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
possible he's going to know that extra

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.710 
possible he's going to know that extra
expansion<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.909> we'll

their final confrontation and whoa that
was<00:02:14.530> not<00:02:14.680> expected<00:02:15.130> pure<00:02:15.910> going<00:02:16.209> for<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
was not expected pure going for the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.320 
was not expected pure going for the
carriers<00:02:17.319> instead<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.830> arbiters

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
carriers instead of the arbiters

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.250 
carriers instead of the arbiters
interesting<00:02:19.330> pure<00:02:19.599> has<00:02:19.810> something<00:02:20.080> for

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
interesting pure has something for

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.589 
interesting pure has something for
carriers<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.830> think<00:02:21.040> he<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.700> likes<00:02:22.030> carriers

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
carriers I think he just likes carriers

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.089 
carriers I think he just likes carriers
I'm<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:22.930> sure<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.170> Andromeda<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.769> great<00:02:23.950> map

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
I'm not sure of Andromeda is a great map

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.009 
I'm not sure of Andromeda is a great map
in<00:02:24.280> fact<00:02:24.519> I'm<00:02:25.000> willing<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.360> same<00:02:25.510> drama<00:02:25.750> is

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
in fact I'm willing the same drama is

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.410 
in fact I'm willing the same drama is
not<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.290> good<00:02:26.470> map<00:02:26.680> for<00:02:27.310> carriers<00:02:27.819> if<00:02:28.060> anything

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
not a good map for carriers if anything

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.839 
not a good map for carriers if anything
a<00:02:28.599> fellow<00:02:28.900> was<00:02:29.110> good<00:02:29.319> map<00:02:29.500> Troy<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> decent

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
a fellow was good map Troy is a decent

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.759 
a fellow was good map Troy is a decent
man<00:02:31.030> for<00:02:31.360> carriers<00:02:31.630> but<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.989> drama<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.530> really

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
man for carriers but a drama to really

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.890 
man for carriers but a drama to really
does<00:02:32.980> not<00:02:33.160> have<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.519> map<00:02:33.670> artifacts<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.720> high

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
does not have the map artifacts the high

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.050 
does not have the map artifacts the high
ground<00:02:35.170> ledges<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.890> islands<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.819> able<00:02:36.910> to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
ground ledges the islands to be able to

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.550 
ground ledges the islands to be able to
protect<00:02:37.360> carriers<00:02:37.720> very<00:02:37.900> well<00:02:38.049> so<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.319> don't

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
protect carriers very well so I don't

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.259 
protect carriers very well so I don't
think<00:02:38.650> it's<00:02:38.769> going<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.010> really<00:02:39.160> work<00:02:39.370> for<00:02:39.610> pure

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
think it's going to really work for pure

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.479 
think it's going to really work for pure
frankly<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.470> think<00:02:41.860> it's<00:02:42.040> going<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.220> be<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> bit

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
frankly I think it's going to be a bit

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.630 
frankly I think it's going to be a bit
of<00:02:42.580> trouble<00:02:42.819> here<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:44.100> see<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.340> probably

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
of trouble here and see is that probably

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.070 
of trouble here and see is that probably
gonna<00:02:45.760> scan<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.030> very<00:02:46.360> soon<00:02:46.540> he's<00:02:46.750> me<00:02:46.870> about

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
gonna scan this very soon he's me about

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.740 
gonna scan this very soon he's me about
transition<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.650> think<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.040> time<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.970> client<00:02:49.660> to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
transition I think in time to client to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.820 
transition I think in time to client to
be<00:02:49.840> able<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.049> deal<00:02:50.170> with<00:02:50.319> that<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:50.650> going<00:02:50.739> to

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
be able to deal with that it's going to

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.930 
be able to deal with that it's going to
come<00:02:50.920> down<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.220> scouting<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:51.730> see

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
come down to the scouting but see

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.850 
come down to the scouting but see
scouting<00:02:52.330> is<00:02:52.420> generally<00:02:52.780> very<00:02:52.810> good<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.830> I

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
scouting is generally very good so I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.350 
scouting is generally very good so I
think<00:02:54.040> he's<00:02:54.340> been<00:02:54.580> able<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.760> spot<00:02:54.970> this<00:02:55.120> fairly

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
think he's been able to spot this fairly

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.380 
think he's been able to spot this fairly
soon<00:02:55.980> okay<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.190> oh<00:02:57.340> oh<00:02:57.370> whoa<00:02:57.760> none<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.120> us<00:02:58.269> saw

soon okay and oh oh whoa none of us saw

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.640

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
just to gain a small edge in the game

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.060 
just to gain a small edge in the game
and<00:03:16.359> see<00:03:16.870> has<00:03:17.019> drawn<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.320> first<00:03:17.590> blood<00:03:17.920> in<00:03:18.040> the

and see has drawn the first blood in the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.130 
and see has drawn the first blood in the
game<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.489> far<00:03:18.750> surprising<00:03:19.750> for<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.900> game<00:03:20.049> that's

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
game so far surprising for a game that's

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.930 
game so far surprising for a game that's
gone<00:03:20.350> this<00:03:20.470> long<00:03:20.530> but<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:20.920> first<00:03:21.160> blood<00:03:21.400> drawn

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
gone this long but the first blood drawn

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.930 
gone this long but the first blood drawn
by<00:03:22.120> sea<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:23.320> pure<00:03:23.920> has<00:03:24.130> not<00:03:24.310> not<00:03:24.489> followed<00:03:24.850> up

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
by sea and pure has not not followed up

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.759 
by sea and pure has not not followed up
with<00:03:24.970> any<00:03:25.180> kind<00:03:25.329> of<00:03:25.420> Templar<00:03:25.870> build<00:03:26.470> or

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
with any kind of Templar build or

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.590 
with any kind of Templar build or
Templar<00:03:27.459> drop<00:03:27.730> or<00:03:27.970> anything<00:03:28.180> like<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.299> so

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
Templar drop or anything like that so

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.039 
Templar drop or anything like that so
I'm<00:03:28.930> pure<00:03:29.709> well<00:03:30.549> looks<00:03:31.329> like<00:03:31.390> see<00:03:31.690> actually

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
I'm pure well looks like see actually

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.750 
I'm pure well looks like see actually
taking<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:32.739> as<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.920> signal<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.310> push<00:03:33.579> out

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
taking this as a signal to push out

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.670 
taking this as a signal to push out
actually<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.329> think<00:03:34.750> he's<00:03:34.870> probably<00:03:35.109> scanned

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
actually I think he's probably scanned

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680 
actually I think he's probably scanned
the<00:03:35.799> stargates<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:37.060> want<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.390> push<00:03:37.540> out

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
the stargates and you want to push out

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.340 
the stargates and you want to push out
before<00:03:38.260> pure<00:03:38.709> gets<00:03:39.519> those<00:03:39.640> carriers<00:03:40.120> out

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
before pure gets those carriers out

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.050 
before pure gets those carriers out
actually<00:03:41.350> seating<00:03:41.680> up<00:03:41.799> here<00:03:42.190> maybe<00:03:42.850> just

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
actually seating up here maybe just

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.330 
actually seating up here maybe just
trying<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.299> expand<00:03:43.690> his<00:03:43.720> uh<00:03:43.930> his<00:03:44.410> container

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
trying to expand his uh his container

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.650 
trying to expand his uh his container
where<00:03:45.819> it<00:03:45.880> now<00:03:46.000> it's<00:03:46.120> contained<00:03:46.420> though<00:03:46.540> his

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
where it now it's contained though his

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.449 
where it now it's contained though his
defenses<00:03:47.079> around<00:03:47.200> its<00:03:47.380> main<00:03:47.560> actually<00:03:47.980> maybe

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
defenses around its main actually maybe

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.949 
defenses around its main actually maybe
not<00:03:48.549> designed<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.030> push<00:03:49.239> out<00:03:49.389> entirely<00:03:49.720> but

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
not designed to push out entirely but

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.190 
not designed to push out entirely but
I'm<00:03:50.230> gonna<00:03:50.799> pick<00:03:51.010> off<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.310> observer<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:52.200> see

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
I'm gonna pick off that observer to see

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.289 
I'm gonna pick off that observer to see
I<00:03:53.590> mean<00:03:54.069> at<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:54.370> point<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:54.700> think<00:03:54.730> see<00:03:55.090> should

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
I mean at this point I think see should

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.789 
I mean at this point I think see should
really<00:03:55.569> just<00:03:55.720> go<00:03:55.810> for<00:03:56.049> a<00:03:56.139> frontal<00:03:56.470> attack<00:03:56.530> i

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
really just go for a frontal attack i

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.590 
really just go for a frontal attack i
think<00:03:56.829> he<00:03:57.100> is<00:03:57.130> about<00:03:57.760> enough<00:03:58.030> units<00:03:58.359> to<00:03:58.480> be

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
think he is about enough units to be

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.710 
think he is about enough units to be
able<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.840> crack<00:03:59.139> it<00:03:59.170> before<00:04:00.160> before<00:04:00.670> pure<00:04:01.540> can

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
able to crack it before before pure can

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.090 
able to crack it before before pure can
bring<00:04:01.900> up<00:04:01.989> in<00:04:02.109> a<00:04:02.200> few<00:04:02.319> minutes<00:04:02.380> otherwise<00:04:02.650> pure

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
bring up in a few minutes otherwise pure

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.440 
bring up in a few minutes otherwise pure
will<00:04:03.370> be<00:04:03.489> ahead<00:04:03.579> once<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:03.970> carrier's<00:04:04.299> come

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
will be ahead once the carrier's come

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.809 
will be ahead once the carrier's come
out<00:04:04.569> he<00:04:05.319> is<00:04:05.440> working<00:04:05.709> off<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:05.980> one<00:04:06.310> extra<00:04:06.670> base

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
out he is working off of one extra base

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.550 
out he is working off of one extra base
and<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.510> looks<00:04:07.690> like<00:04:07.750> he's<00:04:07.959> probably<00:04:08.109> put<00:04:08.500> up

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
and it looks like he's probably put up

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.440 
and it looks like he's probably put up
another<00:04:08.650> base<00:04:08.980> at<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.190> upper<00:04:09.459> left<00:04:09.699> that

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
another base at the upper left that

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.820 
another base at the upper left that
going<00:04:10.599> to<00:04:10.660> put<00:04:10.780> them<00:04:10.840> in<00:04:11.020> the<00:04:11.140> advantage<00:04:11.590> here

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
going to put them in the advantage here

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.330 
going to put them in the advantage here
against<00:04:13.050> c.c<00:04:14.050> with<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.290> dropship<00:04:14.980> actually

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
against c.c with a dropship actually

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.400 
against c.c with a dropship actually
dropping<00:04:15.640> at<00:04:15.879> the<00:04:16.060> twelve<00:04:16.720> o'clock<00:04:16.959> position

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
dropping at the twelve o'clock position

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.080 
dropping at the twelve o'clock position
interesting<00:04:18.190> position<00:04:18.579> it's<00:04:18.790> going<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:19.000> be

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
interesting position it's going to be

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.930 
interesting position it's going to be
the<00:04:19.239> last<00:04:19.419> expected<00:04:20.049> island<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.459> two<00:04:21.669> I

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
the last expected island of the two I

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.330 
the last expected island of the two I
think<00:04:22.510> I<00:04:23.110> think<00:04:23.470> pure<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.800> more<00:04:23.980> expecting

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
think I think pure is more expecting

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.190 
think I think pure is more expecting
them<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.460> take<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.730> closer<00:04:24.970> one<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.389> six<00:04:25.600> but

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
them to take the closer one to six but

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.990 
them to take the closer one to six but
see<00:04:26.620> in<00:04:26.740> fact<00:04:26.919> has<00:04:27.040> taken<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.340> 12<00:04:27.550> instead<00:04:27.850> and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000

yeah<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.470> lights<00:04:59.650> are<00:04:59.889> out<00:04:59.919> for<00:05:00.370> C<00:05:00.610> so<00:05:00.850> C<00:05:00.880> is

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
yeah the lights are out for C so C is

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.900 
yeah the lights are out for C so C is
gonna<00:05:01.570> be<00:05:01.630> able<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.370> certainly<00:05:03.370> deal<00:05:03.669> with<00:05:03.820> the

gonna be able to certainly deal with the

gonna be able to certainly deal with the
first<00:05:04.120> couple<00:05:04.360> of<00:05:04.540> clients<00:05:04.780> although<00:05:05.139> he

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
first couple of clients although he

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.840 
first couple of clients although he
really<00:05:05.860> needs<00:05:06.010> to<00:05:06.130> make<00:05:06.250> an<00:05:06.370> attack<00:05:06.580> though<00:05:06.820> I

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
really needs to make an attack though I

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.060 
really needs to make an attack though I
think<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:07.840> can't<00:05:08.080> let<00:05:08.260> pure<00:05:08.560> get<00:05:08.770> away<00:05:08.919> with

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
think you can't let pure get away with

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.610 
think you can't let pure get away with
further<00:05:09.729> expansions<00:05:10.389> because<00:05:11.080> once<00:05:11.470> the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
further expansions because once the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.659 
further expansions because once the
carrier's<00:05:11.919> reach<00:05:12.070> a<00:05:12.160> certain<00:05:12.280> limit<00:05:12.490> of

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
course the Terran player is really

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.050 
course the Terran player is really
behind<00:05:14.200> the<00:05:15.039> Terran<00:05:15.280> player<00:05:15.400> will<00:05:15.729> struggle

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
behind the Terran player will struggle

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.220 
behind the Terran player will struggle
to<00:05:16.240> take<00:05:16.630> them<00:05:16.780> down

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
to take them down

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.530 
to take them down
really<00:05:19.100> really<00:05:19.250> will<00:05:19.460> struggle<00:05:19.640> and<00:05:20.480> the

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
really really will struggle and the

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.600 
really really will struggle and the
carriers<00:05:20.990> are<00:05:21.080> out<00:05:21.260> now<00:05:21.440> so<00:05:21.770> we'll<00:05:22.430> see<00:05:22.580> if

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
carriers are out now so we'll see if

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.820 
carriers are out now so we'll see if
pure<00:05:23.210> decides<00:05:23.510> to<00:05:23.630> stay<00:05:24.020> on<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.200> defensive<00:05:24.620> or

Terran of course is good on the tactical

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.230 
Terran of course is good on the tactical
defense<00:05:48.560> of<00:05:48.890> emo<00:05:49.520> when<00:05:49.670> they're<00:05:49.790> doing<00:05:50.030> a

some of these uh some of these minds so

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.330 
some of these uh some of these minds so
that<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.320> results<00:05:57.680> can<00:05:57.800> get<00:05:57.950> in<00:05:58.040> among<00:05:58.250> the

that the results can get in among the

that the results can get in among the
tanks<00:05:58.700> all<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.180> think<00:05:59.690> pure<00:06:00.020> actually<00:06:00.410> has<00:06:00.650> not

tanks all I think pure actually has not

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.040 
tanks all I think pure actually has not
gotten<00:06:01.100> a<00:06:01.550> capacity<00:06:02.330> upgrade<00:06:02.690> for<00:06:02.900> his

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
gotten a capacity upgrade for his

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.440 
gotten a capacity upgrade for his
carriers<00:06:03.620> that's<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.460> big<00:06:04.730> mistake<00:06:04.940> if<00:06:05.270> that's

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
carriers that's a big mistake if that's

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.210 
carriers that's a big mistake if that's
true<00:06:05.660> cut<00:06:05.930> last<00:06:06.110> time<00:06:06.290> I<00:06:06.380> click<00:06:06.530> the<00:06:06.680> carrier<00:06:07.040> I

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
true cut last time I click the carrier I

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.090 
true cut last time I click the carrier I
only<00:06:07.490> had<00:06:07.700> four<00:06:08.030> interceptors<00:06:08.630> and<00:06:08.900> I<00:06:09.560> think

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
only had four interceptors and I think

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.260 
only had four interceptors and I think
