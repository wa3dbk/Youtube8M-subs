00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
put the crickets in make sure you put a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.180

it's like I was running like quarter of
it<00:02:36.590> left<00:02:36.770> now<00:02:39.700> what<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.790> recommend<00:02:41.209> doing<00:02:41.270> is

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
it left now what I recommend doing is

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.190

once<00:02:42.830> then<00:02:43.100> these<00:02:43.220> ones<00:02:43.400> start<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.790> hatch<00:02:44.200> go

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
once then these ones start to hatch go

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.060 
once then these ones start to hatch go
out<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.650> buy<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> boat<00:02:46.370> like<00:02:47.290> six<00:02:48.290> dozen<00:02:48.709> of

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070

out and buy a boat like six dozen of
female<00:02:49.790> crickets<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.330> start<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.080> one
