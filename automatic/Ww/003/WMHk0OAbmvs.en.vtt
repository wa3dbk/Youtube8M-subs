that<00:00:41.640> gyro

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
that gyro

00:00:42.330 --> 00:01:12.959 
that gyro
it's<00:00:42.960> pretty<00:00:43.260> stable<00:00:43.620> actually

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:02:13.610 

let<00:01:13.969> me<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:14.270> get<00:01:14.420> a<00:01:14.479> little<00:01:14.750> hover<00:01:15.140> of<00:01:15.350> this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.810 

well<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.840> did<00:02:17.080> not<00:02:17.230> get<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.770> real<00:02:18.160> high<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
well it did not get up real high in the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.520 
well it did not get up real high in the
sky<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.420> just<00:02:19.660> because<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.170> battery

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
sky it's just because the battery

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.500 
sky it's just because the battery
doesn't<00:02:20.770> have<00:02:21.010> enough<00:02:21.280> power<00:02:21.310> I'm<00:02:21.970> sure<00:02:22.270> it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
doesn't have enough power I'm sure it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.480 
doesn't have enough power I'm sure it
will<00:02:22.660> get<00:02:22.870> good<00:02:23.050> altitude<00:02:23.440> right<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.100> at<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
will get good altitude right here at the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.400 
will get good altitude right here at the
