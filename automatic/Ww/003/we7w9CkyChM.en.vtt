00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.970
 what's up with people catching melchingen 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.950
 back and today's comments from 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.139
 I got a little bit to my squad 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.750
 gameplay and what I've played 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.429
 with the ak 12 on octane i believe it 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.130
 was completely solo yes I think it was 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.050
 completely silent all by myself and yes 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 Here is a kemtrack with a pretty 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.560
 like scene so I think so one 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.699
 right beast fashion scene 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.160
 I think I'm kind of careful 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.260
 piece or nine pieces in a row away 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.590
 brought and indeed a splintered 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.120
 8man feed but the forest is not complete 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.469
 so to see so always have 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.210
 one after the other what is true then it was 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.370
 even a five man is still missing 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.960
 so eight people then nine people then 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.250
 definitely gotten away right one way 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 cool scene and yes I found the know 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.750
 she actually pretty easy game 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.239
 yes octane you do not see too often 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.460
 and I thought to myself namely the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.280
 gameplay times is twelve but well 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.690
 But what do a good weapon ak 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.750
 12 and hanno pÃ¶schl are so far 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.850
 actually my favorite weapons never 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.170
 better and I do not know which 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.699
 I actually prefer to play weapons 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.129
 I think I play games 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.409
 both arms pretty much alike 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.240
 so always pretty balanced ones 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.000
 weapons in the game as ak 2 was anni 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.000
 berger and her as I said said 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.310
 fought quite the latest trick bit tricky 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.299
 but the fans do not have more 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.250
 used at the end so I have 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.189
 forgot to insert that because I'm here 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.409
 namely let me kill I 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.909
 then I went to double 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.650
 I think I had the first camp 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.390
 We had about 100 ruling points 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.430
 also substances have somehow 290 or too 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.470
 100 won as we had just kind of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.240
 the whole match over double cab and 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.159
 then had quite a few points 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.570
 so domination points and that's why 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.280
 I did not think so 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.079
 more is enough I think 7 before double cam 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.700
 the game was over and then had 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.049
 I still forget my camp 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.909
 strike 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.990
 one to the spezi bundestrainer me 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.729
 I took a long time to believe 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.490
 kind of such a minute thirty or something 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.200
 biting to him later was bonus and then 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.600
 Sometime this came to mo 10 calm the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.430
 new people away probably one definitely 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.049
 stark scene 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.650
 and yes, I have already so many times 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.450
 in ghost in mine 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.250
 shocked so I want to know 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.660
 now, somehow, so now 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.430
 I really want to go next week 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.110
 necessarily have the kemal I have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.180
 I like it so often I like it 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.440
 think about ten to 15 times have 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.690
 I really like the way here now 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.850
 seven kills the goods sometimes even 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.310
 In any case, be closer then 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.110
 had died always on the verge of once 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.780
 i for example of warcraft it was no 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.400
 real double field but worse 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.650
 faster fields threw red with the mt 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.140
 iks build on the way then had 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.110
 30 ruling point 21.00 pictures of one 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.650
 you could blow away around the corner 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.060
 do nothing 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.130
 It also takes a lot of time 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.860
 had for the double cam and me 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.450
 I always try it that way if it works that way 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.370
 80 herthas point I always try so 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.330
 first can stalk and then 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.800
 I always try that way 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.380
 double to go and if just a good one 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.450
 map comes as for example strikes or so go there 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.620
 I always wake up when the game is over 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.959
 I start trying my core city 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.780
 reach pretty quickly and then 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.580
 He's still going to double up so far 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.870
 just really like it all the time 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.700
 but I really try it that way 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.420
 next week really ne came to it 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.489
 earn 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.380
 the first can track will stop 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.640
 says Marlies trick and faster 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.340
 the second question I will then 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.910
 probably for a long time 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.890
 need 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.130
 then I do not always care for myself 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.540
 time for the double would come one 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.580
 again for today's comments I have 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.160
 time here so far only about a double 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.230
 fights keeps talking so to speak I hope 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.790
 the gameplay failed if so then 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.989
 Can you give a positive evaluation of the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.220
 leave a nice comment 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.650
 I am always happy to write 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.540
 over it and then almost as I said 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.170
 from me and then I always say look 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.170
 until next time 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.060
 Euro
