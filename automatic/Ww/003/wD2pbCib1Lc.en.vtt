Havana this Maps called Havana and this
map<00:00:53.640> usually<00:00:54.059> pans<00:00:54.449> out<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> same<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.140> try

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
map usually pans out the same way I try

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.180 
map usually pans out the same way I try
to<00:00:56.000> UM<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.930> same<00:00:58.109> way<00:00:58.289> whichever<00:00:58.680> game<00:00:58.949> typer

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190

whatever I do on this man but I'd say
the<00:01:01.379> most<00:01:01.530> important<00:01:01.980> spot<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.850> keep<00:01:03.539> your

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.929 
the most important spot is to keep your
spawn<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.830> spawning<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.460> where<00:01:05.760> my

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
thing like it especially this is

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.979 
thing like it especially this is
domination<00:02:08.429> getting<00:02:08.789> kills<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.360> holding<00:02:09.720> to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
domination getting kills and holding to

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.449 
domination getting kills and holding to
domination<00:02:10.349> points<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:11.039> now<00:02:11.069> killing
