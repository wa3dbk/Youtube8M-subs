00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hi all guys here start 117 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.779
 welcome this new video as you did 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.760
 for the previous chapter of 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.370
 battlefield intends to bring you back the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.710
 guides to joint weapons pollutes and one of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.020
 they will explain how it works 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.820
 the features are missing something 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 that makes it special or something that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.500
 makes a shit and what accessories are i 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.880
 best for various specific weapons 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.199
 but unlike the season 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.810
 previous on battlefield 3 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.550
 let's call it this way I'll do all the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.410
 main weapons available kind the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.450
 game or at least all those 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.890
 noteworthy so let's not get lost in 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.420
 chat we go to see the weapon of 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.040
 today the first weapon I decided to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.989
 bring you as you have already read from 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.489
 titolo is a weapon that I define with 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.780
 a plus this is because a 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.820
 set of factors we're going to see 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.860
 that as a whole that it really is 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.079
 great mouth of fire from which to shoot 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.760
 and to the main feature of 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.829
 be unlockable at low levels 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.020
 in fact it is only the fourth at the lock 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.699
 third if we do not consider the weapon that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.170
 you will already have at the beginning for the class 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.500
 doctor assault as I preferred 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.600
 calling is in fact already starting shortly 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.460
 to play this chapter of the series 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.560
 you can have a really good weapon with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.400
 to break through your friends declares but 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.860
 I'm talking 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 simple of sar 21 but now let's go to 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 see the characteristics of this weapon 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.920
 as always I will not show you one 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.020
 set of data numbers written on paper 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 for the fire ray 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.799
 the distance to which becker the blows there 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.610
 they want the data because they really don't 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.220
 I don't care 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.840
 I prefer to talk about the experience 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.400
 done with such weapons however I have the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.200
 accessories that I got to try 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.850
 because we are honest, I am in battles 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.170
 he starts to think but if I catch him in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 that point there maybe enough 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.299
 damage to knock him out of semi things then 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.159
 I find it completely useless therefore 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.049
 let's start immediately seeing the recoil 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.790
 of the weapon no longer having mine 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.740
 beautiful but for which I did the texts a 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.570
 very clean wall all look for a while 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.399
 around and there is the polygon let's use it 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.990
 I hope maybe to find a location 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.619
 better but for the moment it goes more than 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.360
 well 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.490
 besides the text the recoil on the contrary 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.170
 of the previous season I did it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.570
 only with the basic weapon without the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.490
 accessories because this battlefield i 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.350
 its accessory there is a graph that you 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.540
 explains how it will affect the weapon 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.429
 will improve recoil accuracy on 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.560
 focused fire so it seemed useless 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.080
 do it because I could not like him 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.310
 hard and the invoice 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.950
 which did really well at stake 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.330
 therefore let us be satisfied 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.130
 or better be satisfied with that 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.990
 simply with the basic weapon is already 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.520
 there as you can see this is a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.320
 key factor in this weapon or if the 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.060
 recoil is very low 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.970
 if really a very soft recoil 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.380
 how rare dramas without aiming will be 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.850
 the situation got a little worse but it is 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.980
 normal because they will have to balance but 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.690
 even though he wasn't too strong but aiming 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.330
 which in my opinion should always be 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.970
 do with weapons and assault rifles in short 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.260
 it's really great and this is the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.880
 feature that leads me to prefer 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.710
 this rare many others that will be 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.930
 much more accentuated already without 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.940
 the use of a football and also will be 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.490
 also excellent for shooting down targets 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.410
 100 150 meters without problems because 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.640
 however doing targeted bursts vi 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.920
 I assure you that you can hit 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.970
 quietly such targets for what 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.830
 covers all other features 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.570
 of this weapon I must admit that it is not there 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.120
 really nothing noteworthy because 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.680
 however 30 loaders charge to a crime 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.720
 which is nothing exceptional 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.060
 normal to a damage that it too is 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.890
 equal in installments, however, are factors that 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.120
 put together with the little recoil then 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.820
 to the stability of the renault weapon 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.019
 this weapon is excellent then these only 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.610
 in my opinion 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.720
 but if you approve of it, I think many 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.160
 of you will agree with me 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.140
 especially if they got to 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.730
 try 90 percent of the others 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.530
 assault rifles half of which are 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.330
 usable as regards instead 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.489
 the negative aspects of this weapon it 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.870
 can only find one you are the 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.940
 fact that it will not be possible to set 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.920
 the rate of fire in gusts ie a 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.090
 three strokes however not and it is that much a 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.670
 problem because however putting 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.440
 the automatic continuing to press you 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.600
 the trigger is good or bad to do thuraya 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.730
 burst of three and four strokes anyway 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.340
 this in my opinion remains the best way 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.190
 to be able to shoot because it decreases to 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.959
 run ass that is already attenuated e 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.370
 in the same way they can be done 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.170
 more precise targeted bursts than 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.790
 straining at random talking instead 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.830
 of accessories in my opinion the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.140
 winning combination provides a viewfinder 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.810
 optical without zoom as laser reflex o 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.790
 coyote an ergonomic handle that 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.410
 will still increase accuracy and a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.790
 silencer for not having you called in 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.799
 in case you are in enemy territory 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.780
 having said that this is all that 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.250
 you had to know about this weapon now 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.299
 you can also be a serial 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.400
 professional killer is ok no jokes a 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.810
 part this is my opinion this is 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.639
 the way I use this copper is 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.349
 the one with which 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.939
 I found myself better afterwards 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.150
 have tried several different ones 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:32.409
 combinations and what I will propose to you 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.060
 if you want you are free to leave it 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.889
 he comments letting me know instead 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.870
 you have used this weapon as vi 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.639
 you are found and how you use it 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.900
 Having said this, I greet you and see you 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.900
 to the next video, hello everyone
