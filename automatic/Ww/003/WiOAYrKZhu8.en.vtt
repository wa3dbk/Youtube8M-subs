alarm clock setting and let me go ahead

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.589 
alarm clock setting and let me go ahead

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and set the alarm clock so you can see

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:45.459 
and set the alarm clock so you can see
that<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.900> works

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.259 

so<00:00:46.039> you<00:00:46.100> can<00:00:46.340> toggle<00:00:46.670> between<00:00:46.879> these

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
so you can toggle between these

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:48.819 
so you can toggle between these
different<00:00:47.629> modes<00:00:47.809> by<00:00:48.050> holding<00:00:48.410> them<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.620> left

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
different modes by holding them the left

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.170 
different modes by holding them the left
trigger<00:00:49.100> let<00:00:49.550> me<00:00:49.610> go<00:00:49.699> ahead<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:49.850> play<00:00:50.059> the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
trigger let me go ahead and play the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.520 
trigger let me go ahead and play the
game

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.860 

so<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:58.190> play<00:00:58.430> as<00:00:58.580> Hulk<00:00:58.820> Hogan<00:00:59.210> on<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.630> left

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
so you play as Hulk Hogan on the left

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.340 
so you play as Hulk Hogan on the left
and<00:01:00.200> I'm<00:01:00.650> not<00:01:00.800> sure<00:01:00.950> who<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.370> opponents<00:01:01.910> are

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
and I'm not sure who the opponents are

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.610 
and I'm not sure who the opponents are
but<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.650> controls<00:01:04.070> are<00:01:04.370> like<00:01:04.730> this<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:05.690> the

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
but the controls are like this so the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.740 
but the controls are like this so the
middle<00:01:06.860> button<00:01:07.160> does<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.640> kick<00:01:08.060> just<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.420> regular

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
middle button does a kick just a regular

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.380 
middle button does a kick just a regular
kick<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.740> right<00:01:09.950> button<00:01:10.340> gets<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.030> guy<00:01:11.150> in<00:01:11.300> a

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
kick the right button gets the guy in a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.540 
kick the right button gets the guy in a
hold<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.810> if<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:12.380> kick<00:01:12.650> after<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.190> it<00:01:13.400> does

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
hold and if you kick after that it does

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.500 
hold and if you kick after that it does
a<00:01:13.580> new<00:01:14.030> lift<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:15.430> if<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.610> get<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.240> guy<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:17.450> a

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
a new lift and if you get the guy in a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.510 
a new lift and if you get the guy in a
hold<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:17.960> then<00:01:18.050> you<00:01:18.140> hit<00:01:18.290> left<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:19.370> can

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
hold and then you hit left you can

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.340 
hold and then you hit left you can
actually<00:01:19.670> jump<00:01:20.060> off<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.450> turnbuckle<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:21.140> do

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
actually jump off the turnbuckle and do

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.390 
actually jump off the turnbuckle and do
a<00:01:21.380> splash<00:01:21.710> on<00:01:22.010> them<00:01:22.160> so<00:01:22.310> that's<00:01:22.400> pretty<00:01:22.670> sweet

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
a splash on them so that's pretty sweet

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.770 
a splash on them so that's pretty sweet
just<00:01:25.400> gotta<00:01:25.580> time<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:25.880> right<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.360> timing<00:01:26.720> is

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
just gotta time it right the timing is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.830 
just gotta time it right the timing is
kind<00:01:26.900> of<00:01:26.990> difficult<00:01:31.300> and<00:01:32.300> that's<00:01:32.570> pretty<00:01:32.720> much

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
kind of difficult and that's pretty much

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.410 
kind of difficult and that's pretty much
it<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.500> opponent's<00:01:34.130> they<00:01:34.970> increase<00:01:35.390> in

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
it the opponent's they increase in

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.370 
it the opponent's they increase in
difficulty<00:01:35.990> just<00:01:36.530> crazy<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:39.050> first

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
difficulty just crazy so the first

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.320 
difficulty just crazy so the first
couple<00:01:39.590> bosses<00:01:40.100> obviously<00:01:40.670> are<00:01:40.759> pretty<00:01:41.090> easy

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
couple bosses obviously are pretty easy

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.600
