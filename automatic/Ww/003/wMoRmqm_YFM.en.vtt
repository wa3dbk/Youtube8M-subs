00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.960
 Now myths as they are is next 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.459
 understand it better today on the day of 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.360
 today I bring you a video with which 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:11.370
 we will be able to know how is your view 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.590
 currently what a good perception 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.700
 they have the colors 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.289
 Then he wants to know how it is done 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.289
 what is involved in this video 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.000
 two 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.430
 and let's start this video to be compatible 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.869
 both for them and for what is 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.489
 android then any of you what 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.100
 they will be able to use with applications 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.510
 that do very similar functions like 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.400
 he told them at the beginning what he does 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.340
 this application is to know how good 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.199
 perception you have in your eyes or what 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.449
 they are fine you can differentiate the 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.660
 different colors that we can see 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.920
 around us around 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.120
 mainly then to do this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.340
 an application is very simple 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.920
 totally free view if you have a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.089
 iphone ipod touch or ipad you are simply going 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.890
 to find this application that is 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.930
 appearing on their screens that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.489
 llama there are sites of all I do not know if you 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.870
 I leave the name for you to look for it and what 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.180
 des wants to be as he says 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.820
 totally free and very good is a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.640
 excellent option to be able to use 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 is this way to do this test in 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 what is android or if you have android 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.400
 we are going to look for this application that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.930
 flame stick to simply write what 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.820
 so look for this application should be 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.280
 totally free 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.479
 is exactly or is at least very 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.690
 similar to what we have in ios 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 then do not worry basically the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.380
 same function once you already have 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.600
 downloaded and doing android i am what 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.710
 what you are going to do is open the application 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.320
 once opening the application 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.790
 you will be able to see what is the interface of 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.340
 the application as you can see the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.720
 interface this is how it must be very 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.460
 similar to what is on android in the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.160
 which simply to use it we are going to 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.960
 give the play button and to start 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.820
 to run what is this kind of test 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.470
 in which you have to select your 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.570
 color that is different from all the others 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.460
 squares obviously at first is 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.140
 much easier but that about going 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.020
 going on it's going to be a bit complicated 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.149
 more everything depends that we are in sight 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.640
 have you going to see the different 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.470
 types if you sell select one that 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.149
 it's not going to let you go to what 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.979
 is the next level between work 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.140
 get stuck there you can wait 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.690
 until you find the little box that is 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.160
 the one that really is very different as 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.410
 you can see it all I'm moving 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.330
 there are about 30 seconds left and 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.090
 final is what is this application gives you 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.560
 what is a range that depending on the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.599
 range in which you are 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.060
 to see how good a view you have or what 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.930
 So bad views on gas depending on these 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.810
 results as you can see I have already 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.810
 24 points and I keep going 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.100
 It is then seen as the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.510
 current 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.510
 achievement 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.320
 as you can see this time I had 29 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.150
 in my best record of 30 and if we see what 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.580
 that is the game up here you have a 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.950
 advanced view range 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.110
 makes you believe a little better in which it says 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.600
 that if you come from 0 to 15 you have a 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.000
 very poor view if you have 16 to 20 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.550
 you have a very view what is a view 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.980
 weak this is between 21 and 30 that you 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.590
 that I have you have normal eyes and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.830
 if you are going to have more than 30 points you have 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.850
 a view supposedly of eagle 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.470
 so then you're afraid that you'll prove it 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.850
 try and not let me forget 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.620
 down in the comments what was your 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.510
 result in your highest record you've ever 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.150
 got in what is this game this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.800
 good eyesight test friends is your vote 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.910
 for this video I also remember to send 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.470
 The application is very similar 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.910
 then they will be able to use if they saw 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.260
 this video will be able to use it without 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.690
 no problem in what is android 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.070
 for this is the applause its flame there 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.840
 sites we are here the name appears 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.540
