00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
consistency is not what consistency

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
result but I think by now you hopefully

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.639 
result but I think by now you hopefully
trust<00:00:49.440> me<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.710> these<00:00:49.800> are<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.250> in

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
in and that went in okay obviously I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.140 
in and that went in okay obviously I
gave<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.710> guys<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.920> completely<00:01:08.820> different

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
gave you guys a completely different

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.300 
gave you guys a completely different
look<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.900> those<00:01:10.049> three<00:01:10.409> swings<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.010> first

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
look on those three swings the first

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.370 
look on those three swings the first
swing<00:01:11.640> was<00:01:11.909> pretty<00:01:12.210> much<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.659> traditional

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
swing was pretty much my traditional

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.070 
swing was pretty much my traditional
standard<00:01:13.920> forehand<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.240> second<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.810> was

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
standard forehand the second one was

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.620 
standard forehand the second one was
obviously<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:17.180> off-balance<00:01:18.180> kind<00:01:18.509> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
obviously a really off-balance kind of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.260 
obviously a really off-balance kind of
shaky<00:01:19.110> looking<00:01:19.439> stroke<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.759> third<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
shaky looking stroke and the third one I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.020 
shaky looking stroke and the third one I
just<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.229> played<00:01:22.470> around<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.100> cross

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
just kind of played around with a cross

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.560 
just kind of played around with a cross
step<00:01:24.479> stance<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.409> little<00:01:25.560> uncomfortable<00:01:26.570> you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
step stance a little uncomfortable you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.539 
step stance a little uncomfortable you
know<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.840> all<00:01:27.990> three<00:01:28.259> went<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.520> I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549

hear around the club a lot is hey Brady
I<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.369> consistent<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.420> made<00:01:33.630> all

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I was consistent because I made all

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.429 
I was consistent because I made all
three<00:01:34.079> shots<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> coach<00:01:36.049> you<00:01:37.049> know<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.259> I

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
three shots and as a coach you know if I

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.640 
three shots and as a coach you know if I
see<00:01:37.829> somebody<00:01:38.280> producing<00:01:39.240> three<00:01:39.780> completely

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
see somebody producing three completely

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.819 
see somebody producing three completely
different<00:01:40.880> looking<00:01:41.880> swings<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.930> different

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
different looking swings or different

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.850 
different looking swings or different
balanced<00:01:44.540> different<00:01:45.540> follow<00:01:45.810> throughs<00:01:46.259> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
balanced different follow throughs that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.670 
balanced different follow throughs that
is<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.310> consistency<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> want

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
is not consistency to me so what I want

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.490 
is not consistency to me so what I want
us<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> start<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.399> latch<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.450> terms<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
us to start to latch on to in terms of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.639 
us to start to latch on to in terms of
consistency<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:54.259> producing<00:01:55.259> similar

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
consistency is producing similar

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.179 
consistency is producing similar
footwork<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:57.030> all<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.390> our<00:01:57.509> shots<00:01:58.189> producing

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
footwork for all of our shots producing

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.940 
footwork for all of our shots producing
similar<00:01:59.790> balance<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.750> our<00:02:01.020> setup<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.740> all<00:02:01.829> of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
similar balance in our setup for all of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.510 
similar balance in our setup for all of
our<00:02:02.040> shots

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
our shots

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.230 
our shots
hopefully<00:02:03.420> producing<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.110> very<00:02:04.500> consistent

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
hopefully producing a very consistent

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.990 
hopefully producing a very consistent
backswing<00:02:06.590> into<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.220> we've<00:02:08.729> talked

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
backswing into you know as we've talked

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.570

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
of the the modern forehand fall

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.240

similar-looking swing every time you
know<00:03:59.910> I<00:03:59.940> think<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.570> will<00:04:01.140> get<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.620> results<00:04:02.070> I

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
know I think I will get the results I

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.880 
know I think I will get the results I
want<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.580> terms<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:03.000> making<00:04:03.269> shots<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.080> like<00:04:04.769> I

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
want in terms of making shots and like I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.190 
want in terms of making shots and like I
said<00:04:05.130> before<00:04:05.280> those<00:04:06.209> three<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.600> just<00:04:06.930> aimed

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
said before those three I just aimed

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.590 
said before those three I just aimed
high<00:04:07.620> over<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:07.980> net<00:04:08.070> close<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.360> middle

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
high over the net close to the middle

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.770 
high over the net close to the middle
it's<00:04:10.320> going<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.560> be<00:04:10.680> very<00:04:11.010> tough<00:04:11.340> for<00:04:11.610> me<00:04:11.790> if<00:04:12.090> I

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
it's going to be very tough for me if I

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.860 
it's going to be very tough for me if I
can<00:04:13.019> produce<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.769> type<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.190> look<00:04:15.060> back<00:04:15.360> here

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
can produce that type of look back here

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.949 
can produce that type of look back here
with<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> conservative<00:04:17.190> target<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:18.359> miss<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.690> lot

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
with a conservative target to miss a lot

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.630 
with a conservative target to miss a lot
of<00:04:19.109> balls<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.440> would<00:04:19.530> be<00:04:19.650> very<00:04:20.040> hard<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.549> I

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
of balls it would be very hard and I

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.370 
of balls it would be very hard and I
think<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:21.000> would<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.239> hard<00:04:21.479> down<00:04:21.840> all<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.260> way

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
think it would be hard down all the way

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.610 
think it would be hard down all the way
at<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.530> 300<00:04:23.100> level<00:04:23.539> not<00:04:24.539> to<00:04:24.840> produce<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.380> lot<00:04:25.590> of

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
at the 300 level not to produce a lot of

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.620 
at the 300 level not to produce a lot of
good<00:04:25.860> shots<00:04:26.160> near<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.640> center<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.090> court

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
good shots near the center of the court

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.570 
good shots near the center of the court
if<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:28.230> guys<00:04:28.350> can<00:04:28.650> latch<00:04:28.860> on<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.400> idea

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
if you guys can latch on to that idea

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.690 
if you guys can latch on to that idea

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
the seven shot rule in terms of kind of

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.470 
the seven shot rule in terms of kind of
designing<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.470> point<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:38.340> be<00:04:38.370> consistent<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.240> go

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
designing a point to be consistent so go

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.660 
designing a point to be consistent so go
ahead<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:39.750> check<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.200> out<00:04:40.260> check<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.520> out

thinking about getting the shot in the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.920 
thinking about getting the shot in the
court<00:04:51.980> because<00:04:52.980> it<00:04:53.160> clouds<00:04:53.550> us<00:04:53.910> from<00:04:54.540> trying

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930
