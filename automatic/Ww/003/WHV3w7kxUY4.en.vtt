 following the recommendations of the commission of scientists 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.500
 the situation with ready-made restaurant food 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.659
 most serious but management is not 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.580

 commissions and he speaks slow 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.189
 gradual change and because 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.920
 radical steps in his opinion not 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:31.469
 will work this play mode in the area you 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 forgot nothing will come of several 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.399
 reasons firstly consumers are used to 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.170
 to the salty taste of food 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.359
 so if we cut it right away 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.009
 salt content at 30 percent of what we 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.740
 in the end we want consumers say 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.380
 taste just terrified from cts cable 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.659
 Americans consume an average of almost three 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.729
 and a half thousand milligrams of sodium in 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.399

 should consume more than a thousand 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.200
 milligrams per day in the center think that 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.990

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.510
 a teaspoon of salt per day that is about 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.000
 2300 milligrams 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.599

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.959
 salt overdue aviation cavaliers ball it 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.790
 preventive measure 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.620

 health experts in this area consider 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.459
 that excess salt intake 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.500
 problems mainly developed countries 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.170
 but as the inhabitants of the developing 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.180

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.299
 partnership between individuals 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.400
