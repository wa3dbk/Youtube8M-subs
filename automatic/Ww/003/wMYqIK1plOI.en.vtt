00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.080
 the goals could follow the same 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.880
 unlucky titan path both 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.010
 productions have more than one element in 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.480
 common and beyond the fact of being titles 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.520
 practically dedicated only to the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.809
 online multiplayer have arrived on 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.480
 market with a quantity really 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.280
 narrow of tar content for rock though 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.530
 unlike what was done by respon 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.449
 entertainment has not wasted time and after 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.860
 not even two months after his release 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.540
 creature is already ready to flood the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.090
 digital stores with new monsters 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.379
 hunters maps and features with the 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.239
 pre order the vault was possible 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.160
 in fact, grab an exclusive monster 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.870
 a lava colossus free of charge e 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.430
 stone in whose face angola jat 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.350
 he seemed to be a frail one 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.879
 little lamb in case you were not there 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.860
 take care to buy the game with 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.539
 well in advance by taking the master pac 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.950
 know that the creature will be 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.170
 also available with the next of 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.530
 having sold for about 15 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.149
 EUR 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.039
 together with him they will also arrive 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.130
 the observer mode four new hunters 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.090
 and two completely new maps 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.440
 But let's focus on what a 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.330
 all the effects is the true heart 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.520
 one gigantic package button 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.350
 monster that you can impersonate and with the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.549
 which disintegrate everything you do 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.049
 lays on your path 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.760
 the balance didn't seem to be there yet 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.710
 perfectly to the point when we have 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.990
 tried the bebop and during ours 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.490
 session without major problems our 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.229
 won about eighty percent of the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.299
 times with the defeats caused 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.189
 obviously from inexperience and imprudence 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.750
 once he took the hand with the beast 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.820
 however, things have gone very well 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.710
 otherwise so as to make us win one 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.210
 extraction game for 5 to 0 without 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.860
 too much difficulty 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.350
 possible that the demo therefore does not have 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.610
 weak points fortunately he only knows 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.680
 that manages to mitigate them much more 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.689
 easily compared to his colleagues on 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.000
 demo is our heaviest chunky 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.829
 slow ever appeared on evolve and for this 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.770
 reason his movement skills are 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.700
 reduced enough to be completely 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.290
 unable to skip this 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.729
 could at first sight be a huge one 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.200
 obstacle but what cannot be 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.150
 exceeded in flight can safely 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.620
 being crushed under our weight 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.450
 then emerges that our new friend 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.100
 he can roll himself up 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.989
 exactly as an armadillo would do 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.970
 will start sliding down the slopes 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.110
 acquiring gradually more and more inertia e 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.820
 speed 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.560
 needless to say that in combat this 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.820
 capacity can be exploited both for 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.220
 escape the traps of hunters 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.930
 both to attack them directly 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.189
 rolled inflicts a good 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.230
 relative of damage and can be 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.879
 easily linked with an attack 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.709
 milito or with one of the other four 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.689
 new unpublished skills 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.250
 the first of this is called feature e 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.810
 it causes flames to erupt from the ground 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.849
 they proceed in a straight line from the hands of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.950
 vermouth after he slammed them 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.420
 violently to the ground done to train a 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.969
 whatever is on the trajectory 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.650
 a double for mac and therefore who can 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.540
 easily interrupt beam treatments 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.519
 of doctors or shields of the support 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.260
 however, shortening distances is not 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.150
 very easy in combat 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.950
 and here then that with the tony g will be 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.930
 possible to target a single target 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.030
 and project it directly towards the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.680
 jaws of the creature often killing her 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.750
 at the stroke in case it was 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.400
 of simple fauna that this monster is 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.169
 a further evolution of the design of the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.480
 goal hyatt emerges from his ability to 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.400
 distance a fireball to hurl 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.349
 far exactly as the creature does 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.120
 biped those rocks with the difference 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.189
 but this time it has less damage 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.719
 direct on the impact but to generate al 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.400
 at the same time of exclusive mines for 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.540
 damage hunters and create 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.189
 safe areas 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.780
 the demo at a damage output 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.549
 particularly high 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.109
 and despite this, even the largest 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.699
 energy and armor by putting it 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.919
 definitely on the podium of the monsters in 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:40.750
 terms of danger in the unfortunate 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.579
 in which case a hunter were able to 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.590
 we keep checked and stationed 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.449
 in the high areas of the real single map 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.430
 problem for the demos we will always be able to 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.139
 create a giant rock wall either 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.669
 to use as a natural shield or for 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.199
 to trap isolate from the group a 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.699
 lone hunter 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.439
 we tried the well known in the two 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.150
 new maps made available 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.949
 broken hill mines and the jugs of 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.359
 foundry both obviously with 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.530
 mechanics related to the mode 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.970
 evacuation 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.680
 in the first in case of victory of the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.239
 hunters will appear as drones 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.919
 they will activate automatic shields 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.599
 while in case of victory of the monster 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.939
 some birds will appear in a manner 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.109
 random for the setting 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.909
 disorienting hunters and pushing them 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.470
 to move away from the creature there 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.150
 second map instead provides for the 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.829
 victory of the hunters an upgrade 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.960
 to the jet pack while in case of defeat 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.580
 of gas will come out of the finishes of the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.349
 ground enhancing the attacks of the 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.449
 monsters brooklyn mine is probably 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.039
 the most interesting of the two uniforms 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.659
 in three different areas with elements 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.370
 destructible that can be 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.500
 used both to open new routes and 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.000
 speed up the movements of the monster o 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.039
 also simply to send out 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.419
 street of the hunters maps anyway 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.289
 especially like that 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.330
 they will arrive in a manner 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.309
 the first contents are completely free 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.749
 for vol they are certainly appreciable 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.819
 seen that they represent without a doubt 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:50.889
 some a valid reason to return to 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.749
 game server during this first and 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.879
 fleeting proof we have noticed however one 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.979
 imbalance for the demo maybe too much 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.629
 powerful than the other monsters one 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.699
 more detailed test at the next 31 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.349
 March among indispensable to evaluate the 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.789
 all knowingly and 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.800
 especially to find out if the new 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.389
 monster will prove to be equally powerful 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.710
 against all the old players 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.710
 we are already sharpening our fangs
