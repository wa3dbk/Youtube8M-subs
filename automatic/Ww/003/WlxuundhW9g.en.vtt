00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.950
 In 2011 russ quaner got the first ones 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.259
 professional power saws with new motors 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.779
 technology and automatic carburettor 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.369
 meanwhile have to enter the market 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.570
 These features also in the middle class 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.019
 retracted 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.679
 these include the 550 xp and the something 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.660
 bigger 555 we have the blessing 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.930
 in practice and on the test bench 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.930
 tested 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 the 550 xp is considered professional 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.629
 Thinning saw designed the 555 as 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.969
 universal saw for the semi 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.250
 professional use 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.879
 both blessings are with a manual one 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.519
 fuel pump for the cold start 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.839
 equipped the starting behavior at 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.839
 cold engine was good 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.159
 the 550 xp did not jump with warm engine 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.930
 Always right at the beginning of a compression 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.890
 Sven Thiel reduces the effort required 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.890
 when starting 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.710
 the start stop switch is now jumping 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.290
 after turning off the saw by itself 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.940
 back to the start position a little 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.400
 There is improvement when refueling 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.140
 the level in the gas tank can be 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.140
 now see through a window 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.600
 both blessings are with the electronic 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.119
 carburetor regulation auction equipped 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.310
 the system compensates for soiled 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.060
 Air filter as well as heights and weather 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 differences 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.479
 a manual carburettor setting is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.479
 no longer necessary 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.650
 the extra engine technology is reduced 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.250
 the emissions according to the current 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.250
 emission guidelines 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.330
 when relieving the red bulls 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.400
 technology for a short-term 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.530
 performance boost to increase the chains 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.020
 speed this technique remains 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.020
 but the 550 xp reserved 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.680
 The 555 can do it with a 10 higher 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.240
 motor performance come up 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.220
 besides, this saw has a stronger one 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.410
 handle this pipe from above all 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.410
 users with big hands 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.099
 which we tested 550 xp brought 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.860
 at times not the full engine power 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.989
 after a software update and swaps 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.730
 the breather was the problem though 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.720
 Fixed 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.180
 you even have to deal with these new ones 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.980
 devices for error analysis and for 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.670
 Gasification are one setting 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.670
 visit workshop 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.950
 both blessings worked very strong 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.820
 and got good grades for the handling 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.820
 and the maintenance 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.850
 The air filter is easy 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.230
 remove and clean it soiled 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.230
 in our test only a little 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.270
 the nuts are on the ceiling 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.270
 secured against losing 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.180
 the oil pump for the chain lubrication 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.180
 can be adjusted according to need 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.290
 the low web system absorbs 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.769
 vibrations and already so the hands of the 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.769
 Berliner 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.729
 both blessing was with 38 cm long 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.470
 seemed to be equipped during 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.919
 our test noticeably strong 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.919
 worn 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.879
 the chain is now over from the side 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:42.409
 a screw in the lid cocked that 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.409
 complicates the installation of the track 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.450
 the detailed practical test of the two 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.220
 Power saws read in issue 9 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.220
 2013 of the advanced farmer
