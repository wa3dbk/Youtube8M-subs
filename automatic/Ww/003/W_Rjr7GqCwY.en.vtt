mostly<00:00:32.790> hands<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> beat<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.450> little<00:00:33.540> bit<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
mostly hands to beat a little bit of

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.750 
mostly hands to beat a little bit of
foot<00:00:34.500> involved<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.130> there<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> kind<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
foot involved in there just to kind of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.250 
foot involved in there just to kind of
break<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:35.970> up<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.270> bit<00:00:36.300> now

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
break it up a bit now

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.560 
break it up a bit now
if<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.340> wanted<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> get<00:00:38.880> hand<00:00:39.149> speed<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
if you wanted to get hand speed on the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.209 
if you wanted to get hand speed on the
kit<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.260> could<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.829> this

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.190 

the<00:00:49.219> problem<00:00:49.670> isn't<00:00:49.940> your<00:00:50.270> hands<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.809> problem

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
the problem isn't your hands the problem

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.630 
the problem isn't your hands the problem
isn't<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.649> drums<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.129> problem<00:00:52.399> is<00:00:52.489> your

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
isn't the drums the problem is your

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.490 
isn't the drums the problem is your
brain<00:00:52.850> your<00:00:53.180> brain<00:00:53.270> gets<00:00:53.570> bored<00:00:53.960> doing<00:00:54.350> that

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
brain your brain gets bored doing that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.930 
brain your brain gets bored doing that
so<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:54.980> need<00:00:55.160> something<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.550> little<00:00:55.910> more

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
so you need something a little more

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.790 
so you need something a little more
creative<00:00:56.270> than<00:00:56.720> just<00:00:56.930> straight-up<00:00:57.230> singles

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
creative than just straight-up singles

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.590 
creative than just straight-up singles
or<00:00:57.949> doubles<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.699> need<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.879> pattern<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.510> be

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
or doubles you need a pattern to be

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.180 
or doubles you need a pattern to be
moved<00:00:59.809> around<00:01:00.110> like<00:01:00.410> I<00:01:00.590> said<00:01:00.769> bring<00:01:01.010> in<00:01:01.129> a

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
moved around like I said bring in a

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.189 
moved around like I said bring in a
little<00:01:01.370> foot<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.820> break<00:01:02.030> up<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.269> monotony<00:01:02.390> so

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
little foot to break up the monotony so

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.600 
little foot to break up the monotony so
this<00:01:03.350> one's<00:01:03.500> really<00:01:03.710> simple<00:01:04.009> it's<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.220> three

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
this one's really simple it's in three

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.490 
this one's really simple it's in three
four<00:01:04.909> now<00:01:05.119> when<00:01:05.300> you<00:01:05.449> hear<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.780> by<00:01:05.990> itself<00:01:06.290> it

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
four now when you hear it by itself it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.560 
four now when you hear it by itself it
is<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.920> bit<00:01:07.159> confusing<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.030> way<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.300> break

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
is a bit confusing so the way to break

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.930 
is a bit confusing so the way to break
it<00:01:08.690> down<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:09.080> four<00:01:09.470> notes<00:01:09.740> at<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:09.920> time<00:01:10.009> so<00:01:10.700> it's

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
it down is four notes at a time so it's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.790 
it down is four notes at a time so it's
in<00:01:11.060> three<00:01:11.300> four<00:01:11.570> that<00:01:11.720> means<00:01:11.869> one-e-and-a

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
in three four that means one-e-and-a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.070 
in three four that means one-e-and-a
two-e-and-a<00:01:13.580> three-e-and-a<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:14.899> that's

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
two-e-and-a three-e-and-a so that's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.590 
two-e-and-a three-e-and-a so that's
three<00:01:15.590> groups<00:01:15.979> of<00:01:16.190> four<00:01:16.250> notes<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.240> instead<00:01:17.479> of

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
three groups of four notes so instead of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.200 
three groups of four notes so instead of
thinking<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.140> as<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:24.670> which<00:01:25.670> is<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.850> lot<00:01:26.090> to

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
thinking of it as this which is a lot to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.590 
thinking of it as this which is a lot to
take<00:01:26.360> in

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
take in

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.090 
take in
think<00:01:26.929> of<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.110> four<00:01:27.320> notes<00:01:27.530> at<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.679> time<00:01:27.710> what

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
think of it four notes at a time what

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.400 
think of it four notes at a time what
are<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.250> first<00:01:28.490> four<00:01:28.670> notes<00:01:31.869> cool<00:01:32.869> you<00:01:33.380> are

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
are the first four notes cool you are

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.260 
are the first four notes cool you are
done<00:01:33.710> with<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:33.950> first<00:01:34.100> four<00:01:34.340> notes<00:01:34.520> second

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
done with the first four notes second

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.320 
done with the first four notes second
four<00:01:35.450> note<00:01:38.679> last<00:01:39.679> four<00:01:40.009> notes<00:01:42.970> so<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.060> have

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
four note last four notes so you have

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.899 
four note last four notes so you have
right<00:01:44.690> left<00:01:44.899> right<00:01:45.320> left<00:01:45.530> right<00:01:46.100> left<00:01:46.310> right

right left right left right left right
left<00:01:47.119> kick<00:01:47.899> right<00:01:48.080> left<00:01:48.679> kick<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:49.280> then<00:01:49.490> it

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
left kick right left kick and then it

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.190 
left kick right left kick and then it
starts<00:01:49.880> over<00:01:50.000> I'm<00:01:50.390> going<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.810> do<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.050> and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
starts over I'm going to do it and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.870 
starts over I'm going to do it and
instead<00:01:51.440> of<00:01:51.560> stringing<00:01:52.069> it<00:01:52.190> together<00:01:52.520> like

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
instead of stringing it together like

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.520 
instead of stringing it together like
solid<00:01:53.209> sixteenth<00:01:53.630> notes<00:01:53.869> I'm<00:01:54.200> going<00:01:54.319> to<00:01:54.380> do<00:01:54.440> it

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
solid sixteenth notes I'm going to do it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.690 
solid sixteenth notes I'm going to do it
four<00:01:54.739> notes<00:01:54.920> at<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.069> time<00:01:55.099> and<00:01:55.429> give<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:55.640> a

four notes at a time and give it a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.339 
four notes at a time and give it a
quarter<00:01:55.940> note<00:01:56.179> rest<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.840> can<00:01:56.989> get<00:01:57.110> used<00:01:57.229> to

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
quarter note rest so you can get used to

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:36.000 
quarter note rest so you can get used to
it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.990 

all<00:02:37.010> right<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.280> let's<00:02:37.430> speed<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.670> up<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.910> little

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
all right so let's speed it up a little

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.699 
all right so let's speed it up a little
