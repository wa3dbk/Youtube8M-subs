with an unknown level and this basically

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.639 
with an unknown level and this basically
means<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.309> stats<00:00:53.579> aren't<00:00:53.850> affected<00:00:54.270> at<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.510> by

means it stats aren't affected at all by

means it stats aren't affected at all by
default<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.800> need<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.070> equip<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> weapon<00:00:56.820> to

default you need to equip the weapon to
identify<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:57.989> degradation

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
identify it and then this degradation

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.069 
identify it and then this degradation
will<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.010> an<00:00:59.129> effect<00:00:59.870> unfortunately<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
will have an effect unfortunately and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.599 
will have an effect unfortunately and
one<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.379> our<00:01:01.469> pet<00:01:01.710> peeves<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> mod<00:01:02.430> is

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
one of our pet peeves with the mod is

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.950 
one of our pet peeves with the mod is
that<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.820> can't<00:01:03.030> clearly<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.449> an<00:01:03.660> items

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
that you can't clearly see an items

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.109 
that you can't clearly see an items
current<00:01:04.320> level<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.589> durability<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.850> some

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
current level of durability for some

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.820 
current level of durability for some
this<00:01:06.299> will<00:01:06.360> mean<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.900> challenging<00:01:07.140> system

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
this will mean a more challenging system

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.929 
this will mean a more challenging system
where<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.340> look<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> weapons

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
where they have to look at a weapons

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
where they have to look at a weapons
value<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.540> stats<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.170> how<00:01:10.290> badly<00:01:10.500> it's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
value or stats to see how badly it's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.240 
value or stats to see how badly it's
damaged

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
damaged

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.770 
damaged
and<00:01:11.400> it'll<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.360> you're<00:01:12.600> actually

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and it'll be as if you're actually

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.570 
and it'll be as if you're actually
evaluating<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> weapons<00:01:13.979> condition<00:01:14.430> for

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
evaluating the weapons condition for

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.940 
evaluating the weapons condition for
yourselves<00:01:14.960> whereas<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.200> others<00:01:16.470> it'll<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
yourselves whereas for others it'll be a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.679 
yourselves whereas for others it'll be a
bit<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.310> nuisance<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.299> think<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.630> would

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
bit of a nuisance so we think it would

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.120 
bit of a nuisance so we think it would
be<00:01:18.750> nice<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:19.380> included<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.009> an

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
be nice if that was included as an

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520 
be nice if that was included as an
optional<00:01:20.490> feature<00:01:20.700> both<00:01:21.659> weapons<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.290> armor

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
optional feature both weapons and armor

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
optional feature both weapons and armor
will<00:01:22.680> also<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.130> affected<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.700> various<00:01:24.060> ways

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
will also be affected in various ways

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.719 
will also be affected in various ways
including<00:01:25.020> degradation<00:01:25.380> by<00:01:25.830> time<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
including degradation by time so the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.070 
including degradation by time so the
longer<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> weapon<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.900> more

scenarios into account so for weapons

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.469 
scenarios into account so for weapons
things<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.130> power<00:01:35.340> attacks<00:01:35.700> blocking<00:01:36.299> the

things like power attacks blocking the

generally<00:01:40.680> speaking<00:01:40.710> hitting<00:01:41.430> an<00:01:41.549> enemy<00:01:41.670> with

generally speaking hitting an enemy with

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
generally speaking hitting an enemy with
a<00:01:42.030> lighter<00:01:42.329> iron<00:01:42.720> sword<00:01:43.020> will<00:01:43.229> cause<00:01:43.439> more

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
a lighter iron sword will cause more

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.249 
a lighter iron sword will cause more
damage<00:01:44.009> than<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> heavy<00:01:44.490> ebony<00:01:44.909> sword<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:46.020> same

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
damage than a heavy ebony sword the same

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.440 
damage than a heavy ebony sword the same
specifics<00:01:46.829> are<00:01:46.950> also<00:01:47.070> applied<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> armors<00:01:47.970> so

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
specifics are also applied to armors so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.789 
specifics are also applied to armors so
if<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> hit<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> power<00:01:49.200> attack<00:01:49.530> then

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
if you hit with a power attack then

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.490 
if you hit with a power attack then
they'll<00:01:49.950> degrade<00:01:50.280> faster<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
they'll degrade faster and so on so the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.929 
they'll degrade faster and so on so the
changes<00:01:52.890> should<00:01:53.009> also<00:01:53.220> affect<00:01:53.670> how<00:01:53.790> you

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
changes should also affect how you

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
changes should also affect how you
handle<00:01:54.329> yourself<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.720> combat<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.290> you'll

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
handle yourself in combat and you'll

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.230 
handle yourself in combat and you'll
have<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.009> even<00:01:56.280> more<00:01:56.430> careful<00:01:56.490> about<00:01:57.000> being

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
have to be even more careful about being

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.819 
have to be even more careful about being
hit<00:01:57.479> which<00:01:58.020> works<00:01:58.259> great<00:01:58.560> alongside

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
hit which works great alongside

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.280 
hit which works great alongside
something<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.490> ultimate<00:01:59.880> combat<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.450> lot<00:02:01.170> of

feature<00:02:55.280> helps<00:02:55.580> partially<00:02:56.120> fix<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.260> for

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
feature helps partially fix it so for

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
your inventory at the same time then

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.970 
your inventory at the same time then
you'll<00:03:02.570> have<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.870> either<00:03:02.990> drop<00:03:03.260> one<00:03:03.530> or<00:03:03.800> keep

the rest of them as unidentified

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.030 
the rest of them as unidentified
which<00:03:05.840> we<00:03:06.050> think<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.350> perfectly<00:03:06.830> reasonable

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
which we think is a perfectly reasonable

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.130 
which we think is a perfectly reasonable
workaround<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.030> issue<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.480> that's

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
workaround to the issue and that's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.480 
workaround to the issue and that's
everything<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.709> need<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:09.980> know<00:03:10.010> about<00:03:10.220> the
