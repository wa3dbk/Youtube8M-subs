it

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.210 

well<00:03:28.020> we<00:03:28.110> kind<00:03:28.319> of<00:03:28.379> do<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:28.709> rules<00:03:29.010> and

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
well we kind of do have rules and

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.960 
well we kind of do have rules and
regulations<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.739> its<00:03:31.739> more<00:03:31.980> common<00:03:32.010> this

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
regulations but it its more common this

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.400 
regulations but it its more common this
year<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:33.239> think<00:03:33.450> there's<00:03:33.569> more<00:03:33.690> teams<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.290> it's

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
year I think there's more teams so it's

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.470 
year I think there's more teams so it's
more<00:03:34.560> common<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:35.129> think<00:03:35.940> after<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.300> seas

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
more common I think after the seas

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.030 
more common I think after the seas
