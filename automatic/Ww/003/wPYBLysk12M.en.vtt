00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.720 

let's<00:00:05.720> look<00:00:05.900> at<00:00:06.050> calculating<00:00:06.730> magnification

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.730 
let's look at calculating magnification

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.120 
let's look at calculating magnification
let's<00:00:08.630> say<00:00:08.809> we've<00:00:08.960> got<00:00:08.990> our<00:00:09.320> photo<00:00:09.620> here<00:00:10.010> with

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
let's say we've got our photo here with

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.259 
let's say we've got our photo here with
our<00:00:10.280> specimen<00:00:10.790> I<00:00:10.970> pick<00:00:11.870> the<00:00:12.050> specimen<00:00:12.620> here

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269 
our specimen I pick the specimen here

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.000 
our specimen I pick the specimen here
and<00:00:14.269> we<00:00:14.390> draw<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.600> specimen<00:00:15.200> and<00:00:15.380> we<00:00:15.710> want<00:00:15.890> to

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
and we draw the specimen and we want to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.980 
and we draw the specimen and we want to
know<00:00:16.160> how<00:00:16.520> many<00:00:16.610> times<00:00:17.000> has<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:17.390> specimen

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
know how many times has the specimen

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.909 
know how many times has the specimen
been<00:00:18.260> magnified<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:19.099> this<00:00:19.369> joy<00:00:20.590> so<00:00:21.590> first<00:00:21.800> of

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
been magnified and this joy so first of

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.230 
been magnified and this joy so first of
all<00:00:22.009> let's<00:00:22.189> look<00:00:22.279> at<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.579> equation<00:00:22.730> for

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
all let's look at the equation for

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.380 
all let's look at the equation for
magnification<00:00:24.160> magnification<00:00:25.160> is<00:00:25.880> equal<00:00:26.239> to

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
magnification magnification is equal to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.889 
magnification magnification is equal to
the<00:00:26.779> size<00:00:27.050> of<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.800> drawing<00:00:31.029> so<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.180> size<00:00:32.509> of

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
the size of the drawing so the size of

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:42.040 
the size of the drawing so the size of
the<00:00:33.050> specimen<00:00:33.560> and<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:41.059> we<00:00:41.570> need<00:00:41.719> to<00:00:41.840> take<00:00:42.019> a

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
the specimen and so we need to take a

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.590 
the specimen and so we need to take a
measurement<00:00:42.260> now<00:00:43.219> we<00:00:43.760> need<00:00:43.879> to<00:00:44.030> take<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.390> same

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
measurement now we need to take the same

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.270 
measurement now we need to take the same
measurement<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.170> both<00:00:45.350> we<00:00:45.739> can<00:00:45.890> either<00:00:46.010> go

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
measurement in both we can either go

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.009 
measurement in both we can either go
with<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.820> length<00:00:47.030> of<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.329> cell<00:00:47.539> or<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.870> width

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
with the length of the cell or the width

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.119 
with the length of the cell or the width
I<00:00:48.289> have<00:00:48.710> taken<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.129> length<00:00:50.679> and<00:00:51.679> so<00:00:51.859> I<00:00:51.920> measure

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
I have taken the length and so I measure

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.099 
I have taken the length and so I measure
myself<00:00:52.339> from<00:00:53.059> top<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.329> bottom<00:00:53.480> in<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:53.870> drawing

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
myself from top to bottom in the drawing

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.680 
myself from top to bottom in the drawing
and<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.530> find<00:00:54.769> it<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.010> be<00:00:55.039> 100<00:00:55.910> millimeters<00:00:58.690> then

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
and I find it to be 100 millimeters then

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.419 
and I find it to be 100 millimeters then
I<00:00:59.719> need<00:00:59.899> to<00:01:00.050> take<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.350> same<00:01:00.530> measurements<00:01:01.190> the

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
I need to take the same measurements the

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.770 
I need to take the same measurements the
length<00:01:01.699> of<00:01:01.999> myself<00:01:02.629> in<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.769> photo<00:01:04.690> so<00:01:05.690> the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
length of myself in the photo so the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.550 
length of myself in the photo so the
actual<00:01:06.200> specimen<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:08.410> I<00:01:09.410> do<00:01:09.980> this<00:01:10.990> as<00:01:11.990> such<00:01:12.230> I

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
actual specimen and I do this as such I

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.560 
actual specimen and I do this as such I
see<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.460> there's<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.700> scale<00:01:13.970> bar<00:01:14.150> here<00:01:14.390> I

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
see that there's a scale bar here I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.050 
see that there's a scale bar here I
measure<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.230> scale<00:01:15.470> bar<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.340> equivalent<00:01:16.910> to

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
measure the scale bar so equivalent to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.330 
measure the scale bar so equivalent to
one<00:01:17.210> centimeter<00:01:17.630> all<00:01:18.440> this<00:01:18.800> means<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.310> that

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
one centimeter all this means is that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.310 
one centimeter all this means is that
one<00:01:19.700> centimeter<00:01:20.270> on<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:20.540> photo<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:21.080> actually

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
one centimeter on this photo is actually

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.120 
one centimeter on this photo is actually
equal<00:01:21.980> to<00:01:22.040> one<00:01:22.580> micrometer<00:01:23.210> in<00:01:23.630> real<00:01:23.840> life<00:01:24.130> so

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
equal to one micrometer in real life so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.860 
equal to one micrometer in real life so
if<00:01:25.190> I<00:01:25.280> measure<00:01:25.460> my<00:01:25.700> cell<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:26.270> find<00:01:26.510> it<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.660> be

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
if I measure my cell and I find it to be

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.330 
if I measure my cell and I find it to be
2<00:01:27.080> centimeters<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:30.080> actual<00:01:30.530> length<00:01:30.740> will<00:01:31.160> be

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
2 centimeters the actual length will be

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.130 
2 centimeters the actual length will be
2<00:01:32.320> micrometers<00:01:33.700> because<00:01:34.700> 1<00:01:35.510> micrometer<00:01:35.930> is

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
2 micrometers because 1 micrometer is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.650 
2 micrometers because 1 micrometer is
equal<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.440> one<00:01:36.590> centimeter<00:01:36.980> every<00:01:37.370> had<00:01:38.180> 1

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
equal to one centimeter every had 1

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.450 
equal to one centimeter every had 1
micrometer<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.380> equivalent<00:01:39.980> to<00:01:40.010> naught<00:01:40.310> comma

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
micrometer is equivalent to naught comma

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.910 
micrometer is equivalent to naught comma
9<00:01:40.700> centimeters<00:01:41.330> all<00:01:41.540> we<00:01:41.720> do<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:42.320> take<00:01:42.590> our<00:01:42.770> 2

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
9 centimeters all we do is take our 2

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.310 
9 centimeters all we do is take our 2
centimeters<00:01:43.550> divided<00:01:44.330> by<00:01:44.510> na<00:01:44.660> Clementine<00:01:45.080> and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
centimeters divided by na Clementine and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.390 
centimeters divided by na Clementine and
we'd<00:01:45.740> get<00:01:45.920> our<00:01:46.010> answers<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:46.610> micrometers<00:01:46.970> so

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
we'd get our answers in micrometers so

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.030 
we'd get our answers in micrometers so
now<00:01:49.400> we've<00:01:49.580> got<00:01:49.760> our<00:01:49.940> values<00:01:50.330> both<00:01:50.930> values<00:01:51.380> but

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
now we've got our values both values but

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.740 
now we've got our values both values but
we<00:01:52.190> need<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:52.490> be<00:01:52.610> really<00:01:52.820> careful<00:01:53.000> because<00:01:53.210> our

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
we need to be really careful because our

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.800 
we need to be really careful because our
values<00:01:54.140> don't<00:01:54.890> have<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.220> same<00:01:55.400> units<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:56.060> if

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
values don't have the same units and if

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.470 
values don't have the same units and if
we<00:01:57.260> were<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.440> substitute<00:01:57.710> them<00:01:58.340> as<00:01:58.490> they<00:01:59.450> are

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
we were to substitute them as they are

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.540 
we were to substitute them as they are
just<00:01:59.810> now<00:01:59.990> into<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.590> equation<00:02:00.950> we'd<00:02:01.130> get<00:02:01.400> a

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
just now into the equation we'd get a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.440 
just now into the equation we'd get a
wrong<00:02:01.970> number

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
wrong number

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.990 
wrong number
so<00:02:03.290> what<00:02:03.500> we<00:02:03.590> do<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:03.950> need<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:04.370> convert<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:04.910> of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
so what we do is need to convert one of

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.810 
so what we do is need to convert one of
them<00:02:05.150> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
them is

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.180 
them is
like<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.330> thousand<00:02:06.720> times<00:02:06.930> bigger<00:02:07.200> than<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
like a thousand times bigger than a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.760 
like a thousand times bigger than a
micrometer<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.869> what<00:02:09.990> we<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.380> we<00:02:10.500> times

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
micrometer and so what we do is we times

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:19.750 
micrometer and so what we do is we times
it<00:02:10.979> by<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.700> thousand<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.220> get<00:02:16.610> 100,000

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.340 

micrometers<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:22.220> now<00:02:23.220> both<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.700> our<00:02:24.350> values

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
micrometers so now both of our values

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.930 
micrometers so now both of our values
have<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.560> same<00:02:25.620> units<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.459> can<00:02:26.610> put<00:02:26.790> them

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
have the same units and we can put them

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.570 
have the same units and we can put them
into<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.300> equation<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:28.500> magnification<00:02:29.459> is

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
into the equation but magnification is

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.670 
into the equation but magnification is
equal<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:31.940> 100,000<00:02:33.080> over<00:02:34.080> two<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.959> we<00:02:36.959> get<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
equal to 100,000 over two and we get the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.170 
equal to 100,000 over two and we get the
magnification<00:02:38.550> as<00:02:39.560> 50,000<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.820> so<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> means

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
magnification as 50,000 and so it means

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.070 
magnification as 50,000 and so it means
that<00:02:43.100> specimen<00:02:44.100> has<00:02:44.640> been<00:02:44.670> magnified<00:02:45.360> fifty

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
that specimen has been magnified fifty

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.580 
that specimen has been magnified fifty
thousand<00:02:46.560> times<00:02:46.770> in<00:02:47.250> our<00:02:47.400> drawing<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:49.440> can

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
thousand times in our drawing we can

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.520 
thousand times in our drawing we can
also<00:02:49.770> use<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.580> equation<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:52.050> calculate<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
also use this equation to calculate the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.350 
also use this equation to calculate the
size<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> specimen<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.910> let's<00:02:54.060> say<00:02:54.239> we

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
size of the specimen so let's say we

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.910 
size of the specimen so let's say we
have<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.630> size<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.020> drawing<00:02:55.260> we've

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
have the size of the drawing we've

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.770 
have the size of the drawing we've
calculated<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
calculated that and we have the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.020 
calculated that and we have the
magnification<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:59.400> now<00:02:59.550> we<00:02:59.610> want<00:02:59.910> to<00:02:59.970> know

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
magnification but now we want to know

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.330 
magnification but now we want to know
why<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.570> actual<00:03:00.930> size<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.890> specimen

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
why is the actual size of the specimen

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.410 
why is the actual size of the specimen
so<00:03:02.730> all<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.280> we<00:03:05.280> take<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.910> size<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
so all we do is we take the size of the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.240 
so all we do is we take the size of the
drawing

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:21.699 

/<00:03:14.900> magnification<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.879> that<00:03:17.879> will<00:03:18.360> give<00:03:18.569> us

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.670 

the<00:03:22.709> size<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.189> specimen
