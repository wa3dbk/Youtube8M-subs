 and then you can become an investigator 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.229
 Question one that you do not know yet so how would you 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.429
 You and your life describe for people who have never heard of you 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.810
 have heard or know you 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.460
 He can easily take care of Lohrs, I'm extraordinary 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.670
 quality 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.069
 One day the local very short answer to one was dense 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:02.919
 in the crowd that I would have liked as a newcomer still rest yes 

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:06.720
 Please Mr. Reimann Konya must also be an orderly or a little bit off 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.740
 yes that does not know me that is obviously unlikely because not 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.980
 all people know me yes 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.420
 I emigrated six years ago 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.360
 Choice is not quite right I just give the location because 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.720
 the life that i have in Texas i have also been running germany only he 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.180
 in Germany I have noticed that sometimes illegal 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.090
 What percentage of that one can do what it is you have made illegal here 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.580
 since then but that she starts at the top of Mosley but who joins 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.580
 American August knows who knows what means natural 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.840
 with her then wanted the previous building codes 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.359
 Merkel there are also ways to twitch but that's one too 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.900
 By the way, another story in the so-called is my next book 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.980
 your first book is called the customer run away that's another 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.320
 History that's another story exactly 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.530
 who you are at the moment also on Germany tour he until now also at 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.860
 He is very close to us in the dance world 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.470
 now there is a copy and he also left or will appear if that is in 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.050
 the height is sent it already appeared the day before yesterday 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.420
 how do you prepare yourself so go ahead what wants to introduce Konya 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.579
 it also athletic fit 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.110
 but also of Durchschlag the bit for ordered is of course quite simple 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.610
 I do not prepare myself there but I leave everything on me 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.930
 Come on horseradish comma I've been here the second day before 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.120
 three years ago three grapes has been in Offenbach says Rossi in 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.689
 the cloud 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.440
 He has been exactly short interim markets with Lane 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.780
 how far away is he right now at that on Connys Island 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.130
 yes he could Iceland we have a web page there you can always 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.650
 descendant the hot and Konya because there come 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.460
 right there is the state of the company quite up to date one updates that 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.400
 Whenever block daughter you can also see 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.629
 and how the tower goes on at the moment 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.180
 The house as such is almost I would have said terraces outside Antony 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.949
 addition point for Lena 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.599
 and the sound now has two floors Unkrich again two floors 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.820
 Good to come back to watch your tour 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.440
 the already the wholesaler photo just gives the way you are and he reads 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.469
 from his book 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.269
 or introduce people to your life in Texas 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.559
 Years on the tour I have to say the only thing I do not think so 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.879
 It is prepared that I give the old things through again 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:08.380
 read 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.310
 because investigators I read from the book but I already have script 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.019
 Advance Shimbun few stories 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.799
 and mostly when I see orders and then the audience 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.139
 then I decide anyway anyway what I mean it so so out of the 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.779
 Head out with what or think but that's always the case with people 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.100
 I think so because of that 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.530
 how would you describe your success also explained by Wustrow 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.049
 are 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.549
 that you are to you so you're still neither won out of that back then that won 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.299
 Nest to Texas you can do that today just as much as before 8 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.449
 we still hear just as nonsense as usual 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.369
 and I believe in success 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:48.169
 It's just because I stayed like that I always think I'm mine 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.479
 obstructs success or whatever has gone upside down with that 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.539
 of course, as before 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.839
 would have been ten years 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:04:00.369
 and to be the GEMA for many people around me, I'm a bit of a role model because of that 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.239
 the troupe may have dreamed of emigrating or 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.899
 to do something else and we now see that it is indeed possible 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:10.369
 You do not necessarily have to have any of this one he knows people 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.529
 On the other hand, such a simple craftsman has overseas 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:17.289
 and he has also led Getrag, I think in any case 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.889
 you're a bit pissed off heating plumber lake that's not 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.539
 thoroughly i am a skilled mechanical engineer i am probably close to 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.889
 Unions and forestry he wants and of course you will never get very good 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.889
 Training and can be as practical in the whole world contrary 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.970
 we or something to find is where in those 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.680
 US Army What you would say I like being there but that's it 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.070
 what not then what would have to find something which is easier yes what sure 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.710
 if it is one for itself sometimes 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.419
 For example, Ribot has the effect that the newspaper does not exist 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.320
 some things 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.129
 and unfortunately only with other ingredients and these 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.870
 just do not taste anymore 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.800
 but by and large I have to say a sexton and two percent one 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.810
 In the Dallas or Piedmont area, you're really all that to Harman Picture It 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.169
 there is nothing to nothing, "does not complain 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.139
 what do you miss him not him except Germany or said that so 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.569
 Lucky that you yourself that is not in the hustle and bustle on the highway 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.840
 for example, when I just drove up and the recklessness so that 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.530
 I miss practice 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.760
 Hauke ​​did not suspect that that's not there are really the cops 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.470
 the stricter that always see that there are zero 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.350
 Larissa Hoppe Hauer like that or the cops tarnish that's the kindest thing to follow 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.509
 that you can imagine 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:29.289
 madness 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.629
 So they are very very nice, courteous and very polite friendly 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:37.259
 but seriously create a wrong word or a wrong hand of Mercuria 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.680
 IMF and IMG goes shopping it did not take long to get one 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.750
 already be careful that it out or who always stand behind one Anna 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:46.919
 bottom out and we have the one hand on the gun or mean one 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.330
 probably not with you 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.229
 that's what got me the hand on the gun so bad is that 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.620
 not but I mean you have to think 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.770
 The must assume that the universal in the glove box has as 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.580
 we are cautious but they have such an authority of dull 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.020
 no one is doing anything because you do not have Iran 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.850
 the common ones do not even think about it you can be so easy here 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.210
 no, what the hell, what's that? 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.560
 So of course there's the authority that's the end of Schurter 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.169
 of the 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.660
 Policemen that you can talk to people here l clearly everything 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.770
 You can make out something like that over there walls like you have a repudiation 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.100
 your heart or bad Kerpen 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.880
 have you ever experienced something or something is now part of ours? 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.639
 You have to be able to watch so if you are on the highway 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.110
 his vehicle or Roger Beck drives a lot then you can see that from time to time 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.050
 keep that to the right but stands though one of them next to 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.630
 now Bohème dive light or west 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.480
 and the police are doing so that comes to the question before the question as well 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.360
 not for long myself had had nothing to do with the police as such in the 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.160
 On the contrary, the childish experience and always a very small event 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.860
 have made fashion made long narrow lane of the 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.080
 the keeper in front of more is bent 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.979
 I drove on the highway in the Hermann the cameraman head of 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.800
 GbR's right stop the lamp again without having to stop again 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.040
 because ridden in Stennweiler also complied 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.550
 because when I combed back on this highway and on the hectic 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.360
 Policeman Covers are the one you guests to that you usually can not 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.240
 notice 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.409
 at the Saar me and tell black Peter Pan the page 8 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:20.139
 all the sailors Nazar Ahari what the he noticed this winter he should 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.529
 Drilling has asked me if Enwezor is coming to Ulrich 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:23.719
 Koke
