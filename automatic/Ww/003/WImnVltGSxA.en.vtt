00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 but nice and hello to a new one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:12.929
 Video from our video series lie 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:14.849
 So today streak is angle 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.590
 actually that was just fine that poverty 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.650
 want to teach if the and research 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.210
 and half orphans because then is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.390
 Just wave it and wave 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.260
 teach and I say first lot 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.260
 fun with the media 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.460
 if the dog winkewinke teach 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.129
 want it is beneficial if the dog 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.579
 already 25 can and you do with it 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.219
 yours and just the exercise hifi and 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.869
 but you do not let your dog to yours 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.699
 handbag keep it that way a bit 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:06.890
 away because only then yes as is called the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.390
 because shovels or so and he is 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.399
 he says simply wink wave 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.520
 and the sign of it is natural 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:16.729
 no longer advancing this normal hifi 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.729
 but just doing so or and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.080
 then just wave a wave and you can 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.300
 but you continue to make distances 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.979
 and we can see the that makes 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.000
 already very good 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.350
 that's a bit over there, of course 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.750
 I do not think so 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.659
 That's why it 's still a favorite trick 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.770
 practice a little bit and yes, then be waving 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.119
 wave also quickly taught and this 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.119
 bildchen do for you in the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:01.120
 the one with my low is a video too 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:03.250
 I'll go next time I think 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.940
 In any case, I still have to 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.700
 never done and it has to start 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.080
 to teach the new tricks 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.640

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.640
