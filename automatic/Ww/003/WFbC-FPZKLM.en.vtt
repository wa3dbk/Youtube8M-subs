with<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:45.440> mindset<00:00:45.830> we<00:00:46.250> came<00:00:46.489> into<00:00:46.640> this

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
with that mindset we came into this

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.580 
with that mindset we came into this
thing<00:00:47.000> let<00:00:47.210> us<00:00:47.239> go<00:00:47.570> out<00:00:47.600> start<00:00:48.020> out<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.200> small

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
thing let us go out start out a small

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.430 
thing let us go out start out a small
motor<00:00:48.950> which<00:00:49.489> is<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:49.700> four-cylinder<00:00:50.450> vs.<00:00:51.110> v8

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
motor which is a four-cylinder vs. v8

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.950 
motor which is a four-cylinder vs. v8
and<00:00:51.820> it's<00:00:52.820> going<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.090> have<00:00:53.239> inherently<00:00:53.720> less

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
and it's going to have inherently less

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.600 
and it's going to have inherently less
Parker's<00:00:54.379> are<00:00:54.530> smaller<00:00:54.830> but<00:00:55.070> we<00:00:55.250> can<00:00:55.400> put<00:00:55.580> more

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
Parker's are smaller but we can put more

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.020 
Parker's are smaller but we can put more
technology<00:00:56.480> back<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:57.020> get<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.470> work

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
technology back and get to work

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.450 
technology back and get to work
it<00:00:59.030> matches<00:00:59.480> something<00:01:00.170> like<00:01:00.830> a<00:01:00.980> car<00:01:01.220> that<00:01:01.250> you

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
it matches something like a car that you

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.980 
it matches something like a car that you
can<00:01:01.610> buy<00:01:01.760> today<00:01:03.640> on<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.790> outside<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.720> max

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990

where our changes began we've changed
started<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:15.979> changed<00:01:16.250> everything<00:01:16.640> we<00:01:16.759> went

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
started to changed everything we went

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.050 
started to changed everything we went
twenty<00:01:17.240> inches<00:01:17.479> narrower<00:01:17.860> we<00:01:18.860> add<00:01:19.070> we<00:01:19.640> added<00:01:19.970> a

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
twenty inches narrower we add we added a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.940 
twenty inches narrower we add we added a
14-inch<00:01:20.660> distance<00:01:21.350> here<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.710> get<00:01:21.830> the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
14-inch distance here to get the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.850 
14-inch distance here to get the

we<00:01:25.220> made<00:01:25.399> all<00:01:25.640> lexan<00:01:26.090> windows<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.630> stuff<00:01:26.780> for

we made all lexan windows and stuff for

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.990 
we made all lexan windows and stuff for
it<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.380> blocked<00:01:27.920> off<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.399> doors<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:28.880> you

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
it and blocked off the doors so you

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.460 
it and blocked off the doors so you
don't<00:01:29.149> see<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.420> door<00:01:29.570> handles<00:01:29.990> or<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.229> doors

under high pressure to let the air out
to<00:01:37.420> parachutes<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.659> we<00:01:38.900> got<00:01:39.049> all<00:01:39.200> done<00:01:39.470> this

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
to parachutes and we got all done this

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.140 
to parachutes and we got all done this
is<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.950> only<00:01:40.040> part<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.430> was<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.760> original

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
is the only part that was the original

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.190 
is the only part that was the original
part<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.869> that's<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.320> detail<00:01:42.799> in<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.040> back

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
part and that's the detail in the back

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.620 
part and that's the detail in the back
but<00:01:45.200> underneath<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.400> max<00:01:46.670> for<00:01:47.000> anything

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
but underneath is the max for anything

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.289 
but underneath is the max for anything
but<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.020> street<00:01:48.409> car<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:49.490> an<00:01:49.610> updated<00:01:49.970> version

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
but a street car it's an updated version

a hundredth of a second could make all

the<00:04:48.499> difference<00:04:49.689> if<00:04:50.689> I<00:04:50.810> want<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.050> add<00:04:51.139> some

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
the difference if I want to add some

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.390 
the difference if I want to add some
fuel<00:04:51.499> stay<00:04:51.889> right<00:04:52.069> there

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
fuel stay right there

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.010 
fuel stay right there
and<00:04:52.879> what<00:04:53.030> I<00:04:53.060> do<00:04:53.150> is<00:04:53.419> I<00:04:53.539> just<00:04:53.569> go<00:04:53.749> like<00:04:53.870> this

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
and what I do is I just go like this

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.709 
and what I do is I just go like this
because<00:04:54.830> that's<00:04:54.919> more<00:04:55.189> fuel<00:04:55.490> this<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.509> less

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719 
because that's more fuel this is less

looks to me as as something that that is
