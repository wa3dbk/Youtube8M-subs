00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.600 
of the phone and there are these three
slits<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:20.760> turns<00:03:21.209> out<00:03:21.709> this<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:23.010> part<00:03:23.430> of

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
slits in it it turns out this is part of

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.539 
slits in it it turns out this is part of
some<00:03:24.569> brilliant<00:03:24.870> engineering<00:03:25.769> which

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
some brilliant engineering which

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.420 
some brilliant engineering which
actually<00:03:27.329> uses<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.380> stainless<00:03:28.920> steel<00:03:28.950> band

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
actually uses the stainless steel band

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.140 
actually uses the stainless steel band
as<00:03:29.790> part<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.390> antenna<00:03:30.870> system<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:37.069> yes

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
as part of the antenna system and so yes

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.199 
as part of the antenna system and so yes
and<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.780> other<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.170> UMTS<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.769> GSM<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.940> it's

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
and the other is UMTS and GSM so it's

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.500 
and the other is UMTS and GSM so it's
got<00:03:42.450> these<00:03:42.959> integrated<00:03:43.590> antennas<00:03:44.340> right<00:03:45.120> in

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
got these integrated antennas right in

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.720 
got these integrated antennas right in
the<00:03:45.930> structure<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.890> phone<00:03:47.130> it's<00:03:47.370> never

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
the structure of the phone it's never

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.940 
the structure of the phone it's never
been<00:03:48.000> done<00:03:48.060> before<00:03:48.290> three<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.440> half<00:03:49.560> inches

IPS<00:04:15.329> technology<00:04:15.680> this<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:16.950> very<00:04:17.459> advanced

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
IPS technology this is a very advanced

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.870 
IPS technology this is a very advanced
LCD<00:04:18.600> technology<00:04:18.840> which<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.919> quite<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> bit<00:04:20.669> in

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
LCD technology which is quite a bit in

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.370 
LCD technology which is quite a bit in
our<00:04:21.000> opinion<00:04:21.389> quite<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.690> bit<00:04:21.870> better<00:04:22.049> than<00:04:22.200> the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
our opinion quite a bit better than the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.990 
our opinion quite a bit better than the
OLED<00:04:22.740> technology<00:04:22.950> for<00:04:23.490> these<00:04:23.580> types<00:04:23.850> of

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
OLED technology for these types of

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.320 
OLED technology for these types of
products<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:25.100> provides<00:04:26.100> much<00:04:26.639> more<00:04:26.910> accurate

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
products and provides much more accurate

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.339 
products and provides much more accurate
color<00:04:27.539> and<00:04:28.940> much<00:04:29.940> higher<00:04:30.210> resolution<00:04:30.419> you

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
color and much higher resolution you

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.230 
color and much higher resolution you
can't<00:04:31.680> make<00:04:32.010> an<00:04:32.160> OLED<00:04:32.490> display<00:04:32.910> with<00:04:33.090> this

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
can't make an OLED display with this

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.810 
can't make an OLED display with this
type<00:04:33.419> of<00:04:33.450> resolution<00:04:33.870> right<00:04:34.260> now<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.610> we

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
type of resolution right now and so we

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.180 
type of resolution right now and so we
think<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.090> IPS<00:04:36.599> technology<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:37.349> really<00:04:37.770> quite

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
think the IPS technology is really quite

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.140 
think the IPS technology is really quite
superior<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:40.889> results<00:04:41.460> in<00:04:41.550> incredibly

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
superior and it results in incredibly

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.350 
superior and it results in incredibly
sharp<00:04:42.570> text<00:04:43.160> images<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.370> video

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
sharp text images and video

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.419 
sharp text images and video
