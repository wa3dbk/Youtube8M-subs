I<00:00:00.299> know<00:00:00.870> everybody<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:01.439> want<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.829> show<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.070> a

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
I know everybody I want to show you a

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.370 
I know everybody I want to show you a
new<00:00:02.429> board<00:00:02.730> for<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.419> Raspberry<00:00:03.899> Pi<00:00:03.990> it's

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
new board for the Raspberry Pi it's

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.309 
new board for the Raspberry Pi it's
called<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.830> piggyback<00:00:05.160> board<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:06.109> it<00:00:07.109> has

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
called the piggyback board and it has

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.830 
called the piggyback board and it has
the<00:00:08.189> first<00:00:08.429> component<00:00:08.760> that's<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.630> board

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
the first component that's on the board

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.220 
the first component that's on the board
is<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> RTC<00:00:11.099> it's<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.460> real<00:00:11.639> time<00:00:11.910> clock<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.509> this

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
is a RTC it's a real time clock and this

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.169 
is a RTC it's a real time clock and this
is<00:00:13.380> hundred<00:00:13.679> percent<00:00:13.969> compatible<00:00:14.969> with<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
is hundred percent compatible with a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
is hundred percent compatible with a
linux<00:00:15.450> operating<00:00:15.780> system<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.770> means<00:00:16.980> that

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
linux operating system that means that

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.760 
linux operating system that means that
nobody<00:00:17.760> has<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.810> write<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> driver<00:00:19.410> because

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
nobody has to write a driver because

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.099 
nobody has to write a driver because
it's<00:00:20.010> already<00:00:20.430> there<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.750> linux

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
it's already there so the linux

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.929 
it's already there so the linux
operating<00:00:22.199> system<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:23.039> supporting<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.699> ship

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
operating system is supporting that ship

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.540 
operating system is supporting that ship
here's<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.840> battery<00:00:25.289> backup<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> real

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
here's a battery backup for the real

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.910 
here's a battery backup for the real
time<00:00:26.820> clock<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.689> second<00:00:28.109> chip<00:00:28.320> here<00:00:28.740> or

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
time clock the second chip here or
