and<00:00:41.820> coaches<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.230> there's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> fine<00:00:44.219> line

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and coaches you know there's a fine line

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.430 
and coaches you know there's a fine line
because<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.360> case<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> big

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
because in my case more like a big

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
because in my case more like a big
brother<00:00:46.649> than<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> father<00:00:47.219> figure<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.910> you're
