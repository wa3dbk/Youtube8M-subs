of the early 1970s and a lot of ways
were<00:02:37.670> solved<00:02:38.240> but<00:02:38.750> we<00:02:38.870> are<00:02:39.020> making<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:39.800> are

making a shift globally and the hope for
the<00:02:43.370> future<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.970> we<00:02:44.060> won't<00:02:44.240> be<00:02:44.300> addicted

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
the future is that we won't be addicted

the future is that we won't be addicted
to<00:02:44.780> fossil<00:02:45.200> fuels<00:02:45.230> we've<00:02:46.070> got<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> lot<00:02:46.700> of

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
to fossil fuels we've got a lot of

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.220 
to fossil fuels we've got a lot of
people<00:02:47.240> who<00:02:47.360> are<00:02:47.480> trying<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.870> make<00:02:48.020> that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
people who are trying to make that

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.620 
people who are trying to make that
difference<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.310> think<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.790> next<00:02:49.820> few

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
difference and I think in the next few

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.420 
difference and I think in the next few
months<00:02:50.810> we'll<00:02:51.230> see<00:02:51.470> more<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.400> other

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
months we'll see more of the other

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.960 
months we'll see more of the other
nations<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.210> world<00:02:53.240> picking<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:53.870> up
