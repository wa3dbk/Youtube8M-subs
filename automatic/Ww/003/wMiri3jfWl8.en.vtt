00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:09.720
 and so hello everyone today we are with you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:14.510
 talk about hydrojack ah here y 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:21.750
 I have in my hands such an exhibit 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:24.869
 he is from the engine 25th mill principle 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.109
 the same 2 liters that 27 tires on 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.170
 Polish one of 6 was walking Anosov usa 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:37.860
 grass and gum there is a difference 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:41.130
 8 valves and 16 valve 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.559
 there is already a little feature but 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:50.520
 principle if they all have the same 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.210
 lighters well from the word hydra this 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.420
 liquid 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 so compensator is compensated 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:06.799
 announced the liquid and so now we 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.799
 Let us examine it look principle of 

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:14.779
 let's go so here you can see that there is such 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:20.340
 worth 

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:23.539
 sealing washer then we are part 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.929
 rip out of here if you pinned her 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.929
 important to go out 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 there is 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 so here it is 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.859
 how now we pull the core 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.109
 inside there is no idea you spring 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:01.109
 so you need to be careful 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:18.069
 Here we pull it so the remnants of the oil 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.069
 take another rag extra 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.069
 that's it 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.220
 extract 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:44.110
 so look here in theory in Cinderella 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.110
 there is a ball spring 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:59.150
 I'm there late to be another spring 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:03:07.370
 how much do I remember yes here it is 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:10.160
 spring it drove on so we see 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.870
 here the phase is a little bit narrowed therefore 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.480
 use or tone some sewed or 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.959
 screwdriver sean thin usa this 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.400
 I will be able to take it off so now I 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.910
 take a screwdriver 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.940
 so continue to disassemble 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:37.820
 hydraulic compensator so here I am specifically 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:40.990
 such a screwdriver so here it is not 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.990
 can be seen to remove the cap 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.050
 go 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.749
 that's it 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:16.169
 Here, in principle, completely disassembled 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:20.190
 see spring such a ball that's all and so 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:27.300
 take the very principle of this 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:32.729
 devices its main problems in general 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.250
 how does it work and so are we 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.250
 I â€™ll give you a slip 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:42.860
 concept of work here but its 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.960
 picked up completely and lifter 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:53.780
 put that principle work here 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:57.300
 came such a schema we have it ourselves 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:02.190
 lash is our router is 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.960
 valve is the camshaft oil comes by itself 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:12.199
 this condenser is under working pressure 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:15.599
 squeezes out longer can passed its 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:18.620
 force and say so on a popcorn rocker 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:25.310
 valve ie automatically 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:30.240
 the gap itself is regulated 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:34.130
 elementary here is such a scheme so on 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.130
 quickly painted 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:44.000
 Well, here we have all disassembled 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:51.200
 I 'll clean it now 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:55.510
 back and we put everything to the engine 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.510
 thank you like good luck
