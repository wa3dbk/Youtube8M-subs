00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.909 
same thing we've been doing on bikes
forever<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:45.930> ever<00:03:46.049> is<00:03:46.260> some<00:03:46.530> sort<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.829> a

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
forever and ever is some sort of a

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.409 
forever and ever is some sort of a
grease<00:03:47.099> fitting<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.030> little<00:03:48.269> more

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
grease fitting this is a little more

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.830 
grease fitting this is a little more
sophisticated<00:03:49.019> system<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.910> black<00:03:51.150> caps<00:03:51.480> are

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
sophisticated system the black caps are

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.680 
sophisticated system the black caps are
inspection<00:03:52.769> caps<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.669> just<00:03:53.879> take<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> cassette

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
inspection caps you just take a cassette

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.710 
inspection caps you just take a cassette

lock ring tool unscrew it it you can
almost<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:58.109> it<00:03:58.139> by<00:03:58.349> hand<00:03:58.650> they<00:03:59.160> have<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.310> rubber

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
almost do it by hand they have a rubber

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.839 
almost do it by hand they have a rubber

seal check the bolts underneath look at

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.009 
seal check the bolts underneath look at
the<00:04:02.940> condition<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.480> bearings<00:04:03.750> make<00:04:03.900> sure

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
the condition of the bearings make sure

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.289 
the condition of the bearings make sure

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
linkage the derailleur hanger like we've

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.150 
linkage the derailleur hanger like we've
been<00:04:12.900> doing<00:04:13.079> with<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.260> DHR<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.799> last<00:04:13.980> few

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
a pretty long top tube wheelbases I

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.750 
a pretty long top tube wheelbases I
think<00:04:57.840> right<00:04:57.990> around<00:04:58.080> 48<00:04:58.590> inches<00:04:58.980> this<00:04:59.520> for

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
think right around 48 inches this for

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.190 
think right around 48 inches this for
guys<00:04:59.910> that<00:04:59.940> are<00:05:00.210> like<00:05:00.300> 63<00:05:00.960> 266<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:02.520> for<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.450> good

we weld a cap on the bottom so it's
boxed<00:05:29.520> in<00:05:29.670> so<00:05:30.330> we<00:05:30.420> get<00:05:30.540> a<00:05:30.570> great<00:05:31.080> amount<00:05:31.290> of

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
boxed in so we get a great amount of

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.610 
boxed in so we get a great amount of
rigidity<00:05:31.650> without<00:05:32.270> extra<00:05:33.270> weight<00:05:33.450> so<00:05:34.230> big

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
rigidity without extra weight so big
