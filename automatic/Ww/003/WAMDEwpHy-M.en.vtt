00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.850
 top game hide the cinema magazine 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.650

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.580
 fast place in the matthias schweighöfer 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.170

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.730
 we have the same opportunity 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.720
 to talk to him personally and 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.730
 We are very happy 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 and what the movie is about 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.509
 Annie Paul is more professional 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.160
 he brings the conclusion he brings the separation 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.899
 wish his customers to their partners 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.970
 in an order, he meets the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.110
 sensitive toto of the end of his 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.180
 Unfortunately, not at all 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.010
 endures photo finally hangs 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.010
 to Paul and accompanies the locksmith 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.359
 across Germany can buy 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.359
 I am free studzinski 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.210
 on 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.199
 matthias you could imagine in 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.989
 real life 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.719
 in a separation agency as a maker too 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.320
 I would work one day a day 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.670
 interest 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.540
 and then I would probably too 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.580
 Leave why you have to be emotional 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.100
 was pretty stable if you like that 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.850
 relationships trends or you get 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.289
 right on the face 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.490
 depending on who does not know or you have to 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:16.450
 just be tall and be strong and courageous and big 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.830
 if you send me the message now 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.030
 would have to convey that my friend 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.680
 wants to break up with me 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:28.420
 how would you spontaneously do that now? 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:30.340
 let me know you have it now 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 no friend actually since 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.420
 I was three months old 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.510
 At the end was especially the paul was 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.620
 Do you especially like him? 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.880
 nothing that is but someone is already 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.460
 so a story behind it with 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.690
 his family to the divorce child of 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.820
 has lived it differently 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.470
 get now so I think I find 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.810
 believe this is someone who is just very 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.550
 He does not want to be loved 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.200
 really can do it and find that 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.610
 I actually quite good as you anyway 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.660
 I think so was a dream of mine 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.720
 it now together with milan peschel 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.850
 worked which scene was someone with it 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.550
 most fun of course the partner exercise 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.050
 is already that was fun and with 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.520
 milan is so much going on so that's why 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.130
 So did partner of my daughter 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.270
 that is why milan is every scene 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.500
 actually always very funny because of me 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.500
 basically also very funny 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.160
 what do you think what is that 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.730
 worst kind around with the connection 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.730
 easy to die for 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.159
 In any case, the partner can not do that 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.750
 ask more questions because the answer 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.769
 I really had to say family there 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.680
 we had then shot from the hip 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.180
 but already one interview question have 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.480
 I just laughed to die laughing 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.189
 is you crazy with one 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.909
 bad way with the connection 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:20.209
 made for happiness is not so narrow 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.099
 Generally difficult and I do 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.540
 Also do not like to finish me 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:29.349
 In front of that, I'll just see you 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:32.120
 Man, I do not want to see that now 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.709
 single became with you and as always 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.739
 circuit in a bad fashion style 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.260
 So you made it neat then 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.120
 I had new guys and I got them 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.760
 the principle caught like this 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.349
 with each other or something out of it 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.389
 So that has a broken rib 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.159
 through somebody else and I have that then 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.650
 experienced that at the impact 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.810
 happened and then it was clear 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.829
 that the relationship is not longer 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.660
 what message do you want with you 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.379
 mediate your film plays there 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.579
 somehow also perceive your colors 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.410
 that you always have that, of course 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.349
 camper pay for the love fight like that 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.000
 long man unloved so that one 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.650
 maybe longer 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 that the long breath is always better than 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.000
 new partners 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.160
 the great true love she gives you ran 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.750
 is not for cowards josef 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.430
 Schlossmacher really liked it very much 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.140
 So in particular the submitted duo 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.990
 consisting of matthias schweighöfer and 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.910
 Milan Peschel was very convinced of me 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.030
 The film was also very good and straight 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.470
 milan peschel has with his facial expressions with 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.700
 his abstract somehow always 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.200
 brought back to a laugh 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.390
 yes and I was fine now too 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.190
 really lust finally the other films 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.930
 to see 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.970
 So I think I 'm a bit too 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.100
 negative about the film of this one action 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.180
 scene with the car that could not have been 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.250
 I need to find it a bit 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.980
 but I found exaggerated exaggerated 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.840
 even this surreptitious advertising animals do 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.030
 in parts was already pretty dominant 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.180
 and I am simply somehow 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.680
 human if I notice that then then 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.180
 yes then that stares me right 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.700
 or I night and repeatedly point 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:14.139
 and still I can watch the movie well and 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.560
 I can him even better than today 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.689
 in addition to the 18 of the film is on everyone 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.819
 a must for all swiss fans 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.009
 and I 'm looking forward to the 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.520
 next film by swiss from give the 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.499
 wheeler circuit 7 5 out of 10 points to 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:35.909
 greta I think it's totally true that we 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:35.909
 today among us basically relaxed 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:41.020
 I have to tell you that unfortunately 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.789
 this position is over 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.620
 I have no order from one 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.629
 certain silvia bor 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.159
 this is your handwriting 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:54.930
 it may be that you are afraid that is 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.930
 cinema magazine works without you
