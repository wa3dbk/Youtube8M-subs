00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.220 

get<00:02:30.980> off<00:02:31.129> me

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.729 

well<00:02:36.620> that's<00:02:36.799> one<00:02:37.129> way<00:02:37.159> to<00:02:37.430> die<00:02:38.379> that's<00:02:39.379> one

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
well that's one way to die that's one

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.879 
well that's one way to die that's one
way<00:02:39.889> to<00:02:39.950> die<00:02:40.249> so<00:02:40.999> we<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.420> lost<00:02:41.889> landing

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
way to die so we have lost landing

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.379 
way to die so we have lost landing
pattern<00:02:43.040> now<00:02:43.310> we'll<00:02:43.459> be<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.700> desperate

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
pattern now we'll be a desperate

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.940 
pattern now we'll be a desperate
defensive<00:02:44.810> cafeteria<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:45.469> it's<00:02:45.680> very

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
defensive cafeteria but it's very

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.330 
defensive cafeteria but it's very
unlikely<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:47.709> we<00:02:48.709> will<00:02:48.889> actually<00:02:49.069> be<00:02:49.280> able

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
unlikely that we will actually be able

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.190 
unlikely that we will actually be able
to<00:02:49.459> survive<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:50.000> these<00:02:50.239> scopes<00:02:50.569> are<00:02:50.840> coming

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
to survive this these scopes are coming

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.470 
to survive this these scopes are coming
in<00:02:51.349> and<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.709> invertible<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.219> going<00:02:52.489> down<00:02:52.760> so

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
in and the invertible is going down so

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.679 
in and the invertible is going down so
that<00:02:53.659> was<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:54.590> fun<00:02:55.159> way<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.370> start<00:02:55.579> a<00:02:56.180> game<00:02:56.659> and
