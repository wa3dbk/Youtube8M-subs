00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.700
 so the owner of the car in the picture when 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.500
 com 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.210
 He is here in that lighthouse here in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.420
 Iceland in the city and region stay in 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.010
 capital and she walking around here think one 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.810
 Interesting thing about the last great photo 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.810
 I think the suspect 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.170
 first the sun is behind the camera or 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.900
 be any fine right there and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.590
 said and you can see that the sky behind 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.510
 is a black forest cause calamity 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.550
 rain rain and snow coming here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.030
 one or another time changes every five 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.010
 minutes 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.350
 so what I'm doing here I got 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.850
 my camera in my hand without having anything 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.789
 I find it interesting, something else is yours. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.680
 church me accustomed not yellow yet 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.129
 They are not virgins by April. 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.930
 You will see our yellowish there by the previous ones 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.120
 on the bottom are black 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.090
 then the deal is off white white 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.059
 can a color contrast is enough 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.250
 big at 33 feet and the bottom has sky 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.840
 black that's really cool if it was a sky 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.610
 the sun had been there it was a sky 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.770
 totally blue it might not look so 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.799
 The question of light is already 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.509
 diffused by the sun is shining from there to 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.549
 here are some clouds and it's cool 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.189
 who will try to take two things to take 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.229
 horizontal photo on the bed in the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.600
 horizontal a vertical photo to see 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.670
 concluded at the end of the video that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.920
 They are showed the two photos talk about 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.110
 Which do you prefer, too, but the tip is 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 if you walk with the cameras go 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.740
 to pay attention to the issue of 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.420
 Carlos is looking at underlining and in 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.640
 contrasts things 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.020
 I see the opposite of these colors is very 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.400
 legal and that the waiting time more 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.320
 practice to start observing this 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.250
 kind of thing the potential of each scene 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.810
 then I would take a photo that I gave to 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.000
 ac that is not that big but 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.280
 alone and now at the end of the video that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.680
 show the two photos goes in the case of the photo 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.540
 with a kiss and a half there will stay for 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.579
 within the specific tips that will 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.469
 leave your friends open-mouthed with 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.180

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.890
 youtube too because everything here is from 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.340
 grace in the case of the photo that to the very 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.340
 So
