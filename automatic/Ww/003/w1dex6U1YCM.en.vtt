we're<00:02:23.469> going<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> look<00:02:23.799> at<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> engine<00:02:24.219> right

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
we're going to look at the engine right

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.729 
we're going to look at the engine right
now<00:02:24.819> before<00:02:25.299> we<00:02:25.689> go<00:02:25.870> all<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.469> way<00:02:28.620> what<00:02:29.620> we

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
now before we go all the way what we

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.130 
now before we go all the way what we
have<00:02:29.920> here<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.430> 388<00:02:33.510> or<00:02:34.510> something<00:02:35.079> like

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
have here is a 388 or something like

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.910 
have here is a 388 or something like
that<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.379> 380<00:02:36.040> something<00:02:36.720> 83<00:02:37.720> 83<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.470> believe

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
that like 380 something 83 83 I believe

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.809 
that like 380 something 83 83 I believe
and<00:02:39.849> this<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.269> an<00:02:40.359> original<00:02:40.510> engine<00:02:41.519> with<00:02:42.519> a

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
and this is an original engine with a

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.990 
and this is an original engine with a
hundred<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.450> 7,000<00:02:44.319> miles<00:02:44.470> on<00:02:44.829> it<00:02:45.000> it's

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
hundred like 7,000 miles on it it's

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.580 
hundred like 7,000 miles on it it's
running<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.599> good<00:02:46.810> condition<00:02:47.260> I'm<00:02:47.379> going<00:02:47.530> to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
running in good condition I'm going to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.319 
running in good condition I'm going to
fire<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.950> up<00:02:47.980> really<00:02:48.280> quick<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.849> you<00:02:48.909> guys<00:02:49.060> can

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
fire it up really quick so you guys can

00:02:49.329 --> 00:03:02.190 
fire it up really quick so you guys can
see<00:02:49.599> how<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.560> runs<00:02:59.579> if<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:00.760> guys<00:03:00.909> see<00:03:01.299> it<00:03:01.930> runs

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
see how it runs if you guys see it runs

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.679 
see how it runs if you guys see it runs
really<00:03:02.409> good<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.919> fires<00:03:03.189> right<00:03:03.549> up<00:03:03.689> there's

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
really good and fires right up there's

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.190 
really good and fires right up there's
no<00:03:04.840> problems<00:03:05.409> and<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.980> drives<00:03:06.189> good<00:03:06.579> so<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
no problems and it drives good so the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.379 
no problems and it drives good so the
only<00:03:08.379> problem<00:03:08.919> is<00:03:09.159> there's<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.700> heater<00:03:10.030> core

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
only problem is there's a heater core

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.379 
only problem is there's a heater core
and<00:03:10.629> it<00:03:10.780> needs<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.019> be<00:03:11.139> replaced<00:03:12.150> other<00:03:13.150> than

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
and it needs to be replaced other than

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.420 
and it needs to be replaced other than
that<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.900> seems<00:03:14.230> like<00:03:14.349> everything<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.099> working

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
that it seems like everything is working

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.590
