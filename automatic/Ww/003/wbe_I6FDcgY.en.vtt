you<00:00:42.180> had<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> pretty<00:00:42.840> close<00:00:43.140> game<00:00:43.500> against<00:00:43.890> we

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
you had a pretty close game against we

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
you had a pretty close game against we
as<00:00:44.219> Asian<00:00:44.550> um<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> beginning<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.930> looked

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
as Asian um in the beginning it looked

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.190 
as Asian um in the beginning it looked
like<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.590> had<00:00:46.620> maybe<00:00:47.070> even<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.879> better

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
like you had maybe even the better

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.549 
like you had maybe even the better
standing<00:00:50.629> what<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.780> learn<00:00:51.989> from<00:00:52.170> defeats

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
standing what do you learn from defeats

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.529 
standing what do you learn from defeats
like<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> mean<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
like that I mean is it just that you

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.510 
like that I mean is it just that you
need<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> pay<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.500> attention<00:00:55.860> next<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.160> or

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
need to pay more attention next time or

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.569 
need to pay more attention next time or
is<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.879> maybe<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> lack<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.440> synergy<00:00:58.829> it's

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
is it maybe like it lack of synergy it's

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.779 
is it maybe like it lack of synergy it's
definitely<00:01:00.090> well<00:01:00.829> we<00:01:01.829> had<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.100> many<00:01:02.670> many

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
definitely well we had it many many

and then yeah and then try to get a last
step<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.450> through<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:31.350> through

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
step going to go through to go through

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.770 
step going to go through to go through
to<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> base<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.460> their<00:01:32.579> exes<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.630> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
to a base and get their exes but in this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.569 
to a base and get their exes but in this
game<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> would<00:01:34.320> rather<00:01:34.560> stayed<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.100> my<00:01:35.280> fault

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
game I would rather stayed with my fault

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.730 
game I would rather stayed with my fault

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
to be quite honest I had an early
refresh<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.549> ended<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.119> using<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
refresh and just ended up not using it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.770
