00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.630
 a toy for a gift like on their arises 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:24.939
 this game is about the dark knight I mean about 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:28.910
 Batman toy is very high quality 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:33.069
 cool done let's continue with 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.429
 places where it stopped is the second chapter 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:40.100
 in my beginning 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:42.170
 toy on the plot completely 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:49.399
 corresponds to the film about the dark knight 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.190
 here they cinnamon attacked villain and here 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:57.889
 enslaved the whole city 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:00.170
 his people everywhere we are thrown in jail we 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:02.269
 Successfully but prisons get out but this 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.990
 everything in the plot you do it all as 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.880
 film, that is, immediately try to 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.210
 defeat his villain you fail 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.969
 then in prison and climb there too 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.109
 get out of there and again like 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:20.090
 come back after many years 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.729
 stay in jail well there by we don't even 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.509
 for many years there is a move here that passed what 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.759
 I won't tell you that exactly 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.950
 what kind of graphics is enough in the game 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.270
 nice done something 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.109
 toy resembles such in style 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.840
 also a city as something less open 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:44.869
 world here it is this city map so you can 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.569
 watch and the plot task is 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:53.719
 additional task here is the plot here 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.420
 very interesting which is very good 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.049
 there you are not just there wonder chaos 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.550
 run around 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.620
 but that's all interesting dialogues 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.730
 the toy is translated into Russian and 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.670
 Russian subtitles 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.960
 graph graph if finding fault of course 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.190
 Well, here you can see Batman like that 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.650
 nothing guy at all his face 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.350
 chin lips plastered whether to us 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.310
 that's my dialogue 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.240
 they don't even move their mouths that's what 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.330
 modern standards of course minus 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:36.170
 take even the recently released deus ex in 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.280
 which is all worked out and everything is simple 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.930
 super but not the point right now 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.590
 my mission is mine to destroy on 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.700
 peers and get to my goal here with us 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.620
 there are all sorts 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.600
 different enemies what's great in the game you 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.780
 these enemies can destroy 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:01.760
 in many ways how quiet quietly clean 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.060
 there somehow quietly or rashit there for 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.140
 all this you have your gadgets 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.480
 Batman's gadgets let's go into the menu 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.220
 hardware store and consider these all 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.440
 devices here we have batarang 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.930
 Cinnamon is such a batman asterisk 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.260
 which improves on only one 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.650
 stars and rebound and distance and myself 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:32.720
 Damage and and here I will allow now by 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:39.950
 my yes here are two more two things 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:42.410
 improvements there let's buy here's another 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.570
 one stayed then here he is and we have 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.390
 so here is the harpoon which batman 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.959
 clinging to the building can also 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.750
 clinging to enemies is also a cool thing 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.700
 buy at a distance 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.700
 After all, go and strength and speed but in general 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.470
 detail it all improves smoke 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.370
 curtain clicking here you can see it 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.590
 specifications 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.330
 tips for what it may be useful 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.620
 it is so for everyone 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.629
 this device 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.129
 then the technique, that is, there is a motorcycle 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.910
 Batman needs a level here 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.410
 then you earn experience and 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.780
 pumping fat hero I just 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.199
 pumped uniforms for the game 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.340
 currency you can buy it for it 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:33.550
 gold these are all trapped there are sets 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.650
 bit oragna these and so on you see 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.840
 these are also elements of a suit flying there 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.820
 will figure it out 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:48.190
 Here we are presented but also sets 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.630
 and the items themselves that is how many you are there 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.310
 want a grenade let's buy ourselves 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.780
 I have betaranks right now 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:02.680
 few such even one remained only 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.840
 let's buy here 20 pieces for 200 gold 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.490
 this gold falls out of the fallen 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.160
 enemies naturally 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.889
 where from but could still come from 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.849
 now consider the gameplay itself you're on 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:18.210
 the technical side was long delayed 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:22.630
 we shoot we pull up everything is cool everything 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.630
 smoothly beautiful will also pass 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.669
 very effectively batman kinks various 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.380
 there you have the blows cool 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.919
 such a slowdown everything is clearly done 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.169
 game board 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.050
 destroy naturally first enemies with 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.590
 weapons so that this marriage does not break with us 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:45.240
 and here and then finish in melee 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:50.190
 batman is primarily a melee fighter and 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.190
 kills enemies in hand-to-hand combat 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.770
 I think in our hour they aim at 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.580
 us or not 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.210
 a ray and right away you need to push you 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.430
 didn't burn 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:11.020
 and so let's go over the roof this here 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:18.099
 there are probably auto-targeting with this arpu 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:24.250
 We are firming in hi dude 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:26.800
 steam like a real ninja took it with it 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.159
 Betarang you can move to 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:35.620
 environment at any point for yourself 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:38.139
 some tactics to choose here is very 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.530
 interesting is it play something mean 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:45.930
 in between know here spiderman he so here 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:49.060
 game about superhero here and such 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.610
 motirovo there cartoon graphics and so 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.490
 further and something like that kind of 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.610
 action shooter in which you can 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.919
 rashit 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:05.190
 and apply all sorts of tactical moves 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.190
 against your enemies 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:10.930
 especially cool that at least there is 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.080
 Russian subtitles and you may well 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:19.259
 understand what's going on in the plot 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.259
 very big plus to the game 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:41.669
 why didnâ€™t sleep me that it was him so cowardly 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:49.590
 poor to poor my dear
