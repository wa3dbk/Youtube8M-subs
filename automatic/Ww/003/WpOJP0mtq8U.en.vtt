point then I went to plan the drill next
to<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> place<00:00:57.870> where<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.289> get<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> new

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to the place where you get the new

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.869 
to the place where you get the new
Wonder<00:00:59.100> weapon<00:00:59.870> drill<00:01:00.870> disappears<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
according to my teammates I became the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.990 
according to my teammates I became the
drill<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.900> their<00:01:07.140> screen<00:01:07.560> they<00:01:08.520> could<00:01:08.700> see

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
drill so in their screen they could see

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.740 
drill so in their screen they could see
me<00:01:09.810> being<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.350> drill<00:01:10.970> pointing<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.450> they

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
me being the drill pointing they they

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
me being the drill pointing they they
could<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.439> triangle<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
could see like this triangle where it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
could see like this triangle where it
says<00:01:14.939> drill<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.750> was<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.680> I'll

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
says drill and it was like me I'll

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.670 
says drill and it was like me I'll
although<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.360> no<00:01:18.540> drill<00:01:18.780> anymore<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
although there was no drill anymore it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.260 
although there was no drill anymore it
was<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:20.369> gone<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:23.100> plan<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.490> again<00:01:23.970> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
was all gone so I I can plan it again it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.030 
was all gone so I I can plan it again it
just<00:01:24.299> kind<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.610> practically<00:01:26.610> disappeared<00:01:27.360> but

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
just kind of practically disappeared but

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.920 
just kind of practically disappeared but
somehow<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.460> was<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> drill<00:01:30.180> at<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> same<00:01:30.659> time

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
somehow I was the drill at the same time

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.370 
somehow I was the drill at the same time
I<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.970> tried<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:34.170> had

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
I don't know so we tried this had

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.140 
I don't know so we tried this had
happened<00:01:34.409> before<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> first<00:01:35.490> mission<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
happened before in the first mission and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.450 
happened before in the first mission and
it<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.659> pretty<00:01:37.079> simple<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.740> how<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> fix<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it was pretty simple on how to fix it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.490 
it was pretty simple on how to fix it
back<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.270> after<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> new<00:01:39.930> patch<00:01:40.229> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
back then but after the new patch I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
back then but after the new patch I
guess<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.549> sure<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
guess I'm not sure if you can do it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
guess I'm not sure if you can do it
anymore<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.200> by<00:01:43.409> downing<00:01:43.680> yourself<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:45.030> would

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
anymore so by downing yourself you would

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.139 
anymore so by downing yourself you would
eventually<00:01:45.810> drop<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.070> drill<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.610> inside

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
eventually drop the drill from inside

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.260 
eventually drop the drill from inside
you<00:01:49.430> apparently<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.549> doesn't<00:01:50.729> work<00:01:50.970> anymore

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you apparently it doesn't work anymore

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.170 
you apparently it doesn't work anymore
as<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.409> went<00:01:53.369> down<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.820> team<00:01:54.030> had

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
as you can see I went down my team had

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.810 
as you can see I went down my team had
revived<00:01:54.540> me<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.439> will<00:01:55.649> didn't<00:01:56.460> appear

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
revived me so that will didn't appear

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.840 
revived me so that will didn't appear
again<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.810> i<00:01:58.140> tried<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.619> fight<00:01:58.920> trap<00:01:59.219> i<00:01:59.430> played

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
again so i tried the fight trap i played

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.340 
again so i tried the fight trap i played
out<00:01:59.880> completely<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.969> still<00:02:02.969> no<00:02:03.630> drill<00:02:03.960> my

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
out completely and still no drill my

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.130 
out completely and still no drill my
team<00:02:04.590> has<00:02:04.770> revived<00:02:05.100> me<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.719> didn't

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
team has revived me here and it didn't

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.660 
team has revived me here and it didn't
help<00:02:07.320> either<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:09.470> i'm<00:02:10.470> guessing<00:02:10.979> there<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.459> no

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
help either so i'm guessing there is no

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
help either so i'm guessing there is no
way<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.879> fix<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.840> glitch

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
way to fix this glitch

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.750 
way to fix this glitch
if<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.970> if<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.180> run<00:02:15.390> across<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:17.220> its

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
if you if you run across it it's its

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.260 
if you if you run across it it's its
Gigi<00:02:18.440> we<00:02:19.440> went<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.680> check<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.460> whole<00:02:20.670> map<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
Gigi we went to check the whole map and

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.860
