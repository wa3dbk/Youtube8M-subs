00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.460
 How about Mexico? I am another community 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.850
 time is rawlings and in this video tutorial 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.100
 I will explain how to change the voices of 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.570
 champ in select from English to Spanish 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.570
 latin ok 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.690
 I imagine that they will have followed the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.760
 previous tutorial where I explained them 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.680
 how to change the voices within the game 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.800
 from English to Spanish if they already did this 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.540
 perfect if that video does not go and do it 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.730
 since it's going to download files that 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.080
 they need to do what I'm going to do 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.410
 say next what I 'm going to 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.440
 explain 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.320
 suppose they already did what they 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 I explained in the previous video 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.670
 we just go to the folder League of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.829
 legends in my case is 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.590
 albums in raid games league of legends 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.620
 again we open the folder of rats 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.650
 we go later to where it says 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.030
 projects 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.230
 loud airlines is the first 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:14.010
 you make 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:15.900
 now you will notice that there is 1.6 and 1.0 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.070
 for the endings for what we want 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.530
 Now let's work on the 1.00 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.800
 otherwise it will not work we enter 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 the 1.0 we are going to diploid 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.080
 we choose the folder that says assets us 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.270
 let's assange 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.870
 and we're going to see a lot of folders the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.420
 what we are interested in is this is a low mx 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.370
 we double- click on it says champion 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.240
 and these are the voices of the champions 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.740
 in Spanish 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.649
 let's see 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.649
 today we feel naughty today 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.720
 this case for me well well 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.680
 we copy all 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.680
 we give him copy 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.000
 we return to the back folder another 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.360
 time until we get back to the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.729
 of sam's we look for the folder that is 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.239
 s 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.790
 we go to the champions folder and the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.579
 we paste 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.049
 we give you overwrite everything so 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.210
 that we have here the voices in 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.370
 Spanish too 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.370
 today we feel naughty 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.129
 everything is ready we open the client 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.129
 Let's play 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.269
 we enter your password 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.330
 fast handle fast fast fast fast 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.330
 fast fast fast 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.100
 would create a very quick taste to see if 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.100
 do they work 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.450
 just accept 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.800
 click let's go 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.810
 I'll put a bot 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.340
 we hear it today we feel naughty 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.850
 only the spider is safe in its web 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:27.640
 I seek a worthy opponent a decision 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:30.640
 invoking practice you do not feel a 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.640
 chill 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.530
