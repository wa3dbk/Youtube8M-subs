00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 the galaxy s 4 active is currently one 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.810
 out of a total of four smartphones from the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.639
 s4 s4 family is here 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.639
 family member something different 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.070
 specializes in the super power of the 500 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.059
 euro expensive galaxy s 4 active it is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.190
 dustproof and waterproof 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.350
 we show you what the smartphone under 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:31.859
 Water can and how much car really 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:34.020
 in the sv is active that it is the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.399
 sv active around a smartphone aster s4 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.380
 it is unmistakable 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.930
 Samsung also stays with this device 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.700
 faithful to his design not only by accident 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.430
 ends the active from the appearance of the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.539
 topseller galaxy s 4 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.309
 Nevertheless, there are many differences 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.379
 to the current flagship of the koreans 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 also usually under the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.399
 display blase home-button join 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.920
 there are two more physical keys 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.199
 menu and a back button like the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.510
 galaxy s 4 comes on in the active one five 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.730
 inch large full hd display for use 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 only difference samsung omitted 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.570
 when sv active on an amoled 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.330
 screen and puts on instead 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.670
 tft lcd display at an author 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.680
 Smartphone makes that quite sensible 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.700
 lcd screens clear in the outdoors 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.380
 better read 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 In the test it was indeed like that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.009
 websites on the active clearly 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.259
 were better to read than on it 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.640
 four colors, on the other hand, do not work 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.790
 as intense as on a super amoled 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.040
 display of the s4 but realistic 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.310
 there is nothing in the matter of sharpness 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310
 find fault 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.410
 the viewing angle stability is high enough 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.150
 to texts and pictures also at 45 degrees 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.860
 to recognize tilted device 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.540
 only the automatic 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.630
 Brightness adjustment could be better 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.160
 be tough 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.390
 usually samsung will start everything 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.550
 not flagship is with 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.920
 Inferior technology from not in the 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.720
 case of the s4 active already at the display 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.430
 you have not waived full-hd 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.000
 even with the processor, there is no 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.830
 difference 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.320
 in both devices one finds one 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.890
 snapdragon 600 in front of its four cores 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.989
 a frequency of 1 gigahertz clock 9 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.510
 running processes are in 12 gb 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.970
 memory outsourced also gives 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.760
 It has 16GB of internal memory which can be used 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.709
 Expand micro sd cards by up to 64gb 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.390
 passes both the wipe through the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.130
 homescreens as well as navigate 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.170
 through the menu was running smoothly and 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.170
 The device represents no obstacle 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.950
 on the back there is an 8 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.950
 Megapixel camera at the dark 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.480
 Support from an LED gets along 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.740
 This one does with good ones 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.810
 lighting conditions also quite good 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.640
 Shooting only affects the colors 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.489
 sometimes either something faded or 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:59.260
 that's too intense at close-ups 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.260
 galaxy s 4 extra a good figure 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.660
 An advantage of dust and waterproofing 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.190
 casing 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.500
 You can also record under water 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.819
 if this is clear then succeed 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.100
 certainly on one or the other good 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.350
 starting shot is to be noted here 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.030
 not a deeper water than a meter 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.220
 dive in and not longer than 30 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.450
 minutes for everything beyond that there is 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.450
 from samsung no guarantee 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.939
 at the end of one and a half hour 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.530
 working days were on the scale 35 scale 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.480
 remaining percent read 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.329
 after another 16 hours in the standby 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.970
 were still 22 read 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.220
 thus lost the 2300 milliamp hours 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.140
 strong battery the active not even 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.780
 a percent battery charge per hour in the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.819
 standby currently 500 euros more expensive 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.829
 galaxy s 4 active is not really one 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.900
 complete car smartphone because it's for 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.780
 example is not shockproof it is rather 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.459
 a galaxy s 4g certificate that the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.030
 Active water and dust resistance 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.030
 certified
