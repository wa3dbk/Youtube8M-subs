00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:13.710
 It is sand order of education consultant 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:17.190
 I would like to guide you to the matter without you an overview of the future course of how to write a short essay 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.590
 Of course when I say an essay, I take a university exam 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.010
 Or graduate examination 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.720
 Furthermore, of university transfer 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:30.460
 It is often automated when taking an exam 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.370
 To what kind of wind it is on the assumption that the fact that writing a short essay in so kind of test 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:41.140
 I would like to show you if I should write 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.140
 I will tell you that if I do write in first is I essay what constituted 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.600
 It is the composition, but first of all 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.460
 Introduction and conclusion 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.430
 Remember that you're writing this 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.410
 Essay 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.730
 Have a fan 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.360
 It seems that one claim is called introductory conclusion this conclusion 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.940
 It is basic that we develop 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:13.090
 Sensitive 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:13.090
 There is also a very important and easy-to-understand it becomes condition that is consistent with the paper conclusion 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.090
 How are you in general 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:24.950
 It is not a conclusion of this place, but good luck 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.120
 If you say that it is good to deploy in the form of a pen iron 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.580
 welcome 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:34.020
 However, this is no good for essays 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.310
 I say and why and say you and I kishōtenketsu is 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.720
 Since the sun short started 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.420
 At the end of the day, I will make a surprising development with corn 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.580
 And tie 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.630
 This development is not suitable for essays 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.630
 承 な く で で す ね で す ね 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.770
 It's not consistent because it's unforeseen developments 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.150
 Cause approval Tenketsu is useless in the essay 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.510
 Now 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.510
 Hmm 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.230
 It 's said that it is not a sequel 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.810
 Some people say that it is good to do the configuration 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:17.620
 However , please lower this also in the essay 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.650
 If you say why it 's a sudden rush First of all, it's slow to say this place 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.110
 Ne 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.710
 the start 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.490
 Take it a bit faster with teeth 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:32.830
 It's like going to Tatamikake is that cucumber Cor and faster 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.620
 Gaso Well, for example, the novel readers, such as it is drawn into the world of jerk jerk novel 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.390
 Say 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.200
 Although it is good for me, I have calmed down my essay, but I got an easy-to-understand explanation with the main line. 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.920
 To do 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.180
 Because this is not suitable for this 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.430
 In the steeper essay fracture mechanism 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.290
 I think you should think like no 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.069
 Well then 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.909
 The essay 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:03.849
 Introduction Constitution of the present conclusion 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:05.450
 I told you how to think about this and how to go about it 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:10.990
 I will 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:14.920
 First of all, there will be a problem statement, so the theme said in the problem statement 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.400
 Receive what is required in the first half of the introduction 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.430
 I need this first 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.280
 For example, if a theme is indicated, 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.280
 It's about the subject in the world right now 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.240
 However, you may say something that you are paying attention to, or about the subject 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.300
 You may define 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:42.680
 First of all, I received what I was told in the first half 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:47.560
 I want you to enter, and in the second half how it is in this paper 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:51.010
 Guides you to develop a dissertation 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.920
 That's right, for example, 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:00.849
 The order of the three items in this paper saying that with the three items referred to as a release from now on 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.880
 Go and requires that the guide is fit to gradually said in 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:07.550
 John is definitely that 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.690
 The person who rebuilds first gets a pad woman か ら from this well 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.960
 It is a belt very Oh so s the you can see that I Do I is written in this kind of wind 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:19.340
 Is very important 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:23.240
 And this theory is enough if you fully develop your claim 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.580
 It is the normal conclusion and we stuck conclusion in 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:33.940
 Looking back on it I say to the selfishness of the Tteyuu be said in this paper is was what it 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:37.210
 Is there you as a hope of that finally 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.090
 This is not included if the number of characters is small 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:46.650
 For example , if it is a short essay such as 600 characters or the date of presentation 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:50.610
 It is enough because there is this book also there where there is no need like this 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.320
 It is when the number of characters is in many cases and the 1100 child Toka 2010 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.560
 It would be nice to give a brief summary of this paper 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:04.320
 And the last thing that matters in the conclusion is the last 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.919
 I appealed that I was answering the questions I asked about what I had developed so far . 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.740
 I will 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:11.230
 So As described above, for example, 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.849
 It is possible to argue about the anti-anti-this kind of theme 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:17.420
 That's how it looks 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:21.110
 Please refer to the appeal that I replied properly in conclusion 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:25.430
 By the way, the configuration is a trial of this person 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.430
 How do you write an essay using this structure ? 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.520
 Let's see how to write in the process 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:37.409
 At first we read problem sentence well 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.230
 This is the first step to figure out what is being asked in a question statement 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.790
 is not it 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.170
 I am 10 years old and this is important I wrote that it was out of focus if this grasp was not made properly 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.700
 I will do it 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:50.009
 Use exactly what is being asked 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.260
 Understanding of is very important 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:57.530
 And 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:59.800
 Envision that it is after that myself on the basis of the understanding is of how to write What do you mean 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:06.009
 Enter the stage of 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:08.210
 If you are asked about your opinion or thinking about the broadcast, you are likely to do it yourself 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.320
 Such unique members 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.850
 Because it is For example, the test 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.220
 That he is a suitable person to enter the university graduate school 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.460
 this 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.979
 Think about going out 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.509
 If knowledge is required in the essay, what kind of knowledge is included in this concept 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.409
 I wonder if it will go 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.070
 I think here 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:35.040
 Not say that 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:36.330
 If you can do this, you will actually write it next time, but it is called expression 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.529
 It becomes a stage 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:46.380
 Here is a logical way to write in a straight line 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:48.240
 This is the process to answer in the exam 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:53.009
 Just you guys 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.270
 In fact small but has to tell you that I do in the Inzai theory roughly this kind of wind today 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:57.400
 It Is the Tteyuu paper 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:01.090
 Let's write and have it look 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.480
 The fact that this is but I was more important than what you get advice 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.700
 a 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.100
 If you like me, here is the email address 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.490

 Get send if I mail it because it is quite anything consultation 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.550
 You do the reply be sure if you can 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:22.380
 By all means everyone 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:26.910
 Based on what you have been taught about the essay, please write it yourself 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:31.880
