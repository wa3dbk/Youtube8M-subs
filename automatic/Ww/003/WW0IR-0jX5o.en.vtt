does each of these each of the bullets
do<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.830> mean<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.299> close-range<00:01:18.299> um<00:01:18.799> like

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
do because I mean a close-range um like

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
do because I mean a close-range um like
even<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.340> doesn't<00:01:20.700> matter<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.180> how

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
even that doesn't matter really how

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.390 
even that doesn't matter really how
accurate<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.049> gun<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.799> one<00:01:23.040> point<00:01:23.250> you're
