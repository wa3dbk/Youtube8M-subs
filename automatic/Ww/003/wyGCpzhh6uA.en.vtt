phase<00:00:00.900> one<00:00:01.230> initially<00:00:02.040> opens<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.970> 303<00:00:03.389> from

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
phase one initially opens the 303 from

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.039 
phase one initially opens the 303 from
Happy<00:00:05.009> Valley<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.839> i-70

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
Happy Valley to i-70

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.900 
Happy Valley to i-70
so<00:00:07.170> it's<00:00:07.350> 14<00:00:08.069> new<00:00:08.400> miles<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.059> Valley<00:00:09.300> Freeway

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
so it's 14 new miles of Valley Freeway

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.570 
so it's 14 new miles of Valley Freeway
this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> machine<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.540> measures

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
this is the machine that measures

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.589 
this is the machine that measures
smoothness<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.820> concrete<00:00:15.210> pavement

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
smoothness for the concrete pavement

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.960 
smoothness for the concrete pavement
once<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.289> run<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.680> profile<00:00:17.039> ax<00:00:17.070> graph<00:00:17.369> it

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
once we run this profile ax graph it

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.810 
once we run this profile ax graph it
counts<00:00:18.660> what<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.680> call<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.160> bumps<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
counts what we call the bumps and the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.279 
counts what we call the bumps and the
dip<00:00:21.060> where<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.020> switch<00:00:22.320> lanes<00:00:23.660> we<00:00:24.660> measured<00:00:25.080> in

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
dip where we switch lanes we measured in

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.759 
dip where we switch lanes we measured in
tenth<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> mile<00:00:26.039> sections<00:00:26.630> 528<00:00:27.630> feet<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
tenth of a mile sections 528 feet and it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.299 
tenth of a mile sections 528 feet and it
simulates<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.429> travel<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> vehicle<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:32.160> if

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
simulates the travel of a vehicle so if

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.910 
simulates the travel of a vehicle so if
I<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.700> three<00:00:33.480> lanes<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.870> traffic<00:00:34.079> then<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I have three lanes of traffic then that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.729 
I have three lanes of traffic then that
means<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.579> six<00:00:36.480> different<00:00:37.020> passes<00:00:37.530> two

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
means I have six different passes two

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.220 
means I have six different passes two
for<00:00:37.980> each<00:00:38.070> lane<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.149> if<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.570> figure<00:00:39.899> three

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
for each lane so if you figure three

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.819 
for each lane so if you figure three
lanes<00:00:41.000> fourteen<00:00:42.000> miles<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.809> whatever<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
lanes fourteen miles and whatever you

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.590 
lanes fourteen miles and whatever you
push<00:00:44.070> forward<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.820> turn<00:00:45.059> around<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
push forward you turn around and you

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.880 
push forward you turn around and you
push<00:00:45.809> back<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.700> I<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.930> say<00:00:48.960> feels

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
push back so I I would say feels

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.040 
push back so I I would say feels
probably<00:00:50.399> come<00:00:50.610> close<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.000> 100<00:00:51.329> miles<00:00:51.480> pushing

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
probably come close to 100 miles pushing

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.150 
probably come close to 100 miles pushing
this<00:00:52.140> thing<00:00:52.699> here<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.620> regular

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
this thing here we go it's a regular

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.900 
this thing here we go it's a regular
bicycle<00:00:56.550> tire<00:00:56.930> whenever<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.079> tire<00:00:58.410> either

bicycle tire whenever that tire either
raises<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.090> lowers<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.750> all<00:01:00.930> measured<00:01:01.379> by

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
raises or lowers it's all measured by

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.609 
raises or lowers it's all measured by
computers<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.300> about<00:01:03.570> sensors<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
computers it's all about sensors and it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.390 
computers it's all about sensors and it
in<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.010> it'll<00:01:05.369> tell<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.850> how<00:01:06.240> smooth<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.500> run

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
in it it'll tell you how smooth that run

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.179 
in it it'll tell you how smooth that run
is<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.850> 528<00:01:09.780> feet<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.200> gathers<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.799> data

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
is in 528 feet it gathers all the data

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.910 
is in 528 feet it gathers all the data
then<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> gives<00:01:11.970> us<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.420> smoothness<00:01:13.170> factor<00:01:13.740> for

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
then it gives us a smoothness factor for

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.690 
then it gives us a smoothness factor for
that<00:01:13.950> 528<00:01:14.820> feet<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.240> there's<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.500> bump<00:01:17.369> that's

this thing now not downhill it's always

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.980 
this thing now not downhill it's always
been<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.310> method<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.940> measurement<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.630> feet

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
been a method of measurement on feet

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.160 
been a method of measurement on feet
we've<00:01:49.260> never<00:01:49.500> used<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.750> transporting<00:01:51.750> vehicle

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
we've never used a transporting vehicle

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
to either push or tow alright so we're

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.210 
to either push or tow alright so we're
going<00:01:54.480> to<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.690> next<00:01:54.900> side<00:01:55.050> everybody<00:01:55.740> likes<00:01:56.010> a

going to the next side everybody likes a

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.460 
going to the next side everybody likes a
smooth<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.790> quiet<00:01:57.000> right<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:58.260> is<00:01:58.440> how

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
smooth and quiet right and this is how

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.440 
smooth and quiet right and this is how
we<00:01:58.620> guaranteed<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.670> smooth<00:02:00.000> part<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.390> the

we guaranteed the smooth part of the
ride
