00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:15.040
 show what is minecraft 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.880
 that 1.3 point 1 was irrigated 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.400
 good even though I'm a pirate 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.170
 and me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.710
 and maybe not 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:30.230
 Although I am a pirate, I do not give you several 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.649
 changes and in the majority is that 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.890
 minecraft always voted for me and 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:42.270
 a blue image appears only 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:46.230
 they talk a lot and it's good what 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.890
 If you did not save your folder well, if not 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.630
 has your support here I leave you one if 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.440
 I leave you a backup of the folder well 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.719
 about this no 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.199
 is here I'm going to leave the link of the 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.610
 description description that is good 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 what is the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.250
 the folder well completely native and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.670
 more than anything the minecraft jr 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.220
 what does that have if I had to rescue it 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.310
 with my own mods 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.310
 but not only has he created 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.010
 let's see 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.850
 if apparently he only has the opt and fine 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.000
 what is a good thing I suppose 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.550
 and the a sacramentum in items 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.370
 in case you do not save your settings 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.050
 from your minecraft you can download and 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.360
 download this 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.810
 in this file 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.080
 to return your minecraft to 1.25 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.800
 which I had to do 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.460
 because if I really minecraft 1.3 point 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.980
 I did not like it but not the fact that I 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.319
 I made that one grew so fast 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.579
 that's not 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.579
 no, it is not forgivable 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.400
 The only thing that made me laugh was if the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.730
 the minecraft java was what is the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.590
 only that shaders looked good from 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.340
 Suddenly the blue screen was on and 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.980
 white 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.880
 it's good to be all those who say that 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.310
 I wanted to tell you here is 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.450
 the download simply downloads it 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.840
 they go to their minecraft folder and delete 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.090
 is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.190
 in this folder and put it 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.860
 what will come here compress ok 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.430

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.430
