00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.219 
record 4k video the sony xperia so too
keeps<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.219> until<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.969> gets<00:01:06.210> too<00:01:06.479> hot<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
keeps going until it gets too hot so

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.389 
keeps going until it gets too hot so
that<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> first<00:01:07.799> thing<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.009> found<00:01:08.219> so

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
that was the first thing we found so

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.980 
that was the first thing we found so
that<00:01:08.429> dictated<00:01:08.969> one<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.389> the<00:01:09.509> tests<00:01:09.869> we're

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that dictated one of the tests we're

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
that dictated one of the tests we're
doing<00:01:10.259> so<00:01:10.469> we<00:01:10.859> had<00:01:11.009> to<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.249> five<00:01:11.520> minutes<00:01:11.729> with

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
doing so we had to do five minutes with

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
doing so we had to do five minutes with
the<00:01:12.209> ice<00:01:12.359> cube<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.899> top<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.889> phone<00:01:14.100> ie

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the ice cube on the top of the phone ie

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.730 
the ice cube on the top of the phone ie
on<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.639> screen<00:01:14.999> and<00:01:15.179> then<00:01:15.630> once<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.170> reset<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
on the screen and then once we reset the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.349 
on the screen and then once we reset the
4k<00:01:17.069> video<00:01:17.340> recording<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.909> flipped<00:01:18.209> the

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
4k video recording we flipped the

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.300 
4k video recording we flipped the
phone's<00:01:18.600> around<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.409> put<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.770> ice<00:01:19.950> cube

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
phone's around and we put the ice cube

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.580 
phone's around and we put the ice cube
on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> camera<00:01:21.270> module<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.749> same<00:01:22.049> ice<00:01:22.289> cubes

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
on the camera module the same ice cubes

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
on the camera module the same ice cubes
each<00:01:22.799> phone<00:01:23.130> obviously<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:24.119> repeated<00:01:24.600> this

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
each phone obviously we repeated this

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.169 
each phone obviously we repeated this
process<00:01:25.200> until<00:01:25.469> all<00:01:26.249> the<00:01:26.520> ice<00:01:26.639> cubes<00:01:26.999> had

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
process until all the ice cubes had

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.080 
process until all the ice cubes had
melted<00:01:27.319> now<00:01:28.319> our<00:01:28.649> initial<00:01:29.130> finding<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
melted now our initial finding was that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.199 
melted now our initial finding was that
the<00:01:30.509> Sony<00:01:30.779> Xperia<00:01:30.929> z2<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:32.639> we<00:01:32.789> said<00:01:32.999> can

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:33.209 
the Sony Xperia z2 like we said can

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.239 
the Sony Xperia z2 like we said can
record<00:01:33.599> longer<00:01:34.200> video<00:01:34.409> than<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.679> competition

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
record longer video than the competition

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.879 
record longer video than the competition
but<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.299> records<00:01:36.779> bigger<00:01:37.200> file<00:01:37.560> sizes

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
but it also records bigger file sizes

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.499 
but it also records bigger file sizes
which<00:01:38.219> means<00:01:38.429> there<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.789> less<00:01:38.819> compression

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
which means there is less compression

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.870 
which means there is less compression
going<00:01:39.929> on<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.469> is<00:01:40.679> good<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.249> you<00:01:41.399> like<00:01:41.609> less

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
going on this is good if you like less

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.639 
going on this is good if you like less
compression<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.630> bad<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.139> we<00:01:43.439> actually

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
compression it's bad because we actually

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.769 
compression it's bad because we actually
managed<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.369> fill<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.939> internal<00:01:45.419> memory

of<00:01:45.959> the<00:01:46.109> phone<00:01:46.349> quickly<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.429> that<00:01:47.789> meant<00:01:48.179> that

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
of the phone quickly and that meant that

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.929 
of the phone quickly and that meant that
for<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.749> very<00:01:49.109> last<00:01:49.560> round<00:01:49.919> we<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.609> had<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
for the very last round we just had to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.550 
for the very last round we just had to
leave<00:01:51.149> all<00:01:51.359> the<00:01:51.479> screens<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.109> home<00:01:52.319> screen

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to keep this as fair as possible so

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.839 
to keep this as fair as possible so
which<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.349> hottest<00:01:55.529> 4k<00:01:56.069> video<00:01:56.369> recorder

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849

which was the hottest 4k video recorder
of<00:01:56.999> the<00:01:57.119> bunch<00:01:57.329> well<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.049> more<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.259> which

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
of the bunch well it's more like which

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.769 
of the bunch well it's more like which
were<00:01:58.859> the<00:01:59.069> hottest<00:01:59.279> 4k<00:01:59.909> video<00:02:00.209> recorders<00:02:00.630> of

were the hottest 4k video recorders of
the<00:02:00.840> bunch<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.469> Samsung<00:02:01.889> Galaxy<00:02:02.009> s5

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the bunch because the Samsung Galaxy s5

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.330 
the bunch because the Samsung Galaxy s5
and<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.149> Samsung<00:02:03.569> Galaxy<00:02:03.689> Note<00:02:03.989> 3<00:02:04.139> both<00:02:04.709> tied

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 both tied

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.389 
and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 both tied
in<00:02:05.639> last<00:02:06.359> place<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:07.619> both<00:02:07.919> of<00:02:07.950> these<00:02:08.160> have

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
in last place now both of these have

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.740 
in last place now both of these have
different<00:02:08.429> sensors<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.390> suggests

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
different sensors but it suggests

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.240 
different sensors but it suggests
there's<00:02:09.899> plenty<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.410> similar<00:02:10.830> background

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
there's plenty of similar background

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.950 
there's plenty of similar background
processes<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.240> generate<00:02:12.660> heat

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
processes going on that generate heat

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.750 
processes going on that generate heat
and<00:02:13.080> on

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
and on

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.339 
and on
top<00:02:13.879> of<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.180> they<00:02:14.299> both<00:02:14.540> have<00:02:14.810> ammo<00:02:15.170> LED

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
top of that they both have ammo LED

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.199 
top of that they both have ammo LED
screens<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:15.950> that's<00:02:16.129> an<00:02:16.280> interesting<00:02:16.819> one<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
screens so that's an interesting one to

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.880 
screens so that's an interesting one to
know<00:02:17.360> which<00:02:17.840> screen<00:02:18.379> is<00:02:18.409> going<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> generate

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
know which screen is going to generate

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.899 
know which screen is going to generate
more<00:02:19.370> heat

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
more heat

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.880 
more heat
well<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.450> suggests<00:02:20.629> that<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.170> mo<00:02:21.439> LEDs<00:02:21.650> well

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
well this suggests that the mo LEDs well

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.679 
well this suggests that the mo LEDs well
as<00:02:22.220> far<00:02:22.459> as<00:02:22.549> second<00:02:23.000> place<00:02:23.150> goes<00:02:23.420> this

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
as far as second place goes this

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.420 
as far as second place goes this
