00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.960
 So I have been here from a trade fair 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:11.429
 presented to the war and yes that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.059
 is the magnum bokko rescue knife and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.440
 yes I'm coming to something first 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.460
 me too much time so it just one 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.210
 one-hand operation blade 1400 liquid 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.430
 steel and on the street then that has 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.789
 knife still a bot schneider behind 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.279
 in it which also very good textiles 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.440
 actually can cut the same 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.460
 again us here and behind 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:46.020
 a glass burglar and that would be 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.789
 I all over again carries the knife as 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.770
 You can also serve a clip 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.920
 For example, here is always one of the top brands 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.239
 hold our hands 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.030
 without time you have always practical 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.579
 at hand and we really have to 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.500
 good match and now we come to 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.040
 practical and indeed great for example 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.970
 that can also be cut 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.970
 through the butter 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.410
 No problem for growth 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.300
 and the things from the beginning very tight 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:30.340
 You do not need them too often 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.710
 grind and cut everything very well 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.810
 and to you the god tailor too 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.600
 demonstrate that I have simply times 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.370
 taken to drive and that really no 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.550
 problem 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:49.800
 and yes 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.620
 Now let's see what we have 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.060
 Unfortunately, nothing else found out 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:01.340
 roÃŸtal to hinke but first jumps 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 also immediately if one meets immediately and 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.340
 ok tailor 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.880
 yes, that will really be any 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.340
 panzer glass now had to go again 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.810
 The band roll technique with the espa 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:28.760
 which is why two to three millimeters 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:31.900
 pawing and therefore always been going on 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.900
 the defenders 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.970
 because the knife synonymous a little thinner klinger 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.240
 you should not be so big sc 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.920
 collect the debris with the best 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.240
 technology robber and the sword car 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.010
 can be damaged 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.020
 but that too a little sons 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.670
 klinger has is also very high 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.950
 Soft as butter, it goes through thinner 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.350
 branches, for example, always here 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.350
 someday that's no problem 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.390
 OK 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.730
 that was actually already threatening many 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.730
 thanks from there to the next
