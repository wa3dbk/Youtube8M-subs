two types of acne scars that people get
the<00:00:29.429> first<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.849> called<00:00:30.060> an<00:00:30.240> icepick<00:00:30.720> scar<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the first is called an icepick scar and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.470 
the first is called an icepick scar and
that's<00:00:31.470> because<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.399> shape<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.210> scar

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that's because the shape of the scar

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.139 
that's because the shape of the scar
almost<00:00:34.230> looks<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:34.950> an<00:00:35.130> icepick<00:00:35.730> had

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
almost looks as if an icepick had

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.799 
almost looks as if an icepick had
pierced<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> skin<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:38.040> an<00:00:38.520> example<00:00:38.879> this

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
pierced the skin and as an example this

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.040
