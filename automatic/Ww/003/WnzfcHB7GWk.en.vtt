00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.250
 I hope you all go very well for 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.450
 my share is fine 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.040
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.290
 computer video about I was at 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.000
 6 almost two years ago 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.530
 that fifth opus of the big series 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.970
 theft auto the outings the fans 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.800
 start to react and asked 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.720
 some information about the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.250
 following the rockstar rockstar game that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.380
 has already responded to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.820
 some fans not disclosing then 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 some valuable information 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 I want to point out that its main 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.129
 information are serious sources 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.140
 rockstar while others are 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.140
 rumors at 2000 magnetized by being 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.219
 different editors of the game it takes 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 First know that I was not enough 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.739
 would not come out before the year 2018 or 2019 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.059
 even 2020 we are used to seeing 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.920
 gta every five years on average 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.079
 but rockstar will perhaps put more 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.210
 of time to develop the next gta 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.469
 on one side fans may be disappointed 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.239
 they will have to wait again 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.710
 four years to see a next opus 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.359
 but if the publisher has chosen to put 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.949
 more time to realize this game it's 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.050
 that it will be even better and probability to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.080
 5 they will have to make a sacred 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.180
 Assignment will be of a very high 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.740
 picture quality and main platform 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.830
 can accommodate this future game will be 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.560
 obviously the xbox on the ps4 and and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.780
 sorry pc for an old gen player but 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.840
 you can imagine very well that in 2018 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.550
 or 2019 ps3 and xbox 360 will already have 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.350
 well the patients standard of living the game 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.120
 will not be released on these consoles 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.940
 note that the main manufacturers of 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.710
 consoles that are microsoft xbox and sony 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.560
 for the playstation on no way of a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.150
 console every 7 89 in 2009 this will make 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.130
 six years that the law is the ps4 will be 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.320
 got out then rockstar bring out the game on 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.360
 the future platforms of microsoft and 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.100
 sony 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 now let's move on a very topic 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.060
 important for fans of the series 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.370
 the amap then started to map this gta 6 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.260
 leslie bendis the rockstar boss 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.600
 north recently said during a 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.130
 interview that the map will be gigantic and 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.300
 that merge the maps of some gta this 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.280
 would be a very good idea 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.810
 according to the revelations of the iss that 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.700
 banish are they very good news 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.610
 imagine a map with los santos 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.500
 gta5 liberty city jetta are still 26 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.330
 city of the GTA of the same name under your eyes 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.190
 so you can see what could 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.830
 look like amap of jk if these revelations 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.060
 home bundy's will be confirmed I hold 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.250
 still to clarify that some fans 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.709
 had the wonderful idea to see gt1 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.480
 in europe some in paris or london 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.040
 mike starr immediately answered no to 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.840
 these requests I want as you know 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.520
 very good rock star likes to make fun 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.930
 American companies and rhythm 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.489
 of American life 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.670
 they then announced that all the gta 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.080
 would happen in the united states when 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.400
 these are characters only one 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.020
 character as a character 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.100
 main to review the day despite the 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.900
 does that idea of three characters 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.160
 were very good the esl and belize has 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.510
 announced that embodying three 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.670
 main characters were really 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.040
 an idea of ​​gta 5 and that will make them 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.140
 surely not the same thing the seventies 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.060
 also in an interview told to 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.489
 reporters that m as a hero 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.709
 principal a female character was 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.810
 a very good idea and the CEO of north 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.060
 from rockstar north also said that the 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.010
 female character between the hero can see 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.790
 day on another guy share of rockstar 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.140
 like max payne or red dead redemption 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.430
 and finally a banal information 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.989
 but very important 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.400
 the development of these assisses called 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.720
 well started like these different 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.519
 images that show the personal of 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.650
 rockstar at work and we can see 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.120
 some screenshots of their work on 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.650
 particular computer of some 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.510
 places on the map and the next 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.910
 vehicles of all their amber projects 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.489
 so to finish a little quote 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.590
 from leslie bendis we still have 45 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.760
 years the idea to exploit then as much you 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.980
 to say that I was so red warned 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.790
 full eyes full view and that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.920
 since next 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.239
 this 6th is also likely to be moors 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.700
 the priest is then of the game should see 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.900
 days around autumn 2017 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.220
 two years before the game's release 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.870
 just like gta 5 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.940
 remember the first trailer was 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.739
 released on November 2, 2011 be a little 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.660
 less than two years before the game's release 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.610
 that's all for the info 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.530
 about I was at 6 I hope we 're going 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.000
 find each other 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.240
 new info I imagine that the you 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.240
 as well
