so we're gonna have a look at this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
so we're gonna have a look at this
privacy<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.300> first<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.629> or<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> most

privacy one the first one or the most

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.750 
privacy one the first one or the most

important thing is called location

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.979 
important thing is called location
services<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.649> location<00:00:52.649> services<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.870> in<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
services now location services is in a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.350 
services now location services is in a
simple<00:00:55.289> way<00:00:55.320> about<00:00:56.129> tracking<00:00:56.520> where<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.120> are

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
in the world and that app then

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.729 
in the world and that app then
customizing<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.600> based<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.559> what's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
customizing what you see based on what's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.130 
customizing what you see based on what's
around<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.270> information<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
at location services I've got it enabled

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.649 
at location services I've got it enabled
but<00:01:11.040> there's<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.549> whole<00:01:11.729> heap<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.210> stuff<00:01:12.479> in

here that you can set to not having on

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.490 
here that you can set to not having on
or<00:01:14.939> knowing<00:01:15.540> where<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.380> sort

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620 
or knowing where it is and all that sort
of<00:01:16.590> stuff<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:16.950> apps<00:01:17.520> generally<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> know

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
of stuff now apps generally like to know

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.330 
of stuff now apps generally like to know
where<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.470> developers<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
where you are and developers like to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859 
where you are and developers like to
know<00:01:20.460> where<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.670> are<00:01:20.729> simply<00:01:21.210> because<00:01:21.540> they

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 
so if we have a look at you know 7 News
here<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.159> app<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.909> turned<00:01:27.150> off<00:01:27.330> seven

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
here this app it's got turned off seven

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.390 
here this app it's got turned off seven
years<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.979> know<00:01:29.100> where<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
years would really like to know where I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.859 
years would really like to know where I
am<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> world<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.420> knew<00:01:30.600> where<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
am in the world so they knew where the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.039 
am in the world so they knew where the
user<00:01:31.079> base<00:01:31.290> was<00:01:32.180> generally<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.420> kind<00:01:33.900> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
user base was generally that's kind of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.859 
user base was generally that's kind of
what<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.439> use<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.040> location<00:01:35.610> services<00:01:36.119> for

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
what they use that location services for

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.260 
what they use that location services for
so<00:01:37.560> they<00:01:37.680> knew<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> damn<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> majority<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
so they knew the damn if the majority of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.819 
so they knew the damn if the majority of
people<00:01:39.659> were<00:01:39.780> using<00:01:39.960> their<00:01:40.380> app<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.770> they

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
people were using their app and they

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649 
people were using their app and they

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.660 
were in Perth Western Australia they
would<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.500> market<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.250> they

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
would see that as a market that they

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.249 
would see that as a market that they
could<00:01:45.229> lend<00:01:46.229> themselves<00:01:46.439> more<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:49.110> all

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
could lend themselves more to but it all

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
could lend themselves more to but it all
depends<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.710> what<00:01:49.890> you're<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.490> with

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
depends on what you're going to do with

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.340 
depends on what you're going to do with
location<00:01:51.149> services<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:51.930> talk<00:01:52.110> about

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
location services and when talk about

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.780 
location services and when talk about
how<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.590> works<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> look<00:01:53.640> on

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
how it works so if you have a look on

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.760 
how it works so if you have a look on
here<00:01:54.060> camera<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.020> cameras<00:01:55.470> got<00:01:55.649> like

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
here camera so cameras got like

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.100 
here camera so cameras got like
education<00:01:56.520> services<00:01:56.909> enabled<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
education services enabled now the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.959 
education services enabled now the
reason<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.890> from<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.640> perspective

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
reason for that is from my perspective

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.899 
reason for that is from my perspective
is<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> sometimes<00:02:01.460> photos<00:02:02.460> are<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.670> just

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
is it sometimes photos are not just

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.520 
is it sometimes photos are not just
photos<00:02:03.270> today<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.930> other<00:02:03.990> words<00:02:04.200> photos

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
photos today so in other words photos

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.990 
photos today so in other words photos
are<00:02:04.740> captured<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.250> over<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> world<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
are captured all over the world and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.609 
are captured all over the world and
where<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.210> are<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.659> when<00:02:07.229> you're<00:02:07.350> creating

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
where you are and when you're creating

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
where you are and when you're creating
different<00:02:08.009> products<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> has<00:02:09.569> what<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.750> call

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
different products it has what we call

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.680 
different products it has what we call
metadata<00:02:10.470> or<00:02:10.890> information<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:12.360> about

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
metadata or information that's about

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.730 
metadata or information that's about
where<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.140> was<00:02:13.319> taken

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
where that was taken

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.830 
where that was taken
so<00:02:13.920> when<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> take<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> photo<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.270> my<00:02:15.300> iPad<00:02:15.720> or

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so when I take a photo on my iPad or

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.690 
so when I take a photo on my iPad or
capture<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> photo<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.160> also<00:02:17.280> captured

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
capture the photo but it also captured

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.390 
capture the photo but it also captured
where<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:17.970> was<00:02:18.150> how<00:02:18.840> what<00:02:19.440> time<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.830> was<00:02:19.980> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
where it was how what time it was it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.070 
where it was how what time it was it
will<00:02:20.490> give<00:02:20.640> me<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.790> map<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.420> where<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.690> was<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
will give me a map of where it was and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.030 
will give me a map of where it was and
all<00:02:22.170> those<00:02:22.290> sorts<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.560> things<00:02:22.620> which<00:02:22.890> are

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
all those sorts of things which are

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.310 
all those sorts of things which are
great<00:02:23.280> tools<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.210> tracking<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.900> creating

why would I need that on it's because if

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.030 
why would I need that on it's because if
I<00:02:33.210> did<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.450> status<00:02:33.810> update<00:02:33.990> saying<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.680> was<00:02:34.860> with

I did a status update saying I was with
a<00:02:35.070> friend<00:02:35.280> at<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.680> local<00:02:37.680> winery<00:02:38.160> or<00:02:38.280> at

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
something like that then I could

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.350 
something like that then I could
pinpoint<00:02:40.770> where<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.190> am<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.550> say<00:02:41.730> come<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.120> you

we<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.250> go<00:02:47.280> into<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.700> little<00:02:47.790> bit<00:02:47.970> later

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
we can go into that a little bit later

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.550 
we can go into that a little bit later
but<00:02:48.390> you'll<00:02:48.570> see<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.900> there's<00:02:49.110> particular

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
next important step so down the bottom

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.620 
next important step so down the bottom
it<00:03:22.770> gives<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.040> great<00:03:23.250> explanation<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:24.270> what

all right this is the icon that's going
to<00:03:29.670> appear<00:03:29.760> up<00:03:30.210> in<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.510> top<00:03:30.720> right<00:03:30.990> when<00:03:31.860> this

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
to appear up in the top right when this

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.540 
to appear up in the top right when this
app<00:03:32.400> or<00:03:32.850> when<00:03:33.210> twitter<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.870> using<00:03:33.960> my<00:03:34.800> location

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
app or when twitter is using my location

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.300 
app or when twitter is using my location
to<00:03:36.300> send<00:03:36.660> me<00:03:36.870> information<00:03:37.170> or<00:03:37.620> using<00:03:38.100> some

sort of information about what I am the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.330 
sort of information about what I am the
boat<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:41.910> it's<00:03:42.180> purple<00:03:42.830> then<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:44.160> means

boat so if it's purple then it means

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.420 
boat so if it's purple then it means
that<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:45.000> app<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.210> going<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.050> recently<00:03:46.530> use<00:03:46.860> my

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
that the app is going to recently use my

that the app is going to recently use my
location<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.600> why<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.350> how<00:03:49.980> it's<00:03:50.280> totally<00:03:50.580> up

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
location and why and how it's totally up

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.860 
location and why and how it's totally up
to<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.880> app<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.030> what<00:03:51.360> permission<00:03:51.750> you've

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
to the app and what permission you've

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.900 
to the app and what permission you've
given<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:54.420> certainly<00:03:55.020> takes<00:03:55.530> some<00:03:56.130> battery

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
given it it certainly takes some battery

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.550 
given it it certainly takes some battery
