00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello how about friends and friends I am and 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.700
 good with respect to the previous video that 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.710
 I did where I show you the situation of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.929
 capulín this puppy that he had to 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.820
 operate the photo the little leg for not 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.309
 medical care weather 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.990
 we find here and go to the corner 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.970
 and he wanted to cross the street but the other 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.039
 I catch a car if it is carried by the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.480
 anti-rabies and the caretaker and told me that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.859
 tell me he was not interested if he but 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.720
 now mine that they more in operations 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.939
 there is but what good to do is going to 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 cost this too expensive and it was going to be 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.840
 around like five thousand pesos that yes 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.430
 I was counting on that money, I told him 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.809
 Well, the truth is that you do not waste your time 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.079
 that the poor animal goes on like this with his 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.079
 part 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.900
 yes 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.340
 and I want to propose something in what 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.350
 I want you to help me in what 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
 I want all of us to participate because the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.860
 only beneficiaries are going to be the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.239
 animals both need and then 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.190
 good what I want to propose those 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.020
 centers of surgeries at low cost which 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.269
 Well, we have already been working 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.070
 several surgeries have been performed at low 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.140
 cost such as sterilization is 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.540
 tumor operations resections of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 eyes amputations of limbs even 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.720
 chemotherapy and good this center 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.280
 I want it to work so that all 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.690
 people who do not have the resources 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 necessary do not have the resources 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.310
 enough to contact us and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 we give you very good prices 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.550
 accessible to attend to their 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.200
 pets because all the animals 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.210
 they have the right to receive medical attention 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.530
 veterinary and it's not fair that many 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.240
 people for lack of resources 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.899
 economic activities can not meet their 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.880
 animals then this this center of 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.560
 Low cost surgeries will be open 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.149
 for all the people that we 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.979
 like to help animals so they do not 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.810
 expensive than it costs and what help 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.190
 good that serves for people 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.050
 also that they do not have the 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.910
 necessary economic resources we have already 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.530
 done this type of activities in a 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.910
 place where they do not have the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.010
 conditions necessary to function 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.480
 however it is done because it is 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.340
 the good heart is made with a 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.210
 professional that is my friend the doctor 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.490
 arturo salah 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.260
 which I admire you very much I respect you very much 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.880
 for work and great effort and 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.680
 humanism that has and well I want 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.270
 make this place more professional to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.800
 tend to the animals and then the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.780
 support that I want to ask friends and 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.000
 friends is to help us to buy 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.710
 a stainless steel table a lamp 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.470
 of exploration and things that are basic 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.330
 to adequately attend to 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.550
 animals then if any of you 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.500
 like to cooperate to realize this 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.620
 project will be welcome either 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.510
 contribute something economic or that someone 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.970
 donate this type of real estate to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.920
 better serve the animals and light 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.630
 I have the place to serve them, we only 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.310
 lack furniture and strength and 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.200
 you want so that many people can 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.910
 understand their animals on time and not 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.500
 happen as what happened as a capulín that 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.630
 unfortunately for not receiving 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.370
 medical attention immediately because you are 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.170
 had to amputate his patina let's avoid 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.060
 these situations happen and we avoid that 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.709
 more animals suffer from this situation 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.270
 and we're going to help people over 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.709
 all to the animals so that they have a 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.240
 place to turn to when 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.490
 they also need people 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.440
 who want to help us with sutures of 10 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.950
 of 'double zero' healing material in 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.250
 general 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.930
 It is cotton from iodine bandages 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.459
 gentian violet all that kind of 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.989
 things are greens are welcome because 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.400
 they will be there at the service of the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.200
 animals that need it in this 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.030
 place will be like I repeat at low cost 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.280
 because you have to buy medicines 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.569
 controlled as anesthetics and good 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.580
 that someone would also like to donate 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.470

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.860

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.370
 but professional in which I do not know 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.410
 discriminates against any animal and that 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.840
 all the animals have the attention 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.790
