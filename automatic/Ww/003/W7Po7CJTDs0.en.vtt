00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670 

mine<00:00:00.890> yeah<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:02.129> think<00:00:02.580> that<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.750> key<00:00:03.990> here<00:00:04.319> is

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
mine yeah I think that the key here is

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.660 
mine yeah I think that the key here is
that<00:00:06.230> the<00:00:07.230> status<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.859> Puerto<00:00:08.099> Rico<00:00:08.370> should<00:00:08.519> be

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
that the status of Puerto Rico should be

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.660 
that the status of Puerto Rico should be
decided<00:00:09.179> by<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:10.469> residents<00:00:10.920> appointed<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
decided by the residents appointed and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.859 
decided by the residents appointed and
so<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.500> issue<00:00:14.210> for<00:00:15.210> us<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.630> if<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:17.869> Clemmie

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
so the issue for us is if the Clemmie

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.540 
so the issue for us is if the Clemmie
site<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> referendum<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:19.980> takes<00:00:20.310> place

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
site if the referendum that takes place

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.070 
site if the referendum that takes place
in<00:00:20.730> Puerto<00:00:20.850> Rico<00:00:21.470> indicates<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:23.960> there<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
in Puerto Rico indicates that there is a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.380 
in Puerto Rico indicates that there is a
strong<00:00:25.560> preference<00:00:27.140> from<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.470> majority<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
strong preference from a majority of the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.749 
strong preference from a majority of the
Puerto<00:00:30.660> Rican<00:00:30.929> people<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.460> think<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.610> will

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
Puerto Rican people I think that will

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.040 
Puerto Rican people I think that will
influence<00:00:33.180> how<00:00:33.390> Congress<00:00:34.250> approaches<00:00:36.050> any

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
influence how Congress approaches any

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
influence how Congress approaches any
actions<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.620> might<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.890> taken<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:39.120> address

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
actions that might be taken to address

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.979 
actions that might be taken to address
status<00:00:39.930> issues<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.780> split<00:00:42.780> down<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
status issues if it's split down the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.090 
status issues if it's split down the
middle<00:00:43.230> 5050<00:00:43.980> or<00:00:44.719> 5149<00:00:45.770> then<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> think

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
middle 5050 or 5149 then I think

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.830 
middle 5050 or 5149 then I think
Congress<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.640> inclination<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> be

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
Congress is inclination is going to be

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.029 
Congress is inclination is going to be
not<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> change<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:51.469> maintain<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.800> status

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
not to change but to maintain the status

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.130 
not to change but to maintain the status
quo<00:00:53.190> until<00:00:54.350> there's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:56.270> greater<00:00:57.270> indication

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
quo until there's a greater indication

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.670 
quo until there's a greater indication
that<00:00:58.289> there<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.530> support<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.980> change<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:00.809> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that there is support for change but you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.770 
that there is support for change but you
know<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.760> task<00:01:03.030> force<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.570> put

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
know what the task force that I put

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.820 
know what the task force that I put
forward<00:01:04.049> did<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.040> think<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:07.320> examine

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
forward did I think was was to examine

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.310 
forward did I think was was to examine
all<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> arguments<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.729> every<00:01:08.970> side<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.140> so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
all the arguments on every side to do so

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500 
all the arguments on every side to do so
in<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> fair<00:01:10.740> way<00:01:10.979> unbiased<00:01:11.760> way<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.270> not

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
in a fair way unbiased way I'm not

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.770 
in a fair way unbiased way I'm not
trying<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> put<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> thumb<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> scale<00:01:14.780> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
trying to put the thumb on the scale and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.090 
trying to put the thumb on the scale and
say<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.810> well-structured

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
say that a well-structured

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.270 
say that a well-structured
website<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.369> well-structured<00:01:21.860> referendum<00:01:22.860> in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
website a well-structured referendum in

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.399 
website a well-structured referendum in
Puerto<00:01:23.580> Rico<00:01:23.970> could<00:01:24.509> help<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> determine<00:01:25.110> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
Puerto Rico could help to determine this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.550 
Puerto Rico could help to determine this
and<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.549> what<00:01:26.700> we've<00:01:26.850> also<00:01:27.780> recommended

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and I think what we've also recommended

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
and I think what we've also recommended
although<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.040> has<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.400> yet<00:01:29.430> been<00:01:29.700> adopted

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
although this has not yet been adopted

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.920 
although this has not yet been adopted
is<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.439> inconclusive<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:33.479> can

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
is that if it's inconclusive then we can

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.469 
is that if it's inconclusive then we can
set<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.380> process<00:01:34.890> you're<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.790> Congress<00:01:36.299> that

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
set up a process you're in Congress that

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.210 
set up a process you're in Congress that
would<00:01:37.430> lead<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:39.320> further<00:01:40.320> examination<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
would lead to further examination of

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
would lead to further examination of
what<00:01:41.400> our<00:01:41.520> options<00:01:41.700> would<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.899> for

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
what our options would be but but for

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.490 
what our options would be but but for
now<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.610> most<00:01:44.790> important<00:01:45.329> thing<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.140> is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
now the most important thing I think is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.370 
now the most important thing I think is
to<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.490> clear<00:01:48.299> sense<00:01:49.259> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to see if there's a clear sense of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
to see if there's a clear sense of
direction<00:01:49.439> from<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> Puerto<00:01:50.490> Rican<00:01:50.759> people

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
direction from the Puerto Rican people

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.660 
direction from the Puerto Rican people
themselves<00:01:51.680> if<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:53.130> continue<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> be

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
themselves if they continue to be

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.920 
themselves if they continue to be
divided<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.240> hard<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.540> imagine<00:01:54.720> that

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
divided it's hard to imagine that

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.100 
divided it's hard to imagine that
Congress<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.500> 4va<00:01:56.210> wanting<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.360> impose<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
Congress is 4va wanting to impose a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.219 
Congress is 4va wanting to impose a
single<00:01:58.770> solution<00:01:59.399> on<00:02:00.920> them<00:02:02.630> as<00:02:03.630> representing

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
single solution on them as representing

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.679 
single solution on them as representing
this<00:02:04.460> discretion<00:02:05.460> came<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.180> repeatedly

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
this discretion came for you repeatedly

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.129 
this discretion came for you repeatedly
on<00:02:07.290> social<00:02:07.770> secur
