00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
that picture how can you prepare

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.980 
that picture how can you prepare
yourself<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.409> perhaps<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
scenes of things like that I mean it's a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.100 
scenes of things like that I mean it's a
difficult<00:02:11.060> one<00:02:11.210> to<00:02:11.270> answer<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.750> know<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.900> mean

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
difficult one to answer you know I mean

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.510 
difficult one to answer you know I mean
we<00:02:12.320> all<00:02:12.440> join<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.680> military<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.400> all

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
we all join the military and all

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.370 
we all join the military and all
accepted<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.360> we'd<00:02:14.510> see<00:02:14.720> things<00:02:14.990> possibly

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
accepted that we'd see things possibly

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.990 
accepted that we'd see things possibly
that<00:02:15.530> we<00:02:15.590> wouldn't<00:02:15.770> otherwise<00:02:15.860> see<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.880> do

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
that we wouldn't otherwise see and do

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.250 
that we wouldn't otherwise see and do
things<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.300> might<00:02:17.450> otherwise<00:02:17.570> do<00:02:17.900> both<00:02:18.080> good

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
things we might otherwise do both good

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.680 
things we might otherwise do both good
and<00:02:18.350> bad<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.830> think<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.490> know<00:02:19.640> it's<00:02:20.390> down<00:02:20.570> to

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
and bad I think you know it's down to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.390 
and bad I think you know it's down to
the<00:02:20.780> individual<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.470> we're<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:21.980> close-knit

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
the individual and we're a close-knit

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.190 
the individual and we're a close-knit
squadron<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.270> we're<00:02:23.630> there<00:02:23.780> for<00:02:23.810> each<00:02:24.050> other

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
squadron and we're there for each other

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.010 
squadron and we're there for each other
this<00:02:25.010> will<00:02:25.160> be<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.430> sevens<00:02:25.940> final<00:02:26.420> spin<00:02:26.780> in

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
this will be it for sevens final spin in

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.230 
this will be it for sevens final spin in
the<00:02:27.110> older<00:02:27.530> Lynx<00:02:27.860> helicopters<00:02:28.010> when<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.000> get

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
the older Lynx helicopters when I get

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.600 
the older Lynx helicopters when I get
back<00:02:29.450> they'll<00:02:29.720> transfer<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.710> new<00:02:30.890> Wildcat

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
back they'll transfer to the new Wildcat

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.520 
back they'll transfer to the new Wildcat
I<00:02:31.970> think<00:02:32.750> it'd<00:02:32.810> be<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.960> very<00:02:33.020> different

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
I think it'd be a very different

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.720 
I think it'd be a very different
challenge<00:02:33.710> because<00:02:34.160> we're<00:02:34.310> going<00:02:34.430> through<00:02:34.670> a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
challenge because we're going through a

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.450 
challenge because we're going through a
course<00:02:35.500> where<00:02:36.500> we<00:02:36.650> learn<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.070> fly<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.400> operate

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
course where we learn to fly and operate

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.040 
course where we learn to fly and operate
the<00:02:37.850> aircraft<00:02:37.970> where<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.540> learn<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.870> maintain

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
the aircraft where we learn to maintain

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.930 
the aircraft where we learn to maintain
the<00:02:39.440> aircraft<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.130> then<00:02:40.220> we'll<00:02:40.400> be<00:02:40.520> hopefully

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the aircraft and then we'll be hopefully

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.160 
the aircraft and then we'll be hopefully
taking<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.330> back<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.510> seeing<00:02:41.900> our<00:02:41.990> more

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
taking it back to seeing our more

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.890 
taking it back to seeing our more
