00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.809 

couple<00:04:06.230> more<00:04:06.350> notes<00:04:06.530> about<00:04:06.830> this<00:04:07.069> one<00:04:07.400> is<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
couple more notes about this one is the

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.340 
couple more notes about this one is the
timing<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.569> when<00:04:09.050> you<00:04:09.200> start<00:04:09.530> here<00:04:11.230> not<00:04:12.230> at

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
timing of it when you start here not at

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.780 
timing of it when you start here not at
the<00:04:12.440> beginning<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.069> measure<00:04:13.310> that's<00:04:13.580> not

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
the beginning of a measure that's not

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.130 
the beginning of a measure that's not
your<00:04:14.000> downbeat<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:14.660> if<00:04:14.750> you're<00:04:14.870> trying<00:04:14.990> to

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
your downbeat so if you're trying to

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.289 
your downbeat so if you're trying to
plug<00:04:15.350> this<00:04:15.530> into<00:04:15.800> a<00:04:16.519> song

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
plug this into a song

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.050 
plug this into a song
you<00:04:17.810> this<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.109> your<00:04:18.290> down<00:04:18.650> B<00:04:18.859> right<00:04:19.100> here<00:04:19.340> that

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
you this is your down B right here that

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.480 
you this is your down B right here that
first<00:04:20.359> hammer<00:04:20.750> on<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:21.739> if<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:21.950> were<00:04:22.070> counting

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
first hammer on so if you were counting

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.060 
first hammer on so if you were counting
this<00:04:22.700> out<00:04:23.240> loud<00:04:23.540> in<00:04:23.750> 4/4<00:04:24.169> time<00:04:24.200> you<00:04:24.710> would<00:04:24.860> you

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
this out loud in 4/4 time you would you

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.610 
this out loud in 4/4 time you would you
would<00:04:25.190> lead<00:04:25.430> into<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.910> this<00:04:26.060> way<00:04:26.270> one<00:04:26.810> two

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
would lead into it this way one two

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.280 
would lead into it this way one two
three<00:04:31.090> okay<00:04:32.090> so<00:04:32.240> these<00:04:32.480> are<00:04:32.540> actually<00:04:33.080> eighth

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
three okay so these are actually eighth

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:52.810 
three okay so these are actually eighth
notes<00:04:33.620> 1<00:04:34.130> 2<00:04:34.850> 3<00:04:37.690> ok<00:04:38.690> so<00:04:38.900> it's<00:04:39.230> on<00:04:39.410> them<00:04:39.820> 1<00:04:40.820> 2<00:04:41.600> 3

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.330 

so<00:04:53.450> it's<00:04:53.840> probably<00:04:54.080> best<00:04:54.530> used<00:04:54.800> as<00:04:55.040> a<00:04:55.070> little

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
so it's probably best used as a little

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.070 
so it's probably best used as a little
bit<00:04:55.460> faster<00:04:55.880> than<00:04:56.060> kind<00:04:56.270> of<00:04:56.360> a<00:04:56.480> bluegrass

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
bit faster than kind of a bluegrass

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.770 
bit faster than kind of a bluegrass
banjo<00:04:57.410> type<00:04:57.830> of<00:04:58.010> speed

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.050 

we're<00:05:03.530> gone<00:05:03.680> smoothing<00:05:04.190> out<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:04.490> roll<00:05:04.730> so

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
we're gone smoothing out that roll so

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.510 
we're gone smoothing out that roll so
that<00:05:05.210> it<00:05:05.330> works<00:05:05.540> and<00:05:06.100> and<00:05:07.100> then<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.400> other

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
that it works and and then the other

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.420 
that it works and and then the other
other<00:05:08.210> comment<00:05:08.630> I<00:05:08.840> get<00:05:09.710> asked<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.010> lot<00:05:10.040> about

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
other comment I get asked a lot about

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.060 
other comment I get asked a lot about
what<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.150> do<00:05:11.300> with<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:12.230> pinkie<00:05:12.650> on<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.830> right

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
what to do with the pinkie on the right

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.190 
what to do with the pinkie on the right
hand<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.580> this<00:05:13.700> is<00:05:13.760> an<00:05:14.000> example<00:05:14.480> where<00:05:14.720> I<00:05:15.020> do

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
hand and this is an example where I do

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.590 
hand and this is an example where I do
like<00:05:15.590> to<00:05:15.740> anchor<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.280> pinkie<00:05:16.670> on<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:17.420> face<00:05:17.570> of

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
like to anchor the pinkie on the face of

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.780 
like to anchor the pinkie on the face of
the<00:05:17.870> guitar<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.740> may<00:05:18.920> or<00:05:19.070> may<00:05:19.190> not<00:05:19.220> want<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.700> do

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
the guitar you may or may not want to do

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.750 
the guitar you may or may not want to do
this<00:05:19.940> it's<00:05:20.180> not<00:05:20.240> required<00:05:20.660> but<00:05:21.110> for<00:05:21.860> a<00:05:21.890> faster

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
this it's not required but for a faster

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.850 
this it's not required but for a faster
rolling<00:05:23.600> style<00:05:23.900> picking<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.410> find<00:05:24.680> that<00:05:24.800> that

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
rolling style picking I find that that

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.460 
rolling style picking I find that that
helps<00:05:25.310> stabilize<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.840> right<00:05:27.050> hand<00:05:27.290> and

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
helps stabilize the right hand and

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.350 
helps stabilize the right hand and
especially<00:05:27.950> because<00:05:28.100> we're<00:05:28.460> only<00:05:28.670> playing<00:05:29.030> on

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
especially because we're only playing on

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.770 
especially because we're only playing on
the<00:05:30.290> on<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.770> smaller<00:05:31.070> strings<00:05:31.550> down<00:05:32.150> lower

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
the on the smaller strings down lower

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.450 
the on the smaller strings down lower
here<00:05:33.140> your<00:05:33.290> hand<00:05:33.500> can<00:05:33.740> stay<00:05:33.980> in<00:05:34.160> a<00:05:34.250> pretty

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
here your hand can stay in a pretty

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.570 
here your hand can stay in a pretty
tight<00:05:34.790> you<00:05:35.780> know<00:05:36.290> I<00:05:36.320> really<00:05:36.620> do<00:05:36.770> a<00:05:36.800> fist<00:05:37.190> but

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
tight you know I really do a fist but

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.659 
tight you know I really do a fist but
but<00:05:37.910> a<00:05:37.940> nice<00:05:38.150> close

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.820 

and<00:05:41.449> you<00:05:41.689> can<00:05:41.840> keep<00:05:41.990> it<00:05:42.169> nice<00:05:42.349> and<00:05:42.379> steady

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
and you can keep it nice and steady

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.890 
and you can keep it nice and steady
anchored<00:05:43.340> with<00:05:43.520> that<00:05:43.699> pinky<00:05:44.090> you<00:05:44.539> don't<00:05:44.689> have

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
anchored with that pinky you don't have

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.400 
anchored with that pinky you don't have
to<00:05:45.080> do<00:05:45.229> that<00:05:45.379> you<00:05:45.530> can<00:05:45.680> keep<00:05:45.830> it<00:05:46.009> up

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.050 

there's<00:05:51.770> no<00:05:51.890> right<00:05:52.100> or<00:05:52.130> wrong<00:05:52.280> on<00:05:52.610> that<00:05:52.820> but
