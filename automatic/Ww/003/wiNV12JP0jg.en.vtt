external links where people have thought

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.720 
external links where people have thought
it<00:00:33.510> was<00:00:33.630> good<00:00:33.809> enough<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.260> link<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.829> bloggers

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730

social networking bookmarking tools and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.569 
social networking bookmarking tools and
because<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.350> had<00:00:40.770> some<00:00:41.100> good<00:00:41.280> search

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
because of that we had some good search

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.319 
because of that we had some good search
engine<00:00:42.110> ranking<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.890> Google<00:00:44.399> liked<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.120> page

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
engine ranking so Google liked the page

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.540 
engine ranking so Google liked the page
it<00:00:45.660> gave<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> page<00:00:46.410> rank<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> 5<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.280> 10

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it gave it a page rank of 5 out of 10

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.880 
it gave it a page rank of 5 out of 10
which<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> kind<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> rudimentary<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
which is a kind of rudimentary way of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.220 
which is a kind of rudimentary way of
measuring<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.820> quality<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.629> page<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
measuring the quality of the page and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.799 
measuring the quality of the page and
that<00:00:52.949> quality<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.430> based<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.390> number<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that quality is based on the number of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.170 
that quality is based on the number of
Link's<00:00:55.110> coming<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.520> quality<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
Link's coming in and the quality of the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.750 
Link's coming in and the quality of the
content<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:58.079> homonym<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.980> whole<00:00:59.280> host<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.699> things

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
content a homonym a whole host of things

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.840 
content a homonym a whole host of things
really<00:01:00.649> effectively<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:02.309> our<00:01:02.430> new<00:01:02.640> web

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
really effectively with our new web

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.090 
really effectively with our new web
structure<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.840> page<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.830> move

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
structure that page was going to move

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.530 
structure that page was going to move
now<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.479> moved<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.470> folder<00:01:08.510> to<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
now it moved from one folder to a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.030 
now it moved from one folder to a
different<00:01:09.960> structure<00:01:10.200> which<00:01:10.740> basically

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
different structure which basically

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
different structure which basically
meant<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> existing<00:01:12.000> web<00:01:12.150> page<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> old

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
meant the existing web page or the old

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.080 
meant the existing web page or the old
web<00:01:13.080> page<00:01:13.350> wasn't<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.430> anymore<00:01:14.700> saw<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
web page wasn't there anymore saw the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.859 
web page wasn't there anymore saw the
links<00:01:15.540> weren't<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.500> pointing<00:01:17.369> anywhere

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
links weren't actually pointing anywhere

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
links weren't actually pointing anywhere
now<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.500> control<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:20.100> own<00:01:20.130> website

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
now because you control your own website

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.060 
now because you control your own website
it's<00:01:21.390> very<00:01:21.659> easy<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.080> set<00:01:22.439> your<00:01:22.560> internal

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it's very easy to set your internal

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.390 
it's very easy to set your internal
links<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.580> sort<00:01:23.880> those<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.920> your<00:01:25.920> external

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
links and sort those out your external

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.359 
links and sort those out your external
links<00:01:26.790> obviously<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.330> still<00:01:27.840> linking<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
links obviously are still linking to the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
links obviously are still linking to the
old<00:01:29.549> page<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.479> obviously<00:01:30.930> unless<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.409> go

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
old page now obviously unless you go

can't really change it's quite task the

period of time that will disappear out

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.999

purposes is a new page so one way of
getting<00:02:07.049> around<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> create<00:02:07.979> this

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
getting around that is to create this

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.900 
getting around that is to create this
301<00:02:08.789> redirect<00:02:09.330> page

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
301 redirect page

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.390 
301 redirect page
is<00:02:09.970> effectively<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.570> page<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:10.870> says<00:02:11.400> where

it's great because anyone who links on

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.280 
it's great because anyone who links on
the<00:02:21.010> existing<00:02:21.700> link<00:02:21.940> will<00:02:22.540> automatically

the existing link will automatically

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.880 
the existing link will automatically
just<00:02:23.530> be<00:02:23.740> pushed<00:02:24.040> through<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.000> new<00:02:25.180> page

just be pushed through to the new page

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.920 
just be pushed through to the new page
the<00:02:26.890> search<00:02:27.160> engines<00:02:27.610> come<00:02:27.880> along<00:02:28.150> take<00:02:28.900> a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
the search engines come along take a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.810 
the search engines come along take a
look<00:02:29.140> at<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.350> 301<00:02:29.680> redirect<00:02:30.430> which<00:02:30.610> has<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
look at the 301 redirect which has a

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.750 
look at the 301 redirect which has a
piece<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.090> code<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.540> says<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.710> page<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.400> now

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
piece of code that says that page is now

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.960 
piece of code that says that page is now
over<00:02:34.270> here<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.590> search<00:02:35.830> engine<00:02:36.340> changes

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970

over here so the search engine changes
its<00:02:37.150> listing<00:02:37.660> takes<00:02:38.320> out<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.530> old<00:02:38.770> page<00:02:39.040> and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
its listing takes out the old page and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.000 
its listing takes out the old page and
put<00:02:39.370> your<00:02:39.610> new<00:02:39.730> one<00:02:39.940> in<00:02:40.500> theoretically<00:02:41.500> all
