00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.830
 1 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.430
 I 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.480
 they expect from 150,000 people I 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.720
 know it's one of the events 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.279
 mediatized sportspeople in the world and that's 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.230
 true that one reinforces oneself even well 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.190
 when we can go in the paws a 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.410
 stroke 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.940
 but we do not start there from just 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.940
 around the cars stands 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.510
 no 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.580
 yeah that's it's part of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.200
 mythical cars so here it is 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.290
 names like that slamming alpine sa 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.310
 resonance with someone in my family 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.200
 who had a berlinette alpine that and 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.220
 it's true that I remember her 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.460
 was beautiful what was it 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.140
 which stood out a lot of elegance 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.480
 and something modern 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.190
 I think I had a little renault 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.050
 alpine in miniature when I was a kid 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.720
 in my opinion like many children 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.630
 by the way and of course seaweed politics 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.510
 I knew the name and it's a pleasure 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.520
 to find the alpine all in a future 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.520
 close is in any case on the 20 80 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.030
 what I see is that it's a 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.650
 equipped work and that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.220
 we do not have to be the biggest 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.229
 no longer strong or have the most money 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.150
 to win we did in fact we are 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.400
 come to tap into the story tap into 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.159
 what was alpine fort already the logo 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.200
 the to the arrow which is really 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.369
 extremely strong extremely striking the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.360
 second element obviously this is the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.750
 blue alpine blue 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.159
 that's a structuring element llama is 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.570
 in fact we came already worked with 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.190
 its codes we added a color 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.149
 complementary which is the orange is in 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.740
 it's something we were going 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.330
 draw on elements also in 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.420
 the story eg heroux gotti on 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.250
 the d alpine a110 or the 1 220 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.360
 lack had orange headlights 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.220
 what did the harvest 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.020
 that's it and that's really an identity 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.630
 very strong that we wanted to develop 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.709
 and how much today transferred on the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.450
 car mans big braking is a 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.090
 auto if a car that is very very 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.220
 pleasant to drive because at high 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.600
 speed plus more we are more 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.069
 we have aero load plus we have 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.019
 charge then she's stable purists 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.850
 steadfast that the election will pay them the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.850
 charge his bottomless supports 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.830
 since the beginning of the week it's 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.440
 really very very hard we had 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.220
 conditions really very complicated in 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.630
 qualifiers a lot of stops a lot of 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.500
 settings to manage to work on 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.150
 the set up of the car 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.470
 and then at the beginning of the race very 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.000
 complicated with a strap 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.860
 of alternator following an unfortunate 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.900
 pebbles a puncture following a piece 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.640
 wheels of a car that had a 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.090
 crash or one of two very races 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.980
 difficult 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.270
 but despite everything but we are well 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.620
 back up we showed that we were 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.930
 performant and that in the future I think 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.280
 we will want to count on us because 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.520
 we have a good crew a good team 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.080
 we went back from 48th to 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.090
 16th place that went pretty 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.680
 amazing enough remarkable and who 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.689
 translated well this time 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.170
 acid and all the active team 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:17.530
 we are happy torments his 35 years 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.150
 that there has not been and we discover a 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.220
 very new world but at the same time 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.720
 we also discover that it is an activity 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.500
 really that requires a lot of humility 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.500
 and of rigor 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.140
 it's exciting because in fact we have 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.390
 want to see this car win 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.879
 maybe not this year because we 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.500
 is in 2nd category 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:44.510
 but I think in the years 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.510
 future alps he can win the mans 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.410
 hello we're second in the championship 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.180
 so we will try to get them 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.370
 the first place and we have the last 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.450
 race happening in France so that 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.340
 was great I think we'll be 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.780
 supported in addition we did tests there 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.860
 down so it was castellet we did 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.709
 the best times so 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.090
 so we are confident so I hope to see 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.330
 many over there at the puzzle for us 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.330
 support
