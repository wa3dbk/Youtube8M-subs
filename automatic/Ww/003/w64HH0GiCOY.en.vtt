00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.270
 The whole range of benefiting from this stage that has just started at the end shows that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 you do not have to be a great expert to make an artist 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.630
 hi be letterists in lakes because we are going to reduce the heads 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.390
 Attentive to this craft they know that they have declared ranks 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.800
 framed chopard cholos you like how it becomes very simple to start 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.430
 clear a cashier your house but the big box 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.940
 cases like these that from here 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.769
 example this is ideal for morality 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.690
 the next step is to extract 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.390
 the front of the box so you'll get something like this 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.409
 let's notice the front part and the inside the blue ink 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.330
 you can paint it 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
 we could do this 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.220
 You can cut gift paper the striking color drawing paper so that 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.270
 are the same size as the inside of the box 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.800
 put some inside glue 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.720
 A) Yes 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 and paste it 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.670
 afp a brand life on one of the sides now I want 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.780
 place the box on top of some plasticine and with a sharp pencil and 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.240
 very careful afp a hole in the cardboard 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.310
 that is large and exploded nor the thickness of the track 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.860
 for the frame, place the package on top of a colored cardboard 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.420
 and step its outline 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.070
 bock and tan pack and draw a smaller rectangle inside 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.070
 one centimeter from the other 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 this will be the interior of the sea as 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.470
 This is the basic structure of our framework, you have seen and 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.780
 so that a funny molony boat is not transformed is what we need 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.109
 It is an average chen paper tube from 9 to 15 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:59.429
 the localized 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.429
 Well let's go to Mastromarco, did not mark molano 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.910
 with what he had in a corner of the rectangle and reviewed his outline with 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.910
 great care 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:16.109
 do the same in the other corners 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.419
 draw 1 Wed a dunghill between each of the circles as well as 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.469
 very well 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.719
 co when you're done with what cuts the middle part 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:29.749
 the outside 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.949
 inti career something like this 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:37.809
 turn it around and decorate it with spirals so you can use felt tip pens 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:38.469
 colors 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.219
 a gold marker like this that gives a great look 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.920
 decorates the entire frame in the same way 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.920
 until it is on the line like this 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:54.579
 When you have finished decorating it, turn it over and place the package between the 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.979
 girls in pencil 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:58.799
 he has urged very well 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.799
 say the opposite 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.450
 He spoke very carefully checking that they are well attached to the frame 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.209
 Well then let's see how it has been in our frame here 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.500
 we have peace seen 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.559
 burned and perfect and if you look 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:24.509
 I have covered the back with wrapping paper so it is perfect for nothing 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.129
 now the next step is to catch let's clear up your size 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.129
 head 6 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:33.899
 sanchez 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:34.989
 no longer 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.169
 Unless they realized it leads once I think this seems a little bit 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.000
 I worked important is that not who should take him out do not give 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.179
 generation of weights 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:50.919
 hold the balloon and do not let the law escape 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.349
 now he drew a funny face with a permanent marker 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.180
 You can also use a pen 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.359
 but read carefully you can burst the balloon 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.359
 and busting does not matter until others 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.399
 very good so 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:09.749
 as you want 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.439
 when you have finished the face 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.669
 they let out the air and very slowly 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.350
 until the balloon has been reduced to the size of your fist so you see 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.049
 perfect 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.389
 check that it fits inside the frame and if it does not fit 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.860
 let out a little more air 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 and carefully tie a knot in the balloon 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.330
 If you do not know, ask for more help 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.099
 now netuno through the hole at the bottom of the box 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.260
 Maybe it costs you a little but keep trying until you get it 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.610
 2 kahlo and place them face forward 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.450
 well let's see our results here is 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.670
 our reduced head within the sea as the most seen that paint have 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.090
 people like sobrero ana papak 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.110

 head 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:42.419
 although brown the pineda age this is worth it and we are still here in harpa pac

 I think that funny of their heads even actually work 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.460
 but in advance cut out the front of a package or box 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.889
 little ones can see it inside happen then share the gift all 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:14.799
 height hole at the bottom with a mba draws the contour of the box 

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:18.979
 on a colored cardboard and it is a smaller box inside for the frame 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.050
