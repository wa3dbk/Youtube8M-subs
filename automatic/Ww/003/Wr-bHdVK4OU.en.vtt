00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.599
 look wider there and everyone dreams to see 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.299
 how will this race end 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.910
 k it depends it than pilots so 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.560
 we wish them good luck 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.330
 English studio lookout masters can be 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.770
 rightly accused of many but 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.230
 Catch and in a quickie in principle 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.550
 impossible to release your next race 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.259
 no matter what name 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.090
 developers succeed every time with 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.919
 the virtuosity of the tightrope walker 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.900
 between shameless copying themselves 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.150
 yourself and trying to make an accessible game 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.699
 at mario kart level only with bmw and audi 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.140
 on the cover of the game studio is usually the same 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.879
 interesting as for people tired of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 suspension settings in gran turismo and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.360
 for those who think that car 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.519
 simulators it's just as difficult 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.050
 simulator submarines and let's say rover 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.879
 while the developers like 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.129
 pretentious postmodern artists 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.350
 make bright races that attract 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.000
 attention and nothing else you are unlikely 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 want to rewrite the first part now 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.079
 burning or going for their time they 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.309
 were almost perfect but today 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.850
 hardly anyone will become them 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.850
 admire 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.660
 grid autosport is not strong 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.910
 out of the general number of races 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.800
 English studio is just as nice here 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.960
 and moderately complex car physics 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.970
 and its engine is still capable 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 generate beautiful sunsets and high 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.510
 detailed smoke from under the wheels together 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.310
 so and the developers don't roll into 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.780
 banalism throwing a pile on the player 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.400
 sports car tracks 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.620
 they are measured in advance 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.360
 a planned route with little or no 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.580
 There are choices in this approach. 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.020
 at the same time pros and cons with one 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.490
 parties we don't need to be distracted from 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.320
 races on the difficult setting of the car 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.480
 although optionally this possibility 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.950
 still there is on the other hand we even 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.550
 pick up a car for a ride not in 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.140
 condition 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.610
 authors prudently limited 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.200
 choice of sponsors each of which 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.200
 your own set of transport 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.000
 if earlier authors are different types of races 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.400
 tried to somehow devote separate 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.020
 the grid autosport projects immediately about everything 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.720
 5 types of competitions are available to players 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.280
 car racing hit 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.870
 under the wtcc category 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.460
 night endurance competitions 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.080
 open car competition 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.300
 the wheels of the race are stuffed with the main ones 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.250
 cars and ordinary city races 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.200
 from the rich studio portfolio is not here 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.850
 unless rally competitions you have 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.110
 suspicion that it is only because 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.090
 next project codemasters 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.090
 will be just coming off-road 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.530
 Masters consistently disassembled all 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.480
 I chose my previous works from there 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.340
 best components and made of everything 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.630
 this giant frankenstein 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.490
 which can quite bearable 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.320
 move around and even possesses like you 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.030
 no personality course with 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.690
 The transfer suffered many important nuances 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.370
 for example if in f1 2013 the formula pain hurts 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.410
 drove off the paved road on 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.150
 the ground then on the tires then there was sand 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.040
 which greatly worsened the coupling with 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.670
 dear grid autosport this item where 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.410
 then gone 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.300
 the same applies to racing under 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.460
 rain during which the car on the track 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.390
 behaved quite differently in the new grid 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.390
 they are simply not there 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.819
 however it does not detract at all 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.709
 merits of the game if you leave boring 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.910
 caving in on yourself and start to perceive 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.739
 all the spark from another beautiful 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.930
 arcade with a claim something from the game can 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.730
 get a lot of fun developers 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.650
 cleverly sorted familiar car 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.269
 stamps first give us a ride on 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.989
 brands hatch then we take a look at 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.250
 redbull ring 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.110
 well, and finally we will be presented 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.660
 hockenheimring authors by all means 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.849
 try to justify the name of the game and they 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.530
 it turns out the scrupulous English 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.629
 created many iconic sports 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.459
 cars at that level that connoisseur 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.739
 auto racing will not have any questions 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.390
 about credibility if you take 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.530
 under the control of say chevrolet cruze and 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.140
 you can be one hundred percent 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.940
 confident that this is the one 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.549
 car on which Ivan Muller 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.200
 won last year's wtcc just in the game 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.200
 there will be a little different coloring 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.770
 while already for several 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.450
 years it can be seen that the codemasters themselves are not really 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.950
 knows what else can be improved in 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.050
 virtual racing not to be 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.880
 similar to kadzunori yamauchi and do not 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.290
 childish moon races in passport 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.940
 the British decided to develop a theme with 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.709
 dispatcher who appeared in games 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.630
 studios a couple of years ago and already managed 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.680
 pretty much get bored now 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.240
 time he is silent 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.250
 but the player has several 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.630
 teams on the cross of the gamepad with their 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.370
 using for example you can find out about 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.140
 machine condition or location 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.569
 companions to pilate not when you need it 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.569
 when they want an annoying dispatcher 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.829
 he himself is already sad news regarding 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.350
 Grid autosport we voiced in the very 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.090
 the beginning of the game is simply one-time 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.040
 ride on modeled details 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.930
 mercedes-benz and bugatti want 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.730
 maximum weekend and then the game 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.410
 forgotten and even thought to collect all 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.090
 previous studio games you are united 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.130
 will no longer seem like a good idea 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.600
 better to have a few separate 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.490
 projects executed on much more 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.500
 high level with grid autosport 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.300
 the same story happens that of 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.710
 most modern races they are not 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.480
 seem monumental 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.520
 I don't want to study them I don't want to 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.169
 come back though if you measure them in 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.490
 absolute values then they are still 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.490
 will be good races 

00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:03.739
 his verdict is 7 points 

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:06.279
 justification waiting hundred percent on 

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:06.279
 amateur 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.510
 can
