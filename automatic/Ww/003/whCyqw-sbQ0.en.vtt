00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
we've had two awesome filler designs one

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.439 
we've had two awesome filler designs one
is<00:00:15.270> leaf<00:00:15.900> filler<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.789> slightly

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
is leaf filler and this is a slightly

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.480 
is leaf filler and this is a slightly
more<00:00:18.810> advanced<00:00:19.050> design<00:00:19.500> here's<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.980> bit<00:00:20.220> photo

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
more advanced design here's a bit photo

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.340 
more advanced design here's a bit photo
but<00:00:20.730> right<00:00:20.880> here<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
but right here this is going to be a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.660 
but right here this is going to be a
design<00:00:22.620> that<00:00:22.650> works<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.070> any<00:00:23.190> area<00:00:23.520> of<00:00:23.550> your

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
design that works in any area of your

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.750 
design that works in any area of your
quilt<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.690> reason<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.170> i<00:00:25.500> rated<00:00:26.280> it<00:00:26.490> as

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
quilt the reason that i rated it as

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.580 
quilt the reason that i rated it as
advanced<00:00:27.360> is<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:28.050> there's<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.289> lot<00:00:28.380> of

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
advanced is because there's a lot of

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.440 
advanced is because there's a lot of
travel<00:00:29.190> stitching<00:00:29.550> involved<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.030> this<00:00:30.119> design

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
travel stitching involved in this design

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.330 
travel stitching involved in this design
don't<00:00:31.200> let<00:00:31.350> that<00:00:31.470> intimidate<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.039> though

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
don't let that intimidate you though

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.790 
don't let that intimidate you though
it's<00:00:32.820> really<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.629> difficult<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.680> i

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it's really not that difficult and i

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.200 
it's really not that difficult and i
think<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.310> design<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.760> gonna<00:00:36.060> work

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
think that this design is gonna work

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.080 
think that this design is gonna work
really<00:00:36.960> well<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.650> large<00:00:37.980> areas<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.970> your

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
really well in the large areas of your

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.120 
really well in the large areas of your
quote<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.510> expand<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.470> could<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:40.829> big

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
quote you expand it we could really big

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.889 
quote you expand it we could really big
i<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.520> it'll<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:42.000> easier<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.570> stitch

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
i think it'll be a lot easier to stitch

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
i think it'll be a lot easier to stitch
the<00:00:43.800> second<00:00:44.160> design<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.670> learned<00:00:44.880> this

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the second design that we learned this

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.110 
the second design that we learned this

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.150 
week with landscape filler our landscape
stitch<00:00:48.420> actually<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> design

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
stitch actually and this is the design

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.850 
stitch actually and this is the design
that<00:00:50.399> i<00:00:50.579> created<00:00:51.120> whenever<00:00:51.989> i<00:00:52.230> was<00:00:52.410> working<00:00:52.739> on

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that i created whenever i was working on

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.880 
that i created whenever i was working on
my<00:00:52.920> cup<00:00:53.370> runneth<00:00:53.610> over<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.540> this<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
my cup runneth over and this was just a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
my cup runneth over and this was just a
design<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.219> i<00:00:56.670> decided<00:00:57.510> i<00:00:57.600> wanted<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
design that i decided i wanted a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
design that i decided i wanted a
landscape<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.829> quote<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.520> kind<00:00:59.790> of

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
landscape in that quote and so I kind of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
landscape in that quote and so I kind of
stuck<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.620> worked<00:01:01.920> out

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
stuck it in and it really worked out

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.619 
stuck it in and it really worked out
well<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.610> just<00:01:02.879> simply<00:01:03.180> stitched<00:01:03.480> in

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
it and then of course the flowers the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.220 
it and then of course the flowers the
next<00:02:51.060> quotes<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.720> really<00:02:52.019> going<00:02:52.170> to

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
next quotes I'm really going to

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.900 
next quotes I'm really going to
experiment<00:02:52.709> with<00:02:52.890> different<00:02:53.069> threads<00:02:53.640> and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
experiment with different threads and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.300 
experiment with different threads and
different<00:02:54.150> thread<00:02:54.329> colors<00:02:54.810> over<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.829> flowers

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
different thread colors over the flowers

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.300 
different thread colors over the flowers
but<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.780> these<00:02:58.170> I'm<00:02:58.590> trying<00:02:58.890> out<00:02:59.069> many

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
but in these I'm trying out many

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.979 
but in these I'm trying out many
different<00:02:59.670> things<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.360> that's<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> reason

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
different things and that's the reason

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.900 
different things and that's the reason
why<00:03:01.200> I'm<00:03:01.260> making<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.709> many<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:02.040> them<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.730> one

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
why I'm making so many of them this one

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.660 
why I'm making so many of them this one
is<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> turn<00:03:03.420> edge<00:03:03.690> hand<00:03:04.290> applique<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.489> is

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
is a turn edge hand applique this is

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.660 
is a turn edge hand applique this is
turn<00:03:06.030> edge<00:03:06.299> machine<00:03:06.810> applique<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:08.430> is

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
turn edge machine applique and this is

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.880 
turn edge machine applique and this is
simply<00:03:09.299> fused<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.079> fused<00:03:10.350> with<00:03:10.470> Wonder

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
simply fused it's fused with Wonder

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.190 
simply fused it's fused with Wonder
under<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:11.880> they<00:03:12.000> all<00:03:12.180> look<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.870> course

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
under and so they all look of course

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.170 
under and so they all look of course
identical<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.549> they're<00:03:14.700> all<00:03:14.819> done<00:03:15.060> in

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
identical but they're all done in

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.849 
identical but they're all done in
different<00:03:15.510> ways<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.230> course<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.560> fuse

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
different ways and of course the fuse

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.280 
different ways and of course the fuse
one<00:03:17.069> was<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.000> absolute<00:03:18.480> fastest<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.170> get

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
one was the absolute fastest to get

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.750 
one was the absolute fastest to get
together<00:03:19.410> i<00:03:19.620> got<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:19.920> together<00:03:20.100> in<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:20.609> a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
together i got that together in just a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.670 
together i got that together in just a
couple<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.090> minutes<00:03:21.260> when<00:03:22.260> i'm<00:03:22.350> putting

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
couple of minutes when i'm putting

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.440 
couple of minutes when i'm putting
something<00:03:22.950> like<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:23.250> together<00:03:23.639> i<00:03:24.060> wanted<00:03:24.359> to

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
something like this together i wanted to

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.949 
something like this together i wanted to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.520 
set my fabrics out and I decide which
one's<00:03:30.239> going<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.450> be<00:03:30.600> my<00:03:30.750> background<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.440> it

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
one's going to be my background and it

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.009 
one's going to be my background and it
needs<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.769> be<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.160> fairly<00:03:32.760> dark<00:03:33.150> fabric<00:03:33.540> because

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
needs to be a fairly dark fabric because

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.830 
needs to be a fairly dark fabric because
you<00:03:34.380> want<00:03:34.650> your<00:03:34.889> flowers<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.940> really<00:03:36.389> show<00:03:36.660> up

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
you want your flowers to really show up

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.220 
you want your flowers to really show up
and<00:03:37.049> pop<00:03:37.290> easily<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.970> I'm<00:03:39.299> pick<00:03:39.900> out<00:03:40.079> my

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
and pop easily and so I'm pick out my

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.199 
and pop easily and so I'm pick out my
background<00:03:40.829> fabric<00:03:41.069> first<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.970> then<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.090> just

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
background fabric first and then I just

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.539 
background fabric first and then I just
kind<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.540> play<00:03:42.750> with<00:03:42.930> different<00:03:43.190> borders<00:03:44.190> and

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
kind of play with different borders and

different vase patterns i really like

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.610 
different vase patterns i really like
picking<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:47.940> vase<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.389> a<00:03:48.480> lot<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.720> texture<00:03:49.410> to

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
fun and this one this layout is actually

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.530 
fun and this one this layout is actually
my<00:03:54.569> favorite<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.290> far<00:03:56.030> because<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.150> has<00:03:57.299> so

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
my favorite so far because it has so

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.319 
my favorite so far because it has so
many<00:03:57.660> bright<00:03:58.019> colors<00:03:58.049> in<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.160> so<00:04:00.090> it's

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
many bright colors in it and so it's

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.770 
many bright colors in it and so it's
going<00:04:00.599> to<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:01.130> dark<00:04:02.130> red<00:04:02.549> kind<00:04:03.389> of<00:04:03.480> fiery

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
going to be this dark red kind of fiery

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.490 
going to be this dark red kind of fiery
background<00:04:04.709> with<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.459> very<00:04:05.730> unusual<00:04:05.940> teal<00:04:06.690> vase

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
background with a very unusual teal vase

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.460 
background with a very unusual teal vase
and<00:04:07.859> then<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.700> brown<00:04:09.230> i'm<00:04:10.230> going<00:04:10.380> to

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
and then this brown i'm going to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.069 
and then this brown i'm going to
actually<00:04:10.590> piece<00:04:11.100> this<00:04:11.630> going<00:04:12.630> on<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> diagonal

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
actually piece this going on a diagonal

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.050 
actually piece this going on a diagonal
very<00:04:13.769> similar<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:15.000> original<00:04:15.120> quo

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
very similar to the original quo

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.199 
very similar to the original quo
so<00:04:16.959> this<00:04:17.470> instead<00:04:18.100> of<00:04:18.160> being<00:04:18.430> just<00:04:18.459> quilted<00:04:19.090> in

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
so this instead of being just quilted in

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.030 
so this instead of being just quilted in
I'm<00:04:19.480> actually<00:04:19.660> going<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.109> piece<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.530> in<00:04:20.829> in

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
I'm actually going to piece it in in

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.800 
I'm actually going to piece it in in
this<00:04:21.730> situation<00:04:22.030> so<00:04:22.389> that's<00:04:22.540> going<00:04:22.660> to<00:04:22.720> be

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
this situation so that's going to be

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.200 
this situation so that's going to be
kind<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:23.050> different<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.530> then<00:04:24.100> this<00:04:24.310> pretty

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
kind of different and then this pretty

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.409 
kind of different and then this pretty
purple<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:25.960> going<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.320> be<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.650> border<00:04:27.010> so<00:04:28.000> that

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
purple is going to be the border so that

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.180 
purple is going to be the border so that
one's<00:04:28.600> my<00:04:28.780> favorite<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:29.530> far<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.740> can't<00:04:30.040> get

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190
