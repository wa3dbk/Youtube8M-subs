00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.850
 buy the void and now it was already us 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 we are here in front of the apartment already 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 how did I know what I would buy and active 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.320
 the treatment here that I had this 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.820
 I just came here to go already 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.479
 I bought it now, I'll get in here on my 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.640
 car 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.649
 let's go to my garage and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.689
 With that I'm going up to the apartment, I'm going 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.340
 show you I do not know yet 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.470
 interior of the apartment and I also know that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.510
 to tell me everything will be new because 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.140
 look it will be together with you 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.940
 because 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.319
 I do not know what's inside the apartment. 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.040
 because I do not have any money, I 'll stay 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.690
 spending 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.790
 thus buying lots and lots 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.830
 apartments, another thing is to talk to 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.390
 Are you using my account? 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.250
 Okay, so I 'm going to make it back to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.380
 making this account I'll add 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.900
 everybody here on ps 4 the bill 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.880
 playstation 4 and also playstation 3 not 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.890
 It's only against the new like you're playing soon. 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.020
 which is not very different from 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.300
 other things, they all have this 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.150
 Christmas tree, see here, tree. 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.380
 Christmas really crazy zinho top in all 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.760
 the apartments now when the people 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.620
 do you think that in your own apartment 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.250
 I'm not mistaking the volume with the kids. 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.250
 he has this tree stop 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.570
 christmas here we have an office is 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.209
 It's certainly a little different here. 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.410
 different but I do not know if I was already 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.750
 new generation that had never entered 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.100
 I had never noticed the apartment 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.620
 so everything I say here is going to be 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.230
 as maybe here I do not see anything 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.239
 I do not know if the games of 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.670
 sofa that reds I do not remember 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.470
 to have in the other here is one more 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 armchair because we can sit down 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.079
 have an ipod location here for you to take 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:27.870
 your gorod every day too 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:32.250
 you now take 225 spout at the rate of 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.440
 of the real estate plus 150 of the mechanic ie 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.970
 stuff already started getting widowed life 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.670
 here's how I get a lot more expensive 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.560
 that we have a bathroom in reality 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.730
 different, it was only the tree of 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.280
 Christmas 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.420
 here we have our closet where you 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.980
 You can wear all your clothes and that's it. 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.200
 I did not even see anything else that is a 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.090
 ghost room that does not open that door 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.150
 Maybe it's the elevator door or something. 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.950
 of the genre just to leave trash 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.079
 undifferentiated but have no 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.780
 no functionality then this is it 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:07.680
 remembering that now we have three fashion 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.600
 the focus of apartments of 30 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.340
 so it was basically that you 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.930
 liked and want to leave your license 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.860
 if you liked but still favorite this 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.690

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.100

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.989

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.820

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.500

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.100
