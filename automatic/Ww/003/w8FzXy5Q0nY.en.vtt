how<00:01:55.409> depth<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.189> field<00:01:56.490> works<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.000> now<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
how depth of field works and now the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.109 
how depth of field works and now the
best<00:01:57.719> way<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.530> show<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.890> how<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.280> really

with<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.000> frog<00:02:03.299> who<00:02:03.869> I've<00:02:04.020> become<00:02:04.430> well

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
with this frog who I've become well

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.249 
with this frog who I've become well
acquainted<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:06.780> does<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.079> actually

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
acquainted to but what does it actually

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.249 
acquainted to but what does it actually
look<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.770> when<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.489> get<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> picture<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.330> 1.8

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
look like when you get a picture at 1.8

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.520 
look like when you get a picture at 1.8
first<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.890> picture<00:02:11.039> at<00:02:11.450> 22<00:02:12.450> what's<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.319> on

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
first a picture at 22 what's going on

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.910 
first a picture at 22 what's going on
here

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
here

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.820 
here
well<00:02:14.340> what's<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.850> on<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:16.080> your<00:02:16.530> depth

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
well what's going on is that your depth

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.910 
well what's going on is that your depth
of<00:02:16.980> field<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.550> changing<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:18.420> shallow<00:02:19.319> depth<00:02:19.770> of

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
of field is changing a shallow depth of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.260 
of field is changing a shallow depth of
field<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.370> what<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.940> when<00:02:21.120> you're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
field is what you see when you're

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.050 
field is what you see when you're
shooting<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.660> 1.8<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.440> very<00:02:22.830> narrow<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.910> your

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
shooting at 1.8 it's very narrow so your

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.690 
shooting at 1.8 it's very narrow so your
focus<00:02:24.360> point<00:02:24.569> or<00:02:25.140> your<00:02:25.740> area<00:02:26.100> focus<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.640> very

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
focus point or your area focus is very

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.750 
focus point or your area focus is very
small<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.080> numbers<00:02:28.500> go<00:02:28.740> up<00:02:28.770> all<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> way

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
small as the numbers go up all the way

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.720 
small as the numbers go up all the way
here<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> 22<00:02:30.720> your<00:02:31.470> focus<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.100> changing<00:02:32.610> so

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
here to 22 your focus is changing so

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.949 
here to 22 your focus is changing so
more<00:02:33.000> things<00:02:33.030> are<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.570> be<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.720> focus

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
more things are going to be in focus

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.650 
more things are going to be in focus
from<00:02:34.350> front<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.860> back<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.820> that's<00:02:36.120> important

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
from front to back so that's important

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.420 
from front to back so that's important
to<00:02:36.690> keep<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.050> mind<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.770> what<00:02:37.950> we're<00:02:38.100> doing<00:02:38.130> here

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
to keep in mind so what we're doing here

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.949 
to keep in mind so what we're doing here
is<00:02:38.640> I'm<00:02:38.730> going<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.880> photograph<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.540> Frog<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
is I'm going to photograph the Frog and

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.949 
is I'm going to photograph the Frog and
I'm<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.830> focus<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.430> its<00:02:41.610> eye<00:02:41.760> at<00:02:42.030> 1.8

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
I'm going to focus in on its eye at 1.8

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.930 
I'm going to focus in on its eye at 1.8
then<00:02:43.650> I'm<00:02:43.739> going<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.920> work<00:02:44.069> my<00:02:44.130> way<00:02:44.310> all<00:02:44.640> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
then I'm going to work my way all the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.729 
then I'm going to work my way all the
way<00:02:44.970> up<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.270> 22<00:02:45.569> so<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.380> see<00:02:46.590> what's

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
way up to 22 so that you can see what's

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.350 
way up to 22 so that you can see what's
happening<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> background<00:02:47.910> then<00:02:48.270> we're

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
happening to the background then we're

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.940 
happening to the background then we're
going<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.510> talk<00:02:48.750> about<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.320> figure<00:02:49.739> out

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
going to talk about it and figure out

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.890 
going to talk about it and figure out
you<00:02:50.430> know<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.730> little<00:02:50.940> subtleties<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.750> are

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
you know the little subtleties that are

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.020 
you know the little subtleties that are
going<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:52.890> right<00:02:53.250> now<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.459> have<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> camera

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
going on so right now I have the camera

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.300 
going on so right now I have the camera
set<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.390> aperture<00:02:54.780> priority<00:02:54.980> but<00:02:55.980> aperture

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
set to aperture priority but aperture

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.949 
set to aperture priority but aperture
priority<00:02:56.519> means<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.209> am<00:02:57.360> setting<00:02:57.780> my

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
priority means that I am setting my

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.470 
priority means that I am setting my
aperture<00:02:58.350> I'm<00:02:59.070> picking<00:02:59.700> where<00:02:59.880> I<00:02:59.910> want<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.360> and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
aperture I'm picking where I want it and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.560 
aperture I'm picking where I want it and
the<00:03:01.260> camera<00:03:01.860> is<00:03:02.010> then<00:03:02.459> going<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.790> select<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
the camera is then going to select the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.560 
the camera is then going to select the
shutter<00:03:03.870> speed<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.800> proper<00:03:05.280> exposure

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
shutter speed for a proper exposure

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.060 
shutter speed for a proper exposure
let's<00:03:06.570> shoot<00:03:06.720> at<00:03:06.840> one<00:03:06.989> point<00:03:07.230> eight<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.980> I'm

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
let's shoot at one point eight so I'm

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.410 
let's shoot at one point eight so I'm
wet<00:03:08.250> one<00:03:08.430> point<00:03:08.700> eight<00:03:08.820> right<00:03:09.000> now<00:03:09.150> I'm

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
wet one point eight right now I'm

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.890 
wet one point eight right now I'm
focused<00:03:10.019> in<00:03:10.200> on<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.769> frogs<00:03:11.040> eye<00:03:11.310> boom<00:03:12.209> that's

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
focused in on the frogs eye boom that's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.280 
focused in on the frogs eye boom that's
one<00:03:13.260> point<00:03:13.500> eight<00:03:14.120> let's<00:03:15.120> take<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.600> F<00:03:15.750> two

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
one point eight let's take it to F two

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.360 
one point eight let's take it to F two
point<00:03:16.620> eight<00:03:17.000> there's<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.180> nice<00:03:18.390> smile<00:03:19.250> now<00:03:20.250> I'm

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
point eight there's a nice smile now I'm

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.400 
point eight there's a nice smile now I'm
making<00:03:20.610> sure<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.329> almost<00:03:21.570> did<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.140> here<00:03:22.320> I'm

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
making sure I almost did this here I'm

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.500 
making sure I almost did this here I'm
going<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.560> shoot<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.890> there<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.700> cut<00:03:24.060> her<00:03:24.180> finger

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
going to shoot it there I cut her finger

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.180 
going to shoot it there I cut her finger
off<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.840> saw<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.620> that's<00:03:25.799> why<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.010> didn't

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
off and I saw it so that's why I didn't

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.039 
off and I saw it so that's why I didn't
shoot<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.459> initially<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.060> now<00:03:27.120> I'm

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
shoot it initially but now I'm

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.509 
shoot it initially but now I'm
recomposing<00:03:30.079> boom<00:03:31.079> I'm<00:03:31.470> making<00:03:32.190> sure<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.459> I

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
recomposing boom I'm making sure that I

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.880 
recomposing boom I'm making sure that I
have<00:03:32.700> her<00:03:32.910> finger<00:03:33.299> in<00:03:33.450> there<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:34.380> do<00:03:34.440> so

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
have her finger in there and I do so

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.310 
have her finger in there and I do so
that<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.130> really<00:03:35.459> sharp<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.690> can<00:03:36.870> see<00:03:37.079> in<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
that is really sharp you can see in the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.050 
that is really sharp you can see in the
pictures<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.860> background<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.670> nice<00:03:38.880> and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
pictures that the background is nice and

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.699 
pictures that the background is nice and
blown<00:03:39.239> out<00:03:39.480> when<00:03:39.660> we<00:03:39.720> talk<00:03:39.900> about<00:03:40.200> blowing<00:03:40.470> out

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
blown out when we talk about blowing out

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.400 
blown out when we talk about blowing out
it's<00:03:41.220> compressed<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.329> that's<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.140> point<00:03:43.260> of

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
it's compressed so that's the point of

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.560 
it's compressed so that's the point of
using<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.709> piece<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.400> glass<00:03:44.489> like<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.480> I'm

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
using a piece of glass like this and I'm

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.910 
using a piece of glass like this and I'm
probably<00:03:45.780> going<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.079> switch<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.620> bigger

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
probably going to switch to the bigger

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.500 
probably going to switch to the bigger
piece<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.280> glass<00:03:47.579> of<00:03:47.760> three<00:03:47.970> hundred<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.360> eight

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
piece of glass of three hundred to eight

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.630 
piece of glass of three hundred to eight
in<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.750> few<00:03:48.959> minutes<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.799> we<00:03:49.950> can<00:03:50.100> see<00:03:50.280> how

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
in a few minutes so that we can see how

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.400 
in a few minutes so that we can see how
we<00:03:50.700> can<00:03:50.910> really<00:03:51.269> compress<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.989> background

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
we can really compress the background

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.170 
we can really compress the background
step<00:03:52.709> away<00:03:52.860> from<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.250> tree<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.670> make<00:03:54.150> a

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
step away from the tree and make a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.090 
step away from the tree and make a
parking<00:03:54.630> lot<00:03:54.660> look<00:03:55.380> really<00:03:55.620> awesome<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.010> we're

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
parking lot look really awesome so we're

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.800 
parking lot look really awesome so we're
going<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.250> come<00:03:56.459> back<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.780> couple

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
going to come back to that in a couple

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.860 
going to come back to that in a couple
seconds<00:03:58.790> well<00:03:59.790> why<00:03:59.940> don't<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.180> sit<00:04:00.420> back<00:04:00.450> on

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
seconds well why don't you sit back on

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.740 
seconds well why don't you sit back on
it<00:04:01.190> just<00:04:02.190> face<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.910> way<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.269> just<00:04:03.390> rest<00:04:03.690> your

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
it just face that way but just rest your

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.460 
it just face that way but just rest your
tuchus<00:04:04.079> own<00:04:04.380> on<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:05.690> so<00:04:06.690> now<00:04:06.810> we're<00:04:06.959> ready<00:04:07.140> to

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
tuchus own on it so now we're ready to

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.770 
tuchus own on it so now we're ready to
photograph<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> swing<00:04:08.670> here<00:04:08.970> I'm<00:04:09.150> locking<00:04:09.450> in

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
photograph the swing here I'm locking in

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.039 
photograph the swing here I'm locking in
on<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.500> tripod<00:04:11.010> just<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:11.519> that<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:11.700> have<00:04:11.730> a

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
on the tripod just so that I have a

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.449 
on the tripod just so that I have a
something<00:04:13.049> that's<00:04:13.200> not<00:04:13.320> moving<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.250> each

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
something that's not moving so that each

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.819 
something that's not moving so that each
image<00:04:14.730> kind<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.450> stays<00:04:15.630> similar<00:04:16.049> right<00:04:16.680> now

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
image kind of stays similar right now

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.370 
image kind of stays similar right now
I'm<00:04:17.010> set<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.519> shutter<00:04:18.510> priority<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.289> that

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
I'm set to shutter priority and that

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.170 
I'm set to shutter priority and that
means<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.459> am<00:04:20.519> setting<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.910> shutter

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
means that I am setting the shutter

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.610 
means that I am setting the shutter
speed<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.690> camera<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:22.169> going<00:04:22.289> to<00:04:22.349> do<00:04:22.500> the

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
speed and the camera is going to do the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.020 
speed and the camera is going to do the
rest<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.099> work<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.430> make<00:04:23.550> sure<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.729> it's

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
rest of the work to make sure that it's

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.120 
rest of the work to make sure that it's
exposed<00:04:24.479> properly<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:25.380> I'm<00:04:25.740> going<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:25.950> start

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
exposed properly so I'm going to start

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.470 
exposed properly so I'm going to start
at<00:04:26.280> one<00:04:26.729> tenth<00:04:27.150> of<00:04:27.270> a

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
at one tenth of a

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.990 
at one tenth of a
ii<00:04:27.780> remember<00:04:28.230> how<00:04:28.500> slow<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.830> was<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.820> could

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
ii remember how slow that was you could

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.870 
ii remember how slow that was you could
hear<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.510> sound<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:31.830> how<00:04:32.040> slow<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.340> was<00:04:32.670> when

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
hear the sound of how slow that was when

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.000 
hear the sound of how slow that was when
we<00:04:32.910> were<00:04:33.110> testing<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.320> letting<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.590> hear<00:04:34.860> the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
we were testing and letting you hear the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.680 
we were testing and letting you hear the
different<00:04:35.370> shutter<00:04:35.520> speeds<00:04:35.670> now<00:04:36.330> let's<00:04:36.570> see

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
different shutter speeds now let's see

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.340 
different shutter speeds now let's see
what<00:04:36.840> happens<00:04:37.170> when<00:04:37.620> we<00:04:37.770> move<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.190> swing<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
what happens when we move the swing and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.020 
what happens when we move the swing and
shoot<00:04:40.350> it<00:04:40.500> at<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.680> tenth<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.160> second<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.970> i'm

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
shoot it at a tenth of a second so i'm

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.310 
shoot it at a tenth of a second so i'm
going<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.210> try<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.390> capture<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.900> swing<00:04:46.110> at<00:04:46.230> the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
going to try to capture the swing at the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.130 
going to try to capture the swing at the
very<00:04:46.500> bottom<00:04:46.740> boom<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:48.030> as<00:04:48.600> we<00:04:48.750> look<00:04:48.930> at<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
very bottom boom and as we look at the

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.020 
very bottom boom and as we look at the
swing<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.800> can<00:04:49.830> see<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.340> it's<00:04:50.670> kind<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:50.970> hard

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
swing you can see that it's kind of hard

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.940 
swing you can see that it's kind of hard
to<00:04:51.210> see<00:04:51.390> because<00:04:51.540> it's<00:04:51.690> actually<00:04:52.020> blurring

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
to see because it's actually blurring

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.740 
to see because it's actually blurring
its<00:04:53.730> blurring<00:04:54.090> because<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.450> shutter<00:04:54.690> is

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750
