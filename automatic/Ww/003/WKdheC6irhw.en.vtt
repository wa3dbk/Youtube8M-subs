so ideally the way that magnetic
coupling<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.900> improve<00:00:18.170> surgical<00:00:19.170> procedure

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
coupling can improve surgical procedure

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.140 
coupling can improve surgical procedure
is<00:00:20.060> to<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.210> all<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.580> robotic<00:00:23.580> instrument

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
is to have all the robotic instrument

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.660 
is to have all the robotic instrument
entering<00:00:24.630> from<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.990> single<00:00:25.380> incision<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.519> be

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
entering from a single incision to be

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.519 
entering from a single incision to be
deployed<00:00:27.029> inside<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.779> abdominal<00:00:27.869> cavity<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
deployed inside the abdominal cavity and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.990 
deployed inside the abdominal cavity and
manipulated<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> controlled<00:00:31.769> by<00:00:32.610> magnetic

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
manipulated and controlled by magnetic

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700 
manipulated and controlled by magnetic
fields<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.930> would<00:00:34.110> reduce<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.590> number

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
fields so this would reduce the number

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.830 
fields so this would reduce the number
of<00:00:35.040> incisions<00:00:35.579> required<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> dominant

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
of incisions required for a dominant

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.560 
of incisions required for a dominant
surgery<00:00:37.530> down<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.309> single<00:00:38.910> incision<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
surgery down to a single incision and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.619 
surgery down to a single incision and
also<00:00:39.870> would<00:00:40.020> provide<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:41.010> very<00:00:41.730> large

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
also would provide a very large

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.170 
also would provide a very large
workspace<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.370> subject<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> be

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
workspace for the subject to be

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.869 
workspace for the subject to be
effective<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> really<00:00:46.860> liked<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
effective what I really liked about the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.840 
effective what I really liked about the
project<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.660> fact<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.829> makes<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
project is the fact that it makes the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.130 
project is the fact that it makes the
mechanical<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.590> tough<00:00:53.100> mechanical

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
mechanical the very tough mechanical

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.099 
mechanical the very tough mechanical
part<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.460> biomedical<00:00:56.699> way<00:00:57.270> meaning

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
part in a in a biomedical way meaning

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.880 
part in a in a biomedical way meaning
that<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.359> exploit<00:01:00.359> motors<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> magnets

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that we can exploit motors and magnets

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.450 
that we can exploit motors and magnets
to<00:01:02.160> perform<00:01:02.789> surgical<00:01:03.690> tasks<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:05.129> can

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to perform surgical tasks that can

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.810 
to perform surgical tasks that can
really<00:01:05.760> benefit<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.920> outcome<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.220> surgical

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
really benefit the outcome for surgical

same<00:01:48.840> frequency<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.369> allowed<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.000> have

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
same frequency and this allowed to have

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.830 
same frequency and this allowed to have
wireless<00:01:52.049> mechanical<00:01:52.829> transfer<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.670> power<00:01:53.909> so

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
wireless mechanical transfer of power so

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.800 
wireless mechanical transfer of power so
that<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.500> internal<00:01:56.210> magnets<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.420> then

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that the internal magnets is then

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.100 
that the internal magnets is then
considered<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:59.250> an<00:01:59.579> internal<00:01:59.969> motor<00:02:00.360> but

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
considered like an internal motor but

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.940 
considered like an internal motor but
with<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> higher<00:02:01.829> power<00:02:02.399> specification<00:02:03.360> that

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
with a higher power specification that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.190 
with a higher power specification that
then<00:02:05.270> normal<00:02:06.439> micro<00:02:07.439> motors<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
then normal micro motors have so the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.690 
then normal micro motors have so the
instrument<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.800> introduced<00:02:11.370> through<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
