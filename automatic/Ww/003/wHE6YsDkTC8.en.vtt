apples<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:55.710> they

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
apples going to do this because they

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.010

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the retina display and I doubt they

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.090 
the retina display and I doubt they

changing<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.670> specs<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:40.170> power<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
changing the specs the power of the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.950 
changing the specs the power of the
device<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.640> design<00:01:41.939> too<00:01:42.240> much<00:01:42.420> they're

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
device not the design too much they're

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.660 
device not the design too much they're
probably<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> fix<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> antenna<00:01:43.920> issues

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
probably going to fix the antenna issues

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
probably going to fix the antenna issues
that<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.939> was<00:01:45.060> having<00:01:45.390> last<00:01:46.140> year<00:01:46.409> when<00:01:46.619> the

four<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.189> first<00:01:47.430> released<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:48.540> it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
four was first released but it's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.330 
four was first released but it's
basically<00:01:48.930> overall<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.860> an<00:01:49.979> iphone

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
basically overall going to be an iphone

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.389 
basically overall going to be an iphone
3g<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:51.060> 3gs<00:01:51.090> update<00:01:52.049> similar<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> where

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
3g to 3gs update similar to that where

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.039 
3g to 3gs update similar to that where
they're<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.820> basically<00:01:54.240> changing<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
they're just basically changing the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.010 
they're just basically changing the
internal<00:01:56.090> specs<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> external

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
internal specs and not the external

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.950 
internal specs and not the external
design<00:01:58.939> in<00:01:59.939> terms<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.210> colors<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
design in terms of colors it's going to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.410 
design in terms of colors it's going to
be<00:02:01.049> released<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.469> both<00:02:01.770> i<00:02:02.100> will<00:02:02.790> expect<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> to

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
be released on both i will expect it to

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.929 
be released on both i will expect it to
be<00:02:03.540> released<00:02:03.840> at<00:02:04.020> AT&amp;T<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.920> verizon<00:02:05.490> at<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
be released at AT&amp;T and verizon at the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.700 
be released at AT&amp;T and verizon at the
same<00:02:06.210> point<00:02:06.659> they're<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.530> release

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
same point they're not going to release

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.440 
same point they're not going to release
it<00:02:07.890> at<00:02:07.979> separate<00:02:08.340> times<00:02:08.940> they're<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:09.360> going

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
it at separate times they're not going

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.270 
it at separate times they're not going
to<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.629> verizon<00:02:10.080> lying<00:02:10.319> behind<00:02:10.590> they're

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
to have verizon lying behind they're

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.420 
to have verizon lying behind they're
probably<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.760> release<00:02:11.910> both

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
probably going to release both

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.509 
probably going to release both

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
the same time something that is going to

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.119 
the same time something that is going to
be<00:02:15.609> a<00:02:15.640> letdown<00:02:15.879> i<00:02:16.060> think<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.689> 4g<00:02:17.349> i<00:02:17.530> am<00:02:17.890> not

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
be a letdown i think is 4g i am not

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.459 
be a letdown i think is 4g i am not
expecting<00:02:18.519> this<00:02:18.730> device<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.120> be<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> 4g<00:02:20.109> device

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.469 
expecting this device to be a 4g device

LTE<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:22.150> new<00:02:22.299> networks<00:02:22.629> are<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.019> too<00:02:23.230> new

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
LTE the new networks are just too new

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.770

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
and AT&amp;T and Verizon aren't really ready

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.020 
and AT&amp;T and Verizon aren't really ready
yet<00:02:25.870> but<00:02:26.319> we'll<00:02:27.010> see<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.280> mean<00:02:27.549> it<00:02:27.760> could<00:02:27.819> always

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
yet but we'll see I mean it could always

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.610 
yet but we'll see I mean it could always
happen<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.540> would<00:02:28.840> expect<00:02:29.139> that<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.469> be<00:02:29.500> a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
happen I would expect that to be a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.039 
happen I would expect that to be a
sixth-generation<00:02:30.269> feature<00:02:31.269> definitely<00:02:31.900> but

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
sixth-generation feature definitely but

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.390 
sixth-generation feature definitely but
I'm<00:02:32.139> not<00:02:32.319> sure<00:02:32.349> about<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.769> fifth<00:02:32.980> generation

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
I'm not sure about the fifth generation

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.619 
I'm not sure about the fifth generation
we're<00:02:33.730> going<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:33.909> have<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.090> wait<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.299> see<00:02:34.389> but

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
we're going to have to wait and see but

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.670 
we're going to have to wait and see but
that's<00:02:34.810> another<00:02:35.019> rumor<00:02:35.439> that's<00:02:35.560> been

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
that's another rumor that's been

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.399 
that's another rumor that's been
floating<00:02:35.950> around<00:02:36.719> also<00:02:37.719> better<00:02:38.109> voice

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
floating around also better voice

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.170 
floating around also better voice
controls<00:02:38.950> are<00:02:39.159> going<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.370> be<00:02:39.489> in<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:39.939> new

controls are going to be in this new
device<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.780> mean<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:41.799> don't<00:02:41.980> really<00:02:42.099> see<00:02:42.189> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
device I mean I don't really see the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.220 
device I mean I don't really see the
point<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.790> because<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.389> don't<00:02:43.810> really<00:02:43.840> use

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
point of this because I don't really use

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.170 
point of this because I don't really use
voice<00:02:44.739> controls<00:02:45.159> I<00:02:45.310> usually<00:02:45.579> just<00:02:45.639> click<00:02:46.060> on

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
voice controls I usually just click on

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.089 
voice controls I usually just click on
the<00:02:46.299> screen<00:02:46.629> it's<00:02:46.870> not<00:02:47.019> really<00:02:47.319> that<00:02:47.530> big<00:02:47.889> of<00:02:47.980> a

the screen it's not really that big of a

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.129 
the screen it's not really that big of a
hassle<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:48.519> they<00:02:49.239> may<00:02:49.450> be<00:02:49.510> included<00:02:49.870> in
