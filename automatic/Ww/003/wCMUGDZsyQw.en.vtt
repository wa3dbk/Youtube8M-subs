00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 look I have not bought a new speech group 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.690
 at a discount beautiful 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.830
 lego teams so cool sushiro during 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:20.520
 do n't know anything take there is 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:24.060
 Does Timur play onions better? 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.289
 agent went event taste all hello 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.449
 last time me very often 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.050
 ask what is better to play 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.210
 bus in the subway on couples as groups i'm not 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.030
 I know there read a book, they tell me 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 no no no there are two games a surfers 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:46.530
 and agent dash 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:48.480
 what's better let's understand both of these 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.010
 games by genre rainer and and the best of 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.899
 districts is temp wounds 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.960
 and since he is the best we are 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 do not take the calculation and so I want to start with 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.780
 the differences seem to be minor 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.609
 but on the other hand it is essentially 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.199
 only 1000 in these games in this 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.510
 comparing it all worth deciding on 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.990
 so which of the games is more colorful and which 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.880
 more simple has become a surfers screen 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.540
 the game flips along with your 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.990
 by device 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.619
 yes here is the difference because vagin 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.549
 Dasha we have no screen turns over and 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.439
 sometimes it can be uncomfortable that 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.340
 It concerns the main menu and indeed as 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.979
 and and games in general 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.159
 a surfers it is more simple 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.890
 implemented as it looks vagin dasha 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.470
 This part of the screen is immediately sorted out. 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.210
 it will be hard enough but understandable 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.380
 that with an instant agent you need to press on 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.960
 change agent the problem is that immediately 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.300
 a download appears that is, exit my 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.150
 agent you need to wait for the download 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.470
 and then still need to go back 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.420
 and again wait for the download of the sat down 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.430
 place when we click on a character in 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.860
 we have an instant choice 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.740
 character then there is no loading and 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.200
 not even a hint of 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.800
 podlagivaniya by the way about the character 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.180
 yourself all offers them as many as twenty-one 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.660
 character on different subjects that is here 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.910
 there is even a robot or zombie as for 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.770
 gene dasha 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.080
 again call loading mac and 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.390
 only 15 characters available some 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.360
 One of them is the same agent but rather 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.610
 dressed in different costumes and no agent 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.960
 zombie 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.870
 as for the store, he, too 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.120
 simply performed on 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.370
 it is indicated that we buy how much we have 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.200
 this is and how much it costs if we 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.990
 we do not know that this is just pushing us 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.090
 given the description is true in English I 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.990
 I think that is useful and therefore we will remove them 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.970
 let me see the store vagin dasha 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:53.670
 again we will need to go out in 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.670
 main menu and wait for the download 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.780
 here instead of one store for two 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.440
 description seems to me not enough 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.840
 in detail 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.950
 besides, even with knowledge of basic 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.860
 English 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.909
 some phrases may cause 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.980
 difficulties in both games present 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.620
 then some tasks for which we 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.930
 we get our bonus points as they 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.299
 handed over to the agent even appears here 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.079
 such a window on which absolutely 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.250
 nothing is clear this task is clear 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.820
 performed 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.620
 no medal as likely performed 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.210
 medal unfulfilled server 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.370
 blends and look a little different 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.100
 given three tasks that need 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.740
 perform all in sufficient detail 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.200
 no extra names are simple and 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.390
 I understand this set of 3 tasks for me 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.450
 I like it more because here you are 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.180
 Immediately they say what to do and agent dashi 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.370
 you need to first skim through everything to understand 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.310
 what can you do what is impossible and only 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.470
 then decide for yourself what is better for you 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.620
 make it much easier when they tell you 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.070
 do 3 tasks we give you ares and 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.070
 everything will be cool 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.940
 control in both games absolutely 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.680
 same obstacles in essence too 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.570
 vagin no further angry trains on 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.299
 but there are turns of events offers you 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.250
 running in a straight line I don't care how 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.680
 you run these obstacles the main thing is that you 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.330
 run that i don't like goddess give 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.880
 like this is what after clicking on pause and 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.300
 return to the game there is no intermediate 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.090
 pauses and for example seconds distracts from and 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.790
 in front of some picasso barrier clicked on 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.550
 pause said gum did not have time to notice 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.970
 this barrier and read the game over 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.600
 a surfers is a little bit different we 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.060
 run 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.000
 everything is exactly as collecting coins as well here 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.020
 suddenly we are distracted and pause 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.510
 answered incidentally look at 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.970
 window pause tells us what 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.650
 we still need to complete missions as an agent 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.350
 even have their main mini plane 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.270
 recruitment mission again choose some 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.440
 girl fuck is not shown here 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.450
 what remained 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.290
 and which are made ticked 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.160
 no medals and nothing else we 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.660
 click review 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.840
 and give us three more seconds to understand 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.030
 damn dude ahead the train need 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.350
 run sideways but I didn't have time but this already 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.730
 my problems 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.110
 also owl surfers thanks to more 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.620
 cartoon graphics but also due to the fact 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.190
 that the scenery here is not so much the game is not 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.230
 lags 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.600
 absolutely on all devices apple 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.600
 which support what is different 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.400
 codes touch iPads and iPhones in their 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.070
 I will let the agent queue on old 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.250
 versions of iPods on the first bit on 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.500
 the second ipad and also on the third iphone 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.840
 that is, it is more demanding due to 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.000
 more detailed graphics and 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.250
 more scenery to me 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.260
 it seems that for an ordinary shooter this 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.540
 absolutely no matter I do not care for 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.150
 scenery because i mostly watch 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.580
 on the road and do not give a damn about coins 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.220
 that somewhere up there are any 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.880
 Christmas trees that just slow down more 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.880
 the system 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.880
 the creators again- give a little 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.000
 overdo it with the game and the result 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.680
 It turned out not a Rainer, but some kind of action UN 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.270
 for killing time is not quite suitable 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.430
 because runnier is more fun to play 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.500
 especially if it is colorful and if it is 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.449
 Subway Surfers, well here is today 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.979
 it turned out even more comparisons 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.110
 interesting and not so interesting 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.550
 comparisons are looking for a hole duct tube 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.550
 also in the VKontakte group got up 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.940
 this
