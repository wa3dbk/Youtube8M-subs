00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and now he's in the perfect condition I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.029 
and now he's in the perfect condition I
have<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> brand<00:00:54.180> new<00:00:54.469> emperor<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.680> next<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
have a brand new emperor here next to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.250 
have a brand new emperor here next to
him<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.570> he's<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.600> exactly<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
him and you can see he's in exactly the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.680 
him and you can see he's in exactly the
correct<00:00:58.710> pose<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> looks<00:00:59.609> pretty<00:01:00.210> much<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
correct pose and looks pretty much the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.759 
correct pose and looks pretty much the
same<00:01:01.020> size<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.570> final<00:01:04.110> answer<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
same size so that's the final answer to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
same size so that's the final answer to
what's<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.339> mystery<00:01:05.670> box<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.299> an

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
what's in the mystery box it was an

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.490 
what's in the mystery box it was an
emperor<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.350> bit

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
emperor it was a little bit

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.080 
emperor it was a little bit
disappointing<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.070> was<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.250> only<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.790> emperor

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
disappointing it was on only an emperor

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
disappointing it was on only an emperor
but<00:01:09.299> still<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.740> kind<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.220> don't

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
but still it's one of a kind I don't

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.590 
but still it's one of a kind I don't
think<00:01:11.520> anyone<00:01:11.790> else<00:01:11.970> has<00:01:12.180> gone<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
think anyone else has gone to the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.020 
think anyone else has gone to the
trouble<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.020> having<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.619> box<00:01:13.890> sent<00:01:14.250> away<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.549> be

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
trouble of having a box sent away to be

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.780 
trouble of having a box sent away to be
3d<00:01:15.600> x-rayed<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.040> having<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> results

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
3d x-rayed and in having the results

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.280 
3d x-rayed and in having the results
printing<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> first

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
printing out so I think this is a first

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
printing out so I think this is a first
for<00:01:19.439> stars<00:01:19.860> collecting<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.610> although<00:01:21.600> it's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
for stars collecting so although it's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.120 
for stars collecting so although it's
not<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> most<00:01:22.140> amazing<00:01:22.409> figure<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.950> world

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
not the most amazing figure in the world

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.399 
not the most amazing figure in the world
it's<00:01:23.580> still<00:01:23.729> been<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.390> fun<00:01:24.689> journey<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it's still been a very fun journey and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.620 
it's still been a very fun journey and
the<00:01:25.830> results<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.430> been<00:01:26.460> pretty<00:01:27.180> impressive

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the results have been pretty impressive
