00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.049
 highlight and compete 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.250
 we need a foundation one 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.220
 concealer the hai derives a dark 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.949
 contour foot contour and brother 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.600
 to fix 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.910
 I give my foundation to mine 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.800
 brush and simply spread that out 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.170
 my face and work like that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.050
 foundation in the skin 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.940
 you can fans of course 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.840
 Use ambacher or youtube countries 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.670
 or the eternal best the committee 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.079
 I can work here for myself 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.920
 a brush decided 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.399
 and yes benefits so my foundation on 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.399
 my weight 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.500
 then you will take your concealer and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.149
 then gives the product to the places the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.379
 to be married 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.539
 I am under my eyes now 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.910
 make there such a triangle and also in the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.850
 inner from the corner of his eye because it is with me 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.850
 Often times such a dark place is 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.580
 we put something on my nose 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.470
 between the eyebrows, because there it is 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.790
 It should fall back towards the light 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.390
 be reflected 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.580
 a little yes a mundwinkel and am 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.580
 nostrils and officiate 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.880
 I'm here now 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.850
 sponge and the tip of it because there 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.189
 can this be done at a certain angle 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.130
 blend well and I think so synonymous 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.439
 concealer is doing very well with it 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.979
 handle and with the cabinet however 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:50.530
 finally the concealer practically and 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.530
 highlight then the desired places 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.690
 then we take one right 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.510
 dark foundation I'll give it then 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.910
 under my cheekbones and here me 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.020
 so small strokes on the hairline at the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:03:01.050
 forehead and on the sleeps 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:01.050
 down on the team and on my nose 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.010
 then I take a contoured 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.050
 brush and associations all the color so 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.209
 long until I just too much 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.250
 I am satisfied and no hard edges 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.160
 more were created by the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.459
 the nose becomes narrower to control that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.290
 face just gets more deep and 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.220
 I think that completely contour 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.220
 important for some tutorials and at 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.830
 lux that makes it even more beautiful 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.720
 and it just keeps stressing the banks 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.500
 much more than if you did not do it now 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.500
 contoured 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.569
 for the nose I take then again 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.329
 that sponge and take the 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.680
 lace and then blinds the color 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.680
 again on my nose 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.000
 yes last, just take us again 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.389
 a powder and give the whole on the t 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.389
 zone to fix the concealer 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.940
 and we're done with 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.889
 control and hey direct and you 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.620
 can continue now with yours 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.260
 make-up I have continued to do and 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.180
 have this made up for you and 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.700
 that will be the next video 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.870
 I would say we'll see each other then 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.870
 next time until then
