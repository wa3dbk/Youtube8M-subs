00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.240 
benchmark tests on the LG G flex 2 now
this<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> only<00:00:13.440> if<00:00:13.769> not<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.099> only

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
this is one of the only if not the only

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.000 
this is one of the only if not the only
available<00:00:14.490> device<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.719> has<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.379> Snapdragon

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.210 
810 processor as well as the Adreno 430
GPU<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> lot<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.439> been<00:00:22.470> asking<00:00:22.740> for

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
GPU so a lot of you have been asking for

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.730 
GPU so a lot of you have been asking for
benchmark<00:00:23.670> results<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.779> processor<00:00:25.410> so

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
benchmark results on this processor so

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.650 
benchmark results on this processor so
we'll<00:00:25.890> be<00:00:26.010> doing<00:00:26.189> three<00:00:26.460> benchmarking<00:00:27.150> tests

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
we'll be doing three benchmarking tests

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.919 
we'll be doing three benchmarking tests
using<00:00:28.109> Geekbench<00:00:28.920> 3<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.460> 2<00:00:29.880> 2<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.390> well<00:00:30.720> as

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
using Geekbench 3 and 2 2 as well as

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.380 
using Geekbench 3 and 2 2 as well as
3dmark<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.460> let's<00:00:32.669> kick<00:00:32.880> off<00:00:33.030> straight<00:00:33.360> away

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
3dmark so let's kick off straight away

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.709 
3dmark so let's kick off straight away
with<00:00:34.079> Geekbench<00:00:34.770> 3<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.489> we'll<00:00:35.969> speed<00:00:36.540> this

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
with Geekbench 3 so we'll speed this

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.080 
with Geekbench 3 so we'll speed this
process<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:38.610> see<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:39.059> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
process up and you can see here that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.690 
process up and you can see here that
we've<00:00:39.390> got<00:00:39.629> some<00:00:39.899> nice<00:00:40.140> results<00:00:40.559> almost<00:00:40.739> 4000

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
we've got some nice results almost 4000

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.970 
we've got some nice results almost 4000
for<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> multi-core<00:00:42.750> result<00:00:43.110> now<00:00:43.469> devices

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
for the multi-core result now devices

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
for the multi-core result now devices
with<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.190> Snapdragon<00:00:45.090> 805<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.809> scoring

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
with the Snapdragon 805 was scoring

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.220 
with the Snapdragon 805 was scoring
roughly<00:00:46.379> about<00:00:46.469> 3,000<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.610> 3,200<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.899> there<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
roughly about 3,000 to 3,200 so there is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.619 
roughly about 3,000 to 3,200 so there is
a<00:00:49.440> significant<00:00:50.190> improvement<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:51.059> now

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
a significant improvement here now

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.229 
a significant improvement here now
moving<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> unto<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.430> benchmark<00:00:54.030> now<00:00:54.210> I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
moving on to the unto to benchmark now I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.869 
moving on to the unto to benchmark now I
had<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> install<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.230> 64<00:00:55.500> bit<00:00:55.949> version<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
had to install the 64 bit version on to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.000 
had to install the 64 bit version on to
here<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.809> able<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.050> fully<00:00:58.289> utilize<00:00:58.710> a

here to be able to fully utilize a
dispatch<00:00:59.579> mark<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.329> speeding<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:00.960> which

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
dispatch mark now speeding this up which

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.740 
dispatch mark now speeding this up which
took<00:01:01.739> quite<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.520> longer<00:01:02.789> compared<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
took quite a bit longer compared to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.910 
took quite a bit longer compared to
Geekbench<00:01:04.409> 3<00:01:04.500> you've<00:01:05.400> got<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> results<00:01:06.270> here

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
Geekbench 3 you've got the results here

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.770 
Geekbench 3 you've got the results here
54,000<00:01:07.920> slightly<00:01:08.250> over<00:01:08.460> 54,000<00:01:09.450> which<00:01:09.540> once

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
54,000 slightly over 54,000 which once

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
54,000 slightly over 54,000 which once
again<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:10.229> impressive<00:01:11.010> score<00:01:11.310> looking<00:01:11.909> at<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
again an impressive score looking at the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940 
again an impressive score looking at the
rankings<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.290> also<00:01:13.530> comes

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
rankings you can see this also comes

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
rankings you can see this also comes
above<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.880> samsung<00:01:15.270> galaxy<00:01:15.299> note<00:01:15.869> 4<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
above the samsung galaxy note 4 and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.429 
above the samsung galaxy note 4 and
finally<00:01:16.890> doing<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.280> test<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> 3d<00:01:18.659> mark<00:01:18.990> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
finally doing a test on a 3d mark so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
finally doing a test on a 3d mark so
we're<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.830> speeding<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.450> took<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
we're just speeding this up this took a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.320 
we're just speeding this up this took a
very<00:01:22.170> long<00:01:22.320> time<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:23.520> are<00:01:23.729> presented<00:01:24.330> with

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
very long time we are presented with

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.730 
very long time we are presented with
these<00:01:25.229> results<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.640> around<00:01:27.409> 22,000<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
these results here just around 22,000 so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.960 
these results here just around 22,000 so
there<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> benchmarking

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
there we have it the benchmarking

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.260 
there we have it the benchmarking
results<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.320> LG<00:01:31.950> G<00:01:32.159> flex<00:01:32.189> which<00:01:32.820> has<00:01:33.090> the

430 GPU so hopefully that gives you a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.429 
430 GPU so hopefully that gives you a
bit<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> an<00:01:38.610> idea<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:39.210> terms<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.960> rankings

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
bit of an idea in terms of the rankings

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.200 
bit of an idea in terms of the rankings
a<00:01:40.590> very<00:01:40.770> very<00:01:40.950> short<00:01:41.009> video<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.850> some<00:01:42.180> of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
a very very short video I know some of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210 
a very very short video I know some of
you<00:01:42.329> will<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.689> wondering<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.680> processor

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
you will be wondering if this processor

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.730 
you will be wondering if this processor
overheats<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.689> heard<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.710> is

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
overheats as we have heard now it is

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.800 
overheats as we have heard now it is
quite<00:01:47.130> early<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.549> me<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.759> say<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.509> have

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
quite early for me to say but I have

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
quite early for me to say but I have
noticed<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> smartphone<00:01:49.920> has<00:01:50.130> got<00:01:50.369> warm

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
noticed that the smartphone has got warm

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270 
noticed that the smartphone has got warm
when<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> processing<00:01:52.049> some<00:01:52.350> heavy<00:01:52.619> tasks<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
when a processing some heavy tasks I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.460 
when a processing some heavy tasks I
will<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.670> covering<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:55.020> full<00:01:55.320> review
