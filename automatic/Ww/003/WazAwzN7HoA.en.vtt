 local c programs x86 pushed les 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.590
 media folder I recommend you must 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.819
 take these three does these three 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.569
 folders to copy with copy or 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:05.240
 control c or right button copy le 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.140
 copy in the folder here 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.489
 at the beginning you will only find video clips 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.610
 do control v or right click 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.769
 paste or paste replace me 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.510
 I did I replaced because ce 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.780
 I already had it inside these will be three o'clock 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.209
 additional folders for truck mode 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.000
 truck 8x8 this folder you can 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.640
 to eliminate further this is the dog that 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.490
 you can see that you will see in the game though 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.420
 will not support the 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.810
 the crane will not support the crane because of the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.690
 crane and at the moment it is only for the truck a 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.150
 three aces and not four as now 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.730
 the flaw of this and this mode that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.410
 you have to restart the game and then 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.460
 all sitting match you had in 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.460
 question at the beginning 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.020
 you have to restart it will restart 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.940
 automatically even if you click 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.480
 the Ferrari game continues 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:13.160
 automatically as you see the truck 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.050
 it works because it is visible you can 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.310
 apply a lot of things because the 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.710
 vacuum box and therefore nothing 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.820
 that's all we see a 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.820
 next video bye bye
