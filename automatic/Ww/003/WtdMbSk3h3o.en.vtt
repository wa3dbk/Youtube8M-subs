00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.060 
emerge and start its next phase of life
and<00:00:50.780> then<00:00:51.780> there's<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.140> fungus<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.890> can

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and then there's the fungus that can

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.420 
and then there's the fungus that can
infect<00:00:53.370> tropical<00:00:53.969> tree<00:00:54.210> dwelling<00:00:54.480> ants<00:00:55.430> when

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the ants are infected by the fungus they

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
the ants are infected by the fungus they
crawl<00:00:58.710> out<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> spot<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> tree<00:00:59.820> where

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
crawl out to a spot on the tree where

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
crawl out to a spot on the tree where
the<00:01:00.120> fungus<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.660> thrive<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> fungus

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the fungus can thrive then the fungus

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.729 
the fungus can thrive then the fungus
kills<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.850> ant<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.449> eats<00:01:03.870> its<00:01:04.080> body<00:01:04.320> from<00:01:04.619> the
