songs long the album opens up with the
track<00:00:22.350> fire<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.430> track<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.939> built

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
track fire and this track is built

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.779 
track fire and this track is built
around<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.600> big<00:00:25.109> bass<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.800> very<00:00:26.460> powerful

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
around some big bass and very powerful

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.849 
around some big bass and very powerful
drums<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> great<00:00:28.289> way<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.470> kick<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
drums so it's a great way to kick the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.589 
drums so it's a great way to kick the
album<00:00:29.189> off<00:00:29.310> because<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.880> immediately<00:00:30.179> gets

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
album off because it immediately gets

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.080 
album off because it immediately gets
your<00:00:30.779> neck<00:00:30.990> snapping<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.160> verses<00:00:32.579> Vince

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
your neck snapping in the verses Vince

vocal distortion on this track works

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
vocal distortion on this track works
great<00:00:48.930> too<00:00:49.200> because<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:50.070> fits<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
edgy angry sort of feel that the track

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.910 
edgy angry sort of feel that the track
has<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:54.140> 65-hundred<00:00:55.140> keeps<00:00:55.649> things

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
going with another great beat this beat

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.439 
going with another great beat this beat
has<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.340> Neptune's<00:00:59.820> feel<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
has a bit of a Neptune's feel to it

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.450 
has a bit of a Neptune's feel to it
because<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> tom-toms<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.280> bass

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
because of the tom-toms and the bass

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
because of the tom-toms and the bass
line<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.329> underlying<00:01:03.629> strings<00:01:04.350> add<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
line and the underlying strings add a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.230 
line and the underlying strings add a
little<00:01:05.010> bit<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> darkness<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.030> well<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
little bit of darkness to it as well so

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120 
little bit of darkness to it as well so
it's<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:06.840> interesting<00:01:06.960> production<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
it's a really interesting production and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.830 
it's a really interesting production and
probably<00:01:08.490> my<00:01:08.610> favorite<00:01:08.970> beat<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.630> on

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
probably my favorite beat on here on

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
probably my favorite beat on here on
this<00:01:10.350> track<00:01:10.710> Vince<00:01:11.250> blows<00:01:11.580> juvenile<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that is sixty five hundred degrees as

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.060 
that is sixty five hundred degrees as
opposed<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.180> four<00:01:18.420> hundred<00:01:18.570> degrees<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.290> five

hundred degrees both verses are nice but

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.620 
hundred degrees both verses are nice but
the<00:01:23.130> second<00:01:23.490> verse<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.970> stuck<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.479> me

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the second verse really stuck out to me

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.539 
the second verse really stuck out to me
because<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.290> Vince<00:01:25.439> did<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.710> great<00:01:25.979> job<00:01:26.009> of

can<00:05:00.010> wait<00:05:00.250> EP<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.270> give<00:05:01.420> it<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.570> 3.5<00:05:01.840> out<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.470> 5

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
can wait EP and I give it a 3.5 out of 5

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.950 
can wait EP and I give it a 3.5 out of 5
the<00:05:03.370> lyrical<00:05:03.730> content<00:05:03.940> is<00:05:04.360> great<00:05:04.630> on<00:05:04.810> this

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
the lyrical content is great on this

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.810 
the lyrical content is great on this
because<00:05:05.170> Vince<00:05:05.530> talks<00:05:05.830> about<00:05:06.040> his<00:05:06.220> past<00:05:06.490> he

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
because Vince talks about his past he

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.640 
because Vince talks about his past he
touches<00:05:07.360> on<00:05:07.510> things<00:05:07.720> that<00:05:07.900> he's<00:05:08.020> experienced

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
touches on things that he's experienced

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.560 
touches on things that he's experienced
and<00:05:08.860> things<00:05:09.340> that<00:05:09.520> he's<00:05:09.670> seen<00:05:09.880> and<00:05:10.150> he<00:05:10.420> also

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
and things that he's seen and he also

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.510 
and things that he's seen and he also
talks<00:05:10.960> about<00:05:11.050> social<00:05:11.410> issues<00:05:11.710> like<00:05:12.100> on<00:05:12.400> the

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
talks about social issues like on the

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.500 
talks about social issues like on the
song<00:05:12.700> hands<00:05:13.150> up

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
song hands up

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.390 
song hands up
the<00:05:13.870> only<00:05:14.020> problem<00:05:14.530> really<00:05:14.710> is<00:05:15.100> that<00:05:15.280> the

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
the only problem really is that the

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.760 
the only problem really is that the
production<00:05:15.790> has<00:05:16.330> highs<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.870> lows<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.380> thought

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
production has highs and lows I thought

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.470 
production has highs and lows I thought
the<00:05:17.890> first<00:05:18.100> three<00:05:18.400> tracks<00:05:18.700> were<00:05:19.030> near-perfect

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
the first three tracks were near-perfect

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.660 
the first three tracks were near-perfect
but<00:05:20.080> after<00:05:20.350> that<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.650> album<00:05:21.010> just<00:05:21.190> started<00:05:21.580> on

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
but after that the album just started on

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.370 
but after that the album just started on
a<00:05:21.700> bit<00:05:21.910> of<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.090> decline<00:05:22.240> not<00:05:23.080> that<00:05:23.260> it<00:05:23.350> really

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
a bit of a decline not that it really

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.130 
a bit of a decline not that it really
ended<00:05:23.920> awfully<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.910> just<00:05:25.120> wasn't<00:05:25.450> as<00:05:25.570> good<00:05:25.900> as

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
ended awfully it just wasn't as good as

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.240 
ended awfully it just wasn't as good as
how<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.680> began

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
how it began

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.570 
how it began
still<00:05:27.910> it's<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:28.600> very<00:05:28.960> solid<00:05:29.320> EP<00:05:30.010> I<00:05:30.220> would

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
still it's a very solid EP I would

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.070
