I<00:00:00.060> would<00:00:00.930> like<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.260> compare<00:00:01.439> working<00:00:02.100> with<00:00:02.250> a

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
I would like to compare working with a

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.760 
I would like to compare working with a
word<00:00:02.820> processor<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.480> common<00:00:03.899> word<00:00:04.080> processor

on Windows on Linux Mint and on OS 10
and<00:00:08.849> how<00:00:09.450> they<00:00:09.599> work<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:09.900> images<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.130> each

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
and how they work with images so in each

and how they work with images so in each
of<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.519> operating<00:00:11.880> systems<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.630> will<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:12.990> an

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
of the operating systems I will have an

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.289 
of the operating systems I will have an

their common browser the default browser
and<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.449> will<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.779> probably<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> most<00:00:19.650> common

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and I will have probably the most common

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.279 
and I will have probably the most common
or<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.250> least<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> common<00:00:20.820> word<00:00:21.390> processor<00:00:22.080> on

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
bring this image in but it's not letting

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.990 
bring this image in but it's not letting
me<00:00:33.059> drag<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.570> drop<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.559> would<00:00:34.710> think<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.370> in

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
me drag and drop you would think that in

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.270 
me drag and drop you would think that in
you<00:00:36.270> know<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> year<00:00:36.770> 2013<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.010> actually

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you know the year 2013 it's actually

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.750 
you know the year 2013 it's actually
2014<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:40.070> 2013<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.340> made<00:00:41.550> this

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
2014 but 2013 when they made this

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.510 
2014 but 2013 when they made this
drag-and-drop<00:00:42.600> would<00:00:43.079> work<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.920> doesn't<00:00:44.190> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
drag-and-drop would work it doesn't I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.790 
drag-and-drop would work it doesn't I
can<00:00:45.180> right-click<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.350> hit<00:00:46.500> copy

can right-click on it I get hit copy
come<00:00:47.579> over<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.510> paste<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
come over here and just paste it in and

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.180 
come over here and just paste it in and
there<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:51.559> let's<00:00:52.559> say<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.860> want<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> go

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
there it is now let's say I want to go

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.010 
there it is now let's say I want to go
ahead<00:00:53.280> I'm<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> shrink<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:53.969> down<00:00:54.030> one

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
ahead I'm going to shrink this down one

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.600 
ahead I'm going to shrink this down one
thing<00:00:55.260> that's<00:00:55.440> nice<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.129> assumes

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
thing that's nice is it assumes

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.729 
thing that's nice is it assumes
proportional<00:00:57.480> almost<00:00:57.930> always<00:00:58.170> you're<00:00:58.530> going

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
proportional almost always you're going

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.410 
proportional almost always you're going
to<00:00:58.859> want<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.399> pictures<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.059> proportional

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
to want your pictures to be proportional

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.139 
to want your pictures to be proportional
you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> otherwise<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.670> want<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
you can do it otherwise if you want and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.990 
you can do it otherwise if you want and
I<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.049> move<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> around<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.610> even<00:01:05.850> has

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
I can move it around and it even has

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.060 
I can move it around and it even has
this<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.510> icon<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.049> which<00:01:07.830> lets

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
this little icon right here which lets

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
this little icon right here which lets
me<00:01:08.159> change<00:01:08.430> how<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> want<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> tourette<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.720> I

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
me change how I want to tourette and I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.039 
me change how I want to tourette and I
want<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> wrap<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> tight<00:01:11.630> but<00:01:12.630> even<00:01:12.900> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
want it to wrap the tight but even that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
want it to wrap the tight but even that
isn't<00:01:13.229> quite<00:01:13.619> right<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:13.950> now<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> have

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
isn't quite right because now I have

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.310 
isn't quite right because now I have
this<00:01:14.670> big<00:01:14.970> white<00:01:15.299> area<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.990> want<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
this big white area what if I want it to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320 
this big white area what if I want it to
be<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.250> rectangle<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.909> want<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.180> rotate

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
be not that rectangle I want to rotate

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.670 
be not that rectangle I want to rotate
it<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> bit<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.840> doesn't<00:01:22.320> look<00:01:22.409> quite

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it in a bit this doesn't look quite

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.679 
it in a bit this doesn't look quite
right<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.460> white<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.570> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
right with all that white there but you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.710 
right with all that white there but you
can<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.259> through<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> format<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
can go through go to the format go to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.440 
can go through go to the format go to
color<00:01:28.020> options<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.829> set<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> transparent

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
color options and set a transparent

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210 
color options and set a transparent
color<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.930> set<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.680> color<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.100> be

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
color and set one color to be

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.280 
color and set one color to be
transparent<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.540> even<00:01:33.930> change<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
transparent you can even change the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.630 
transparent you can even change the
spacing<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.369> looks

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
spacing with that right there looks

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.999 
spacing with that right there looks
pretty<00:01:35.700> good<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.420> could<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.350> make<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.740> bigger

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
pretty good I could then make it bigger

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.230 
pretty good I could then make it bigger
and<00:01:39.290> move<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:40.680> notice<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.090> doesn't<00:01:42.090> let

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and move it up but notice it doesn't let

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.789 
and move it up but notice it doesn't let
me<00:01:42.270> move<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> off<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.960> page<00:01:43.140> even<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.649> I'm

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
me move it off the page even as I'm

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
me move it off the page even as I'm
dragging<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.460> off<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.869> far<00:01:46.110> as

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
dragging it off here it that's as far as

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.060 
dragging it off here it that's as far as
it<00:01:46.439> will<00:01:46.530> go

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
it will go

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.940 
it will go
to<00:01:47.399> move<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.700> off<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.850> page<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> way

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to move it off the page there is a way

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.460 
to move it off the page there is a way
to<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:51.930> make<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.439> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
to get it to do that to make it so you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.109 
to get it to do that to make it so you
could<00:01:52.649> drag<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.490> further

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
could drag it up a little further

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.130 
could drag it up a little further
take<00:01:54.990> away<00:01:55.200> move<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.740> text<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.450> can

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
take away move with text and then I can

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.850 
take away move with text and then I can
go<00:01:58.259> ahead<00:01:58.939> maybe<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.710> make<00:02:01.710> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
go ahead maybe have it like this make it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.740 
go ahead maybe have it like this make it
even<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> little<00:02:02.189> bit<00:02:02.369> bigger<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.880> want<00:02:03.149> if<00:02:03.630> I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
even a little bit bigger if I want if I

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.969 
even a little bit bigger if I want if I
want<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> rotate<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> bring<00:02:04.860> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
want to rotate it I have to bring it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.069 
want to rotate it I have to bring it
back<00:02:05.130> down<00:02:05.299> rotate<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.540> way<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:06.750> not<00:02:06.899> so

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
back down rotate it this way but not so

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:07.459 
back down rotate it this way but not so

what I want and then click OK and if I

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
don't like that I have to go back into

don't like that I have to go back into

then<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.900> could<00:03:13.020> do<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.200> same<00:03:13.380> thing<00:03:13.440> on

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
then you could do the same thing on

then you could do the same thing on
Microsoft<00:03:14.250> Word<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.700> also<00:03:14.940> does<00:03:15.270> not<00:03:15.300> show<00:03:15.660> it

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.400 
keeps it on the page I can't drag it off
even<00:03:24.000> if<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.180> wanted<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.810> haven't<00:03:25.170> found

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
even if I wanted to and I haven't found

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.130 
even if I wanted to and I haven't found
just<00:03:25.890> quick<00:03:26.130> searching<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.300> way<00:03:27.810> for<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.110> to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
just quick searching a way for it to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.080 
just quick searching a way for it to
allow<00:03:28.350> me<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:28.740> that<00:03:28.890> at<00:03:29.010> all<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.940> gets

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
allow me to do that at all but it gets

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.610 
allow me to do that at all but it gets
even<00:03:30.360> worse<00:03:30.390> if<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.080> go<00:03:31.260> ahead<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.530> I

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
even worse if I go ahead and I

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.100 
even worse if I go ahead and I
right-click<00:03:32.010> on<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.670> say<00:03:32.910> rotate<00:03:33.390> it

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
right-click on it and I say rotate it

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.380 
right-click on it and I say rotate it
only<00:03:34.380> lets<00:03:34.650> me<00:03:34.770> rotate<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.550> ninety<00:03:36.090> degree

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
only lets me rotate it in ninety degree

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.690 
only lets me rotate it in ninety degree
increments<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.890> could<00:03:38.070> go<00:03:38.160> ahead<00:03:38.250> rotate<00:03:38.610> it

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
increments so I could go ahead rotate it

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.980 
increments so I could go ahead rotate it
and<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:38.910> gonna<00:03:39.000> get<00:03:39.180> worse<00:03:39.330> than<00:03:39.570> that<00:03:39.630> even

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
and it's gonna get worse than that even

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.729 
and it's gonna get worse than that even
when<00:03:40.110> we<00:03:40.140> rotate<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.630> contour<00:03:42.630> does<00:03:43.350> not

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
when we rotate it the contour does not

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.370 
when we rotate it the contour does not
wrap<00:03:44.100> with<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.520> so<00:03:44.970> here's<00:03:45.209> my<00:03:45.390> final<00:03:45.690> document

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
wrap with it so here's my final document

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.440 
wrap with it so here's my final document
I<00:03:46.500> have<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> partial<00:03:47.400> penguin<00:03:48.030> in<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> wrong

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
I have a partial penguin in the wrong

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.680 
I have a partial penguin in the wrong
wrapping<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.290> have<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.040> fix<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.580> I<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.570> go

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
wrapping I have to fix that I have to go

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.110 
wrapping I have to fix that I have to go
back<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.200> wrapping<00:03:52.650> take<00:03:52.890> off<00:03:53.100> contour<00:03:53.850> go

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
back to wrapping take off contour go

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.570 
back to wrapping take off contour go
back<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.690> wrap<00:03:54.900> put<00:03:55.230> contour<00:03:55.830> back<00:03:56.070> on

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
back to wrap put contour back on

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.850 
back to wrap put contour back on
that's<00:03:57.330> just<00:03:57.600> what<00:03:58.470> are<00:03:58.560> they<00:03:58.680> thinking

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
that's just what are they thinking

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.740 
that's just what are they thinking
that's<00:03:59.250> just<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.580> mess<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.060> again<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.360> can't

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
that's just a mess and again I can't

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.740 
that's just a mess and again I can't
drag<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.200> off<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.650> can't<00:04:02.310> rotate<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.630> way

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
drag it off I can't rotate it the way

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.479 
drag it off I can't rotate it the way
I'd<00:04:03.900> want<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.290> rotate<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.100> could<00:04:05.250> only

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
I'd want to rotate it I could only

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.510 
I'd want to rotate it I could only
rotate<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.330> in<00:04:06.540> 90<00:04:07.380> degree<00:04:07.500> increments<00:04:08.010> and

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
rotate it in 90 degree increments and

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.220 
rotate it in 90 degree increments and
again<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:08.760> think<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.239> just<00:04:09.750> messes<00:04:09.930> up<00:04:10.200> that

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
again I think it just messes up that

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.100 
again I think it just messes up that
wrapping<00:04:11.070> completely<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:12.570> this<00:04:12.690> one's<00:04:12.900> quite

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
wrapping completely so this one's quite

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.530 
wrapping completely so this one's quite
a<00:04:13.170> bit<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.530> mess<00:04:13.709> here<00:04:13.940> hard<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.120> suggest

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
would be that rectangle I'm gonna hit

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.920 
would be that rectangle I'm gonna hit
done<00:05:02.890> I<00:05:03.100> could<00:05:03.250> go<00:05:03.340> ahead<00:05:03.490> redo<00:05:04.330> that<00:05:04.510> instant

to<00:05:11.680> rotate<00:05:12.070> it<00:05:12.220> I<00:05:12.370> do<00:05:12.430> need<00:05:12.790> to<00:05:12.820> either<00:05:13.060> use

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
to rotate it I do need to either use

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.500 
to rotate it I do need to either use
this<00:05:14.020> rotation<00:05:14.620> icon<00:05:14.980> right<00:05:15.190> here<00:05:15.220> or<00:05:15.850> I<00:05:15.910> need

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
this rotation icon right here or I need

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.720 
this rotation icon right here or I need
to<00:05:16.660> know<00:05:16.930> to<00:05:16.990> hold<00:05:17.290> down<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.530> command<00:05:17.860> key<00:05:18.310> and

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
to know to hold down the command key and

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.990 
to know to hold down the command key and
that<00:05:19.420> will<00:05:19.600> let<00:05:19.690> me<00:05:19.840> rotate<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.410> I<00:05:20.850> can<00:05:21.850> then

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
that will let me rotate it I can then

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.580 
that will let me rotate it I can then
drag<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.390> up<00:05:22.480> here<00:05:22.540> it<00:05:22.840> lets<00:05:22.930> me<00:05:23.110> go<00:05:23.230> off<00:05:23.410> the

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
drag it up here it lets me go off the

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.680 
drag it up here it lets me go off the
page<00:05:23.740> if<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.130> want<00:05:24.400> I<00:05:24.670> can<00:05:25.000> even<00:05:25.210> drag<00:05:25.420> it<00:05:25.600> from

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
page if I want I can even drag it from

page if I want I can even drag it from
this<00:05:25.870> one<00:05:26.580> really<00:05:27.580> nice<00:05:27.880> really<00:05:28.360> simple<00:05:28.810> very

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
this one really nice really simple very

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.130 
this one really nice really simple very
much<00:05:29.590> real-time<00:05:30.010> very<00:05:30.370> smooth<00:05:30.820> if<00:05:31.540> I<00:05:31.720> move<00:05:31.990> it

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
much real-time very smooth if I move it

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.810 
much real-time very smooth if I move it
to<00:05:32.230> the<00:05:32.320> center<00:05:32.590> if<00:05:33.070> that's<00:05:33.280> what<00:05:33.430> I<00:05:33.490> want<00:05:33.700> it

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
to the center if that's what I want it

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.090 
to the center if that's what I want it
you<00:05:33.850> can<00:05:34.060> see<00:05:34.330> there<00:05:34.630> are<00:05:34.870> markers<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.919> let<00:05:36.010> you

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
you can see there are markers to let you

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.360 
you can see there are markers to let you
know<00:05:36.280> and<00:05:36.580> it<00:05:36.700> snaps<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.390> it<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.860> there<00:05:39.040> we<00:05:39.190> go<00:05:39.220> I

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
know and it snaps to it so there we go I

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.640 
know and it snaps to it so there we go I
could<00:05:39.610> snap<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:40.630> snap<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.230> puts<00:05:41.410> it<00:05:41.530> right

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
could snap and snap that puts it right

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.390 
could snap and snap that puts it right
in<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.830> center<00:05:42.010> I<00:05:42.370> can<00:05:43.120> move<00:05:43.419> it<00:05:43.540> back<00:05:43.750> up<00:05:44.400> move

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
in the center I can move it back up move

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.820 
in the center I can move it back up move
it<00:05:45.550> off<00:05:45.669> the<00:05:45.700> page<00:05:46.030> some<00:05:46.390> so<00:05:47.169> really<00:05:47.530> smooth

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
it off the page some so really smooth

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.950 
it off the page some so really smooth
down<00:05:48.580> site<00:05:48.910> it<00:05:49.060> doesn't<00:05:49.210> have<00:05:49.419> quite<00:05:49.600> as<00:05:49.720> many

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
down site it doesn't have quite as many

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.860 
down site it doesn't have quite as many
options<00:05:50.290> as<00:05:50.680> Microsoft<00:05:51.250> Office<00:05:51.400> so<00:05:52.300> Microsoft

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
options as Microsoft Office so Microsoft

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.720 
options as Microsoft Office so Microsoft
Word<00:05:53.200> I<00:05:53.320> think<00:05:53.500> has<00:05:53.650> more<00:05:53.800> options<00:05:54.310> this<00:05:54.490> one

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
Word I think has more options this one

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.630 
Word I think has more options this one
is<00:05:54.940> easier<00:05:55.540> mint<00:05:56.320> with<00:05:56.530> lipra<00:05:56.950> this<00:05:57.280> doesn't

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
is easier mint with lipra this doesn't

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.220 
is easier mint with lipra this doesn't
really<00:05:57.790> have<00:05:57.970> much<00:05:58.000> going<00:05:58.419> for<00:05:58.720> it<00:05:58.780> in<00:05:59.050> this

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
really have much going for it in this

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.500 
really have much going for it in this
area<00:05:59.500> one<00:06:00.190> thing<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.520> keep<00:06:00.669> in<00:06:00.820> mind<00:06:00.880> though<00:06:01.300> is

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
area one thing to keep in mind though is

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.330 
area one thing to keep in mind though is
that<00:06:01.540> for<00:06:01.750> many<00:06:02.080> things<00:06:02.320> it<00:06:02.590> does<00:06:02.830> work<00:06:03.070> well

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
that for many things it does work well

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.580 
that for many things it does work well
and<00:06:03.550> unlike<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.480> other<00:06:04.510> two<00:06:04.810> programs<00:06:05.050> it's

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
and unlike the other two programs it's

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.990 
and unlike the other two programs it's
free<00:06:06.040> so<00:06:06.640> each<00:06:07.030> one<00:06:07.330> does<00:06:07.570> have<00:06:07.780> its<00:06:07.930> benefits
