00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
approximation of the weight or initial

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.550 
approximation of the weight or initial
position<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.730> mean<00:03:25.510> there's<00:03:25.780> such<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:25.989> short<00:03:26.350> cut

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
position I mean there's such a short cut

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.000 
position I mean there's such a short cut
and<00:03:26.950> it's<00:03:27.430> uh<00:03:27.519> it's<00:03:28.359> only<00:03:28.660> cheating<00:03:28.870> if<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.739> do

she'll<00:03:45.310> start<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.670> get<00:03:45.880> in<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.359> saw<00:03:46.600> it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
she'll start to get in that you saw it

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.229 
she'll start to get in that you saw it
she<00:03:46.930> get<00:03:47.440> in<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.650> position<00:03:47.799> stable<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.880> then

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
she get in that position stable and then
