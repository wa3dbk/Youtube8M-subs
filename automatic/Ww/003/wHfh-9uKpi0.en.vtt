00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.290
 One side 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.290
 1 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:18.039
 Michiko Nakamura 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.460
 5 billion yen by Ming University 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.300
 Locked 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.300
 Obtained a municipality 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.929
 End 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.300
 After leaving for 27 years ago 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.940
 Though I did 30 pieces of Esashi, it is an eco-friendly set 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.940
 Although it was good if there were few 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.930
 Has done 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.109
 When I was told by DoCoMo 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.089
 I was told that the guards are natural but 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.440
 Come on April 10 of the annual year 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.309
 In that Seibu activity can survive 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.920
 The two students in f. 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.990
 It is still a result by having worked on town some other time 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.530
 It will be difficult to provide reports through 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.450
 I am 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.190
 I got a brass band when I entered high school 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.799
 When 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.909
 It was one day E 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.570
 3 years here 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.359
 3 years ago I was sent to work 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.340
 Became an adviser when I was three years ago 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.930
 Because I wanted to do something like that in this book together 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.070
 It was dull and vicious that I was remembered by the scared mayor 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.890
 I have an instrument 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.040
 The people we can have at that time 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.360
 I have slept well for 1-3 days before I came 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.310
 Once 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.680
 I think that I heard it first and then last 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 When I did that I felt like a master 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.969
 But burden 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.339
 A little 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.339
 f1 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:26.870
 that's all 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.870
 The concert that took place at Tokyo Dome 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.699
 I am sending food engineering 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:35.969
 At this moment 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.559
 Everyone used it usually 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.429
 The same can be done. 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:45.809
 But I think you're a stallion this ten o'clock- 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:49.899
 Afternoon at 5:00 pm boarding is Sukagawa people 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:53.609
 Too at each work place instead 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.599
 After all the body is like this 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.409
 City and housing investment is significantly higher 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.129
 40 years 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.129
 I'm really thankful to you 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.750
 That's right 41 years 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.530
 First of all, people from this area are parents and then 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.420
 I hope everyone in the reunion really loves that heart 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.410
 I think I've given you, in that sense really everyone 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.900
 Thank-you words for 41 years and the school itself 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.669
 That against 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.749
 I feel like I want to say the type of thank you words 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:41.669
 I am 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.740
 13 years 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.730
 Luckily, I will continue to watch the summer talk but the last graduate 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.239
 It was disappointing because the country was 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.329
 Let me explain as a state school through spring and summer 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.979
 It is the school I received 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:03.839
 If it's huge, I know a lot of flat rate 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:07.549
 I will tell you that I will have been doing it tomorrow 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.829
 I entered the service 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.579
 It is natural to realize that it was also a dish
