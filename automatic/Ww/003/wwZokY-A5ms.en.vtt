00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.099
 we will learn how to make a 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.040
 origami pyramid so for that we 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.179
 are going to need an a4 sheet of 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.560
 scotch and a pair of scissors and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.730
 start over we'll do like those 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:31.650
 a4 will fold the sheet 2000 and nice 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:36.899
 on the edges like these open all 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:43.290
 heated to four pillars each side of 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:50.579
 the sheet in two failures does not actually 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:54.390
 helped is strong like those on his 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.059
 benefits of the edges and me then when 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.940
 we come here they want to take 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:05.010
 see here it's the end of the line we're going 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.210
 take here is folded up to the middle there 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.600
 must this point arrived in the middle 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.850
 and that it's a tre thrive there are coming 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.259
 well our tips to form a triangle 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:23.040
 a stick 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.509
 what are you waiting for here is perfect 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.520
 see you have to do like these 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:38.100
 mitigates the good dead on his good 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:40.490
 then we will bend it this 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.490
 part 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:54.820
 like this yes like the one formed a 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:03.010
 phase of their permit or leave on 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:06.130
 the edge do the same it has to be 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:11.880
 well this line is the police come 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.880
 continuous and we did one last time 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:27.150
 stretch like this then we will bend you 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:31.330
 the income except that it's like that 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.000
 Then we will fold so that in seven 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.000
 ronald case our conflict 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:52.150
 you see here here in this line that's it 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.630
 perfect when we finished this 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.510
 step 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.030
 here's what we're going to do us 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:07.330
 let's go everything is folded 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:13.110
 the caf put us like these here and 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.110
 here you see we're going to reform there 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:25.120
 I put myself well it's quite complicated 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.420
 so here you see we're going 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:37.060
 put that end inside these 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:43.210
 little leaves in the slot there in 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.430
 seven centers here is perfect now 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:52.410
 we love in the slot 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:57.430
 we'll take a scotch end see 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:05.920
 already see how to put the caramy so 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:14.170
 we will take a piece of tape and the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:15.400
 master here again here here it's 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.660
 complicated on your own but you can 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:28.930
 ask someone for help 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:29.880
 stick here is perfect but we 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.750
 let's go back 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:37.050
 this is it and our pyramid is over 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:42.970
 you see it's an origami pyramid 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:44.530
 to determine and trendy so here 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.080
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.530
