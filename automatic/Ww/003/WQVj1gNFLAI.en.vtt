00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.817
 Consider two concepts that are often found, and they are often confused with each other. 

00:00:09.338 --> 00:00:13.194
 We have a few minutes to clarify the differences between salt and sodium. 

00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:19.061
 We know that they are related, but I would like to finally clarify what the differences are, 

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:22.286
 and how to understand all these numerous numbers, 

00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:26.175
 which indicate how much and what should I consume daily. 

00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:29.950
 I love salty. At home I have salt shaker. 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.924
 She's standing next to a pepper pot, 

00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:35.217
 and I use it very often during lunch. 

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:41.276
 Sometimes it seems to me that I use too much salt. 

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:44.027
 I really put a lot of it in food. 

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:46.947
 So, let's say we have a spoonful of salt. 

00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:49.282
 Let it be a teaspoon of salt. 

00:00:55.273 --> 00:00:59.191
 Imagine that I took this teaspoon of salt and weighed it on the scales. 

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:04.235
 It turned out that one teaspoon of salt weighs about 6 grams. 

00:01:05.207 --> 00:01:10.798
 Let me write it down. So, about six grams. 

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:15.773
 And six grams corresponds to 6000 milligrams. 

00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:19.387
 So, this is the mass of one teaspoon of salt. 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.259
 And now the question arises, how much sodium does it contain? 

00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:30.854
 To answer it, let's remember that salt is sodium chloride, NaCl. 

00:01:33.043 --> 00:01:34.397
 It consists of these two elements. 

00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:37.502
 And if you agree that there is nothing in my salt cell 

00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:40.642
 besides sodium chloride, ants did not get there, for example, 

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:43.450
 no impurities, only NaCl, 

00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:49.711
 then I can assume that all 6000 milligrams of salt consist only of sodium and chlorine. 

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:52.787
 Good. 

00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:56.429
 Now, for sure it was clear, this is the sodium part, 

00:01:56.773 --> 00:02:00.354
 and Cl stands for the chloride part, we figured it out. 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.502
 And they are all atoms, with certain units of atomic mass. 

00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:14.350
 The mass of atoms can be measured and built in size, by weight, from the heaviest to the lightest. 

00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:20.459
 And sodium has a mass of about 23 units, 

00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:24.015
 and chlorine is about 35 units. 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.903
 So this is chloride, and here is sodium. 

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:36.719
 Thus, if I want to summarize them, then I will add 23 and 35 and I will receive 58 units as a result. 

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:40.289
 A unit, I remind you, or, even better, I will write down, 

00:02:40.572 --> 00:02:42.081
 these units are atomic mass. 

00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:45.925
 And now I got the total value of the atomic mass. 

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:51.133
 I can find out what percentage is sodium, and what percentage is chlorine. 

00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:53.981
 So let's consider the first part, sodium. 

00:02:54.336 --> 00:03:00.044
 I can simply calculate how much 23 units are of a total of 58 units. 

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:02.194
 These units are shrinking. 

00:03:02.931 --> 00:03:04.801
 And we get about 40%. 

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:11.409
 And this means that approximately 40% of the salt mass in reality is the sodium part, 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:13.532
 and chlorine makes up the rest of the mass. 

00:03:14.663 --> 00:03:21.002
 So, it turned out that 35 units from 58 units is about 60%. 

00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:25.524
 And again, the units are reduced, and we get 60%. 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.962
 So now we know that in salt 40% of the total mass is sodium, and 60% is chloride. 

00:03:33.537 --> 00:03:34.108
 It's clear. 

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:37.465
 And now I would like to go back to my teaspoon again. 

00:03:37.747 --> 00:03:42.013
 A teaspoon contains 6 grams, or 6000 milligrams of salt. 

00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:48.814
 To determine the mass of each element in a teaspoon, I can simply multiply 6,000 by these indicators, 

00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:52.935
 to calculate what part of the mass is sodium, and which is chlorine. 

00:03:53.813 --> 00:04:02.538
 So, sodium is 40% of 6000, which, if you multiply these two values, will give you 2400 milligrams of sodium. 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.898
 And 60% from 6000 gives 3600 milligrams of chlorine. 

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:16.260
 And now I learned that a teaspoon contains 2,400 milligrams of sodium. 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.996
 I specifically reviewed a variety of recommendations that state 

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:25.263
 how much sodium you should get from your diet, 

00:04:25.797 --> 00:04:28.719
 if you are missing any serious illnesses. 

00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:34.579
 I will write it this way: normal daily salt intake, or a normal amount. 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.899
 I'll write it down. 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.074
 And this is the usual amount, this is the normal salt content, 

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.272
 and here is the low salt content. 

00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:47.349
 It will be low in salt. 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.961
 And if you are on a low salt diet, 

00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:55.298
 then you can calculate how much salt you can or should consume. 

00:04:55.752 --> 00:04:58.312
 The same is true for normal consumption. 

00:04:58.783 --> 00:05:02.827
 What amount of salt you should consume in normal diet. 

00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:06.688
 And I'm going to follow both rations in terms of salt, 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.514
 and in terms of sodium. 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.524
 So let's look first in terms of salt. 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.854
 The normal amount you should be getting - let me write down "per day." 

00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:21.441
 And now let's do the calculations for sodium and right here for the salt. 

00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:25.784
 So the usual amount of sodium you should get per day, 

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:30.042
 is about 2300 milligrams. 

00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:41.264
 And if you are on a low-salt diet, you should get about 1,500 milligrams. 

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:48.742
 Now we know that 1 teaspoon contains 2400 milligrams and 2400 

00:05:48.742 --> 00:05:51.988
 and 2300, I suppose, very close values. 

00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:55.778
 So with that in mind, I can assume that 

00:05:55.832 --> 00:06:00.020
 This means that I can eat about one teaspoon of salt per day. 

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:07.393
 With a low-salt diet, you are advised to consume no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium. 

00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.480
 And if one teaspoon contains 2400 milligrams of sodium, 

00:06:12.984 --> 00:06:19.045
 then 1500 is 2/3 of it, that is, it is about 2/3 teaspoon of salt. 

00:06:20.114 --> 00:06:21.145
 I'll write it down too. 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.947
 Let's go back to our teaspoon of salt, 

00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:29.692
 now we know and remember that if i stick 

00:06:29.692 --> 00:06:34.111
 normal diet, I can consume one spoon daily, 

00:06:34.741 --> 00:06:36.714
 not with every meal, but every day. 

00:06:37.968 --> 00:06:44.358
 And if I follow a diet low in salt, then I can fill it with only 2/3 of the volume, and not more, 

00:06:44.858 --> 00:06:47.623
 not to exceed the recommended amount. 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
