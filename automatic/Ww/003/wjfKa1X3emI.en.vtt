00:00:02.283 --> 00:00:06.801
 Good afternoon, this morning, the Federal Supreme Court decided to pass the Affordable Care Act. 

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.933
 Good afternoon, this morning, the Federal Supreme Court decided to pass the Affordable Care Act. 

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:13.051
 That is, the health care reform we passed two years ago. 

00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:16.900
 By this, the Supreme Court has consolidated a basic principle. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.983
 In the United States, the richest country in the world. 

00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:26.450
 No disease or accident can threaten the financial situation of any family 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.983
 I know that there will be a series of paradoxes about this case in the future. 

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:33.317
 Arguing who wins and who wins 

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:36.767
 In Washington, people are used to seeing this problem in this way. 

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:39.916
 But these paradoxes completely miss the key points. 

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:43.750
 Regardless of the policy, this decision is a victory for the people of the country. 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.301
 This bill and the support of the Supreme Court will make people's lives more secure. 

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:51.517
 This bill and the support of the Supreme Court will make people's lives more secure. 

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:54.433
 Because this bill has a direct impact on the lives of many people. 

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:59.483
 I would like to take this opportunity to explain to you the significance of this bill to all of you. 

00:00:59.483 --> 00:01:04.267
 First, if you have health insurance like the other 250 million Americans 

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:08.917
 You can continue to maintain your existing health insurance 

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:12.683
 And this bill will only make the situation more stable and reduce your burden. 

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:15.900
 Insurance companies will not be able to limit your lifetime beneficiary rights 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.301
 Insurance companies will not be able to limit your lifetime beneficiary rights 

00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:20.900
 They cannot ignore children with congenital diseases 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.083
 You can't stop your insurance project because you are sick. 

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.833
 You can't stop your insurance project because you are sick. 

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:29.833
 They can't help increase your insurance premiums. 

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.718
 They must provide free disease prevention measures 

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:35.000
 Such as health checkups and mammography 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.283
 The bill has benefited 54 million people who are in private health care. 

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:40.017
 The bill has benefited 54 million people who are in private health care. 

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:44.083
 In August this year, nearly 13 million people will receive a refund from the insurance company. 

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:45.683
 In August this year, nearly 13 million people will receive a refund from the insurance company. 

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:49.384
 Because insurance companies spend too much money on management 

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:54.050
 As well as the CEO’s bonus, your health care is only a small part. 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.469
 Furthermore, 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.916
 Affordable medical law also allows young people under the age of 26 

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:01.517
 Can be paid under the parents’ health insurance plan 

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:03.301
 This regulation has benefited six million young Americans. 

00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.950
 This regulation has benefited six million young Americans. 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.400
 And because of this bill, older people can enjoy discounts when purchasing prescription drugs. 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.301
 This discount allows more than five million seniors to save money 

00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:14.699
 Each person can save about $600 in medical insurance costs 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.533
 Each person can save about $600 in medical insurance costs 

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.650
 These benefits existed because of the cheap medical law. 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.899
 The regulations in the bill provide the protection for the middle class families. 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:28.385
 Also provide them with ample funding 

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:32.099
 Thanks to the decision of the Supreme Court, the people who have health care 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.767
 Can continue to enjoy benefits and care 

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:40.417
 If you are not as healthy as the other 30 million people 

00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:45.083
 This bill will be available in 2014. 

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:50.567
 A range of affordable health plans for you to choose from 

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:54.468
 Each state can lead its own program 

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:56.750
 This bill also allows states to customize their own methods. 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.051
 At the same cost, so that more people get the same level of protection 

00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.301
 I have asked Congress to speed up the process and within the first year of the term. 

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:09.433
 Grant each state this flexible authority once the states are established 

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:13.467
 These health care markets, known as health insurance exchanges 

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.517
 Insurance companies will not be able to ignore any 

00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:19.433
 The rights of people with birth disabilities 

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:22.551
 They can't charge different fees because of gender differences 

00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:26.100
 It’s also impossible to get you into financial crisis because of the premium you charge. 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.683
 When you are sick, you also have a strong burden 

00:03:28.683 --> 00:03:33.000
 Affordable health care resources at the same level as others 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.067
 If you can't afford the insurance, you can get a loan to pay for it. 

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:40.683
 The Supreme Court also adopted a principle today. 

00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:43.135
 That is, people who can afford health care 

00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:46.483
 Should bear the responsibility of purchasing health insurance 

00:03:46.483 --> 00:03:49.366
 Two reasons contributed to this important decision 

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:52.884
 First, people who are burdened with health insurance but not insured 

00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:56.483
 Go to the emergency room for help when you need it. 

00:03:56.483 --> 00:04:01.718
 We will be able to increase the premiums to cover their medical needs. 

00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:04.351
 Second, if you ask for an insurance company 

00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:07.017
 Inclusion of insured persons with insurance 

00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:09.916
 But don’t ask people who have a strong burden to buy their own health insurance. 

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.900
 These people may be able to buy insurance when they are sick. 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.767
 This will also increase your premiums. 

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:20.367
 This is why, I insist on during the administration 

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:23.283
 Implement this philosophy even if the bill is not popular 

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:27.017
 Finally, we still include this regulation in the Affordable Care Act. 

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:32.983
 That is, people who are burdened with health insurance should bear the responsibility of purchasing health insurance. 

00:04:32.983 --> 00:04:37.867
 In fact, both the ruling and the opposition support this bill. 

00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:40.700
 Republican presidential candidate is also one of them 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.301
 But I know that this bill still faces great opposition. 

00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:48.483
 I respect the concerns of millions of Americans. 

00:04:48.483 --> 00:04:51.067
 I also understand that the controversy of this health insurance lies in its political implications. 

00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:54.500
 I also understand that the controversy of this health insurance lies in its political implications. 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.801
 Now everyone should understand that my intention is not because 

00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.333
 This is a good policy, but because I believe 

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.783
 This bill will bring benefits to the country. 

00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:07.417
 Will bring benefits to the American people 

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:10.817
 There is a letter on the wall of my office. 

00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:13.067
 During the resolution of the bill, a woman named Natoma sent me this letter. 

00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:16.218
 During the resolution of the bill, a woman named Natoma sent me this letter. 

00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:19.583
 Natoma fulfills what she does every year. 

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:23.483
 Buy health insurance and pay health insurance premiums on time 

00:05:23.483 --> 00:05:27.300
 But she suffered from cancer 18 years ago. 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.417
 Although she has not relapsed for more than a decade 

00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:34.801
 Her insurance company has raised her interest rate every year. 

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:38.400
 Although she wants to maintain the original insurance program 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.850
 Worried that they may be cancer again 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.301
 She has to succumb to health insurance and is forced to face economic pressure. 

00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.600
 In those days when I tried to pass the bill, I kept thinking about Natoma’s experience. 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.833
 This reminds me of those who are worried about getting sick, 

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:57.884
 American people who have to worry about medical expenses 

00:05:57.884 --> 00:06:01.233
 American people who have to worry about medical expenses 

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:04.283
 Natoma is doing very well now. 

00:06:04.283 --> 00:06:09.033
 With this bill, children, brothers and sisters and parents 

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:12.033
 These family members no longer need to be threatened by economic pressure 

00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:14.950
 These family members no longer need to be threatened by economic pressure 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.634
 For these people, we passed this bill. 

00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:22.384
 The Supreme Court on this land has spoken 

00:06:22.384 --> 00:06:24.968
 We will continue to implement this bill 

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:28.217
 And work together to improve 

00:06:28.217 --> 00:06:31.883
 But we and the country won't 

00:06:31.883 --> 00:06:35.916
 Reenact the political struggle two years ago or reply to the past model 

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:38.884
 The decision announced today, 

00:06:38.884 --> 00:06:41.783
 Representing the road to improvement in this step 

00:06:41.783 --> 00:06:44.566
 Implement and improve where this bill should be improved 

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:47.582
 Now we should focus on the most important work at present. 

00:06:47.582 --> 00:06:50.783
 That is, let the people return to work. 

00:06:50.783 --> 00:06:53.417
 Repay our debts and build an economic system 

00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:56.134
 Convince the people that as long as they work hard 

00:06:56.134 --> 00:06:58.417
 I can play my own day. 

00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:01.750
 Now I believe as always, 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.884
 When five, ten or twenty years later we look back now 

00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:09.067
 Our life will be better because we had the courage 

00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:13.250
 Pass this bill and continue to move forward 

00:07:13.250 --> 99:59:59.000
 Thank you all! May God bless you and bless America
