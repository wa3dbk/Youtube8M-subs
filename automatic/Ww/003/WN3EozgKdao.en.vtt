William’s kitchen

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Hi, and welcome to William’s kitchen.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Today we’re going to teach you how make Mozell-soda –

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
– on the basis of the label on the backside of the bottle where the ingredients are listed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
First it says that the soda contains 20% water, and further down it’s written carbon dioxide.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Then we use water added carbon dioxide.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That’s enough.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Further on the ingredient list it says that we need 12% apple juice and 8% grape juice.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We’ve decided to only use apple juice.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now it says sugar. Of course, it’s a soda after all.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
On the list it’s written citric acid.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then you use an ordinary lemon.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now we’ve reached the point of aroma, which means fragrance.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
All you have to do is thinking up your favourite fragrance, –

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
– and personally I love candles.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The next ingredient on the list is preserving agent, – 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
– but you only have to include that if you wants to keep the soda for some time, which I’m not going to do today.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now we need colour (caramel E150b), and in your ears that may sounds difficult, –

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
– but all you need is a toffee.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Be sure you chop it into as small pieces as possible –

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
– then it’ll dissolve faster.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It’s important to stir properly.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now it’s time to move on to the last ingredient on the list –

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
–  ascorbic acid.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That’s the same as C-vitamin tablet.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
For those who like their soda cold, I will recommend to put it into the refrigerator for about 5 minutes.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But now we’re going to do some taste testing.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We begin with the originally soda, and then we’ll taste the difference.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Yea, I do know the taste.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And then, our own home-made soda!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Wow, it tasted really good!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Even though it didn’t taste equally, home-made soda does have its own charm.
