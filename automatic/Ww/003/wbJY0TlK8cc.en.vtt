00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
near the end but by then it was a bit

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.179 
near the end but by then it was a bit
too<00:01:18.060> late<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.630> w13<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.590> has<00:01:19.710> been<00:01:19.890> fine

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
too late here w13 it has been fine

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.370 
too late here w13 it has been fine
there's<00:01:20.400> been<00:01:20.520> very<00:01:20.759> few<00:01:20.880> issues<00:01:21.479> regarding

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
there's been very few issues regarding

there's been very few issues regarding
it<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.520> seems<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.180> big<00:01:24.600> issue

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it but this seems to be a big issue

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.070 
it but this seems to be a big issue
right<00:01:25.020> now<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.680> terms<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.450> game<00:01:27.659> itself

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
right now in terms of the game itself

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.200 
right now in terms of the game itself
not<00:01:28.320> big<00:01:28.590> issue<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.579> series<00:01:30.030> but

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
not big issue of all the series but

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.179 
not big issue of all the series but
certainly<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.689> 13<00:01:31.049> where<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> does<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.159> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
certainly in 13 where it does take a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
certainly in 13 where it does take a
while<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.549> load<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.479> obviously<00:01:33.840> because<00:01:34.140> of
