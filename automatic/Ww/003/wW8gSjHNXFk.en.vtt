00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 it's the kingdom of fjords and gold 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.020
 black norway 5 million inhabitants 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.019
 one of the biggest producers of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.019
 oil of the planet become in 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.940
 a few years a paradise for cars 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 electrical 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.920
 sales are exploding this time more 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.109
 important that in France here told a 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.039
 electric car for 160 inhabitants 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.550
 the highest ratio in the world in the city 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.269
 it is very convenient to drive 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.750
 the electric is much less 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.980
 expensive than gasoline 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.780
 why such a success 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 how did norway get this 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.420
 tour de force first reason buy 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.539
 an electric car here costs less 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.620
 expensive than buying a gas car 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.200
 this mother came to choose 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.739
 her model and she did not put it well 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.360
 a long time to make the decision to buy one does not 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.340
 not pay the 25% VAT on the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.199
 electric it's great she's not 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.399
 expensive and more the trends frankly 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.219
 it's the best deal we can 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.239
 do in norway right now and I 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.090
 believe I'm going to the red learner 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.900
 finally for this Peugeot 100% 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.000
 electric she will pay 17500 euros 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.430
 with taxes the essence equivalent him 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
 would have cost more than 25,000 but the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
 Norwegian government even went 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.409
 further on in norway driving a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.270
 electric car makes you a 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.680
 privileged for example to enter 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.270
 the big cities do not need you 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.860
 pay 4 euros of congestion charge 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.580
 for electric cars 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.580
 it's free 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.970
 and once in town no longer need to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.770
 take out your wallet for you 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.200
 park all the public car parks of the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.790
 city ​​are also free same thing 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.220
 to charge your car there are some 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.060
 terminals everywhere near 900 to oslo 5000 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.560
 in all of norway 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.479
 and again there is nothing to pay other 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 privilege electric vehicles 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.780
 can use the bus lanes 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.729
 especially at rush hour 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.159
 an advantage that allowed us to 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.220
 climb sales skyrocketing but it did not 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.470
 not only happy 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.039
 I am against this measure 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.660
 it creates traffic jams 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.980
 additional even more chaos 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.360
 for me it's okay but it's mostly 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.760
 for my clients they waste time 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.590
 crazy and if they take a taxi it's for 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.990
 to get somewhere fast otherwise it's 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.000
 it's not worth it 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.100
 professionals who moan a lack at 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.020
 earn tax of 500 million euros 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.060
 for the state without counting the setting 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.400
 free provision of electricity 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.970
 all this is expensive but for the town hall 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.650
 oslo 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.530
 no question of giving up these 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.700
 incentives of course that has a cost for 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.620
 the city for the country 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.150
 but economically we find ourselves 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.560
 less pollution means less 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.320
 health problems related to pollution 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.760
 especially the winter days the town hall 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.100
 d'oslo even has a fleet 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.820
 100% electric story to show 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.430
 example 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.680
 now in norway a car in 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.830
 circulation out of 5 runs at 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.830
 electricity
