in<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.920> previous<00:00:05.339> lesson<00:00:05.759> on<00:00:06.089> functions<00:00:06.629> a

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
in a previous lesson on functions a

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.640 
in a previous lesson on functions a
function<00:00:06.859> was<00:00:07.859> defined<00:00:08.130> as<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> way<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.150> analyze

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
function was defined as a way to analyze

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.270 
function was defined as a way to analyze
two<00:00:10.730> unrelated<00:00:11.730> sets<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.210> numbers<00:00:12.950> by<00:00:13.950> now<00:00:14.219> you

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
two unrelated sets of numbers by now you

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.550 
two unrelated sets of numbers by now you
should<00:00:14.670> also<00:00:14.880> know<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.750> function<00:00:16.049> could

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
should also know that a function could

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.510 
should also know that a function could
be<00:00:16.740> linear<00:00:16.980> or<00:00:17.869> non-linear

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
be linear or non-linear

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.480 
be linear or non-linear
however<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:21.480> by<00:00:21.930> definition<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.920> single

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
however because by definition a single

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.429 
however because by definition a single
linear<00:00:24.000> function<00:00:24.480> runs<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.990> one<00:00:25.230> direction

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
linear function runs in one direction

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.300 
linear function runs in one direction
only<00:00:26.510> towards<00:00:27.510> positive<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.310> negative

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
only towards positive and negative

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.120 
only towards positive and negative
infinity<00:00:30.019> you<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.590> find<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
infinity you don't have to find the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.209 
infinity you don't have to find the
limits<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.640> linear<00:00:33.120> functions<00:00:34.219> therefore

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
limits of linear functions therefore

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.540 
limits of linear functions therefore
we'll<00:00:35.730> concentrate<00:00:36.210> our<00:00:36.719> analysis<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.829> non

we'll concentrate our analysis on non
linear<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.090> curved<00:00:39.719> limits<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.770> functions

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
linear or curved limits of functions

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.529

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
limits are found all around us in both

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
limits are found all around us in both
the<00:00:45.930> physical<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.879> abstract<00:00:47.989> for<00:00:48.989> example

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the physical and abstract for example

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.930 
the physical and abstract for example
highway<00:00:50.460> lanes<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:51.149> all<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.230> same<00:00:52.440> width

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
highway lanes are all of the same width

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.580 
highway lanes are all of the same width
this<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.149> course<00:00:54.390> puts<00:00:54.750> limits<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.230> how

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
this of course puts limits on how

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.700 
this of course puts limits on how
vehicles<00:00:56.250> are<00:00:56.489> designed<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> limits<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
vehicles are designed but the limits of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.939 
vehicles are designed but the limits of
functions<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.030> abstract<00:01:00.600> type<00:01:00.949> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
functions are of the abstract type the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.380 
functions are of the abstract type the
limits<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.370> functions<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:03.120> defined

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
limits of functions are defined

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.780 
limits of functions are defined
according<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.799> curve<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.610> an

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
according to how the curve of an

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.260 
according to how the curve of an
equation<00:01:06.119> changes<00:01:06.479> direction<00:01:07.760> for<00:01:08.760> example

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
equation changes direction for example

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.530 
equation changes direction for example
this<00:01:10.049> equation<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:11.040> plot<00:01:11.340> gives<00:01:11.820> us<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.180> curve

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
this equation one plot gives us a curve

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.249 
this equation one plot gives us a curve
that<00:01:12.990> moves<00:01:13.290> down<00:01:13.799> from<00:01:14.280> left<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:15.330> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that moves down from left to right it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.010 
that moves down from left to right it
hits<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.740> low<00:01:17.009> point<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:18.270> keeps<00:01:18.570> moving

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
hits a low point and then keeps moving

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.490 
hits a low point and then keeps moving
from<00:01:19.350> left<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.420> time<00:01:21.720> going

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
from left to right but this time going

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700 
from left to right but this time going
up<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:24.030> curve<00:01:24.270> moves<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
up as the curve moves and because it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
up as the curve moves and because it
does<00:01:25.920> occur<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.820> slope<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> curve

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
does occur the slope of the curve

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
does occur the slope of the curve
changes<00:01:28.740> from<00:01:29.100> point<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.939> point<00:01:30.799> as<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.100> moves

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
changes from point to point as it moves

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
changes from point to point as it moves
if<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.119> points<00:01:33.509> are<00:01:33.540> close<00:01:33.930> together

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
if the points are close together

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.609 
if the points are close together
the<00:01:35.100> change<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.880> slope<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.329> small<00:01:36.500> but<00:01:37.500> if

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the change in the slope is small but if

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.010 
the change in the slope is small but if
the<00:01:37.740> points<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.159> wider<00:01:38.549> apart<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the points are wider apart then the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.100 
the points are wider apart then the
change<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.500> slope<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.070> large<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.930> as

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
change in the slope is large so just as

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.899 
change in the slope is large so just as
the<00:01:43.290> coordinates<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.009> each<00:01:44.130> point<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.640> find

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the coordinates of each point to find

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.420 
the coordinates of each point to find
the<00:01:45.060> curve<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.930> slope<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.439> any<00:01:46.619> point<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the curve the slope at any point of the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.749 
the curve the slope at any point of the
curve<00:01:47.670> defines<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.509> limit<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> curve<00:01:49.759> now

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
curve defines the limit of the curve now

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.780 
curve defines the limit of the curve now
because<00:01:51.509> changes<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.439> perpendicular<00:01:53.340> at<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
because changes are perpendicular at the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.270 
because changes are perpendicular at the
point<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.299> contact<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.079> circle<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
point of contact of a circle and it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.370 
point of contact of a circle and it
follows<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.939> any<00:01:57.180> curve<00:01:57.659> could<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.170> made

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
follows that any curve could be made

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.030 
follows that any curve could be made
part<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.159> circle<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.750> tangent<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.740> any

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
part of a circle then a tangent and any

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.130 
part of a circle then a tangent and any
point<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.759> curve<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.780> slope

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
point of the curve is really the slope

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.340 
point of the curve is really the slope
of<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.649> curve<00:02:04.680> at<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.219> point<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.350> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
of the curve at that point and the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.499 
of the curve at that point and the
peculiar<00:02:07.860> thing<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> tangent<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
peculiar thing is that the tangent and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.950 
peculiar thing is that the tangent and
slope<00:02:10.110> changes<00:02:10.860> at<00:02:11.039> every<00:02:11.340> point<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
slope changes at every point and you

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.430 
slope changes at every point and you
ask<00:02:13.110> who<00:02:13.920> cares<00:02:14.390> well<00:02:15.390> there<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:16.020> great

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
ask who cares well there is great

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.770 
ask who cares well there is great
interest<00:02:16.740> by<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> lot<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.730> people<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.300> knowing

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
interest by a lot of people in knowing

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.720 
interest by a lot of people in knowing
or<00:02:18.960> predicting<00:02:19.560> when<00:02:19.770> things<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.280> about<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
or predicting when things are about to

predicting<00:02:22.470> change<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.310> most<00:02:23.520> important

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
predicting change is the most important

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.320 
predicting change is the most important
part<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.660> making<00:02:25.020> decisions<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.760> limits<00:02:27.150> are

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
part of making decisions so limits are

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.810 
part of making decisions so limits are
important<00:02:27.930> because<00:02:28.110> limits<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.280> dynamic

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
important because limits in a dynamic

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.090 
important because limits in a dynamic
changing<00:02:30.540> environment<00:02:31.230> tell<00:02:31.470> us<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.890> things

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
changing environment tell us that things

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.410 
changing environment tell us that things
are<00:02:32.340> about<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.850> change

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
are about to change

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.350 
are about to change
you<00:02:34.170> see<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.800> changed<00:02:35.250> because<00:02:35.430> we<00:02:35.640> reach<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
you see we changed because we reach a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.440 
you see we changed because we reach a
limit<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.430> go<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.910> another<00:02:39.150> direction

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
limit we have to go in another direction

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.990 
limit we have to go in another direction
because<00:02:40.020> we<00:02:40.230> can't<00:02:40.770> go<00:02:41.040> any<00:02:41.430> further

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
because we can't go any further

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.340 
because we can't go any further
so<00:02:42.780> limits<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.410> change<00:02:43.860> go<00:02:44.280> hand-in-hand<00:02:45.350> as

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
so limits and change go hand-in-hand as

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.830 
so limits and change go hand-in-hand as
