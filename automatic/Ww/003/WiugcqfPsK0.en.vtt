 that you are all very well in the 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.360
 today's video I bring you an idea for 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.610
 make Christmas brooches that you can 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.279
 give to your family friends or 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.279
 co - workers is a very detail 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.980
 nice so if you like to stay for 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.900
 see the step by step we will need 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.449
 this type of pompoms in my land are 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.180
 known as strawberry trees and you can 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.740
 find two types in bags or 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.720
 stuck to a strip 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.430
 I am going to use this that is a rest 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.579
 that I had out there saved by the way 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.320
 you can find them in haberdashery like that 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.570
 that the first thing I have to do is go 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.899
 cutting the compose we will need 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.300
 10 for each brooch we cut a 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.449
 Felt rectangle more or less than 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.430
 about 5 x 7 centimeters and let's go 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.989
 hitting the pompoms creating a figure 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.079
 triangular 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.090
 we start hitting one and we go down 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.679
 increasing the number before I got 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.900
 I forgot to tell you that I have a 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.790
 blog and a facebook page in both 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.520
 sites you can find me as things 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.540
 maribel and if you want you can do 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.160
 followers 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.230
 by the way if you are not subscribed to 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.240
 channel I invite you to do it 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.430
 totally free and you will get all 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.140
 the news of my videos 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.360
 once we have done the form of the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.580
 little tree we are going to cut all the felt 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.320
 that we have left over the back 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.320
 more pegadito that you can to the pompoms 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.270
 Now we are going to cut a strip of felt 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.270
 red that will be the foot of our little tree 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.130
 we put a drop of glue from one of 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.430
 the tips and we will guide it forming a 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.430
 roll 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.409
 so they do not come loose, applied another drop 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.409
 of glue 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.130
 and now we paste it in the middle for the part 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.170
 from below like this 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.750
 It's very nice but we 're going to decorate it 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.650
 a little more we can do it with 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.810
 fantasy star spangles or 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.870
 with these brilliant I will do it with 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.489
 the latter choosing the color red 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.470
 although these bright from another in 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.239
 glue I preferred to apply them 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.290
 little hot silicone so that I 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.290
 stay a little stronger 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.080
 I helped pliers carme not the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.820
 fingers 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.070
 and once we have decorated it in the 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.490
 product you have to see something so 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.290
 nice like this to hold it to the 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.600
 clothes we are going to place a safety pin 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.580
 from the back I instead of 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.580
 I sew them a piece of felt 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.760
 and ready it's completely finished 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.040
 you have seen that it is easy and fast both 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.950
 so I made another one and decorate it with the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.750
 golden sequins and others with 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.630
 they make darker and the stars of 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.260
 fantasy the truth is that the three of me 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.260
 they love 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.709
