so Darrell starts by sliding up to the
12th<00:00:04.440> fret<00:00:05.899> and<00:00:06.980> then<00:00:07.980> he<00:00:08.130> plays<00:00:08.400> 9th<00:00:09.000> fret<00:00:09.330> to

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
12th fret and then he plays 9th fret to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.300 
12th fret and then he plays 9th fret to
12th<00:00:10.110> fret

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.310 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:24.330 

you<00:00:14.310> go<00:00:14.540> 912<00:00:15.540> 912<00:00:16.820> intro<00:00:18.320> whelmed<00:00:19.320> love

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.560 

and<00:00:25.340> then<00:00:25.490> you're<00:00:25.610> gonna<00:00:25.670> slide<00:00:26.060> up<00:00:26.090> this<00:00:26.420> is

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
and then you're gonna slide up this is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.800 
and then you're gonna slide up this is
in<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.780> next<00:00:27.050> bar<00:00:27.230> up<00:00:28.130> to<00:00:28.280> the<00:00:28.400> 14th<00:00:28.910> fret<00:00:29.120> so

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
in the next bar up to the 14th fret so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.689 
in the next bar up to the 14th fret so
again<00:00:30.080> that's

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.439 

and<00:00:35.359> then<00:00:35.449> when<00:00:35.570> you<00:00:35.660> get<00:00:35.809> here

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.930 

so<00:00:41.440> it's<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.679> same<00:00:41.859> kind<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.250> shape<00:00:42.519> keeps

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
so it's the same kind of shape keeps

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:53.080 
so it's the same kind of shape keeps
happening

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.189 

14<00:00:54.090> 12<00:00:54.330> 14<00:00:54.960> 14<00:00:55.440> 14

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
14 12 14 14 14

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.150 
14 12 14 14 14
that's<00:00:57.589> probably<00:00:58.010> important<00:00:59.769> then<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.920> same

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
that's probably important then the same

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.950 
that's probably important then the same
shape<00:01:01.579> moved<00:01:01.909> over<00:01:02.179> to<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.390> Dean<00:01:02.539> g-string<00:01:04.960> so

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
shape moved over to the Dean g-string so

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.810 
shape moved over to the Dean g-string so
more<00:01:06.140> time

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.270 

they<00:01:11.820> went<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> next<00:01:12.450> bar<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:13.260> he<00:01:13.470> goes

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.430 

so<00:01:18.060> twice<00:01:18.450> been<00:01:18.960> released<00:01:20.390> 14<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.540> 12<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.960> 14<00:01:22.320> on

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
so twice been released 14 to 12 to 14 on

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.850 
so twice been released 14 to 12 to 14 on
the<00:01:22.470> D

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.620 

nanny's<00:01:27.640> gonna<00:01:27.820> go

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.990 

so<00:01:32.560> that's<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.890> band<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.340> release<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.820> pull

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
so that's a band and release and pull

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.070 
so that's a band and release and pull
off<00:01:34.150> on<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.450> G<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:37.090> B<00:01:39.090> 15th<00:01:40.090> fret<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.570> then

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
off on the G on the B 15th fret and then

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.240 
off on the G on the B 15th fret and then
you're<00:01:41.229> going<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.409> bend<00:01:41.560> 50<00:01:41.860> in<00:01:41.920> front<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.190> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
you're going to bend 50 in front of the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.370 
you're going to bend 50 in front of the
high

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
high

00:01:44.380 --> 00:02:10.770 
high
of<00:01:44.890> two<00:01:45.490> whole<00:01:45.670> steps<00:01:45.850> in<00:01:46.240> vibrato<00:01:46.570> so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.660

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
picking a little more almost tremolo

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.080 
picking a little more almost tremolo
picking<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:28.099> that's<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.459> basic<00:02:28.790> shape<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090

going to get into a symmetrical sort of

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:09.420 
going to get into a symmetrical sort of
triplets<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.250> pattern<00:02:55.730> here<00:03:02.019> like<00:03:03.019> that

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
and then we have to get that at 7:00

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.430 
and then we have to get that at 7:00
you're<00:03:28.030> gonna<00:03:28.120> pick<00:03:28.360> nine<00:03:28.540> again<00:03:28.870> pull<00:03:29.140> off

you're gonna pick nine again pull off
and<00:03:30.100> do<00:03:30.460> a<00:03:30.490> bench

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.240 

and<00:03:47.159> in<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.430> next<00:03:47.900> two<00:03:48.900> bars<00:03:49.079> gonna<00:03:49.860> do<00:03:50.099> these

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
and in the next two bars gonna do these

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.380 
and in the next two bars gonna do these
big<00:03:51.620> wide<00:03:52.620> bands<00:03:53.069> on<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.280> 17th<00:03:53.790> fret<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.269> we

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
big wide bands on the 17th fret so we

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:05.210 
big wide bands on the 17th fret so we
start<00:04:00.890> we<00:04:01.890> start<00:04:02.159> 17th<00:04:02.579> fret<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:02.879> G<00:04:04.220> when

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
start we start 17th fret of the G when

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.630 
start we start 17th fret of the G when
you<00:04:05.250> get<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.579> up<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.879> step<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.269> half<00:04:07.640> you

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
you get that up a step and a half you

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.699 
you get that up a step and a half you
vibrato<00:04:12.709> first<00:04:13.709> time<00:04:13.890> it's<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.159> step<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.519> half

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
vibrato first time it's a step in half

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.729 
vibrato first time it's a step in half
up<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.859> G<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:17.160> then<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.400> be<00:04:17.549> sharp

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:29.950 

gradually<00:04:21.739> gradually<00:04:22.000> released<00:04:27.759> and<00:04:28.960> now

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
gradually gradually released and now

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.360 
gradually gradually released and now
from<00:04:30.259> here<00:04:30.560> he<00:04:30.620> does<00:04:30.800> this<00:04:30.949> interesting

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
from here he does this interesting

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.710 
from here he does this interesting
chromatic<00:04:32.000> lick<00:04:32.180> we're<00:04:32.419> gonna<00:04:32.539> go<00:04:37.630> they<00:04:38.630> were
