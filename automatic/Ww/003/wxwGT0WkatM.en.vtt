the battery connector since I don't have
to<00:02:10.590> replace<00:02:10.860> my<00:02:10.920> battery<00:02:11.520> your

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
to replace my battery your

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.809 
to replace my battery your
going<00:02:12.379> to<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.769> imagine<00:02:13.010> me<00:02:13.310> putting<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:13.730> a

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
going to have to imagine me putting in a

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.030 
going to have to imagine me putting in a
new<00:02:13.940> one<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.209> replacing<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> case<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.920> can

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
new one and replacing the case you can

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.369 
new one and replacing the case you can
probably<00:02:16.310> stop<00:02:16.790> watching<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.299> video<00:02:17.390> now<00:02:17.750> you

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
probably stop watching the video now you

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.440 
probably stop watching the video now you
know<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.680> got<00:02:18.799> things<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.159> do

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.550 

so<00:02:23.450> you're<00:02:23.569> sticking<00:02:23.810> around<00:02:24.019> because<00:02:24.290> you

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
so you're sticking around because you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.500 
so you're sticking around because you
need<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.799> finish<00:02:24.980> up<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.400> trackpad<00:02:25.670> you've

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
need to finish up the trackpad you've

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.320 
need to finish up the trackpad you've
got<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.930> our<00:02:27.110> project<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.000> video<00:02:29.000> are<00:02:29.150> with

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
got that our project and video are with

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.089 
got that our project and video are with
bizarre<00:02:29.690> religious<00:02:30.200> symbolism<00:02:30.560> doesn't<00:02:31.010> add

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
bizarre religious symbolism doesn't add

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.759 
bizarre religious symbolism doesn't add
it<00:02:31.220> itself<00:02:31.549> right<00:02:32.620> alright

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
it itself right alright

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.220 
it itself right alright
so<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.940> get<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.269> trackpad<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.900> course<00:02:36.110> you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
so to get to the trackpad of course you

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.990 
so to get to the trackpad of course you
have<00:02:36.379> to<00:02:36.530> remove<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.920> battery<00:02:37.069> which<00:02:37.849> you've

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
have to remove the battery which you've

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
tiny brackets used to hold the trackpad

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.319 
tiny brackets used to hold the trackpad
into<00:02:45.379> place<00:02:48.910> may<00:02:49.910> need<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.209> have<00:02:50.299> some

eight in total four for each side after

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.449 
eight in total four for each side after
removing<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.290> screws<00:02:57.620> unplug<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.190> trackpad

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
removing the screws unplug the trackpad

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.550 
removing the screws unplug the trackpad
from<00:02:58.910> its<00:02:59.060> connector<00:02:59.510> you're<00:03:00.170> going<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.349> say

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
from its connector you're going to say

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.800 
from its connector you're going to say
well<00:03:00.859> um<00:03:01.160> he<00:03:01.879> didn't<00:03:02.090> actually<00:03:02.209> pull<00:03:02.569> up<00:03:02.599> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
well um he didn't actually pull up the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.440 
well um he didn't actually pull up the
connector<00:03:03.260> well<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.859> did<00:03:04.430> but<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:04.879> forgot<00:03:04.940> to

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
connector well I did but I forgot to

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.990 
connector well I did but I forgot to
have<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.410> camera<00:03:06.739> rolling<00:03:06.920> but<00:03:07.579> you<00:03:07.670> see<00:03:07.879> that

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
have the camera rolling but you see that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.460 
have the camera rolling but you see that
thing<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.510> right<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.900> screen<00:03:09.019> right

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
thing to the right of the screen right

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.680 
thing to the right of the screen right
in<00:03:09.500> front<00:03:09.709> of<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.890> trackpad<00:03:10.510> that's<00:03:11.510> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
in front of the trackpad that's the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.869 
in front of the trackpad that's the
connector<00:03:12.140> it's<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:12.410> simple<00:03:12.799> pry<00:03:13.129> up<00:03:13.160> motion

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
connector it's a simple pry up motion

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.940 
connector it's a simple pry up motion
kind<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.299> like<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.569> battery<00:03:14.930> connector<00:03:15.470> then

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
kind of like the battery connector then

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.759 
kind of like the battery connector then
lift<00:03:16.220> up<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.700> pull<00:03:17.120> out<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.419> trackpad<00:03:17.769> it's

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
lift up and pull out the trackpad it's

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.770 
lift up and pull out the trackpad it's
kind<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.099> awkward<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:20.120> isn't<00:03:20.269> quite<00:03:20.540> as

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
kind of awkward and it isn't quite as

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.990 
kind of awkward and it isn't quite as
easy<00:03:20.870> as<00:03:21.109> this<00:03:21.230> video<00:03:21.560> makes<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:22.040> look<00:03:22.220> but

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
easy as this video makes it look but

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.550 
easy as this video makes it look but
that's<00:03:23.180> what<00:03:23.389> editing<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:23.780> for<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.410> make

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
that's what editing is for to make

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.960 
that's what editing is for to make
something<00:03:24.829> look<00:03:25.099> like<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.400> took<00:03:25.579> five<00:03:25.790> minutes

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
something look like it took five minutes

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.289 
something look like it took five minutes
when<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:26.840> really<00:03:27.049> took<00:03:27.079> thirty<00:03:27.530> minutes<00:03:28.299> okay

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
when it really took thirty minutes okay

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.379 
when it really took thirty minutes okay
so<00:03:30.260> awkwardly<00:03:31.130> put<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.579> new<00:03:31.730> trackpad<00:03:32.209> in

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
so awkwardly put the new trackpad in

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.629 
so awkwardly put the new trackpad in
then<00:03:33.380> for<00:03:33.620> stability<00:03:33.829> make<00:03:34.340> sure<00:03:34.519> the

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
then for stability make sure the

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.909 
then for stability make sure the
computer<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.299> lying<00:03:35.569> flat<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.260> it's<00:03:36.650> not

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
computer is lying flat and it's not

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.150 
computer is lying flat and it's not
opened<00:03:37.519> at<00:03:37.639> all<00:03:38.380> replace<00:03:39.380> those<00:03:39.620> eight<00:03:39.799> screws

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
opened at all replace those eight screws

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.050 
opened at all replace those eight screws
they're<00:03:40.669> tiny

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
they're tiny

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.300 
they're tiny
so<00:03:41.690> keep<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.230> tweezers<00:03:42.590> close<00:03:42.799> by<00:03:42.980> in<00:03:43.160> case

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
so keep the tweezers close by in case

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.670 
so keep the tweezers close by in case
you<00:03:43.430> have<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.700> shakes

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.479
