00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.169 
wonder weapons in extinction mode so I'm
not<00:00:07.529> going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.799> specifically<00:00:08.340> show<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.849> any

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.060 
wonder weapons I want to just talk about
the<00:00:12.090> idea<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.599> wonder<00:00:13.170> weapons<00:00:13.590> being<00:00:13.830> an

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
the idea of wonder weapons being an

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.550 
the idea of wonder weapons being an
extinction<00:00:14.580> mode<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:16.230> they

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
extinction mode and what I think they

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.080 
extinction mode and what I think they
will<00:00:16.770> put<00:00:17.100> them<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.400> i'm<00:00:17.520> pretty<00:00:17.789> sure<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
will put them in i'm pretty sure that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.029 
will put them in i'm pretty sure that
they're<00:00:18.359> gonna<00:00:18.449> put<00:00:18.690> some<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.680> type<00:00:20.010> of

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
they're gonna put some some type of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.679 
they're gonna put some some type of
wonder<00:00:20.430> weapon<00:00:20.670> extinction<00:00:21.119> mode<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.570> all

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
wonder weapon extinction mode but it all

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.740 
wonder weapon extinction mode but it all
depends<00:00:22.109> when<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.920> let's<00:00:23.880> look<00:00:24.000> at<00:00:24.240> let's<00:00:24.600> go

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
depends when so let's look at let's go

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.380 
depends when so let's look at let's go
back<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.050> zombies<00:00:25.439> ok<00:00:25.740> 44<00:00:26.189> zombies<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.029> first

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
back at zombies ok 44 zombies the first

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.259 
back at zombies ok 44 zombies the first
ever<00:00:27.720> map<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.349> not<00:00:28.680> sure<00:00:28.890> untoten<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.580> that's

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
ever map was not sure untoten and that's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.990 
ever map was not sure untoten and that's
pretty<00:00:30.539> much<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:31.260> point<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.859> contact<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.730> now

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
pretty much what point of contact is now

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.080 
pretty much what point of contact is now
if<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:34.079> look<00:00:34.260> back<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.860> people<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
if you look back at it people like the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.510 
if you look back at it people like the
map<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.570> much<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.219> was

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
map so much at the time because it was

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760 
map so much at the time because it was
zombies<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.450> zombies<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:40.320> something<00:00:40.559> new

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
zombies and zombies are something new

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.170 
zombies and zombies are something new
and<00:00:41.010> something<00:00:41.040> different<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.700> people<00:00:41.940> liked

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and something different so people liked

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.010 
and something different so people liked
it<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.600> much<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:44.090> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.270> compared<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.870> all

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it so much and if you compared to all

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.560 
it so much and if you compared to all
the<00:00:46.050> other<00:00:46.260> maps<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.100> probably<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the other maps it's probably not one of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.350 
the other maps it's probably not one of
the<00:00:48.750> best<00:00:49.020> maps<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:50.579> didn't<00:00:50.969> put<00:00:51.180> any

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the best maps and they didn't put any

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.150 
the best maps and they didn't put any
wonder<00:00:51.899> weapons<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.829> include<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
wonder weapons if you don't include the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.549 
wonder weapons if you don't include the
ray<00:00:53.399> gun<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.850> guess<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> Reagan<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
ray gun I guess the Reagan can be a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.049 
ray gun I guess the Reagan can be a
Wonder<00:00:55.920> weapon<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.370> we're<00:00:56.520> talking<00:00:56.940> about

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
Wonder weapon but we're talking about

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
all those type of things but they didn't

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450 
all those type of things but they didn't
put<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> Wonder<00:01:02.850> weapon<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.359> until<00:01:04.080> she<00:01:04.860> no<00:01:05.010> numa

so for for extinction right now of

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
so for for extinction right now of
course<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.890> wasn't<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.400> expecting

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
course I wasn't really expecting

course I wasn't really expecting
anything<00:01:12.180> big<00:01:12.840> I'll<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.320> expecting<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
anything big I'll just expecting the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
anything big I'll just expecting the
mode<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.640> people<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.150> people<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
mode to see people how people like it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.950 
mode to see people how people like it
and<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.790> expecting<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.360> Wonder<00:01:18.570> weapon<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and I was expecting a Wonder weapon to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.480 
and I was expecting a Wonder weapon to
come<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.320> down<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> line<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.310> I'm

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
come in down the line now what I'm

come in down the line now what I'm
thinking<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.119> maybe<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.689> second<00:01:22.110> DLC<00:01:22.439> or<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
thinking is maybe the second DLC or the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300 
thinking is maybe the second DLC or the
third<00:01:23.700> DLC<00:01:23.970> they'll<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.680> Wonder<00:01:26.189> weapon

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
third DLC they'll have a Wonder weapon

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.460 
third DLC they'll have a Wonder weapon
but<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:27.060> type<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.080> weapon<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.439> you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
but what type of one or weapon do you

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.399 
but what type of one or weapon do you
put<00:01:28.680> into<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> game<00:01:29.130> now<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.420> take<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
put into the game now if you or take the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.890 
put into the game now if you or take the
the<00:01:32.220> wonder<00:01:32.640> waffle<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.479> were<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> put<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the wonder waffle and you were to put it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.719 
the wonder waffle and you were to put it
straight<00:01:34.200> into<00:01:34.439> extinction<00:01:34.890> mode<00:01:35.220> same

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
straight into extinction mode same

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.530 
straight into extinction mode same
damage<00:01:36.090> everything<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.560> extremely

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
damage everything it would be extremely

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
damage everything it would be extremely
overpower<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> reason<00:01:40.229> why<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.590> for

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
overpower now the reason why is for

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.520 
overpower now the reason why is for
zombies<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.210> endless<00:01:42.780> waves<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
zombies it is endless waves so it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.469 
zombies it is endless waves so it
doesn't<00:01:43.799> matter<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.130> wave<00:01:44.399> after<00:01:44.729> wave<00:01:45.000> after

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
doesn't matter is wave after wave after

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.600 
doesn't matter is wave after wave after
wave<00:01:45.689> after<00:01:46.110> wave<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.799> doesn't<00:01:47.100> end<00:01:47.310> now

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
wave after wave and it doesn't end now

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.639 
wave after wave and it doesn't end now
for<00:01:48.299> an<00:01:48.409> extinction<00:01:49.520> there<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.649> objective

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
for an extinction there is a objective

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.350 
for an extinction there is a objective
when<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.159> complete<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.549> objective<00:01:54.149> you

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
when you complete that objective you

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.179 
when you complete that objective you
complete<00:01:54.810> extinction<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> put<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> wonder

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
complete extinction so you put a wonder

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.789 
complete extinction so you put a wonder
waffle<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.939> into<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> game<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.619> just

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
waffle like that into the game you just

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.260 
waffle like that into the game you just
blow<00:01:59.130> through<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> you'd<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.969> finished

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
blow through it and you'd be finished

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090 
blow through it and you'd be finished
because<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.290> an<00:02:01.380> objective<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.979> like

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
because there is an objective on like

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.520 
because there is an objective on like
zombies<00:02:02.490> worth<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.969> endless<00:02:03.719> wave<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.320> what

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
zombies worth just endless wave so what

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.109 
zombies worth just endless wave so what
I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.860> they<00:02:04.950> need<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.189> do<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.610> they<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:05.969> to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
I think they need to do is they have to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.869 
I think they need to do is they have to
implement<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:07.069> wonder<00:02:08.069> weapon<00:02:08.250> into

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
implement a wonder weapon into

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.630 
implement a wonder weapon into
extinction<00:02:09.270> mode<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.840> isn't<00:02:10.640> extremely

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
extinction mode that isn't extremely

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.890 
extinction mode that isn't extremely
over

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
over

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.259 
over

a normal gun maybe a little little bit
better<00:02:17.459> than<00:02:17.819> every<00:02:18.629> other<00:02:18.659> gun<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.890> make<00:02:20.519> it
