tethering<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.830> sharing<00:00:14.219> your<00:00:14.250> wireless

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
tethering is you sharing your wireless

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.870 
tethering is you sharing your wireless
network<00:00:15.890> with<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:18.770> local<00:00:19.770> area<00:00:19.949> network<00:00:20.130> that

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
network with a local area network that

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.859 
network with a local area network that
is<00:00:21.150> either<00:00:21.619> USB<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:22.890> wireless<00:00:23.750> what<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
is either USB or wireless what the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.200 
is either USB or wireless what the
wireless<00:00:25.260> tethering<00:00:26.099> does<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.699> takes<00:00:27.029> your

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
wireless tethering does is takes your

the Wi-Fi from adapting ability and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.049 
the Wi-Fi from adapting ability and
flips<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> inside<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.469> an<00:00:34.770> application<00:00:35.610> that

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
flips it inside out an application that

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.459 
flips it inside out an application that
i<00:00:36.180> use<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:37.940> net<00:00:38.940> share<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.050> app<00:00:40.260> you

they're<00:02:26.180> not<00:02:26.360> very<00:02:26.600> useful<00:02:26.780> for<00:02:27.020> me<00:02:27.260> because

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
they're not very useful for me because

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.400 
they're not very useful for me because
I'm<00:02:27.710> not<00:02:27.890> really<00:02:28.070> into<00:02:28.520> Android<00:02:29.120> hacking<00:02:29.510> but

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
I'm not really into Android hacking but

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.760 
I'm not really into Android hacking but
um<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:31.520> does<00:02:31.760> come<00:02:32.060> with<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.600> wireless<00:02:33.260> tether

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
um it does come with a wireless tether

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.940 
um it does come with a wireless tether
apple<00:02:34.310> still<00:02:35.210> computing<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:36.050> wireless<00:02:36.710> tether

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
apple still computing a wireless tether

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.630 
apple still computing a wireless tether
app<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.750> wired<00:02:38.750> tether<00:02:39.110> app<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:40.460> does

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
app in a wired tether app and it does

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.710 
app in a wired tether app and it does
come<00:02:40.910> pre<00:02:41.240> rooted<00:02:41.750> I'm<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:43.610> know<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.060> a

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
come pre rooted I'm in you know and a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.160 
come pre rooted I'm in you know and a
wired<00:02:44.960> tethering<00:02:45.740> app<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.340> um<00:02:46.960> that's<00:02:47.960> pretty

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
wired tethering app so um that's pretty

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.540 
wired tethering app so um that's pretty
useful<00:02:48.500> because<00:02:50.230> HTC<00:02:51.230> droid<00:02:51.710> eris<00:02:51.890> does<00:02:52.340> not

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
useful because HTC droid eris does not

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.900 
useful because HTC droid eris does not
come<00:02:52.820> with<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.350> ability<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.620> upgrade<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.250> 2.2

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
come with the ability to upgrade to 2.2

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.800 
come with the ability to upgrade to 2.2
or<00:02:56.000> 2.3<00:02:56.720> which<00:02:57.080> have<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.350> tethering<00:02:57.890> feature<00:02:58.810> so

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
or 2.3 which have a tethering feature so

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.130 
or 2.3 which have a tethering feature so
um<00:03:00.430> that's<00:03:01.430> really<00:03:01.520> useful<00:03:01.880> for<00:03:02.240> me<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.600> it

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
um that's really useful for me and it

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.800 
um that's really useful for me and it
also<00:03:03.290> makes<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.800> phone<00:03:03.980> CPU<00:03:04.640> more<00:03:05.150> accessible

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
also makes the phone CPU more accessible

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.850 
also makes the phone CPU more accessible
making<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.350> phone<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.740> lot<00:03:06.950> faster<00:03:07.280> um<00:03:08.860> so

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
making the phone a lot faster um so

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.370 
making the phone a lot faster um so
these<00:03:10.160> are<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.430> two<00:03:10.670> main<00:03:11.030> reasons<00:03:11.380> why

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
these are the two main reasons why

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.680 
these are the two main reasons why
people<00:03:13.010> root<00:03:13.370> their<00:03:13.580> phones<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:14.030> why<00:03:14.630> you

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
people root their phones and why you

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.750 
people root their phones and why you
should<00:03:14.870> root<00:03:15.200> your<00:03:15.440> phone<00:03:15.620> because<00:03:16.100> there<00:03:16.640> is

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
should root your phone because there is

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.540 
should root your phone because there is
a<00:03:16.790> lot<00:03:16.910> more<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.290> android<00:03:18.710> firmware<00:03:18.980> that

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
a lot more to the android firmware that

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.910 
a lot more to the android firmware that
one<00:03:19.850> can<00:03:20.600> access<00:03:21.020> whether<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.380> rooted<00:03:21.710> just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
one can access whether it rooted just

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.240 
one can access whether it rooted just
like<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.070> jailbroken<00:03:22.580> iphone<00:03:22.880> um<00:03:24.100> there<00:03:25.100> are

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
like a jailbroken iphone um there are

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.780 
like a jailbroken iphone um there are
apps<00:03:25.520> that<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.970> need<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:27.190> root<00:03:28.190> your<00:03:28.430> phone

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
apps that you need to root your phone

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.600 
apps that you need to root your phone
for<00:03:29.180> there's<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.110> many<00:03:30.740> different<00:03:31.160> things<00:03:31.340> you

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
for there's so many different things you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.790 
for there's so many different things you
can<00:03:31.730> do<00:03:31.910> but<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.630> main<00:03:32.870> two<00:03:33.170> reasons<00:03:33.620> are

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
can do but the main two reasons are

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.750 
can do but the main two reasons are
tethering<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.580> roms<00:03:36.190> do<00:03:37.190> with<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.520> what<00:03:37.730> you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
tethering and roms do with that what you

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.970 
tethering and roms do with that what you
will<00:03:37.910> but<00:03:38.600> there<00:03:39.260> are<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.650> many<00:03:39.830> different

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
will but there are so many different

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.010 
will but there are so many different
things<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.550> can<00:03:40.670> do<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.390> unlocks<00:03:41.840> the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
things you can do and it unlocks the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.720 
things you can do and it unlocks the
full<00:03:42.200> potential<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.800> your<00:03:42.950> phone<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.400> I

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
full potential of your phone and I

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.240 
full potential of your phone and I
definitely<00:03:43.990> would<00:03:44.990> recommend<00:03:45.020> it<00:03:45.740> I'm<00:03:45.980> not

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
definitely would recommend it I'm not

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.770 
definitely would recommend it I'm not
sure<00:03:46.310> if<00:03:46.580> it's<00:03:46.640> illegal<00:03:46.940> or<00:03:47.210> not<00:03:47.270> but<00:03:47.630> it's

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
sure if it's illegal or not but it's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.900 
sure if it's illegal or not but it's
definitely<00:03:48.080> worth<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.860> if<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.160> do<00:03:49.340> do<00:03:49.520> it<00:03:49.550> I'm

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
definitely worth it if you do do it I'm

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.690 
definitely worth it if you do do it I'm
not<00:03:50.720> condoning<00:03:51.050> it<00:03:51.320> I'm<00:03:51.500> not<00:03:51.680> distributing<00:03:52.550> it

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
not condoning it I'm not distributing it

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.160 
not condoning it I'm not distributing it
but<00:03:52.910> i<00:03:52.940> will<00:03:53.240> say<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.450> it's<00:03:53.840> definitely

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
but i will say that it's definitely

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.310 
but i will say that it's definitely
worth<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.860> and<00:03:55.070> android<00:03:55.670> was<00:03:56.170> keeping<00:03:57.170> to

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
worth it and android was keeping to

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
worth it and android was keeping to
their<00:03:57.470> word<00:03:57.680> when<00:03:57.890> they<00:03:57.980> didn't<00:03:58.310> make<00:03:58.490> it<00:03:58.520> as

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
their word when they didn't make it as

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.520 
their word when they didn't make it as
inaccessible<00:04:01.340> as<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.790> iPhone<00:04:02.330> did<00:04:02.570> and<00:04:02.870> they

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
inaccessible as I iPhone did and they

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.449 
inaccessible as I iPhone did and they
definitely<00:04:05.320> allowed<00:04:06.320> what<00:04:06.800> they<00:04:06.920> said<00:04:07.250> when

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
definitely allowed what they said when

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.449 
definitely allowed what they said when
they<00:04:07.520> say<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.270> they<00:04:08.570> allow<00:04:09.500> open-ended

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
they say that they allow open-ended

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.590 
they say that they allow open-ended
development<00:04:11.390> more<00:04:12.020> than<00:04:12.200> iphone<00:04:12.920> with<00:04:13.190> their

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
development more than iphone with their

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.599 
development more than iphone with their
sdk<00:04:14.600> apps<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.860> whatnot<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:16.370> also

yeah it's just much more useful the
phone<00:04:23.750> is<00:04:23.900> much<00:04:24.110> more<00:04:24.289> useful<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.889> I<00:04:25.099> android

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
phone is much more useful that I android

phone is much more useful that I android
phone<00:04:26.180> should<00:04:26.360> have<00:04:26.389> come<00:04:26.659> with<00:04:26.770> already<00:04:27.770> open

phone should have come with already open
root<00:04:28.370> access<00:04:28.780> but<00:04:29.780> um<00:04:30.189> another<00:04:31.189> thing<00:04:31.460> is<00:04:31.490> with

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
root access but um another thing is with

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.570

the<00:04:34.000> ruling<00:04:35.000> on<00:04:35.150> an<00:04:35.539> HTC<00:04:36.379> evo<00:04:36.949> i<00:04:36.979> believe<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.460> is

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the ruling on an HTC evo i believe it is

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.649 
the ruling on an HTC evo i believe it is
that<00:04:38.419> you<00:04:39.409> get<00:04:39.560> full<00:04:39.889> HD<00:04:40.430> mixs<00:04:41.180> meaning<00:04:41.539> that

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:41.659 
that you get full HD mixs meaning that

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.969 
that you get full HD mixs meaning that
you<00:04:41.810> can<00:04:41.960> plug<00:04:42.139> it<00:04:42.289> into<00:04:42.439> a<00:04:43.090> TV<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.449> get<00:04:44.629> full
