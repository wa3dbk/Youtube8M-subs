 hello youtube friends , how are you? 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.240
 night 66 and today I bring you a new 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.180
 tutorial on how to speed up your PC in 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.119
 windows 7 I do not really know if it works 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.949
 in windows xp but we'll try because 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.780
 here I have my guideline first we 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.140
 we place here in search file 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.760
 we put more config 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.760
 and they give him enter 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.530
 or you blame me for another shit parasite 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.000
 eve is confident 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.000
 click on the file 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.149
 we give you to see start 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 here we give advanced options and here 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.420
 you will leave without marking you give to 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 light and kilo palomear each andris make 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.050
 you by default turn it on 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:17.460
 will come out one we put two and you 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:20.040
 we place to accept then apply 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.070
 I can and accept to you something will come out 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.270
 that they should laugh is restart the pc and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.190
 all that and restart it if I do not expect 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.740
 until the other trick that is the following 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.740
 good we go to team properties 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.610
 we go to advanced configurations 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.610
 about the topic 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 we 're going to the configuration we're going to 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.610
 advanced options and here they give to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.220
 change the disc to you not to them 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.210
 it will come out like that as I do not have but 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.570
 here where the custom size says 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.980
 they give him the little circle and they modify this and 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.759
 place these same numbers that I have 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.010
 I good down here when it says size 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.440
 maximum always has to go double or 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.160
 a little more or a little less gives what 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.200
 same but approximately I placed 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.830
 5,300 and yes it's fast 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.990
 computer and this serves more to capture 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.650
 and programs that record for games 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.770
 same goes a long way for your pc because it's 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.530
 much quicker good after doing 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.690
 this to change the values ​​here they give to 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.060
 set to be placed and 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.980
 then they give him to accept here they give him 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.090
 apply applying to accept accept 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.069

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.959
