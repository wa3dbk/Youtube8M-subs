nice<00:00:21.480> useful<00:00:21.990> spot<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.590> easy<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.220> but

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
nice useful spot it's easy to get to but

nice useful spot it's easy to get to but
I<00:00:23.970> was<00:00:24.570> also<00:00:24.689> kind<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.050> complaining<00:00:25.350> about<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
I was also kind of complaining about the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.290 
I was also kind of complaining about the
fact<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.220> accessory<00:00:26.670> kit<00:00:26.910> was<00:00:27.029> fairly

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
fact that that accessory kit was fairly

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.390 
fact that that accessory kit was fairly
expensive<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.500> could<00:00:28.710> probably<00:00:29.130> pretty

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
expensive and you could probably pretty

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400 
expensive and you could probably pretty
easily<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> watch<00:00:30.689> strap<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.260> just

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
easily get a watch strap to do just

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.880 
about the same thing today's video we're
doing<00:00:33.809> something<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.559> different

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
doing something a little bit different

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.990 
doing something a little bit different
we're<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.040> using<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> cable

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
we're out using this is a cable

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200

management velcro tie and it's a little

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.910 
management velcro tie and it's a little
bit<00:00:39.300> smaller<00:00:39.660> than<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> watch<00:00:40.230> strap<00:00:40.620> there's<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
bit smaller than a watch strap there's a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
bit smaller than a watch strap there's a
reason<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> give<00:00:42.750> an

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
reason for that but just to give an

hard<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> come<00:00:56.370> by<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.760> most<00:00:57.570> people<00:00:57.870> probably

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
hard to come by and most people probably

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.389 
hard to come by and most people probably
have<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> couple<00:00:58.500> lying<00:00:58.859> around<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.280> they've

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
have a couple lying around but they've

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
have a couple lying around but they've
gotten<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.449> different<00:01:00.809> laptop<00:01:01.199> chargers<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
gotten on different laptop chargers and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.759 
gotten on different laptop chargers and
stuff<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.300> reason<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:04.680> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
stuff like that so the reason I put this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.469 
stuff like that so the reason I put this
together<00:01:05.100> before<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.119> using

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
together before was it as actually using

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.750 
together before was it as actually using
it<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> bike<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:08.010> had<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> couple<00:01:08.490> GoPros

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
set up on the bike and one of them all

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.260 
set up on the bike and one of them all
to<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.470> controlled<00:01:10.860> from<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.310> GoPro<00:01:12.210> remote

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
to be controlled from one GoPro remote

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450 
to be controlled from one GoPro remote
that<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.720> easily<00:01:13.110> visible<00:01:13.380> from<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.159> bike

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

now I'm just gonna use this standing set
that<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.270> use<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.600> filming<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that I use for filming because it's a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.039 
that I use for filming because it's a
lot<00:01:43.649> easier<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.009> bring<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.369> stand<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.540> inside

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
lot easier to bring this stand in inside

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.289 
lot easier to bring this stand in inside
than<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> actual<00:01:46.770> bike<00:01:47.040> handlebars<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.240> we

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
than the actual bike handlebars so we

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.069 
than the actual bike handlebars so we
just<00:01:48.479> wrapped<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> around<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:50.720> stuck<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.899> on

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
just wrapped it around there stuck it on

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.460 
just wrapped it around there stuck it on
to<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> handlebars<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.479> just<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.869> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
to the handlebars and just like that it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.530 
to the handlebars and just like that it
was<00:01:55.560> complete<00:01:55.979> super<00:01:56.759> simple<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> mount<00:01:57.360> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
was complete super simple to mount and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.990 
was complete super simple to mount and
this<00:01:57.750> gave<00:01:57.960> us<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.140> great<00:01:58.590> way<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.000> continuously

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
this gave us a great way of continuously

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
this gave us a great way of continuously
monitoring<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:01.350> was<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.829> those

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
monitoring what was going on of those

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.620 
monitoring what was going on of those
three<00:02:02.219> cameras<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.640> being<00:02:02.909> able<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.119> control

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
three cameras and being able to control

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.270 
three cameras and being able to control
all<00:02:03.899> three<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.320> them<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.040> same<00:02:05.130> time<00:02:05.430> from

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
all three of them at the same time from

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.010 
all three of them at the same time from
our<00:02:06.580> handlebars<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.360> this<00:02:07.480> allowed<00:02:07.690> us<00:02:07.720> just

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
our handlebars and this allowed us just

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.270 
our handlebars and this allowed us just
to<00:02:08.140> make<00:02:08.320> sure<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:08.590> they<00:02:09.130> were<00:02:09.190> all
