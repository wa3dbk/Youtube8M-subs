00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 they are all boys and welcome the new 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.130
 hunting video of the legendary well 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.980
 we totaled 1,146 beauty 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.309
 gm because there is the 55 percent bonus 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.810
 how every weekend is or fool 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.410
 Saturday will go to 399 and then 930 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.210
 beautiful and today there is also another event 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 if we buy 500 gems it will give us one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 chance for the chest is really written 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.410
 here in other events 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.719
 here it is perhaps said the treasure if we 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.879
 we buy 500 gems give us the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.020
 let yourself open a chest 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.030
 Palagym excluded and bonuses better 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.730
 therefore prefer bonuses now 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.469
 we will start rolling immediately then yes 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.719
 he always hopes to get legendary but 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.449
 if we think less we activate something for 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.180
 but to empower it here is therefore always 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.920
 constantly from 150 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.030
 then I would love the challenges you are done 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.789
 everything and Rome so much here I do not Sunday 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:11.810
 the law m then enters engagements with the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:13.619
 jammin and 150 150 150 c 50 150 150 150 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.720
 beautiful girls 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.549
 today it's already over without getting anything 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.130
 these see luck is not always 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.619
 on our side 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.090
 in fact it was a very fast roll 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.990
 now let's look at what we have now 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.729
 obtained 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.420
 oh, alchemist one out of five then 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:36.320
 forgiveness is a crap heavy raid e 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.530
 had already built you can get away with 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:46.049
 remember snakes 25 cyclops sprints 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.590
 1 on 5 3 on 5 attention regeneration 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.939
 this powerful executioner and gang 25 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:00.240
 regeneration and then there is the sap then 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:03.140
 I now keep at least three of us 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.850
 by the four and four normal heroes companies 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.830
 why so after when I will have three more 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.520
 I will put them inside 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.950
 now type we sacrifice those who don't 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.080
 they serve me then here we immediately throw the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.870
 sap so I'm trying to bring between 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.650
 su nine because it is very fundamental therefore 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.030
 then it goes well i have four perfect 4 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.720
 normal and instead I have the beauty here 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.620
 of eight working we throw the cyclops 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.840
 that I already have so much 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.190
 the reggina snake this snake dinner 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:43.110
 it sucks where we then throw off the cycle 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:47.130
 it was true already existing cyclops at the auction 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.650
 to go up and I should throw two more 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.280
 kick presses throw this out for it 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.850
 this panda a checa that three out of five 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.390
 almost all of this executioner here at 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.430
 siena because 35 i don't mind though though 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.310
 put the lock on the year here it is 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.570
 let's stop it so he can sacrifice it 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.190
 here it is used by very little 250 e 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.320
 in power I know that downhill of a 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.610
 pava little now what decent lock 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.350
 why not love 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.790
 here and now or throw another one 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.890
 this man out of five 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.230
 I know that this band had there 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.600
 super 25 regeneration doesn't love le 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.790
 let's throw the fathers we love the lock 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.220
 so it is not that you can already served then 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.900
 in place and throw in the perfect 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.940
 let's put the padlock to the others that yes 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.920
 can give us later I will find again more 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:47.489
 powerful that will find more powerful me 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.959
 I will sacrifice them ok so we will 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:55.760
 also a chance to be used 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.750
 meanwhile let's go and make the chest go 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.940
 so I never understood this 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.340
 how it works because it doesn't type 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.910
 he made you the chest tells you you have one 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.910
 chance 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.299
 already because the activity is not finished by 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.299
 rava 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:18.440

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.240
 dong challenge and i can't deny it too 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.160
