00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
the reason why you should use your

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.479 
the reason why you should use your
insecure<00:00:30.179> chat<00:00:30.660> next<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.140> because<00:00:31.560> next

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
insecure chat next it's because next

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.389 
insecure chat next it's because next
drops<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.300> highest<00:00:34.050> price<00:00:34.440> items<00:00:35.130> in

drops the highest price items in
runescape<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:37.040> like<00:00:38.040> total<00:00:38.879> toilet

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
runescape and like total toilet

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.290 
runescape and like total toilet
/<00:00:39.480> Nick's<00:00:39.719> virtus<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
/ Nick's virtus you just it's just the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.209 
/ Nick's virtus you just it's just the
items<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:42.780> amazing<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.440> armor<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.770> amazing

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
items are amazing the armor is amazing

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.549 
items are amazing the armor is amazing
so<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:44.850> why<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.000> should<00:00:45.300> use<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:45.930> next

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
so that's why I should use it at next

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.520 
so that's why I should use it at next
plus<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.610> drop<00:00:47.879> rate<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.600> nexus<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.320> out<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
plus the drop rate for nexus one out of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
plus the drop rate for nexus one out of
30<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> chances<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.270> getting<00:00:51.360> an<00:00:51.510> item

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
30 so the chances of you getting an item

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.180 
30 so the chances of you getting an item
from<00:00:51.870> next<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.350> much<00:00:52.620> more<00:00:52.770> higher<00:00:52.980> than

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
from next is much more higher than

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
from next is much more higher than
getting<00:00:53.430> item<00:00:53.699> from<00:00:53.850> Colby's<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.870> you're<00:00:55.079> a
