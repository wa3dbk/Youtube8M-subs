that that legacy not only of Han but of

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.289

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
because if you think about it these

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.490 
because if you think about it these
characters<00:02:53.150> they<00:02:54.150> lived<00:02:54.450> those<00:02:54.840> stories<00:02:55.320> that

we all grew up with they grew up at the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.000 
we all grew up with they grew up at the
same<00:02:57.660> time<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.080> those<00:02:58.230> stories<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.860> know<00:02:58.980> I

mean<00:02:59.220> Poe<00:02:59.820> was<00:03:00.299> probably<00:03:00.690> he<00:03:01.110> was<00:03:01.230> there

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
mean Poe was probably he was there

the medal ceremony was happening

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.590 
the medal ceremony was happening
thinking<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.430> want<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.760> be<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.120> want<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.510> be

Star Wars I think working with the
legends<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.280> have<00:03:26.310> gone<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:27.750> already<00:03:28.200> made

legends that have gone have already made

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.020 
legends that have gone have already made
this<00:03:28.769> kind<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.070> universe<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.670> coming<00:03:29.880> back<00:03:30.000> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
this kind of universe and coming back to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.970 
this kind of universe and coming back to
it<00:03:30.180> was<00:03:30.810> everything<00:03:31.500> we<00:03:31.620> could<00:03:31.769> have<00:03:31.890> hoped

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
it was everything we could have hoped

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.729 
it was everything we could have hoped
for<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.400> more<00:03:32.430> they're<00:03:33.090> funny<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.840> warm<00:03:34.410> and

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
for and more they're funny and warm and

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.620 
for and more they're funny and warm and
welcoming<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:36.139> made<00:03:37.139> us<00:03:37.350> feel<00:03:37.380> as<00:03:37.889> part<00:03:38.250> of

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
welcoming and made us feel as part of

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.809 
welcoming and made us feel as part of
the<00:03:39.630> universe<00:03:40.079> as<00:03:40.380> they<00:03:40.560> already<00:03:40.799> are

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
the universe as they already are

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.140 
the universe as they already are
so<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.599> was<00:03:42.719> great<00:03:42.989> we<00:03:43.709> didn't<00:03:44.010> really<00:03:44.790> have<00:03:45.120> a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
so it was great we didn't really have a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.190 
so it was great we didn't really have a
lot<00:03:45.360> of<00:03:45.390> conversations<00:03:46.230> about<00:03:46.849> bad<00:03:47.849> or<00:03:48.329> evil

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
lot of conversations about bad or evil

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.369 
lot of conversations about bad or evil
actually<00:03:49.739> when<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:49.980> were<00:03:50.750> shooting<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:52.019> that

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
actually when we were shooting it that

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.720 
actually when we were shooting it that
it<00:03:52.620> was<00:03:52.739> more<00:03:53.239> what<00:03:54.239> do<00:03:54.299> you<00:03:54.390> think<00:03:54.629> is<00:03:55.730> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
it was more what do you think is the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.280 
it was more what do you think is the
difference<00:03:56.760> between<00:03:57.180> being<00:03:57.510> bad<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:59.340> being

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
difference between being bad and being

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.619 
difference between being bad and being
right<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.799> think<00:04:02.400> which<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.879> huge<00:04:03.209> difference

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
right I think which is a huge difference

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.119 
right I think which is a huge difference
don't<00:04:04.409> know<00:04:04.530> what<00:04:04.620> can<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.739> tell<00:04:04.890> us<00:04:04.950> about

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
evil and he's British so yep I found it

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.479 
evil and he's British so yep I found it
exciting<00:04:17.690> because<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.289> found<00:04:19.949> it<00:04:20.130> not<00:04:20.250> only

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
exciting because I found it not only

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.390 
exciting because I found it not only
exciting<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.269> there<00:04:21.479> was<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.720> female

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
exciting that there was a female

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.480 
exciting that there was a female
stormtrooper<00:04:27.110> but<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.320> was<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:29.250> opportunity

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
stormtrooper but it was the opportunity

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.320 
stormtrooper but it was the opportunity
to<00:04:30.210> explore<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:31.199> female<00:04:32.099> character<00:04:32.820> that<00:04:33.030> is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
to explore a female character that is

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.140 
to explore a female character that is
totally<00:04:34.080> not<00:04:34.440> about<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.949> way<00:04:35.130> she<00:04:35.550> looks<00:04:35.880> in

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
totally not about the way she looks in

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.790 
totally not about the way she looks in
flesh<00:04:36.539> and<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:38.220> armor<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.229> exterior<00:04:40.229> and<00:04:40.440> and

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
flesh and that armor is exterior and and

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.310 
flesh and that armor is exterior and and
it's<00:04:41.310> more<00:04:41.550> like<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.910> outside<00:04:42.539> feeding<00:04:42.990> in

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
it's more like the outside feeding in

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.469 
it's more like the outside feeding in
and<00:04:43.590> I<00:04:44.009> just<00:04:44.280> found<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.610> very<00:04:44.729> exciting<00:04:44.910> that

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
and I just found it very exciting that

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.689 
and I just found it very exciting that
underneath<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:46.229> that<00:04:46.710> armor<00:04:47.130> is<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.280> woman

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
underneath that that armor is a woman

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.730 
underneath that that armor is a woman
and<00:04:47.880> I<00:04:48.030> think<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.389> makes<00:04:48.570> it<00:04:48.750> really<00:04:48.960> more

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
and I think it makes it really more

00:04:49.740 --> 00:05:01.810 
and I think it makes it really more
relevant<00:04:50.220> than<00:04:50.340> ever<00:04:50.490> Carrie<00:04:51.210> Fisher

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
we picked up where we left up but we

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.910 
we picked up where we left up but we
left<00:05:04.500> off<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.800> while<00:05:05.220> ago<00:05:06.080> so<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.470> was<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.650> long

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
left off a while ago so it was a long

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.040 
left off a while ago so it was a long
leave<00:05:08.280> off<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.820> then<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.450> then<00:05:09.690> we're<00:05:10.020> back

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
leave off and then and then we're back
