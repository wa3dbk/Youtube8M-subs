 giampaolo very nice to all 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.270
 boys at the beginning I had a little fear 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.200
 in short, this new knowledge, however 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.200
 compared to the people I know 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.250
 I came to the shops, I saw something that you 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.289
 liked and understand things in 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.270

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.940
 steals to never loan more history e 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.910
 the culture of tradition or even the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.580
 modern side in short mainly for 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.260
 this contrast from old and new 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.340
 but let's say that even the old part 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:22.090
 it also inspired me a lot in my field 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.640
 so it struck us from maybe a little 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.769
 that in Tokyo there are some neighborhoods 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.470
