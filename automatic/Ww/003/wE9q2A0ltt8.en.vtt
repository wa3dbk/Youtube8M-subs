take it apart so it has the connector
right<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.369> connector<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.909> fused

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
right here now this connector is fused

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.020 
right here now this connector is fused
to<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:58.020> part<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> staff<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.939> also

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
to this part of the staff and it also

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.730 
to this part of the staff and it also
comes<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.420> another<00:02:00.719> connector<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.590> right

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
comes with another connector it's right

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.030 
comes with another connector it's right
here<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.469> so<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.860> take

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
here and this is so that you can take

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.190 
here and this is so that you can take
this<00:02:05.490> half<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.969> staff<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.840> his<00:02:06.930> hand

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
this half of the staff out of his hand

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.820 
this half of the staff out of his hand
and<00:02:07.469> it'll<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.890> two<00:02:08.520> chainsaw<00:02:09.090> staffs

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
and it'll have two chainsaw staffs

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
and it'll have two chainsaw staffs
theoretically<00:02:10.830> -<00:02:11.580> chainsaw<00:02:11.819> blades

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
theoretically - chainsaw blades

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.150 
theoretically - chainsaw blades
kind<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.470> when<00:02:13.680> Marcus

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
kind of like when Marcus

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.030 
kind of like when Marcus
in<00:02:14.550> half<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.000> played<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> game<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.770> he<00:02:16.890> can

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
in half if you played a game so he can

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
in half if you played a game so he can
have<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.910> connector<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.720> so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
have that and the connector is just so

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.180 
have that and the connector is just so
that<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.110> connect<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> broken

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
that you can connect it to the broken

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.130 
that you can connect it to the broken
portion<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.150> looks<00:02:21.330> like<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:21.600> kind

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
portion because it looks like it's kind

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.930 
portion because it looks like it's kind
of<00:02:22.170> cracked<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.680> stuff<00:02:22.920> which<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.340> for

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
of cracked and stuff which is for

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.410 
of cracked and stuff which is for
detail-wise

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
detail-wise

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.390 
detail-wise
and<00:02:24.630> then<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.110> put<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.380> over<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.280> he

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and then you put this over it so that he

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.850 
and then you put this over it so that he
can<00:02:26.550> hold<00:02:26.730> both<00:02:27.120> sides<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:28.410> that's<00:02:28.560> kind<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.770> a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
can hold both sides so that's kind of a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.640 
can hold both sides so that's kind of a
cool<00:02:28.980> feature<00:02:30.110> articulation<00:02:31.110> wise<00:02:31.260> he's

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
cool feature articulation wise he's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.830 
cool feature articulation wise he's
literally<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> Kansas<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
literally if you have a Kansas is the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.690 
literally if you have a Kansas is the
exact<00:02:34.230> same<00:02:34.470> articulation<00:02:34.800> as<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.340> Cantus

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
exact same articulation as you Cantus

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.770 
exact same articulation as you Cantus
there<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:35.970> not<00:02:36.180> one<00:02:36.420> thing<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.960> different

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
there is not one thing that is different

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.200 
there is not one thing that is different
the<00:02:39.780> only<00:02:39.990> thing<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:41.070> mean<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:41.970> it's

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
the only thing is that I mean it's it's

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.520 
the only thing is that I mean it's it's
not<00:02:42.360> something<00:02:42.660> where<00:02:42.990> it's<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.200> every

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
not something where it's like every

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.070 
not something where it's like every
single<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:44.010> has<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.490> problem<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.840> can't

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
single one has the problem if you can't

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.170 
single one has the problem if you can't
is<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.410> had<00:02:46.800> had<00:02:47.040> major<00:02:47.250> articulation

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
is that I had had major articulation

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.120 
is that I had had major articulation
problems<00:02:48.600> with<00:02:48.780> three<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.200> his<00:02:49.320> three<00:02:49.920> yeah

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
problems with three of his three yeah

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.000 
problems with three of his three yeah
three<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.460> his<00:02:50.550> joints<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.990> really<00:02:52.650> had<00:02:52.830> to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
three of his joints and I really had to

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.620 
three of his joints and I really had to
move<00:02:53.640> him<00:02:53.790> around<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.090> even<00:02:54.300> had<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.480> use<00:02:54.510> a

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
move him around I even had to use a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.300 
move him around I even had to use a
knife<00:02:54.870> around<00:02:55.290> some<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.890> them<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.100> get<00:02:56.220> him

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
knife around some of them to get him

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.930 
knife around some of them to get him
open<00:02:56.520> but<00:02:58.010> Scourge<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.220> although<00:02:59.730> he<00:02:59.850> has

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
open but Scourge here although he has

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.310 
open but Scourge here although he has
the<00:03:00.000> same<00:03:00.180> articulation<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.780> had<00:03:00.930> absolutely

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
the same articulation I had absolutely

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.890 
the same articulation I had absolutely
no<00:03:01.500> problems<00:03:01.920> with<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.730> always<00:03:02.880> good<00:03:03.120> but

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
no problems with so it's always good but

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780 
no problems with so it's always good but
he<00:03:04.170> has<00:03:04.260> good<00:03:04.410> articulation<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.730> a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
he has good articulation so you have a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.880 
he has good articulation so you have a
Cantus<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.240> know<00:03:06.360> exact<00:03:06.630> articulation<00:03:07.350> so

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
Cantus you know exact articulation so

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.170 
Cantus you know exact articulation so
really<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.220> highly<00:03:08.430> recommend<00:03:08.850> if<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.030> have<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
really I highly recommend if you have a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.000 
really I highly recommend if you have a
campus<00:03:09.540> then<00:03:09.750> you'd<00:03:09.930> actually<00:03:10.350> know<00:03:10.620> exactly

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
campus then you'd actually know exactly

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.400 
campus then you'd actually know exactly
what<00:03:11.190> scorches<00:03:11.580> but<00:03:12.240> um<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.810> don't<00:03:13.050> he<00:03:13.290> has

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
what scorches but um if you don't he has

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.290 
what scorches but um if you don't he has
really<00:03:13.650> good<00:03:13.740> articulation<00:03:14.040> he<00:03:14.610> can<00:03:14.850> move<00:03:15.120> in

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
really good articulation he can move in

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.820 
really good articulation he can move in
any<00:03:15.480> way<00:03:15.690> shape<00:03:15.900> or<00:03:16.020> form<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.380> only<00:03:16.530> problem<00:03:16.800> I

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
any way shape or form the only problem I

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.080 
any way shape or form the only problem I
have<00:03:16.950> with<00:03:17.040> mine<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.460> this<00:03:17.640> foot<00:03:17.850> it's<00:03:17.970> like

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
have with mine is this foot it's like

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.770 
have with mine is this foot it's like
way<00:03:18.270> too<00:03:18.330> loose<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:19.620> uh<00:03:19.650> no<00:03:20.310> big<00:03:20.490> deal<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.720> I'm

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
way too loose but uh no big deal so I'm

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.540 
way too loose but uh no big deal so I'm
gonna<00:03:21.900> show<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.260> quick<00:03:22.470> size<00:03:22.860> comparison

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
gonna show you a quick size comparison

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.800 
gonna show you a quick size comparison
so<00:03:23.820> here's<00:03:24.750> scored<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.160> right<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:27.510> here's

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
so here's scored to the right and here's

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.310 
so here's scored to the right and here's
a<00:03:28.430> cog<00:03:29.430> soldier<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.660> as<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.900> see<00:03:30.959> they're

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
a cog soldier so as you can see they're

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.170 
a cog soldier so as you can see they're
relatively<00:03:31.860> about<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.160> same<00:03:32.400> height<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.060> you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
relatively about the same height and you

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.760 
relatively about the same height and you
already<00:03:33.420> know<00:03:33.540> about<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.930> size<00:03:34.140> comparison

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
already know about the size comparison
