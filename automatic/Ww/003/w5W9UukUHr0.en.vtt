it's<00:00:59.030> a<00:00:59.090> fighting<00:00:59.450> game<00:00:59.660> but<00:00:59.739> it's<00:01:00.739> kind<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:00.950> a

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
it's a fighting game but it's kind of a

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.930 
it's a fighting game but it's kind of a
strange<00:01:01.400> one

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
strange one

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.520 
strange one
in<00:01:02.150> fact<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.480> it<00:01:02.750> feels<00:01:02.960> like<00:01:03.110> something<00:01:03.470> I

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
in fact it it feels like something I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.310 
in fact it it feels like something I
would<00:01:03.620> have<00:01:03.739> played<00:01:03.949> on<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.250> Nintendo<00:01:04.940> 64

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
would have played on the Nintendo 64

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.500 
would have played on the Nintendo 64
both<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.530> good<00:01:06.710> way<00:01:06.860> in<00:01:07.010> a<00:01:07.100> bad<00:01:08.060> way

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
both in a good way in a bad way

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.800 
both in a good way in a bad way
so<00:01:09.050> clash<00:01:09.680> of<00:01:09.979> elementalists<00:01:10.970> puts<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:11.660> in

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
so clash of elementalists puts you in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.100 
so clash of elementalists puts you in
the<00:01:11.900> middle<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.410> a<00:01:14.410> clash<00:01:15.410> of<00:01:15.790> elementalists

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
the middle of a clash of elementalists

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.540 
the middle of a clash of elementalists
actually<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:18.229> more<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:18.890> dispute<00:01:19.310> than

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
actually it's more of a dispute than

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.740 
actually it's more of a dispute than
anything<00:01:19.729> else<00:01:19.970> because<00:01:20.270> there's<00:01:20.509> only

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
anything else because there's only

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.870 
anything else because there's only
freaking<00:01:21.259> four<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.710> them<00:01:21.830> anyway<00:01:22.670> each

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
freaking four of them anyway each

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.290 
freaking four of them anyway each
elementalist<00:01:23.720> is<00:01:24.020> an<00:01:24.350> animate<00:01:25.009> girl<00:01:25.300> funny

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
elementalist is an animate girl funny

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.150 
elementalist is an animate girl funny
how<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.509> works<00:01:26.899> out<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.560> of<00:01:27.710> course<00:01:27.770> each

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
how that works out and of course each

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.520 
how that works out and of course each
one<00:01:28.190> uses<00:01:28.789> a<00:01:28.820> different<00:01:29.060> element<00:01:29.600> either<00:01:30.050> fire

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
one uses a different element either fire

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.779 
one uses a different element either fire
earth<00:01:31.369> air<00:01:31.729> or<00:01:32.300> water<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:33.050> good<00:01:33.830> camera<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.520> not

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
earth air or water a good camera is not

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:43.880 
earth air or water a good camera is not
an<00:01:35.060> element<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:35.930> no<00:01:36.800> one<00:01:36.950> uses<00:01:37.340> one<00:01:37.759> of<00:01:37.850> those

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280 

the<00:01:44.670> weird<00:01:44.850> thing<00:01:44.910> for<00:01:45.300> me<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.020> mean

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the weird thing for me is that I mean

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380 
the weird thing for me is that I mean
this<00:01:46.620> is<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.830> 3d<00:01:47.280> fighter<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.910> fights<00:01:48.150> take

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
this is a 3d fighter the fights take

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.170 
this is a 3d fighter the fights take
place<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.900> these<00:01:49.050> open<00:01:49.470> arenas<00:01:49.980> but<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:50.880> don't

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
place in these open arenas but you don't

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.030 
place in these open arenas but you don't
really<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.660> control<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.440> camera

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
really have control of the camera

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.920 
really have control of the camera
in<00:01:53.190> fact<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> camera<00:01:53.820> doesn't<00:01:54.270> move<00:01:54.480> at<00:01:54.810> all

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
in fact the camera doesn't move at all

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.140 
in fact the camera doesn't move at all
it's<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.740> automatic<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.580> doesn't<00:01:56.910> follow

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
it's not automatic it doesn't follow

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.600 
it's not automatic it doesn't follow
your<00:01:57.450> opponent<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.560> only<00:01:58.800> way<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.980> focus<00:01:59.280> on

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
your opponent the only way to focus on

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.730 
your opponent the only way to focus on
your<00:01:59.730> target<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:00.720> do<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> manually<00:02:01.350> by

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
your target is to do it manually by

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
your target is to do it manually by
pushing<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.190> button<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.330> they<00:02:03.450> move

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
pushing a button and then they move

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.950 
pushing a button and then they move
again<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.460> into<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.760> clunky<00:02:06.600> rhythm

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
again so you get into this clunky rhythm

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.570 
again so you get into this clunky rhythm
that<00:02:07.170> again<00:02:07.620> feels<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.040> something<00:02:08.369> from<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
that again feels like something from the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.090 
that again feels like something from the
n64<00:02:09.390> era<00:02:09.630> constantly<00:02:10.410> positioning<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
n64 era constantly positioning the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.390 
n64 era constantly positioning the
camera<00:02:11.550> before<00:02:12.120> doing<00:02:12.510> anything<00:02:12.990> else<00:02:13.400> it's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
camera before doing anything else it's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.730 
camera before doing anything else it's
been<00:02:14.640> almost<00:02:14.790> 20<00:02:15.240> years<00:02:15.270> since<00:02:15.600> games<00:02:16.140> went<00:02:16.380> 3d

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
been almost 20 years since games went 3d

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.170 
been almost 20 years since games went 3d
being<00:02:17.220> able<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.490> see<00:02:17.790> these

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
being able to see these

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.270 
being able to see these
three-dimensional<00:02:19.050> worlds<00:02:19.470> should<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.130> be<00:02:20.250> a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
three-dimensional worlds should not be a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:28.630 
three-dimensional worlds should not be a
problem<00:02:20.730> anymore

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.030 

unfortunately<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.850> n64<00:02:30.540> feel<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.470> also<00:02:31.770> part

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
unfortunately that n64 feel is also part

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.710 
unfortunately that n64 feel is also part
of<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> charm<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.120> actually<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.510> really

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720
