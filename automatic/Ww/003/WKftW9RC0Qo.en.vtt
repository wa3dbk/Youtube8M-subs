you kill a storming it will give him a
second<00:03:17.910> about<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.390> increases<00:03:18.930> his<00:03:19.590> damage

taken<00:03:20.720> for<00:03:21.720> 20<00:03:22.049> seconds<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.370> can<00:03:23.670> just

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
taken for 20 seconds so you can just

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.849 
taken for 20 seconds so you can just
kill<00:03:24.180> them<00:03:24.359> as<00:03:24.570> they<00:03:24.720> appear<00:03:25.109> also<00:03:25.410> debuff

kill them as they appear also debuff
will<00:03:26.160> fall<00:03:26.400> off<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:26.940> it's<00:03:27.180> better<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.660> have<00:03:27.840> it

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
will fall off and it's better to have it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.470
