00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.250
 hello to you with a cover from the garage and 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.830
 today in this short video I 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:15.809
 I will explain everything here why this one here 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.670
 garbage works well and explain how she 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.670
 works 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.670
 go 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.369
 we will immediately begin to consider everything 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.730
 quick and short 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:38.510
 it's our throttle by the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.180
 ordinary throttle smd 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.830
 tuning us it turns out here such 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.660
 here's an extension draw a barrel im okay 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.620
 okay draw a throttle 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.920
 damper 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:59.540
 with our m2 tuning 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.239
 here she is with us already when the throttle 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.649
 the shutter is closed we don't care 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.690
 there is already more air flowing and when we 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.869
 slightly turn anymore 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.899
 the air comes in here 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:19.550
 here now if we even open well 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:25.250
 lets ten percent well it's 10 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:33.770
 percent then we like here we have 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:37.550
 it will go 10 liters of air per hour and here at 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.810
 we will go a little more by ten 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:47.259
 percent for 12 more well let them write 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.300
 eleven and a half liters per hour 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:55.069
 gasoline we spend the same 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:02:01.690
 therefore from this we understand that 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.690
 we have a mixture at low revs poorer and 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.899
 the fuel mixture burns better because of this 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.190
 with us 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:15.500
 and the coming is better we have more horse 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.970
 forces torque at low revs and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.550
 all that and that is remarkable what 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.620
 I heard immediately understood how it all 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.519
 works when they say that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.140
 no need to make settings nothing 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:37.980
 need not need to run in change cards and 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.299
 all that I realized that thanks to this one 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.500
 garbage we have a mixture of poorer and 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:50.220
 us dynamics is getting better but on 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.890
 high rpm when we have throttle 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:59.730
 the flap is already open here we draw and even 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:04.019
 songy tuning here we throttle 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.560
 valve is fully open we are 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:15.720
 air with enough and already we have nothing 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:18.989
 don't feel well , I don't know yet 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.980
 mixture for example of course i don't remember exact 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.579
 numbers well let's take for example 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.650
 normal mixture 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.829
 it's somewhere in the area letting the pancake be 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.730
 13 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:36.870
 and here we have a syngi tuning will be a mixture 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:46.349
 at low revs a little poorer 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:49.440
 let it be 12 12 and 5 and so on well and 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:55.109
 how do you know the poorer connection with the whole 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.989
 the poorer we shift ours the shorter the poorer 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:01.410
 From the place of mana, everything burns better with us 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.840
 happens better well because of this can 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.480
 appear detonation well at low 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.169
 revs it's okay she there and 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.319
 and almost never damn yes it 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:18.180
 generally cool topic you can do anything 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:20.810
 not afraid so well what else to say what else 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.810
 to tell 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:29.710
 so but in principle he explained what the whole 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.960
 this trick how it works so if 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.199
 there will be questions ask questions in 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:42.360
 comments I will gladly answer will remove 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:42.360
 second parts and so on well yes 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.710
 by the way to shooting this video me 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.450
 made a video of hair about his ore 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:56.000
 the second part is already out 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:58.070
 md tuning and he's still this one 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.530
 I didn't tell you all, but it seems to me that he 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:06.080
 that's it that's gonna push me in 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:09.200
 said that without remapping the cards we have on 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.780
 low revs the mixture is poorer from this 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.740
 we are coming better therefore 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.660
 with you was sneezing glad garage 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.020
 subscribe put huskies and wait 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.820
 new videos coming soon new video 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.820
 everything will be cool for now
