opening one when it starts off but then
it<00:00:46.739> slowly<00:00:46.980> picks<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.610> turns<00:00:47.760> into<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it slowly picks up and turns into a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.299 
it slowly picks up and turns into a
pretty<00:00:48.239> decent<00:00:48.450> song<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.559> ending<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> new

pretty decent song the ending the new
ending<00:00:50.700> way<00:00:51.270> better<00:00:51.600> than<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> last<00:00:51.960> ending

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
kind of felt as though reminiscent of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
kind of felt as though reminiscent of
opening<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> visuals<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.460> the

music goals it was really just very hype

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080 
music goals it was really just very hype
and<00:01:04.199> very<00:01:04.379> action-packed<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.489> both<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and very action-packed so both the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.730 
and very action-packed so both the
opening<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.600> ending<00:01:06.689> were<00:01:06.990> awesome<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
opening and ending were awesome the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.010 
opening and ending were awesome the
visuals<00:01:08.189> from<00:01:08.369> opening<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.570> were<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> lot

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
visuals from opening to were a lot

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260 
visuals from opening to were a lot
better<00:01:10.170> than<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.770> visuals<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:11.369> ending<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
better than the visuals from ending to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.420 
better than the visuals from ending to
however<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.200> music<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.680> ending<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.130> felt

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
however the music for ending to I felt

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.340 
however the music for ending to I felt
was<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> bit<00:01:14.939> more<00:01:15.060> stronger<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.140> came

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
was a bit more stronger because it came

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
was a bit more stronger because it came
more<00:01:16.619> action-packed<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.490> overall<00:01:17.909> just

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
more action-packed and overall just

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.899 
more action-packed and overall just
really<00:01:18.810> had<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.350> an<00:01:19.530> intense<00:01:19.890> ending<00:01:20.400> for

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
really had like an intense ending for

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
really had like an intense ending for
anything<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.509> definitely<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.229> both<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.500> them

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
anything so definitely like both of them

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.260 
anything so definitely like both of them
and<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:22.920> glad<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:23.909> wasn't<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and I'm glad that it really wasn't a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.690 
and I'm glad that it really wasn't a
step<00:01:24.780> down<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> mean<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> opening<00:01:26.100> music<00:01:26.520> wise

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
step down I mean the opening music wise

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.399 
step down I mean the opening music wise
is<00:01:27.000> slightly<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.450> step<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.229> just

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
is slightly a step down because it just

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.200 
is slightly a step down because it just
doesn't<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.950> same<00:01:29.159> intensity<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
doesn't have that same intensity and the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.569 
doesn't have that same intensity and the
same<00:01:30.420> rocket<00:01:30.869> fire<00:01:31.259> start<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.950> opening<00:01:32.369> one

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
same rocket fire start that opening one

really<00:02:20.140> boils<00:02:20.740> down<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.550> humanity

and I think we're gonna see more of that
definitely<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.690> we<00:05:09.870> also<00:05:10.020> get<00:05:10.260> more<00:05:10.440> hints<00:05:10.770> at

this whole religious aspect because

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.690 
this whole religious aspect because
early<00:05:12.990> on<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.410> was<00:05:13.560> foreshadowed<00:05:14.280> that

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
early on it was foreshadowed that

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.010

thoughts on the new opening and new
ending<00:06:58.199> do<00:06:58.320> you<00:06:58.410> think<00:06:58.620> the<00:06:58.710> new<00:06:58.860> opening

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.490 
ending do you think the new opening
surpassed<00:07:00.000> the<00:07:00.150> last<00:07:00.360> one<00:07:00.630> was<00:07:00.930> it<00:07:01.080> worse<00:07:01.259> than

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
surpassed the last one was it worse than

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.200 
surpassed the last one was it worse than
the<00:07:01.560> last<00:07:01.770> one<00:07:02.070> and<00:07:02.190> likewise<00:07:02.940> with<00:07:03.090> the

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
the last one and likewise with the

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.969 
the last one and likewise with the
ending<00:07:03.509> me<00:07:03.810> personally<00:07:04.289> I<00:07:04.320> think<00:07:04.380> the<00:07:04.620> ending

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
ending me personally I think the ending

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.800 
ending me personally I think the ending
was<00:07:05.370> a<00:07:05.400> step<00:07:05.699> up<00:07:05.850> with<00:07:06.210> this<00:07:06.389> particular

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
was a step up with this particular

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.900 
was a step up with this particular
ending<00:07:07.080> but<00:07:07.530> the<00:07:07.740> opening<00:07:08.070> wasn't<00:07:08.430> on<00:07:08.580> the

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
ending but the opening wasn't on the

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.330 
ending but the opening wasn't on the
same<00:07:09.090> level<00:07:09.360> as<00:07:09.479> the<00:07:09.600> last<00:07:09.810> one<00:07:10.020> as<00:07:10.110> far<00:07:10.259> as

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
same level as the last one as far as

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.770 
same level as the last one as far as
musically<00:07:11.340> but<00:07:11.610> visually<00:07:11.970> it<00:07:12.419> definitely

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
musically but visually it definitely

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.420 
musically but visually it definitely
topped<00:07:13.020> it<00:07:13.229> that's<00:07:13.530> my<00:07:13.680> thoughts<00:07:13.919> on<00:07:14.039> it<00:07:14.099> but

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
topped it that's my thoughts on it but

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.830 
topped it that's my thoughts on it but
that's<00:07:14.550> all<00:07:14.639> I<00:07:14.669> have<00:07:14.849> for<00:07:14.970> this<00:07:15.060> review<00:07:15.419> thanks
