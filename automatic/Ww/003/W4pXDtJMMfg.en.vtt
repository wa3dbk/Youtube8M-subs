proportion and scale and worked within

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.580 
proportion and scale and worked within
the<00:01:50.820> base<00:01:51.090> plate<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.600> had<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.960> work<00:01:52.560> with

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the base plate that we had to work with

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.520 
the base plate that we had to work with
so<00:01:53.430> those<00:01:53.939> pringles<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> plate<00:01:54.930> I'm<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
so those pringles on a plate I'm the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.749 
so those pringles on a plate I'm the
structural<00:01:55.890> engineer<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> project<00:01:56.369> so

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
structural engineer on the project so

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.550 
structural engineer on the project so
ultimately<00:01:57.000> my<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.810> role<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.290> make<00:01:58.530> sure

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
ultimately my my role is to make sure

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.679 
ultimately my my role is to make sure
the<00:01:58.770> project<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.219> safe<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.090> also<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the project is safe but we also have the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.690 
the project is safe but we also have the
opportunity<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.229> push<00:02:02.130> boundaries<00:02:02.490> in

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
opportunity to push boundaries in

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.830 
opportunity to push boundaries in
architecture<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.390> something<00:02:03.750> that's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
architecture and do something that's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.590 
architecture and do something that's
really<00:02:04.369> different<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.579> creative<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.210> think

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
really different and creative I think

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.910 
really different and creative I think
architecture<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.560> make<00:02:07.710> an<00:02:07.829> impact

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
architecture can really make an impact

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.979 
architecture can really make an impact
on<00:02:08.250> people's<00:02:08.580> lives<00:02:08.640> because<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.629> can<00:02:09.750> change

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
on people's lives because it can change

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.110 
on people's lives because it can change
the<00:02:10.259> way<00:02:10.379> they<00:02:10.530> feel<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:11.430> all<00:02:11.580> move<00:02:11.849> through<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the way they feel we all move through a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.400 
the way they feel we all move through a
busy<00:02:12.569> urban<00:02:12.599> environment

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
busy urban environment

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.620 
busy urban environment
and<00:02:13.710> we<00:02:13.830> look<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.250> moments<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.790> peace<00:02:15.120> moments

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
and we look for moments of peace moments

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.480 
and we look for moments of peace moments
of<00:02:15.690> contemplation<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.650> architecture<00:02:17.340> can

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
of contemplation and architecture can

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.070 
of contemplation and architecture can
create<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.180> people<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.630> their<00:02:18.780> everyday

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
create that for people in their everyday

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.830 
create that for people in their everyday
stressful<00:02:19.650> life<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:20.070> think<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:21.210> it's

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
stressful life I think it's it's

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.660 
stressful life I think it's it's
definitely<00:02:22.320> about<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.590> relaxation<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.490> mean

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
definitely about the relaxation I mean

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.030 
definitely about the relaxation I mean
to<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.030> able<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.390> within<00:02:24.570> 15<00:02:25.080> minutes<00:02:25.320> get<00:02:25.740> from

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
to be able to within 15 minutes get from

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.640 
to be able to within 15 minutes get from
your<00:02:26.250> door<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:27.090> being<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.140> beach<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.590> just

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
your door to being on the beach and just

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.690 
your door to being on the beach and just
having<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.430> moment<00:02:29.580> where<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:31.350> just<00:02:31.620> quiet<00:02:32.250> is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
having a moment where it's just quiet is

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.690 
having a moment where it's just quiet is
really<00:02:33.660> nice<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.470> mean<00:02:35.280> I've<00:02:35.550> always

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
really nice I mean I've always

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.510 
really nice I mean I've always
envisioned<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.750> be<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:38.130> kind<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
envisioned this to be that kind of

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.790 
envisioned this to be that kind of
retreat<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.410> something<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.620> really

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
retreat and something that you really

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.280 
retreat and something that you really
are<00:02:40.980> connecting<00:02:41.550> with<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.090> level<00:02:42.480> not<00:02:43.050> so

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
are connecting with on that level not so

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.350 
are connecting with on that level not so
much<00:02:43.440> something<00:02:43.860> that's<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.850> know<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> wild

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
much something that's you know the wild

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.810 
much something that's you know the wild
beach<00:02:45.540> party<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.130> think<00:02:47.340> everything's<00:02:47.640> got

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
beach party and I think everything's got

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.220 
beach party and I think everything's got
its<00:02:47.940> place<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.390> time<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.960> could<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.140> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
its place in time and that could be a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.140 
its place in time and that could be a
really<00:02:49.380> fun<00:02:49.500> fun<00:02:49.980> weekend<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.460> do<00:02:50.610> at<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:50.970> time

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
really fun fun weekend to do at one time

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.790 
really fun fun weekend to do at one time
but<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.540> wasn't<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.350> wasn't<00:02:52.410> what<00:02:52.710> was

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
but that wasn't that wasn't what was

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.410 
but that wasn't that wasn't what was
driving<00:02:53.130> me<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.310> create<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.970> was<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.330> was

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
driving me to create this it was it was

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.450 
driving me to create this it was it was
definitely<00:02:54.780> about<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:55.920> having<00:02:56.130> depth

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
definitely about like just having depth

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.460 
definitely about like just having depth
at<00:02:56.730> space<00:02:57.150> because<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.660> lost<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.110> when<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.230> moved

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
at space because I lost it when I moved

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.890 
at space because I lost it when I moved
to<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:58.920> want<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.610> beach<00:02:59.820> in<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> city<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.630> want
