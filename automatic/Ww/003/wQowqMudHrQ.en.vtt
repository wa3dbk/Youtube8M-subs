 project that aims to colonize the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.840
 planet until 2023 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.180

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.729
 red 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.530

 At lunch we want to understand a little. 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 this decision and only if 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.409

 all because the will to know mars 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.290
 and live there and stay there 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.020
 the only engineering bank and the dream of all 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 the engineer is to help develop the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.049
 society to humanity through 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.470
 tech ne 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.920
 passion for gastronomy by science 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.750
 space has always existed and one day I 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.570
 I was reading some reports on my 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.659
 mobile phone I saw that a Dutch company 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.119
 was recruiting people to colonize 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.850
 Mars to participate in a unique thing 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.540
 where no one else was I did not think two 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.100
 times 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.680
 I already sent a torpedo with my 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.479
 boyfriend, let 's go, let's both 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.360
 We signed up, we had no doubts. 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.829
 So but only you were initially 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.229
 select the phases yes he agreed 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.330
 anyway we both talked there 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.490
 people who sciences that 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 one could only be chosen then the 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.090
 people are supporting each other and it is clear 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.190
 that he will continue to sign up for it 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.400
 As an engineer he also has great 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.230
 chances of a dream of the two cool now 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.050
 It's like we said you got one 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.790
 mail on December 31st and which is the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.190
 content of that medium or what you 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.430
 You already know about this mission. 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.320
 very little they even comment that the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.810
 information for which we are 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.180
 Annoying will come one thing I know 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.340
 which as of Monday is likely to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.200
 which is personal from the medical part goes into 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.130
 contact to talk about exams 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.660
 physical and psychological , and that the training 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.110
 trainings will start from 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.750
 2015 and will extend until 2024, which is 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.360
 when they left the first one will leave the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.920
 first team on the outside this larger 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.810
 details we still do not have 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.600
 to receive the match spent the week clear 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.240
 that there is still a lot of time 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.540
 thing may change, but if this 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.400
 mission part if today you would already be 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.190
 ready already is one knowing that a trip 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.600
 without leaving your life is an opportunity 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.160
 I only understand that maybe for other 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.410
 people who have other priorities 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.440
 people who have children would be different 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.930
 I do not have is a dream is a 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.200
 single opportunity I would definitely go 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.019
 now what is the main thing in your 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.870
 evaluation is the main barrier to 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.019
 during this whole process of 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.640
 preparation is the question of the 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.100
 physical or psychological issues that 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.769
 pepe may weigh more in its assessment than 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.959
 I believe that in this first phase 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.420
 as long as you have the physical part 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.019
 speak up on this issue of yourself. 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.300
 expose risks to this kind of thing 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.730
 the psychological part will be from the 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.370
 when you already have isolated him there 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.470
 It's going to be the hardest part, right? 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.750
 away from everything and everyone you love 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.310
 here but at first here during the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.530
 training believe will weigh more 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.459
 psychological physicist will pick up when 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.620
 have more back 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.690
 It is true and the support of the family you 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.060
 said that the issue in your boyfriend is 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.010
 supporting but her family father mother 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.790
 siblings, how's all this coming? 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.530
 movement 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.270
 I'm not aware you can not 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.360
 back more look they are all me 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.190
 supporting my mother very well that I 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.010
 kill for sure, right? 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.070
 but it's not but she wants me to be 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.840
 happy and my dad said he wants together 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.150
 It's cool because my whole family 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.900
 You're giving me a lot of support in your family. 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.370
 as friends you are not being well there either 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.760
 encouraging a lot 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.280
 It's news that does not 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.420
 only joinville state but the country of 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.550
 a general form 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.280
 now is the question what's next 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.210
 step is what is the next action by 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.350
 from Priscilla 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.210
 in this preparation there and there 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.600
 this phase now while I wait for 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.970
 new instructions what do i need to do 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.070
 is to divulge a lot after all is 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.500
 a private initiative that is seeking 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.630
 investors sponsors so that 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.420
 but I can order my friends and 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.940
 family members is to help spread the word 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.910
 bring information to everyone because 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.790
 We even need donations to 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.560
 to be able to afford that to the project 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.500
 still being built we know 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.450
 which has a hand method a preparation of the 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.620
 themselves and the mission itself. 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.260
 and if you need 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.970
 Thank you for your participation, the people 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.930
 hope that your dream is 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.180
 accomplished 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.030
 We'll be clear to tell you 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.260
 story and you're going into history in 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.970
 Brazil and also in the world 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.970
 Thank you, thank you, and good afternoon, good afternoon.
