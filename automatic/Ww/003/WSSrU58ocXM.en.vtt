little<00:01:44.909> bit<00:01:45.030> more<00:01:45.210> comfortable<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.020> has<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
little bit more comfortable and has a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.190 
little bit more comfortable and has a
little<00:01:46.829> bit<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.579> tactile<00:01:48.030> feel<00:01:48.540> now

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
little bit of a more tactile feel now

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.100 
little bit of a more tactile feel now
the<00:01:49.259> added<00:01:49.799> thickness<00:01:50.340> isn't<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> much<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the added thickness isn't that much the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.810 
the added thickness isn't that much the
ipod<00:01:52.380> touch<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.460> bit<00:01:53.579> thinner

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
ipod touch is just a little bit thinner

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.609 
ipod touch is just a little bit thinner
than<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.600> here<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> case<00:01:55.320> on

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
than what you see here with the case on

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.679 
than what you see here with the case on
but<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.369> does<00:01:56.640> make<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> pretty<00:01:57.509> large

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
but it does make a pretty large

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.450 
but it does make a pretty large
difference<00:01:58.229> when<00:01:58.409> playing<00:01:58.680> games<00:01:59.070> because

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
difference when playing games because

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
difference when playing games because
when<00:01:59.909> playing<00:02:00.210> games<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.170> turned<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
when playing games and it's turned to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.679 
when playing games and it's turned to
its<00:02:01.710> side<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.670> does<00:02:02.939> feel<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.240> nice

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
its side it does feel really nice

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.289 
its side it does feel really nice
overall<00:02:04.200> playing<00:02:04.770> games<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:06.060> something

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
overall playing games and it's something

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.930 
overall playing games and it's something
that<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:06.990> enjoy<00:02:07.530> about<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:08.039> case<00:02:08.369> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
that I really enjoy about this case so

for all this is a really nice case
overall<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.770> let's<00:02:17.010> get<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.430> ports<00:02:17.970> now

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
overall so let's get to the ports now

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.270 
overall so let's get to the ports now
you<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.690> have<00:02:18.870> your<00:02:18.930> headphone<00:02:19.470> jack<00:02:19.770> port<00:02:20.099> you

do have your lightning port ports or

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.550 
do have your lightning port ports or
your<00:02:23.010> lightning<00:02:23.190> poor<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:24.630> know<00:02:24.780> space<00:02:25.290> for

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
your lightning poor you know space for

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.500 
your lightning poor you know space for
the<00:02:25.650> ports<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.130> then<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.730> your<00:02:26.760> speaker

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the ports and then you have your speaker

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.710 
the ports and then you have your speaker
port<00:02:27.780> right<00:02:27.989> here<00:02:28.130> with<00:02:29.130> added<00:02:29.819> space<00:02:30.390> for

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
port right here with added space for

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.930 
port right here with added space for
that<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.560> also<00:02:31.769> have<00:02:31.920> your<00:02:32.280> loop<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:32.790> if

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
that and you also have your loop so if

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.000 
that and you also have your loop so if
you<00:02:33.060> use<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.300> which<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.930> never<00:02:34.319> use<00:02:34.590> my<00:02:34.800> loop

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
you use that which I never use my loop

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.009 
you use that which I never use my loop
in<00:02:35.160> fact<00:02:35.400> I've<00:02:35.640> never<00:02:36.150> used<00:02:36.360> my<00:02:36.480> loop<00:02:36.780> ever

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
in fact I've never used my loop ever

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.720 
in fact I've never used my loop ever
since<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.470> took<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.769> out<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.980> box<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.430> did<00:02:38.580> my

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
since I took it out the box and did my

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.790 
since I took it out the box and did my
little<00:02:38.940> demo<00:02:39.269> with<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.690> but<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.380> use<00:02:40.410> it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
little demo with it but if you use it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.320 
little demo with it but if you use it
you'll<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.160> happy<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.640> know<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.910> there's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.559 
you'll be happy to know that there's
actually<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> space<00:02:43.380> for<00:02:43.680> its<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.849> yeah<00:02:45.180> not<00:02:45.540> a

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
actually a space for its so yeah not a

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.180 
actually a space for its so yeah not a
big<00:02:45.720> deal<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.900> me<00:02:46.049> but<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.410> course<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.890> might<00:02:47.010> be

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
big deal to me but of course it might be

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.860 
big deal to me but of course it might be
too<00:02:47.430> little<00:02:47.760> kids<00:02:48.120> or<00:02:48.269> something<00:02:48.299> that<00:02:48.750> had

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
too little kids or something that had

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.229 
too little kids or something that had
this<00:02:48.989> device<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.580> course<00:02:50.610> most

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
this device and of course most

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.059 
this device and of course most
importantly<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:52.230> do<00:02:52.410> have<00:02:52.590> your<00:02:52.620> camera

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
importantly you do have your camera

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.699 
importantly you do have your camera
cutouts<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.959> your<00:02:54.989> camera<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.590> your

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
cutouts so you have your camera on your

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.590 
cutouts so you have your camera on your
Flash<00:02:56.040> here<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.670> flash<00:02:56.910> doesn't<00:02:57.209> flood

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
Flash here and the flash doesn't flood

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.229 
Flash here and the flash doesn't flood
the<00:02:57.750> picture<00:02:58.170> because<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.799> space<00:02:59.239> have

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
the picture because of the space have

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.420 
the picture because of the space have
had<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.900> within<00:03:01.140> because<00:03:01.590> sometimes<00:03:02.160> if<00:03:02.310> you

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
had it within because sometimes if you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.520 
had it within because sometimes if you
have<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> case<00:03:03.090> that's<00:03:03.569> really<00:03:03.989> tight<00:03:04.290> around

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
have a case that's really tight around

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.800 
have a case that's really tight around
the<00:03:04.830> camera<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.430> flash<00:03:05.730> will<00:03:05.970> over<00:03:06.390> expose

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
the camera the flash will over expose

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.199 
the camera the flash will over expose
the<00:03:07.019> image<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:08.190> had<00:03:08.340> no<00:03:08.519> problems<00:03:09.030> with

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
the image and I had no problems with

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.050 
the image and I had no problems with
that<00:03:09.269> at<00:03:09.569> all<00:03:09.599> so<00:03:10.560> overall<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.610> one<00:03:12.030> of

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
that at all so overall this is one of

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.970 
that at all so overall this is one of
the<00:03:12.239> best<00:03:12.480> cases<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.049> can<00:03:13.080> get<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.620> it's<00:03:13.709> only

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
the best cases you can get and it's only

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.610 
the best cases you can get and it's only
for<00:03:14.160> eight<00:03:14.519> dollars<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:15.299> highly<00:03:15.989> recommend<00:03:16.110> it

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
for eight dollars I highly recommend it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.729 
for eight dollars I highly recommend it
it<00:03:17.430> comes<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:17.910> four<00:03:18.150> colors<00:03:18.180> black<00:03:19.079> blue<00:03:19.560> red
