00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.780 

and<00:01:49.990> that's<00:01:50.170> how<00:01:50.320> it's<00:01:50.500> done<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:50.980> will

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
and that's how it's done and that will

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
keep on going all the way down that been

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.280 
keep on going all the way down that been
100<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.010> something<00:01:54.190> feet<00:01:54.690> top<00:01:55.690> goes<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.170> the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
100 and something feet top goes to the

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.890 
100 and something feet top goes to the
back<00:01:56.470> middle<00:01:56.950> goes<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.580> back<00:01:57.900> castings

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
back middle goes to the back castings

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.240 
back middle goes to the back castings
gets<00:01:59.110> shoveled<00:01:59.410> out<00:01:59.470> from<00:01:59.740> underneath<00:01:59.980> and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
gets shoveled out from underneath and

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.800 
gets shoveled out from underneath and
that's<00:02:00.520> how<00:02:00.700> we<00:02:00.760> harvest<00:02:01.150> our<00:02:01.270> castings<00:02:01.720> the
