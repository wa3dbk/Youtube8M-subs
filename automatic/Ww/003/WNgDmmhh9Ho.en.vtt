00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.400

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.769
 I have a video that is a sponge cake 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.059
 made in coronda I hope you like it is 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.830
 very easy to do 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.080
 You can have the ingredients in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.029
 house you do not need to buy anything exaggerated 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.010
 and if you have nothing you sure you 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.570
 it will cost very very economically I hope that you 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.250

 growing I send you a month and Ghent we

 we see until the next 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.329
 dance with guys for this video 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.600
 to need 3 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.500
 olive or sunflower 4 tablespoons flour 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.500
 of wheat 4 4 tablespoons of milk 3 of 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.040
 sugar 3 tablespoons of cola cao a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.440
 small spoon of 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.090
 baking powder or yeast and 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.890
 we will need an egg and a mold of 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.200
 plastic or if you can do it in a 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.840
 cup as you want let's start with 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.100
 the video in any bowl we are going to 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.100
 throw what is the egg 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.790
 what we are going to do is tell you a little 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.260
 after I disintegrated the following 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.260
 that we are going to throw away will be the sugar 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.110
 and now let's pour the milk 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.010
 and we are going to give the following the oil 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.729
 for dry ingredients like 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.009
 flour cocoa powder or chocolate 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.229
 and the leaven we are going to throw from the 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.780
 next way I first I 'm going to 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.299
 start throwing what is the tail cao and 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.320
 for that I'm going to do it little by little 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.320
 scoop driven 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.709
 now let's take what flour is 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.330
 and they would do it if we throw it little by little 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.340
 because remember that the flour yes that 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.319
 does a little ball so that's how the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.030
 we will spoon in teaspoon and 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.280
 we will move until we see that there is no 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.300
 nothing white we return we throw another and so 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.300
 until the flour is finished 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.890
 well we have everything that these 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.840
 ingredients together and it 's all 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.870
 fully integrated for the following 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.540
 what we are going to do is take our 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.700
 mix here in this bowl that I already have 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.930
 prepared I the truth is not 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.000
 really that nothing because these 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.709
 little bottles do not stick and they go very well 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.300
 so I recommend that you compress 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.540
 disposable and I usually use only one 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.540
 time 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.850
 you're going to put it in the microwave for about 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.150
 5 minutes until you see that it is already 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.160
 MÃ©tele a stick and if not leave until it 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.990
 because it is already taught in many videos 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.520
 so let's wait for the five 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.940
 little minutes and let's see how we 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.940
 remains 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.330
 well, we have 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.300
 the mini dessert or bizcochito outside the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.710
 microwave and we're just going to delay the 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.690
 wait for it to cool to be able 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.120
 decorate but need to decorate 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.940
 I'm going to use orange 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.550
 coffees and greens and let's give a little bit of 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.709
 icing sugar to put on top and that 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.730
 see prettier good first thing 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.640
 let's do is speculate a bit 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.910
 our biscuits so you have a 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.350
 good presence if you want to give it away or 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.820
 to celebrate any day because it serves 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.620
 for any day and it's very easy to 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.800
 do so let's see what we are going to 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.800
 do 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.430
 Rule 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.120
 with a lacasitos so I kill more 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.130
 like with here more you get attention 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.050
 I've done it that way just to decorate a 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.560
 too little because sometimes I 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.030
 they love 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.280
 You can also leave the embedded ones 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.530
 inside the cake that is super 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.630
 I 'm rich because I 'll throw it away sugar 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.440
 glas made of chocolate made only by 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.870
 over 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.669
 it is correct imagination is that you stay 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.650
 something nice a nice presentation for 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.800

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.449

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.000
 the lacasitos it is very easy to do so 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.360
