00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
nice

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.420 
nice
party<00:02:24.660> time<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.620> that's<00:02:25.950> few<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.310> far

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
party time and that's few and far

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.490 
party time and that's few and far
between<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.090> I'm<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:27.330> okay<00:02:27.540> tall<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:28.230> very

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
between and I'm like okay tall with very

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.840 
between and I'm like okay tall with very
good<00:02:28.620> ways<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.130> can<00:02:29.370> pull<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.550> off

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
good ways I can pull that off

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.220 
good ways I can pull that off
so<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.120> basically<00:02:30.450> picked<00:02:30.930> something<00:02:31.110> that

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
so I basically picked something that

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.320 
so I basically picked something that
would<00:02:31.380> be<00:02:31.470> difficult<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.890> make<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:33.120> I

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
would be difficult to make and that I

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.720 
would be difficult to make and that I
thought<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.630> could<00:02:33.690> pull<00:02:33.959> off<00:02:34.130> very<00:02:35.130> nice<00:02:35.370> so

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
thought I could pull off very nice so

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.850 
thought I could pull off very nice so
looking<00:02:36.450> at<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:37.080> then<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.440> guess<00:02:37.650> what

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
looking at that that then I guess what

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.080
