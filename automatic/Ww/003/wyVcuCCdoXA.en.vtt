grindr<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.270> start<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.570> off<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.250> try<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.399> fix

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
grindr to start this off and try and fix

grindr to start this off and try and fix
this<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.090> bit<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:46.010> think<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this up a bit more I think I have a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.479 
this up a bit more I think I have a
pickaxe<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.420> merge<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.649> since

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
pickaxe to merge that one with since

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
pickaxe to merge that one with since
it's<00:00:50.820> probably<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.570> best<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.989> needs<00:00:52.140> I'm

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
it's probably not the best it needs I'm

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.860 
it's probably not the best it needs I'm
breaking<00:00:52.710> three<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.719> currently<00:00:54.719> got

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
breaking three on it currently got

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.729 
breaking three on it currently got
efficiency<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.739> 14<00:00:56.460> 3<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.590> actually<00:00:58.590> let

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
efficiency for 14 3 on it actually let

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.869 
efficiency for 14 3 on it actually let
me<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.829> oh<00:00:59.719> there<00:01:00.719> goes<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> lag<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.469> uh

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
me just oh there goes the lag and uh

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
me just oh there goes the lag and uh
yeah<00:01:02.879> fortune<00:01:03.390> three<00:01:03.989> efficiency<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.979> I

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
yeah fortune three efficiency for so I

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
yeah fortune three efficiency for so I
want<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.570> breaking

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
want to see if I can get on breaking

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.429 
want to see if I can get on breaking
that<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.409> think<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.130> end<00:01:08.310> chess<00:01:08.640> I

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
that on that I think in my end chess I

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.609 
that on that I think in my end chess I
actually<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.689> unbreaking<00:01:12.689> 31<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.500> maybe

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
actually have a unbreaking 31 and maybe

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
actually have a unbreaking 31 and maybe
something<00:01:13.890> else<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:15.119> someone

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
something else on there I know someone

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.539 
something else on there I know someone
round<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.140> has<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.530> ender<00:01:16.770> chest<00:01:16.799> maybe<00:01:17.369> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
round here has an ender chest maybe it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.030 
round here has an ender chest maybe it's
actually<00:01:17.880> me<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.530> don't<00:01:19.530> know<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.710> I've<00:01:19.830> gotta

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
that but i find them pretty efficient so

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.830 
that but i find them pretty efficient so

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
that follows it and there was actually

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.760 
that follows it and there was actually
two<00:04:27.460> bad<00:04:27.790> things<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.150> happen<00:04:28.510> I<00:04:28.770> actually

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
of it actually like flew down there by

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.570 
of it actually like flew down there by
the<00:04:44.020> time<00:04:44.139> I<00:04:44.260> got<00:04:44.380> back<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.710> like<00:04:45.010> disappeared

the time I got back it like disappeared
into<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.820> void<00:04:46.060> never<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.690> be<00:04:46.720> seen<00:04:46.930> again<00:04:46.990> so

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
into the void never to be seen again so

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.610 
into the void never to be seen again so
what's<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.310> helmet<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.910> boots<00:04:49.620> didn't

actually<00:04:54.820> merge<00:04:55.150> these<00:04:55.389> two<00:04:55.450> together

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
actually merge these two together

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.020 
actually merge these two together
apparently<00:04:56.169> not<00:04:57.010> sure<00:04:57.190> why<00:04:57.400> but<00:04:57.640> I'm<00:04:57.820> just

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030

apparently not sure why but I'm just
going<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.210> go<00:04:58.270> with<00:04:58.600> using<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.080> I'm<00:04:59.200> breaking

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
going to go with using the I'm breaking

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.860 
going to go with using the I'm breaking
through<00:04:59.710> efficiency<00:05:00.280> for<00:05:00.460> over<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.360> 14-3

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
through efficiency for over the 14-3

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.719 
through efficiency for over the 14-3
efficiency<00:05:02.530> for<00:05:02.710> one<00:05:02.940> so<00:05:03.940> yeah<00:05:05.190> you<00:05:06.190> saw<00:05:06.370> four

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
efficiency for one so yeah you saw four

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.640 
efficiency for one so yeah you saw four
or<00:05:06.850> five<00:05:07.030> diamonds<00:05:07.330> just<00:05:07.750> repairing<00:05:08.140> that<00:05:08.440> one

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
or five diamonds just repairing that one

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.850 
or five diamonds just repairing that one

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
two big waste anyway alright so i have

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.180 
two big waste anyway alright so i have
finished<00:05:15.160> inside<00:05:15.729> revamp<00:05:16.270> this<00:05:16.419> a<00:05:16.479> bit<00:05:16.780> Oh

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
finished inside revamp this a bit Oh

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.620 
finished inside revamp this a bit Oh
flying<00:05:18.190> dirt<00:05:18.669> which<00:05:18.910> I<00:05:19.000> don't<00:05:19.060> believe<00:05:19.390> was

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
flying dirt which I don't believe was

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.170 
flying dirt which I don't believe was
there<00:05:19.870> before<00:05:20.370> so<00:05:21.370> this<00:05:21.640> is<00:05:21.760> what<00:05:21.940> it<00:05:22.030> looks

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
there before so this is what it looks

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.940 
there before so this is what it looks
like<00:05:22.360> right<00:05:22.630> now<00:05:23.260> I<00:05:23.289> think<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.710> needs<00:05:23.740> more

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
like right now I think it needs more

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.290 
like right now I think it needs more
lighting<00:05:24.310> in<00:05:24.550> here<00:05:25.560> yeah<00:05:26.560> I'm<00:05:27.460> fairly<00:05:28.180> happy

lighting in here yeah I'm fairly happy
with<00:05:28.510> this<00:05:29.070> probably<00:05:30.070> going<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.250> add<00:05:30.370> some

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
with this probably going to add some

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.909 
with this probably going to add some
glow<00:05:30.970> stone<00:05:31.270> here<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:32.200> give<00:05:32.350> us<00:05:32.380> more<00:05:32.650> light

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
glow stone here to give us more light

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.050 
glow stone here to give us more light
anvil<00:05:33.850> in<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.000> center<00:05:34.450> I<00:05:35.440> have<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.220> do<00:05:36.340> these<00:05:36.640> I

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
anvil in the center I have to do these I

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.930 
anvil in the center I have to do these I
don't<00:05:37.660> know<00:05:37.780> if<00:05:37.870> I'll<00:05:37.990> do<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.590> steps<00:05:38.860> up<00:05:39.100> it's

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
don't know if I'll do the steps up it's

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.730 
don't know if I'll do the steps up it's
hard<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.210> explain<00:05:40.330> but<00:05:40.840> they<00:05:41.110> don't<00:05:41.440> really

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
hard to explain but they don't really

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.610 
hard to explain but they don't really
work<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.820> have<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.720> think<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:44.050> some<00:05:44.200> other<00:05:44.289> sort

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
work I have to think of some other sort

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.659 
work I have to think of some other sort
of<00:05:44.680> design<00:05:45.010> but<00:05:45.570> say<00:05:46.570> uh<00:05:46.600> or<00:05:47.530> on<00:05:47.680> this<00:05:47.979> it<00:05:48.490> you

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
of design but say uh or on this it you

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.570 
of design but say uh or on this it you
just<00:05:48.910> can't<00:05:49.180> walk<00:05:49.300> up<00:05:49.479> here<00:05:50.070> so<00:05:51.070> i<00:05:51.130> have<00:05:51.430> to

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
just can't walk up here so i have to

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.820 
just can't walk up here so i have to
redo<00:05:52.270> that<00:05:52.450> to<00:05:52.780> work<00:05:52.990> if<00:05:53.260> i<00:05:53.350> want<00:05:53.530> it<00:05:53.620> to<00:05:53.650> have

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
redo that to work if i want it to have

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.760 
redo that to work if i want it to have
like<00:05:54.039> that<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:54.570> move<00:05:55.570> that<00:05:55.780> up<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:56.110> bit<00:05:56.139> I<00:05:56.440> place

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
like that and move that up a bit I place

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.210 
like that and move that up a bit I place
out<00:05:57.010> one<00:05:57.370> to<00:05:57.789> load<00:05:58.060> which<00:05:58.419> sucks<00:05:58.780> ah<00:05:59.110> but<00:06:00.100> yeah

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
out one to load which sucks ah but yeah
