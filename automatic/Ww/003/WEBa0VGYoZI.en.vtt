what<00:02:45.010> happens<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.640> get<00:02:45.760> carbon<00:02:46.090> built<00:02:46.450> up

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
what happens is you get carbon built up

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.630 
what happens is you get carbon built up
in<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.990> gap<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.530> degrades<00:02:48.490> the
