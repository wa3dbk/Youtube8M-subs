00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.609 
was just the way that it was wrapped um
and<00:01:46.460> there<00:01:46.880> was<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.149> wasn't<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:47.689> sent<00:01:48.350> in<00:01:48.530> a

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
and there was it wasn't like sent in a

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.120 
and there was it wasn't like sent in a
box<00:01:48.860> within<00:01:49.250> this<00:01:49.520> plastic<00:01:50.380> bag<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.979> know

decided to just try out the style up for
something<00:02:50.420> um<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:52.190> was<00:02:52.489> very<00:02:52.880> similar

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
something um that was very similar

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
and for a fraction of the price I think

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.949
