it's pretty famous plugin and with this
plugin<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.340> can<00:00:17.369> turn<00:00:17.670> your<00:00:17.820> server<00:00:18.090> into<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
plugin you can turn your server into a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.679 
plugin you can turn your server into a
server<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.740> allows<00:00:20.400> people<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.880> fly<00:00:21.240> planes

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
server that allows people to fly planes

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.240 
server that allows people to fly planes
everywhere<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.439> players<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.980> create

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
everywhere so players can just create

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.700 
everywhere so players can just create
planes<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.570> fly<00:00:24.810> them<00:00:25.080> however<00:00:25.350> they

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
planes and just fly them however they

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160 
planes and just fly them however they
want<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.670> buy<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> planes<00:00:27.539> they<00:00:27.990> can

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
want to they can buy the planes they can

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.810 
want to they can buy the planes they can
upgrade<00:00:28.410> their<00:00:28.769> planes<00:00:29.010> it'll<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.730> make

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
upgrade their planes it'll just make

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.189 
upgrade their planes it'll just make
your<00:00:29.939> server<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.240> lot<00:00:30.449> different<00:00:30.900> from<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
your server a lot different from the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.900 
your server a lot different from the
usual<00:00:31.320> servers<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.340> there's<00:00:32.520> two<00:00:32.669> type<00:00:32.880> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
usual servers so there's two type of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.510 
usual servers so there's two type of
planes<00:00:33.329> ones<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.649> plane<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.280> then<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
planes ones just a plane and then the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.280 
planes ones just a plane and then the
other<00:00:35.640> ones<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.239> hover<00:00:36.510> plane<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.200> gonna

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
other ones just a hover plane so gonna

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.630 
other ones just a hover plane so gonna
be<00:00:37.380> showing<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> guys<00:00:37.770> how<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.010> first<00:00:38.370> create

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
be showing you guys how to first create
the<00:00:38.879> plane<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> hover<00:00:40.110> plane<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
create a plane or for your players a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.779 
create a plane or for your players a
plane<00:00:46.410> they're<00:00:46.890> gonna<00:00:47.010> need<00:00:47.219> these<00:00:47.370> four

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
plane they're gonna need these four

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.330 
plane they're gonna need these four
things<00:00:48.120> they're<00:00:48.840> gonna<00:00:48.930> need<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.110> minecart<00:00:49.680> two

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
things they're gonna need a minecart two

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.790 
things they're gonna need a minecart two
redstone<00:00:50.640> two<00:00:51.629> wooden<00:00:51.899> pressure<00:00:52.110> plates<00:00:52.500> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
redstone two wooden pressure plates and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.439 
redstone two wooden pressure plates and
then<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.309> lever<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.940> better<00:00:54.149> than<00:00:54.270> crafting

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
then one lever so better than crafting

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.930 
then one lever so better than crafting
table<00:00:54.960> placed<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.100> flying<00:00:56.610> car<00:00:56.820> right

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
table placed on your flying car right

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.180 
table placed on your flying car right
there<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> middle<00:00:57.660> okay<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.890> two

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
there in the middle okay and then two

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.029 
there in the middle okay and then two
redstone<00:00:59.510> two<00:01:00.510> pressure<00:01:00.750> plates<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.410> then

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
redstone two pressure plates and then

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
redstone two pressure plates and then
that<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.430> lever<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:02.879> top<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.379> now

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that one lever up top so there we go now

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.190 
that one lever up top so there we go now
we<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> plane<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.689> our<00:01:06.869> plane<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
we have a plane so that is our plane and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.960 
we have a plane so that is our plane and
we<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.979> right-click<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.640> place<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
we can just right-click it and place it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.080 
we can just right-click it and place it
on<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> ground<00:01:09.510> hop<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.939> can

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
on the ground hop in and then you can

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.990 
on the ground hop in and then you can
mess<00:01:12.270> around<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> WASD<00:01:12.950> Keys<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
mess around with the WASD Keys and you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
mess around with the WASD Keys and you
can<00:01:15.150> basically<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.840> learn<00:01:16.470> how<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.650> fly<00:01:16.979> so

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
can basically just learn how to fly so

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.359 
can basically just learn how to fly so
it<00:01:17.640> works<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.240> W<00:01:18.600> key<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.049> forward<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> D

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it works like the W key is forward the D

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.090 
it works like the W key is forward the D
keys<00:01:20.610> backwards<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.780> left<00:01:22.020> key<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
keys backwards the left key is up and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.890 
keys backwards the left key is up and
then<00:01:23.340> yeah<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> pretty<00:01:24.420> much<00:01:24.509> look

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
then yeah and then you pretty much look

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.420 
then yeah and then you pretty much look
to<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.470> whatever<00:01:25.650> direction<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.159> want<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> go

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to go whatever direction you want to go

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.550 
to go whatever direction you want to go
in<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.420> how<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.630> works<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
in so that's how that works and if you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.340 
in so that's how that works and if you
want<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.340> shift<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:31.110> just

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
want to get out you just shift you just

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.780 
want to get out you just shift you just
be<00:01:31.500> careful<00:01:31.860> where<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.040> get<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.400> make<00:01:32.759> sure

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
be careful where you get out make sure

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.539 
be careful where you get out make sure
you<00:01:33.000> land<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.369> just

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you land not like that but you know just

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.280 
you land not like that but you know just
make<00:01:35.790> sure<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> safe<00:01:36.509> landing<00:01:36.720> okay

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
make sure you have a safe landing okay

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.810 
make sure you have a safe landing okay
now<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.829> hover<00:01:38.040> plane<00:01:38.400> you're<00:01:38.729> gonna

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
now so for the hover plane you're gonna

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.219 
now so for the hover plane you're gonna
need<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.360> four<00:01:39.720> things<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.079> have

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
need all the four things that we have

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
need all the four things that we have
from<00:01:40.409> before<00:01:40.670> except<00:01:41.670> you're<00:01:41.759> gonna<00:01:41.880> need<00:01:42.119> an

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
from before except you're gonna need an

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.749 
from before except you're gonna need an
additional<00:01:42.659> redstone<00:01:43.439> torch<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.490> one

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
additional redstone torch so just one

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.580 
additional redstone torch so just one
yeah<00:01:45.119> basically<00:01:45.420> everything<00:01:45.930> goes<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
yeah basically everything goes in at the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.639 
yeah basically everything goes in at the
same<00:01:46.799> place<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.600> two<00:01:48.810> redstone<00:01:49.049> two

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
same place and the two redstone two

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.460 
same place and the two redstone two
pressure<00:01:50.040> plates<00:01:50.369> two<00:01:50.610> lever<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
pressure plates two lever and then the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.160 
pressure plates two lever and then the
redstone<00:01:52.950> torch<00:01:53.130> goes<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> bottom<00:01:54.360> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
redstone torch goes on the bottom so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.139 
redstone torch goes on the bottom so
there<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> hover<00:01:56.189> plane<00:01:56.579> so

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
there we go now we have a hover plane so

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.060 
there we go now we have a hover plane so
you<00:01:57.240> guys<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.509> actually<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.530> stats<00:01:58.799> for

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
you guys can actually see the stats for

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.780 
you guys can actually see the stats for
right<00:01:59.340> there

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
right there

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
right there
I'd<00:01:59.969> even<00:02:00.149> notice<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.630> until<00:02:00.810> now<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.409> just

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
I'd even notice that until now I just

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.620 
I'd even notice that until now I just
right-click<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> place<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> ground<00:02:03.360> hop

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
right-click the place on the ground hop

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.660 
right-click the place on the ground hop
in<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.799> there<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.040> go<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.399> basically

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
in and then there we go so basically

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.580 
in and then there we go so basically
just<00:02:05.790> hovers<00:02:06.329> around<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:07.140> me<00:02:07.259> there's<00:02:07.469> not

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
just hovers around to me there's not

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.410 
just hovers around to me there's not
much<00:02:07.829> difference<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.399> those<00:02:08.610> two<00:02:08.670> planes<00:02:09.090> but

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
much difference in those two planes but

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
much difference in those two planes but
for<00:02:09.660> some<00:02:09.840> people<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.379> they<00:02:10.560> learn

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
for some people if they learn

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.830 
for some people if they learn
and<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.790> they<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.120> actually<00:02:12.300> see<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and like they can actually see the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.600 
and like they can actually see the
difference<00:02:13.230> between<00:02:13.410> those<00:02:13.710> two<00:02:13.770> alright

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
difference between those two alright

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.920 
difference between those two alright
guys<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.970> here<00:02:15.150> are<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> items<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.840> are

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
guys and here are the items that are

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.320 
guys and here are the items that are
capable<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.440> upgrading<00:02:17.070> your<00:02:17.250> plane<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.210> if

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
capable of upgrading your plane so if

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.850 
capable of upgrading your plane so if
you<00:02:18.420> guys<00:02:18.540> want<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.840> create<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.230> shop<00:02:19.560> in

explain<00:02:30.870> what<00:02:31.080> they<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> hard<00:02:32.130> block

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
explain what they do so the hard block

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.370 
explain what they do so the hard block
will<00:02:32.550> give<00:02:32.670> your<00:02:32.790> minecart<00:02:33.360> an<00:02:33.540> extra<00:02:34.020> nine

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
will give your minecart an extra nine

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.590 
will give your minecart an extra nine
plus<00:02:34.890> health<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.670> iron<00:02:36.000> ingot<00:02:36.360> will<00:02:36.480> give

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
plus health the iron ingot will give

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.560 
plus health the iron ingot will give
your<00:02:36.780> my<00:02:37.170> card<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.620> extra<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:38.730> plus<00:02:39.330> health

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
your my card and extra one plus health

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.120 
your my card and extra one plus health
so<00:02:39.870> not<00:02:40.080> much<00:02:40.260> kind<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.710> makes<00:02:40.860> sense<00:02:40.890> because

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
so not much kind of makes sense because

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.430 
so not much kind of makes sense because
the<00:02:41.310> ironing<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:42.060> less<00:02:42.570> than<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.900> iron<00:02:43.050> block

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
the ironing is less than the iron block

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.770 
the ironing is less than the iron block
the<00:02:44.040> redstone<00:02:44.460> block<00:02:44.700> will<00:02:45.000> give<00:02:45.180> your<00:02:45.450> plane

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the redstone block will give your plane

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.040 
the redstone block will give your plane
a<00:02:46.050> nine<00:02:46.620> point<00:02:47.130> speed<00:02:47.640> boost<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.150> then<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
a nine point speed boost and then the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.110 
a nine point speed boost and then the
redstone<00:02:49.440> will<00:02:49.560> give<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.130> one<00:02:50.520> point<00:02:50.790> speed

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
redstone will give you a one point speed

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.550 
redstone will give you a one point speed
boost<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.840> they<00:02:51.930> actually<00:02:52.200> want<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.410> upgrade

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
boost so they actually want to upgrade

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.190 
boost so they actually want to upgrade
your<00:02:52.770> plane<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.130> go<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.340> an<00:02:53.520> anvil<00:02:53.960> place<00:02:54.960> your

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
your plane you go to an anvil place your

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.560 
your plane you go to an anvil place your
plane<00:02:55.410> down<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.890> first<00:02:56.130> slot<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.420> then

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
plane down in the first slot and then

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.870 
plane down in the first slot and then
place<00:02:57.870> an<00:02:58.200> item<00:02:58.470> down<00:02:58.800> whichever<00:02:59.190> upgrade<00:02:59.730> so

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
place an item down whichever upgrade so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.320 
place an item down whichever upgrade so
I'm<00:02:59.940> gonna<00:03:00.060> go<00:03:00.210> with<00:03:00.710> plus<00:03:01.710> nine<00:03:02.340> speed<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
I'm gonna go with plus nine speed and

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.970 
I'm gonna go with plus nine speed and
then<00:03:03.690> there<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:03.990> go<00:03:04.110> now<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.770> you<00:03:04.860> can

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
then there we go now and you can

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.400 
then there we go now and you can
actually<00:03:05.130> change<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.460> name<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.730> everything

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
so it's been given plus nine to be

alright guys and you create a shop with

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.230 
alright guys and you create a shop with
a<00:03:10.800> sign<00:03:11.130> you're<00:03:11.460> gonna<00:03:11.520> need<00:03:11.730> your<00:03:11.790> sign<00:03:12.090> of

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
a sign you're gonna need your sign of

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.490 
a sign you're gonna need your sign of
course<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.750> then<00:03:12.870> you're<00:03:12.990> gonna<00:03:13.080> also<00:03:13.290> want
