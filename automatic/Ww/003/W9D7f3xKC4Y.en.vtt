00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
then we might see the new Nexus 5 device

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.439 
then we might see the new Nexus 5 device
in<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.739> two<00:00:49.920> weeks<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> everybody

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
in just two weeks or now and everybody

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.569 
in just two weeks or now and everybody
suspicions<00:00:52.050> will<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.379> confirmed<00:00:52.739> there<00:00:53.190> so

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
suspicions will be confirmed there so

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.910 
suspicions will be confirmed there so
now<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.789> specs<00:00:54.149> aren't<00:00:54.420> actually<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.199> much<00:00:55.649> or

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
now the specs aren't actually as much or

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.849 
now the specs aren't actually as much or
as<00:00:56.489> high-end<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.809> would<00:00:57.960> actually<00:00:58.170> expect

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
as high-end as you would actually expect

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.819 
as high-end as you would actually expect
it<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.250> couple<00:00:59.640> things<00:00:59.969> work<00:01:00.270> how<00:01:00.510> bad<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
it a couple things work how bad and the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.560 
it a couple things work how bad and the
reason<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.340> people<00:01:02.850> suggestion<00:01:03.390> is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
reason for that people suggestion is

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.299 
reason for that people suggestion is
because<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.170> want<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.500> keep<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.070> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
because they want to keep it in that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.640 
because they want to keep it in that
price<00:01:06.150> range<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> affordable<00:01:07.350> for

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
price range that is affordable for

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.520 
price range that is affordable for
anybody<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:09.000> Nexus<00:01:09.600> 4<00:01:09.900> where<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
anybody like that with Nexus 4 where it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.780 
anybody like that with Nexus 4 where it
was<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> three<00:01:11.040> hundred<00:01:11.310> dollar<00:01:11.460> price

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
was at the three hundred dollar price

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.460 
was at the three hundred dollar price
range<00:01:12.180> they're<00:01:12.689> thinking<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.290> may

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
range they're thinking that they may

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
range they're thinking that they may
have<00:01:13.650> cut<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.369> couple<00:01:14.580> specs<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.450> keep

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
have cut back to a couple specs to keep

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.490 
have cut back to a couple specs to keep
the<00:01:15.869> Nexus<00:01:16.229> 5<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.770> same<00:01:17.100> price<00:01:17.400> range<00:01:17.430> so

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
the Nexus 5 in that same price range so

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
the Nexus 5 in that same price range so
people<00:01:19.500> reporting<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.580> supposed<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
people reporting that it was supposed to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.980 
people reporting that it was supposed to
be<00:01:21.170> designed<00:01:22.170> after<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> LG<00:01:23.100> g2<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.869> of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
be designed after the LG g2 and one of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.630 
be designed after the LG g2 and one of
the<00:01:25.049> features<00:01:25.439> was<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> camera<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the features was the camera which is a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.149 
the features was the camera which is a
13<00:01:27.119> megapixel<00:01:27.270> camera<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> new

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
13 megapixel camera but now in the new

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.219 
13 megapixel camera but now in the new
aspects<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> seems<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.540> might<00:01:30.720> only<00:01:30.930> have

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
aspects it seems that it might only have

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.620 
aspects it seems that it might only have
an<00:01:31.380> 8<00:01:31.619> megapixel<00:01:31.829> camera<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
an 8 megapixel camera so it's one of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.120 
an 8 megapixel camera so it's one of
those<00:01:33.720> things<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.259> might<00:01:34.619> actually<00:01:34.829> have

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
those things that might actually have

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370 
those things that might actually have
been<00:01:35.340> cut<00:01:35.549> back<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.119> order<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.659> allow<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
been cut back in order to allow for a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
been cut back in order to allow for a
smaller<00:01:37.650> price<00:01:37.979> tag<00:01:38.250> which<00:01:38.939> technically

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
smaller price tag which technically

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.560 
smaller price tag which technically
isn't<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.530> bad<00:01:40.829> because<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> actually

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
isn't that bad because when I actually

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.960 
isn't that bad because when I actually
show<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.530> specs<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.130> whatnot<00:01:44.460> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
show you that the specs and whatnot you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.210 
show you that the specs and whatnot you
