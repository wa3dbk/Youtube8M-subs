00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
know so let's get started okay so our

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.630 
know so let's get started okay so our
first<00:00:57.180> step<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> process<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.710> set<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
first step in the process is to set up a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.479 
first step in the process is to set up a
template<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.899> easily<00:01:01.170> done<00:01:01.379> by<00:01:01.829> tracing

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
template this is easily done by tracing

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.289 
template this is easily done by tracing
the<00:01:03.000> outer<00:01:03.149> edges<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.809> outer<00:01:04.320> envelope

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
start by going from the first side and

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.870 
start by going from the first side and
then<00:01:12.170> pushing<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:14.189> tracing<00:01:14.729> all

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
then pushing it down just tracing all

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.539 
then pushing it down just tracing all
the<00:01:15.060> way<00:01:15.180> around<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.710> topic<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.430> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the way around so topic this is

made so we will just follow that line
and<00:02:07.500> tray

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
and tray

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.780 
and tray
stone<00:02:08.680> and<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:10.450> do<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:10.990> once<00:02:11.560> more<00:02:11.920> on<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
stone and then do so once more on the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.460 
stone and then do so once more on the
other<00:02:12.940> side<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.810> have<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:17.020> you

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
other side and there you have it you

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.530 
other side and there you have it you
have<00:02:17.620> your<00:02:17.770> template<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:18.730> I've<00:02:19.300> already

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
have your template here I've already

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.130 
have your template here I've already
have<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.290> already<00:02:20.800> set<00:02:21.160> up<00:02:21.190> one<00:02:21.550> that's<00:02:22.140> pre-cut

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
have I already set up one that's pre-cut

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.280 
have I already set up one that's pre-cut
so<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.160> see<00:02:24.400> how<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.580> looks<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:26.080> next

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
so you can see how it looks and the next

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.470 
so you can see how it looks and the next
step<00:02:26.440> in<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.740> process<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:27.460> just<00:02:27.790> inserting

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
step in the process is just inserting

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.100 
step in the process is just inserting
the<00:02:28.630> slip<00:02:28.930> into<00:02:29.230> your<00:02:29.770> envelope<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.810> might

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
the slip into your envelope this might

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.650 
the slip into your envelope this might
need<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.590> little<00:02:32.920> maneuvering<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.240> just<00:02:34.450> play

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
need a little maneuvering so just play

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.350 
need a little maneuvering so just play
with<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.020> until<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.500> can<00:02:35.650> get<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:36.010> easily<00:02:36.820> set

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
with it until you can get it easily set

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.690 
with it until you can get it easily set
in<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:38.230> cut<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.650> with<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.490> pair<00:02:39.670> of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
in and you cut that with just a pair of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.170 
in and you cut that with just a pair of
scissors<00:02:40.060> or<00:02:40.650> correct<00:02:41.650> if<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.430> want<00:02:42.610> an<00:02:42.820> exact

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
scissors or correct if you want an exact

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.030 
scissors or correct if you want an exact
precision<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.900> can<00:02:44.110> use<00:02:44.320> an<00:02:44.440> exacto<00:02:44.710> knife

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
precision you can use an exacto knife

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.510 
precision you can use an exacto knife
but<00:02:45.280> scissors<00:02:45.670> will<00:02:45.850> work<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.270> fine<00:02:46.570> and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
but scissors will work just fine and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.370 
but scissors will work just fine and
once<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.670> have<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:49.030> set<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.480> you're<00:02:49.960> going<00:02:50.230> to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
once you have it set in you're going to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.770 
once you have it set in you're going to
close<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.010> envelope<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:52.440> set<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.590> crease<00:02:54.780> so

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
close the envelope and set the crease so

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.540 
close the envelope and set the crease so
you<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:56.080> your<00:02:56.110> nice<00:02:56.470> little<00:02:56.680> crease<00:02:57.040> when<00:02:57.460> you
