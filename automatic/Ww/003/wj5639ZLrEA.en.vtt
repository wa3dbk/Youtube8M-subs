here<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.590> fencing<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.420> once<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.840> mark<00:00:46.230> off

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
here is the fencing so once you mark off

here is the fencing so once you mark off
the<00:00:46.530> boundaries<00:00:46.980> you're<00:00:47.280> ready<00:00:47.490> to<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
over here is the tiller that I used to

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:09.230

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
it's pretty small

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:22.740 
it's pretty small
tiller<00:01:16.530> blades<00:01:17.530> here<00:01:20.880> there's<00:01:21.880> two<00:01:22.120> sets<00:01:22.510> of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
but it does the job what was hard was

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.600 
but it does the job what was hard was
the<00:01:38.170> size<00:01:38.440> of<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.800> garden<00:01:39.190> that<00:01:39.220> I'm<00:01:39.490> doing<00:01:39.670> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the size of the garden that I'm doing I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.670 
the size of the garden that I'm doing I
took<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.670> long<00:01:43.000> time<00:01:43.030> because<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:43.960> have<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.350> go

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
took a long time because I have to go

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.040 
took a long time because I have to go
over<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.280> over<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.670> over<00:01:45.940> again<00:01:46.090> we<00:01:46.810> break

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
over and over and over again we break

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.900 
over and over and over again we break
down<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.440> grass<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:48.009> get<00:01:48.220> below<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.610> grass

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
down the grass and get below the grass

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.260 
down the grass and get below the grass
and<00:01:49.240> get<00:01:50.009> enough<00:01:51.009> dirt<00:01:51.340> loosened<00:01:51.880> up

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.599 

this<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> garden<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.310> after<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.429> been

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
this is the garden just after it's been

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:06.050 
this is the garden just after it's been
tilled<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:02.039> measured<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.659> runs<00:02:05.060> 20

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
tilled and I just measured it it runs 20

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.320 
tilled and I just measured it it runs 20
feet<00:02:06.659> deep<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:10.760> 43<00:02:11.760> feet<00:02:12.299> long<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
feet deep and 43 feet long so it is a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.690 
feet deep and 43 feet long so it is a
pretty<00:02:15.330> pretty<00:02:16.290> good<00:02:16.590> sized<00:02:17.150> garden<00:02:19.459> got<00:02:20.459> this

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
pretty pretty good sized garden got this

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.970 
pretty pretty good sized garden got this
all<00:02:21.049> nice<00:02:22.049> dark<00:02:23.090> soil<00:02:24.090> here

here are my band
mistakes<00:02:32.570> but<00:02:33.570> I'll<00:02:33.720> be<00:02:33.990> using<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.770> my

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
mistakes but I'll be using for my

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.210 
mistakes but I'll be using for my
tomatoes<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:37.140> whatever<00:02:37.350> else<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.860> needs<00:02:38.160> to

tomatoes and whatever else that needs to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.270 
tomatoes and whatever else that needs to
be<00:02:38.280> staked<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:39.440> those<00:02:40.440> average<00:02:42.290> six<00:02:43.290> seven

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
be staked up those average six seven

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.630 
be staked up those average six seven
feet<00:02:44.520> tall<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:46.640> they<00:02:47.640> are<00:02:47.910> really<00:02:48.480> thick<00:02:49.080> I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
feet tall and they are really thick I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.380 
feet tall and they are really thick I
got<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.850> one<00:02:51.120> here<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.750> about<00:02:52.820> good<00:02:53.820> two-inch

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
got this one here is about good two-inch

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.200 
got this one here is about good two-inch
diameter<00:02:54.840> that's<00:02:55.790> real<00:02:56.790> heavy-duty<00:02:57.150> one<00:02:57.720> here

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
diameter that's real heavy-duty one here

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.840 
diameter that's real heavy-duty one here
the<00:03:00.210> average<00:03:01.580> width<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.850> about<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.510> one

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
the average width is about this one

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.430 
the average width is about this one
Matis<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.240> add<00:03:06.480> an<00:03:06.750> inch<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> half<00:03:07.260> maybe

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
Matis I can add an inch and a half maybe

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.610 
Matis I can add an inch and a half maybe
and<00:03:09.230> then<00:03:10.230> there's<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:11.010> few<00:03:11.220> smaller<00:03:11.670> ones<00:03:12.620> that

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
and then there's a few smaller ones that

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.500 
and then there's a few smaller ones that
would<00:03:13.830> be<00:03:14.070> nice<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.970> don't<00:03:15.090> have<00:03:15.270> too<00:03:15.420> many

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
would be nice you don't have too many

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.320 
would be nice you don't have too many
smaller<00:03:15.930> ones<00:03:16.490> they're<00:03:17.490> all<00:03:17.610> like<00:03:17.820> at<00:03:18.150> least

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
smaller ones they're all like at least

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.210 
smaller ones they're all like at least
an<00:03:18.570> inch<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.140> two<00:03:19.170> inches<00:03:20.270> here<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:21.830> cut<00:03:22.830> them<00:03:23.040> at

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
an inch to two inches here I cut them at

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.350 
an inch to two inches here I cut them at
an<00:03:23.340> angle<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.300> it'll<00:03:24.540> be<00:03:24.600> easier<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:26.360> stake

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
an angle so it'll be easier to stake

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.220 
an angle so it'll be easier to stake
them<00:03:27.600> into<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.990> ground<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.810> did<00:03:31.020> that<00:03:31.200> with

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
them into the ground and I did that with

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.050 
them into the ground and I did that with
the<00:03:31.530> soft<00:03:31.860> cuz<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.670> had<00:03:32.850> so<00:03:33.060> many<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:34.880> used<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
the soft cuz I had so many I used the
