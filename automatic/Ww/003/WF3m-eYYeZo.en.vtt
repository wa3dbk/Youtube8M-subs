had placed these two grey water tanks
and/or<00:00:24.570> reed<00:00:24.869> beds<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.529> then<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.670> wicking

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and/or reed beds and then this wicking

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.210 
and/or reed beds and then this wicking
garden<00:00:27.810> was<00:00:27.960> not<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:29.070> was

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
garden was not here and that one was

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.030 
garden was not here and that one was
already<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.730> place<00:00:30.029> because<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.990> had<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> gray

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
already in place because we had the gray

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.430 
already in place because we had the gray
water<00:00:32.279> system<00:00:32.399> running<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.239> over<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> hill

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
water system running out over the hill

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.709 
water system running out over the hill
and<00:00:34.820> this<00:00:35.820> pipe<00:00:36.090> here<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.480> see

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

and this pipe here that you see
yesterday<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.890> able<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.129> reroute

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
yesterday I was able to reroute

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.150 
yesterday I was able to reroute
everything<00:00:39.149> into<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.870> system<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.500> connected

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
everything into this system I connected

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.690 
everything into this system I connected
all<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.550> beds<00:00:41.760> together<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:44.010> I've

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
all of the beds together and I've

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.540 
all of the beds together and I've
drilled<00:00:45.059> relief<00:00:45.870> holes<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.410> each<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
drilled relief holes in each one of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.180 
drilled relief holes in each one of
these<00:00:47.670> cross<00:00:48.090> flow<00:00:48.809> pipes<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.039> there

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
these cross flow pipes so that there

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.510 
these cross flow pipes so that there
cannot<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:51.500> siphon<00:00:52.500> that's<00:00:52.770> created<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
cannot be a siphon that's created and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.369 
cannot be a siphon that's created and
that<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:54.360> help<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.719> maintain<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.110> water

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that will help to maintain the water

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
that will help to maintain the water
level<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.980> each<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.579> beds<00:00:58.399> secondly

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
level in each one of these beds secondly

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
level in each one of these beds secondly
I<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.609> not<00:01:00.059> glued<00:01:00.420> together<00:01:00.660> some<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> this

here<00:02:03.159> in<00:02:03.369> lakes<00:02:03.750> many<00:02:04.750> states<00:02:05.259> it's<00:02:05.439> illegal

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
here in lakes many states it's illegal

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.859 
here in lakes many states it's illegal
because<00:02:06.009> of<00:02:06.219> how<00:02:06.430> prolific<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.329> how<00:02:07.539> fast

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
because of how prolific it is how fast

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.469 
because of how prolific it is how fast
it<00:02:08.080> grows<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:09.519> how<00:02:09.610> fast<00:02:09.849> it<00:02:10.060> will<00:02:10.149> reproduce

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
it grows and how fast it will reproduce

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.520 
it grows and how fast it will reproduce
I<00:02:10.840> think<00:02:11.349> it's<00:02:11.950> maybe<00:02:12.879> reproduces<00:02:13.660> four<00:02:14.170> times

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
I think it's maybe reproduces four times

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.910 
I think it's maybe reproduces four times
every<00:02:14.830> week<00:02:15.090> or<00:02:16.090> something<00:02:16.330> like<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:16.920> so

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
every week or something like that so

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920 
every week or something like that so
we'll<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.879> keep<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.239> at<00:02:19.450> bay<00:02:19.630> and

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
we'll have to keep this at bay and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.009 
we'll have to keep this at bay and
that's<00:02:20.830> okay<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.300> really<00:02:22.750> good<00:02:22.870> at

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
that's okay it is really good at

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.170 
that's okay it is really good at
filtering<00:02:23.230> water<00:02:23.620> he's<00:02:24.010> been<00:02:24.220> using<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.030> in

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
filtering water he's been using it in

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.960 
filtering water he's been using it in
his<00:02:25.300> aquaponic<00:02:25.959> system<00:02:26.319> do<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.040> second<00:02:27.790> link

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
his aquaponic system do that second link

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.660 
his aquaponic system do that second link
he<00:02:28.060> brought<00:02:28.239> some<00:02:28.450> strawberries<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.670> right

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
he brought some strawberries and right

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.190 
he brought some strawberries and right
now<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:30.910> strawberries<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.660> just<00:02:31.870> setting

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
now the strawberries are just setting

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.759 
now the strawberries are just setting
there<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.830> help<00:02:33.660> until<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:34.810> can<00:02:34.989> add<00:02:35.170> more<00:02:35.410> and

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
really good I've been suggesting to use

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.789 
really good I've been suggesting to use
cattails<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.720> that's<00:03:16.870> one<00:03:17.079> thing<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.380> know<00:03:17.440> for

sure that we're going to go and get in

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.150 
sure that we're going to go and get in
the<00:03:19.480> future<00:03:19.840> is<00:03:20.109> we're<00:03:20.410> going<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.560> go<00:03:20.709> pull<00:03:20.920> Pat

the future is we're going to go pull Pat

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.069 
the future is we're going to go pull Pat
tails<00:03:21.430> out<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.790> pond<00:03:22.030> I'll<00:03:22.540> record<00:03:22.930> the

process and we'll bring them back and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.580 
process and we'll bring them back and
put<00:03:25.150> them<00:03:25.239> in<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.420> gray<00:03:25.569> water<00:03:25.810> system<00:03:26.260> but

it was in the first place we're just
using<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.310> water<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.819> little<00:03:52.269> bit<00:03:52.799> on<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:54.010> way

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
using the water a little bit on the way

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.250 
using the water a little bit on the way
down<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.459> hill<00:03:54.870> now

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
down the hill now

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.130 
down the hill now
I<00:03:57.349> do<00:03:58.069> have<00:03:58.489> plans<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:59.269> make<00:03:59.390> this<00:03:59.629> better<00:03:59.989> I

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
I do have plans to make this better I

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.130 
I do have plans to make this better I
the<00:04:00.709> goal<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:01.099> it<00:04:01.250> could<00:04:01.430> just<00:04:01.579> leave<00:04:01.879> it

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
the goal is it could just leave it

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.270 
the goal is it could just leave it
hanging<00:04:03.140> here<00:04:03.470> off<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.769> edge<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.099> hill

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
hanging here off the edge of the hill

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.640 
hanging here off the edge of the hill
and<00:04:04.310> just<00:04:04.730> let<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.420> water<00:04:05.569> run<00:04:05.720> down<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.500> then

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
and just let the water run down and then

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.429 
and just let the water run down and then
continue<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.519> plant<00:04:08.379> erosion<00:04:09.459> preventing

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
continue to plant erosion preventing

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.699 
continue to plant erosion preventing
plants<00:04:12.439> here<00:04:12.950> below<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:14.079> those<00:04:15.079> will<00:04:15.290> also<00:04:15.470> do

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
plants here below and those will also do

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.400 
plants here below and those will also do
plants<00:04:16.039> we<00:04:16.220> think<00:04:16.400> eat<00:04:17.199> initially<00:04:18.199> we'll<00:04:18.320> be

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
plants we think eat initially we'll be

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.129 
plants we think eat initially we'll be
using<00:04:18.560> garden<00:04:19.100> socks<00:04:19.370> down<00:04:19.699> here<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.570> see<00:04:20.959> how

that curves the water flow moving down
the<00:04:23.300> hill<00:04:23.449> and<00:04:24.350> that's<00:04:24.530> something<00:04:24.770> I
