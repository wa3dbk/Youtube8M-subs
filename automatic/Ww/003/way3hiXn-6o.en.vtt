00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.790
 good evening but that's all today 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.790
 fifth episode of the best weapons 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.710
 after sochi and today we are going 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.820
 tackle the big caliber 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:31.820
 we will tackle the shotgun so 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.200
 we will say hey direction the them 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.320
 targets 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.870
 I had a bug that you are well me it 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.260
 will be back above this beautiful 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.550
 time is super hot finally short 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.199
 is not there to talk about the weather on 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.100
 is there for these banks talk 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.440
 not so we're not going to waste time on 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.219
 will open the top 3 with between a 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.319
 position the wrestler so of course I 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.120
 will try not to spoil us 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:03.129
 see my inventory as in the episode 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.630
 4 so the punchers is an herb 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.780
 to jeal seraphim otherwise we lose the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.400
 controls on fleshy monsters she 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.240
 has a fucking firing rate etc in 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.650
 touch his target 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.720
 we have a chance to recover bullets 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.310
 in the hit loader if you are the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.540
 luck will you shoot you pull ten 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.510
 minutes with 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.810
 make waves 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.810
 Yes 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.480
 my charger is really just sixteen 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.409
 bullets you've seen everything I've 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.060
 pulled in charge 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.060
 I want more than this ball before 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.450
 and 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.520
 it's really a height I like 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.530
 a lot of rules for the jaws the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.530
 rate of fire that are huge 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.760
 sulfateuse 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.300
 good short yeah so I think you read 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.590
 in all the elements of course I 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.630
 the incendiary hearts for the moment 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:11.510
 but there are more zen think yes 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:13.040
 late number 2 the inter 0 so I think 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.020
 that this bridge it's a little the inverted 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.090
 of conference call conference call this is 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.980
 when you pull that it scattered 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.620
 balls everywhere while he's no it's 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.520
 that group them in one place 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.170
 so then by cons I have a small hole 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.700
 I do not know the name of the macif who 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.310
 the loot i know it's in the bfc 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.570
 their own lot but the name I do not remember 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.420
 with a wizard it's a kind 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.130
 of chocolate insect I completely have a 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.709
 hole and I do not remember any more of 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.930
 his name his voice lavaur acid 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.140
 loeb are voracious it seems to me 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.250
 you can buy it at the end of May 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.670
 but yes we can see it on the day at 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.709
 sid 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.650
 so I have the most playful one more 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.720
 the effect of bullets compared to 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.730
 conferences which heroes who do not pay 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.500
 by all the balls him he is 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.600
 regroup here and well it's not 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.280
 I use very rarely but I find 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.170
 that it's really a nice shot what 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.970
 if you get to fuck cepal 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.260
 in the center even if it's mass damage 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.220
 minimum rate of fire or rate of 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.660
 normal shot without for a touch apps 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.170
 referees but here are my games it is 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.620
 still pretty balèze and finally the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.870
 number one who is really the second goal 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.690
 10 the most it's known the carnage the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.810
 second little bridge to the devices 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.840
 against up on the fleshy monsters then 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.239
 him like bühler is to learn from this 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.580
 top so suddenly the publisher had some 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.850
 explosives 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.020
 malta was born where I touched his target 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:01.500
 with the sackings actually 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.870
 here you are like the harold 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.450
 this shot of rocket is but cons 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.550
 hwa who consume mass mass mission 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.050
 wait one retains a blow me is 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.690
 still 3 but he does not pull a lot of 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.160
 queries against black cat 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.480
 now I cover you have my good 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.890
 ranking so age and timing 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.780
 the child tron ​​may have that there is 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.150
 in addition it requires four programs do not 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.680
 do not know but already I find this same 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.310
 base of maginot galas x 5 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.250
 the carnage so here is this little top of 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.900
 coming to an end he will remain a top I 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.880
 do not go so far as to say even if we know 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.500
 very well what it seems to me 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.500
 that it remains that these weapons from elsewhere 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:51.600
 So here maybe I'll be a 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.910
 top by top episodes by how 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.390
 say by color kind blue 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:02.910
 rose sang for a bit my trip a 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.710
 max of terms that are not bad but seen 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.910
 see it maybe we'll go if I go 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.470
 to make a top the worst weapons have had so 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.800
 we'll see an engineer career at 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.410
 noble 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.730
 here we are so I hope this little 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.530
 top you will have liked puma me I tell you to 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.530
 the next ul and kisses measurements
