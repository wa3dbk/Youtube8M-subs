00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.840 

so<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.950> what<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:03.130> ended<00:02:03.189> up<00:02:03.579> with<00:02:05.670> yeah<00:02:06.670> it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
so this is what I ended up with yeah it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.339 
so this is what I ended up with yeah it
doesn't<00:02:07.000> look<00:02:07.149> anything<00:02:07.420> like<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.689> reg<00:02:07.899> wrap<00:02:08.110> or

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
doesn't look anything like a reg wrap or

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.059 
doesn't look anything like a reg wrap or
a<00:02:08.410> pressure<00:02:09.310> or<00:02:09.729> anything<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.959> once<00:02:11.680> i<00:02:11.800> built

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
a pressure or anything but once i built

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.270 
a pressure or anything but once i built
the<00:02:12.400> pressure<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.200> realized<00:02:14.200> how<00:02:14.500> amazingly

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
the pressure to I realized how amazingly

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.750 
the pressure to I realized how amazingly
limited<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.150> x<00:02:16.330> y&amp;z<00:02:17.110> axis<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.680> were<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.069> how

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
limited the x y&amp;z axis is were and how

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.520 
limited the x y&amp;z axis is were and how
little<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.180> could<00:02:19.360> do<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.480> modify<00:02:19.720> them<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.500> I

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
little I could do to modify them so I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.500 
little I could do to modify them so I
was<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> little<00:02:21.040> disappointed<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.390> actually

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
was a little disappointed so I actually

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.240 
was a little disappointed so I actually
printed<00:02:22.900> some<00:02:23.049> new<00:02:23.170> parts<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.709> went<00:02:24.190> ahead

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
printed some new parts and went ahead

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.420 
printed some new parts and went ahead
and<00:02:24.810> built<00:02:25.810> my<00:02:26.019> own<00:02:26.049> custom<00:02:26.560> model<00:02:26.830> actually

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
and built my own custom model actually

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.770 
and built my own custom model actually
all<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> printed<00:02:28.450> was<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:29.709> two<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.549> these<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
all I printed was this two of these the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.850 
all I printed was this two of these the
motor<00:02:32.019> mounts<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:33.780> then<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.870> just<00:02:34.930> put<00:02:35.110> this

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
motor mounts and then I just put this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.100 
motor mounts and then I just put this
together<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.700> all<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.480> other<00:02:37.599> white<00:02:37.810> parts

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
together and all the other white parts

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.210 
together and all the other white parts
you<00:02:38.230> see<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.730> printed<00:02:39.730> with<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:42.040> could

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
you see I printed with this you could

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.069 
you see I printed with this you could
take<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:42.970> look<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.390> print<00:02:43.660> quality<00:02:43.810> is

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
take a look the print quality is

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.160 
take a look the print quality is
actually<00:02:44.379> pretty<00:02:44.500> good<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.690> all<00:02:46.810> printed<00:02:47.079> from

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
actually pretty good so all printed from

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.880 
actually pretty good so all printed from
abs<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.910> is<00:02:49.150> not<00:02:49.299> limited<00:02:49.540> at<00:02:50.079> all<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.739> can

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
abs this is not limited at all you can

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.650 
abs this is not limited at all you can
actually<00:02:51.160> scale<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:52.150> can<00:02:52.299> see<00:02:52.450> all<00:02:52.629> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
actually scale it you can see all the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.380 
actually scale it you can see all the
all<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.110> hardware<00:02:53.590> parts<00:02:53.950> are<00:02:54.129> from<00:02:54.610> the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
all the hardware parts are from the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.900 
all the hardware parts are from the
Reaper<00:02:55.660> app<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.049> I<00:02:56.980> kind<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.250> just<00:02:57.400> adapted

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
Reaper app and I kind of just adapted

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.530 
Reaper app and I kind of just adapted
them<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.390> hold<00:02:58.599> it<00:02:58.750> hold<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.739> together<00:02:59.890> it's

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
them to hold it hold it together it's

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.180 
them to hold it hold it together it's
totally<00:03:01.540> solid<00:03:02.400> totally<00:03:03.400> flat<00:03:03.989> no<00:03:04.989> rock<00:03:05.319> at

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
totally solid totally flat no rock at

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.009 
totally solid totally flat no rock at
all<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:07.569> it's<00:03:08.730> calibrated<00:03:09.730> really<00:03:10.239> well<00:03:10.420> you

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
all and it's calibrated really well you

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.680 
all and it's calibrated really well you
can<00:03:11.170> see<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.650> goes<00:03:11.889> all<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.250> way<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:16.540> can

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
can see it goes all the way and you can

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.900 
can see it goes all the way and you can
continue<00:03:16.810> going<00:03:17.319> I<00:03:17.680> put<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.280> stop<00:03:18.519> actually

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
continue going I put the stop actually

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.900 
continue going I put the stop actually
here<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.329> goes<00:03:19.480> underneath<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.290> table

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
here so it goes underneath the table

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.930 
here so it goes underneath the table
really<00:03:21.910> nice<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:23.769> goes<00:03:23.980> again<00:03:24.609> you<00:03:24.790> can

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
really nice and it goes again you can

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.520 
really nice and it goes again you can
scale<00:03:25.359> this<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.500> goes<00:03:26.709> all<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.630> way<00:03:28.630> across

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.729 

you<00:03:32.530> get<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.829> full<00:03:33.069> 200<00:03:33.639> x<00:03:33.790> 200<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:35.500> this

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
you get the full 200 x 200 and you this

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.680 
you get the full 200 x 200 and you this
is<00:03:35.889> about<00:03:36.130> I'm<00:03:36.700> gonna<00:03:36.910> like<00:03:37.120> seven<00:03:37.510> or<00:03:37.569> eight

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
is about I'm gonna like seven or eight

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.970 
is about I'm gonna like seven or eight
inches<00:03:37.900> high<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:38.500> maybe<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.549> 170<00:03:40.510> 200<00:03:41.260> but

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
inches high so maybe like 170 200 but

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.710 
inches high so maybe like 170 200 but
you're<00:03:42.220> not<00:03:42.310> limited<00:03:42.609> you<00:03:42.970> can<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.419> know<00:03:43.540> make

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
you're not limited you can you know make

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.809 
you're not limited you can you know make
your<00:03:43.780> own<00:03:44.019> X<00:03:44.169> carriage<00:03:44.530> as<00:03:44.799> i<00:03:45.099> did<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:45.669> is

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
your own X carriage as i did this is

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.430 
your own X carriage as i did this is
totally<00:03:46.180> designed<00:03:46.510> by<00:03:46.630> me<00:03:46.780> backstage<00:03:47.739> and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
totally designed by me backstage and

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.839 
totally designed by me backstage and
works<00:03:50.440> great<00:03:50.560> works<00:03:50.980> really<00:03:51.190> really<00:03:51.310> well<00:03:51.519> i

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
works great works really really well i

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.330 
works great works really really well i
am<00:03:52.209> not<00:03:52.419> really<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.870> pro<00:03:53.290> at<00:03:53.470> printing<00:03:53.799> with<00:03:53.950> abs

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
am not really a pro at printing with abs

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.849 
am not really a pro at printing with abs
yet<00:03:54.609> but<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.750> really<00:03:56.230> nice<00:03:56.500> some

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
yet but this is really nice some

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.009 
yet but this is really nice some
improvements<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.459> i've<00:03:57.579> made<00:03:57.819> over<00:03:58.019> the

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
improvements that i've made over the

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.650 
improvements that i've made over the
original<00:03:59.260> design<00:03:59.799> the<00:04:00.669> motor<00:04:00.910> had<00:04:01.419> like<00:04:01.630> a

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
original design the motor had like a

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.550 
original design the motor had like a
little<00:04:01.810> carabiner<00:04:02.819> like<00:04:03.819> a<00:04:03.849> bearing<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:05.380> that

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
little carabiner like a bearing so that

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.550 
little carabiner like a bearing so that
it<00:04:05.680> would<00:04:05.859> kind<00:04:06.190> of<00:04:06.870> tension<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:08.230> bit<00:04:08.379> or

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
it would kind of tension it a bit or

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.229 
it would kind of tension it a bit or
kind<00:04:08.860> of<00:04:08.920> offset<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:09.879> that<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.090> was

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
kind of offset it so that it was

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.620 
kind of offset it so that it was
parallel

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
parallel

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.060 
parallel
with<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:11.960> design<00:04:12.320> I<00:04:12.380> was<00:04:12.620> able<00:04:12.710> to<00:04:12.830> move<00:04:13.010> the

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
with this design I was able to move the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.160 
with this design I was able to move the
motor<00:04:13.340> up<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:14.270> after<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.750> have<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.900> direct

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
motor up and after you have a direct

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.390 
motor up and after you have a direct
belt<00:04:15.590> very<00:04:15.860> much<00:04:16.160> like<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:18.350> x-axis<00:04:18.980> up<00:04:19.130> here

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
belt very much like the x-axis up here

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.480 
belt very much like the x-axis up here
just<00:04:20.300> straight<00:04:20.870> one<00:04:21.140> bearing<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.280> motor

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
just straight one bearing and the motor

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.930 
just straight one bearing and the motor
so<00:04:22.820> there's<00:04:23.000> no<00:04:23.270> worry<00:04:24.140> about<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.890> like<00:04:25.760> an

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
so there's no worry about a like an

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.300 
so there's no worry about a like an
idler<00:04:26.420> or<00:04:26.750> any<00:04:26.990> kind<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.350> tension<00:04:27.620> problem<00:04:28.130> it

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
idler or any kind of tension problem it

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.060 
idler or any kind of tension problem it
works<00:04:28.490> really<00:04:28.610> well<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:30.140> sanguine<00:04:30.680> Oh<00:04:30.710> Lulu

that I printed all the wires are you

didn't want to cut any of the wiring I

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.020 
didn't want to cut any of the wiring I
do<00:04:39.770> like<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.250> keep<00:04:40.520> all<00:04:40.700> my<00:04:40.850> wires<00:04:41.290> clean<00:04:42.290> and

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
do like to keep all my wires clean and

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.470 
do like to keep all my wires clean and
full<00:04:44.030> length<00:04:44.890> underneath<00:04:45.890> you<00:04:46.220> can<00:04:46.400> see<00:04:46.640> kind

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
full length underneath you can see kind

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.500 
full length underneath you can see kind
of<00:04:47.600> edited<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.650> plate<00:04:48.920> mount<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:50.000> lifted<00:04:50.450> it

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
of edited the plate mount and lifted it

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.230 
of edited the plate mount and lifted it
up<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:52.190> could<00:04:52.250> place<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:53.030> motor

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
up so that I could place the motor

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.030 
up so that I could place the motor
higher<00:04:53.570> up<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.610> give<00:04:55.610> that<00:04:55.880> straight<00:04:56.540> belt

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
higher up and give that straight belt

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.300 
higher up and give that straight belt
rather<00:04:58.040> than<00:04:58.280> having<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:59.710> configuration<00:05:00.710> that

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
rather than having a configuration that

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.920 
rather than having a configuration that
kind<00:05:01.700> of<00:05:01.760> offsets<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.480> so<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.810> it's

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
kind of offsets it so that it's

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.960 
kind of offsets it so that it's
perpendicular<00:05:03.920> with<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.670> plate<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:06.970> yeah

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
perpendicular with the plate and yeah

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.480 
perpendicular with the plate and yeah
where<00:05:08.630> is<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.990> mounts<00:05:09.380> so<00:05:10.130> this<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.310> actually

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
where is the mounts so this is actually
