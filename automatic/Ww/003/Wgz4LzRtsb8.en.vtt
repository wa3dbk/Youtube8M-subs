artist recently reminded me how much of

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.800 
artist recently reminded me how much of
a<00:01:29.459> difference<00:01:29.640> tightlining<00:01:30.330> makes<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.750> your

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
a difference tightlining makes to your

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.449 
a difference tightlining makes to your
eyes<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.319> I'd<00:01:31.470> love<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.709> do<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.159> black

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
eyes so I'd love to do that with black

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.580 
eyes so I'd love to do that with black
liner<00:01:32.700> using<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.539> brown<00:01:33.780> makes<00:01:34.080> my<00:01:34.229> eye<00:01:34.259> stand

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
liner using the brown makes my eye stand

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
liner using the brown makes my eye stand
a<00:01:34.740> little<00:01:34.920> more<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> brown<00:01:35.909> always

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
a little more because the brown always

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.630 
a little more because the brown always
tends<00:01:36.539> to<00:01:36.690> compromise<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.830> using<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.429> tight

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
tends to compromise and using the tight

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.010 
tends to compromise and using the tight
line<00:01:38.759> technique<00:01:39.209> crease<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> fuller<00:01:39.780> lash

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
line technique crease a fuller lash

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.419 
line technique crease a fuller lash
effect<00:01:40.200> without<00:01:40.590> interfering<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
effect without interfering with the

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:59.310 
effect without interfering with the
Brown

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320
