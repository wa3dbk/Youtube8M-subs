so you can see we got the guitar so
pretty<00:00:42.920> clean<00:00:43.390> I'm<00:00:44.390> going<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.750> come<00:00:44.870> in<00:00:44.990> here

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
pretty clean I'm going to come in here

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.180 
pretty clean I'm going to come in here
and<00:00:46.930> controls<00:00:47.930> on<00:00:48.170> this<00:00:48.440> pedal<00:00:48.800> are<00:00:48.950> pretty

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
and controls on this pedal are pretty

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.880 
and controls on this pedal are pretty
straightforward<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.900> got<00:00:51.050> volume<00:00:51.350> which<00:00:51.860> is

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
straightforward you got volume which is

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.670 
straightforward you got volume which is
the<00:00:52.160> output<00:00:52.310> signal<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.910> pedal<00:00:53.210> gain<00:00:54.050> which<00:00:54.530> is

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
the output signal to pedal gain which is

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.799 
the output signal to pedal gain which is
the<00:00:54.800> amount<00:00:54.950> of<00:00:55.130> overdrive<00:00:56.060> or<00:00:56.330> distortion

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
the amount of overdrive or distortion

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.110 
the amount of overdrive or distortion
you're<00:00:57.020> going<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.200> have<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.620> then<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.730> EQ

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
you're going to have and then the EQ

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.369 
you're going to have and then the EQ
controls<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.840> low<00:01:00.070> middle<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.430> high<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:03.140> we

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
controls the low middle and high so we

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.380 
controls the low middle and high so we
can<00:01:03.590> start<00:01:03.800> this<00:01:03.950> off<00:01:04.190> at<00:01:04.400> about<00:01:04.489> unity<00:01:05.000> volume

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
can start this off at about unity volume

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.170 
can start this off at about unity volume
about<00:01:05.720> fifty<00:01:06.140> percent<00:01:06.170> gain<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.010> i'm<00:01:08.000> going

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
about fifty percent gain and i'm going

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.070 
about fifty percent gain and i'm going
to<00:01:08.240> leave<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.810> eq<00:01:09.380> pretty<00:01:10.010> level<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.330> here<00:01:12.050> we

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
to leave the eq pretty level so here we

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:31.780 
to leave the eq pretty level so here we
go<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.440> neck

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:45.890 

okay<00:01:32.790> let's<00:01:33.690> try<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> neck<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:44.540> got<00:01:45.540> my<00:01:45.690> back

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
okay let's try the neck that got my back

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.330 
okay let's try the neck that got my back
off<00:01:46.080> volume<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.830> little<00:01:46.980> bit<00:01:47.100> sticking

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
off volume here a little bit sticking

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.070 
off volume here a little bit sticking
here<00:01:47.520> off<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.670> pedal<00:01:48.090> cleans<00:01:48.330> up<00:01:48.510> lower

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
here off the pedal cleans up lower

00:01:49.080 --> 00:02:12.000 
here off the pedal cleans up lower
volume

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.929 

so<00:02:13.010> as<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.129> can<00:02:13.250> hear<00:02:13.430> it's<00:02:13.549> a<00:02:13.579> pretty<00:02:13.730> dynamic

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
so as you can hear it's a pretty dynamic

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.580 
so as you can hear it's a pretty dynamic
puddle<00:02:14.480> when<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.719> when<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:14.989> back<00:02:15.230> off<00:02:15.439> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
puddle when you when you back off the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.140 
puddle when you when you back off the
volume<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:16.129> can<00:02:17.650> get<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.739> pretty<00:02:18.920> clean<00:02:19.219> all

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
volume you can get it pretty clean all

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.670 
volume you can get it pretty clean all
right<00:02:20.329> Alex<00:02:20.599> master<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.959> controls<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.439> little

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
right Alex master the controls a little

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.830 
right Alex master the controls a little
bit<00:02:21.799> I'm<00:02:22.489> going<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.730> bring<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.209> gain<00:02:23.510> up<00:02:23.810> to

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
bit I'm going to bring the gain up to

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.270 
bit I'm going to bring the gain up to
about<00:02:25.480> eighty-five<00:02:26.480> percent<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.980> I'm<00:02:28.099> going

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.160 
about eighty-five percent and I'm going
to<00:02:28.370> take<00:02:28.639> the<00:02:28.819> lows<00:02:29.000> down<00:02:29.299> I'm<00:02:29.750> going<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:29.989> kick

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.720 
to take the lows down I'm going to kick
up<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.439> mint<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.799> little<00:02:30.829> bit<00:02:31.189> and<00:02:31.459> I'm<00:02:31.609> going

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.760 

hey

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.309 

so<00:03:02.770> as<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.069> hear<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.430> petal<00:03:03.730> can<00:03:03.850> really

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
so as you can hear that petal can really

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.949 
so as you can hear that petal can really
get<00:03:05.319> some<00:03:05.440> pretty<00:03:05.680> aggressive<00:03:06.810> sounds<00:03:07.810> out<00:03:07.930> of

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
get some pretty aggressive sounds out of

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.430 
get some pretty aggressive sounds out of
it<00:03:08.140> now<00:03:08.590> let's<00:03:08.740> try<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.010> other<00:03:09.490> way<00:03:10.390> I'm<00:03:11.319> going

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
it now let's try the other way I'm going

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.100 
it now let's try the other way I'm going
to<00:03:11.530> take<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.770> game<00:03:11.980> back<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.459> about<00:03:13.110> thirty

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
to take the game back to about thirty

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.070 
to take the game back to about thirty
percent<00:03:15.330> bring<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.450> lows<00:03:16.690> up<00:03:18.990> kind<00:03:19.990> of<00:03:20.020> keep

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
percent bring the lows up kind of keep

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:28.580 
percent bring the lows up kind of keep
them<00:03:20.350> into<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.800> highs<00:03:21.240> even

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:04:00.360 

because<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.709> were<00:03:29.859> like<00:03:30.099> an<00:03:30.219> ac/dc

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.380 

okay<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:02.450> that<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.850> pigtronix<00:04:04.850> audio

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
okay so that is the pigtronix audio

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.490 
okay so that is the pigtronix audio
distortion<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.310> I'm<00:04:07.310> gym<00:04:07.870> then<00:04:08.870> sub<00:04:09.140> music

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
distortion and I'm gym then sub music

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.440 
distortion and I'm gym then sub music
and<00:04:09.950> if<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:10.400> have<00:04:10.520> any<00:04:10.640> more<00:04:10.760> questions<00:04:11.000> you
