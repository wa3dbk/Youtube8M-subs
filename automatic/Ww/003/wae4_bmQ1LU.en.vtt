but<00:00:46.570> first<00:00:46.840> when<00:00:47.020> I<00:00:47.050> came<00:00:47.170> here<00:00:47.620> out<00:00:48.370> scared<00:00:48.910> I

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
but first when I came here out scared I

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.479 
but first when I came here out scared I
was<00:00:49.629> really<00:00:49.930> scared<00:00:50.289> because<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:50.980> thought<00:00:51.250> of

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
was really scared because I thought of

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.180 
was really scared because I thought of
the<00:00:51.640> longer<00:00:51.910> hours<00:00:52.449> the<00:00:52.750> extra<00:00:53.110> classes<00:00:53.500> and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
the longer hours the extra classes and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.470 
the longer hours the extra classes and
how<00:00:55.089> far<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.540> was<00:00:55.750> at<00:00:56.440> first<00:00:57.339> I<00:00:57.879> thought<00:00:58.120> that

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
how far it was at first I thought that

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.990 
how far it was at first I thought that
we<00:00:58.930> got<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.350> look<00:00:59.589> at<00:00:59.739> a<00:00:59.800> behavior<00:00:59.949> cold<00:01:00.489> it

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
we got a look at a behavior cold it

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.420 
we got a look at a behavior cold it
might<00:01:01.210> be<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.420> bit<00:01:01.690> like<00:01:01.960> strict<00:01:02.440> well<00:01:03.010> at<00:01:03.370> first

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
might be a bit like strict well at first

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.820 
might be a bit like strict well at first
I<00:01:03.820> thought<00:01:03.970> was<00:01:04.089> quite<00:01:04.269> scary<00:01:04.629> as<00:01:05.050> we<00:01:05.710> don't

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
I thought was quite scary as we don't

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.700 
I thought was quite scary as we don't
have<00:01:06.100> older<00:01:06.729> ones<00:01:06.940> to<00:01:07.240> like<00:01:07.479> tell<00:01:08.290> us<00:01:08.320> about

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
have older ones to like tell us about

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.800 
have older ones to like tell us about
these<00:01:08.979> stuff<00:01:09.310> at<00:01:09.520> school<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.570> everything

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
these stuff at school and everything

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.050 
these stuff at school and everything
about<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.340> think<00:01:12.549> I<00:01:12.670> was<00:01:12.759> concerned

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
about that and I think I was concerned

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.859 
about that and I think I was concerned
about<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.450> times<00:01:13.720> because<00:01:15.240> 752<00:01:16.240> 530<00:01:16.600> sounds

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
about the times because 752 530 sounds

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.870 
about the times because 752 530 sounds
quite<00:01:17.020> long<00:01:17.200> but<00:01:17.740> once<00:01:17.950> I<00:01:18.160> got<00:01:18.310> used<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.580> it<00:01:18.640> is

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
quite long but once I got used to it is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.719 
quite long but once I got used to it is
it<00:01:19.270> was<00:01:19.420> good<00:01:19.630> because<00:01:20.220> you'd<00:01:21.220> think<00:01:21.250> that

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
it was good because you'd think that

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.510 
it was good because you'd think that
you'd<00:01:21.880> be<00:01:21.910> tired<00:01:22.210> at<00:01:22.450> home<00:01:22.630> but<00:01:22.840> you're<00:01:22.929> not

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
you'd be tired at home but you're not

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:43.380 
you'd be tired at home but you're not

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
stuff with and that's been really

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.420 
stuff with and that's been really
challenging<00:02:13.270> there's<00:02:14.230> obviously<00:02:14.650> going<00:02:15.370> to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
challenging there's obviously going to

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.090 
challenging there's obviously going to
be<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.580> risk<00:02:15.880> because<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.470> unknown<00:02:17.650> for

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
be a risk because it's the unknown for

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.640 
be a risk because it's the unknown for
most<00:02:18.280> people<00:02:18.700> but<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.390> me<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.840> my<00:02:19.900> family

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
most people but for me and my family

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.430 
most people but for me and my family
it's<00:02:21.130> worked<00:02:21.430> out<00:02:21.640> really<00:02:22.180> well<00:02:22.570> much<00:02:23.200> better

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
it's worked out really well much better

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.940
