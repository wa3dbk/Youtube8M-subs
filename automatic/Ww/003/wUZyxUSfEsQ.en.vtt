00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
purpose of that is is that's where you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.210 
purpose of that is is that's where you
can<00:01:25.990> wiggle<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.439> little<00:01:26.470> bit<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:26.890> then<00:01:27.009> pull

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
can wiggle it a little bit and then pull

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.890 
can wiggle it a little bit and then pull
it<00:01:27.310> up<00:01:27.490> when<00:01:28.060> you're<00:01:28.210> doing<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.659> it's

actually giving you the volume and it's

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.780 
actually giving you the volume and it's
actually<00:01:31.270> helping<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.920> build<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.159> lashes<00:01:33.579> out

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790

this brush gets really nice and close in
there<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.270> I<00:01:37.360> don't<00:01:37.420> feel<00:01:37.840> like<00:01:38.110> as<00:01:38.770> an

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
there and I don't feel like as an

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.340 
there and I don't feel like as an
example<00:01:39.250> something<00:01:39.670> like<00:01:39.850> lash<00:01:40.329> blast<00:01:40.659> or

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
example something like lash blast or

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.609 
example something like lash blast or
something<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:42.280> has<00:01:42.399> a<00:01:42.430> much<00:01:42.610> larger<00:01:42.939> brush

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
something that has a much larger brush

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.950 
something that has a much larger brush
the<00:01:44.619> problem<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.189> is<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:46.329> closer<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.810> get

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
the problem that is the closer you get

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.450 
the problem that is the closer you get
to<00:01:47.020> your<00:01:47.259> eye<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.619> can<00:01:50.770> see<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:51.310> is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
to your eye you can you can see this is

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.010 
to your eye you can you can see this is
so<00:01:51.640> much<00:01:51.790> thicker<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.329> it's<00:01:52.509> actually<00:01:52.840> going

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
so much thicker that it's actually going

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.830 
so much thicker that it's actually going
