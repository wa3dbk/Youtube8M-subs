say in these Kyle we've got nickel metal

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.670 
say in these Kyle we've got nickel metal
hydride<00:03:03.540> that's<00:03:04.310> 3,000<00:03:05.310> milliamps<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.880> think

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
hydride that's 3,000 milliamps I think

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.330 
hydride that's 3,000 milliamps I think
for<00:03:07.680> channel<00:03:08.130> receiver<00:03:09.590> like<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.070> hot

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
for channel receiver like this is a hot

for channel receiver like this is a hot
talk<00:03:11.610> steering<00:03:12.030> servo<00:03:12.450> um<00:03:12.900> it's<00:03:14.000> three

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
talk steering servo um it's three

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.140 
talk steering servo um it's three
thousand<00:03:15.450> kilo<00:03:15.690> volts<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:17.519> speed

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
thousand kilo volts that speed

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.120 
thousand kilo volts that speed
controller<00:03:18.600> she<00:03:18.840> looks<00:03:19.019> rather<00:03:19.200> small<00:03:19.650> what's

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
controller she looks rather small what's

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.580 
controller she looks rather small what's
smaller<00:03:20.459> than<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.700> expected<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.540> be

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
comes if tamiya plug so I'll probably

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.779 
comes if tamiya plug so I'll probably
update<00:04:33.400> them<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.150> Dean's<00:04:34.509> pretty<00:04:35.349> soon<00:04:38.340> yeah<00:04:39.340> I
