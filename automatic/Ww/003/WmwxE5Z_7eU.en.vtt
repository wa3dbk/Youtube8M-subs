and I'm sorry in the winter I am more

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.559 
and I'm sorry in the winter I am more
concerned<00:03:32.459> with<00:03:33.380> warmth<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.530> comfort<00:03:34.859> and

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
concerned with warmth and comfort and

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.759 
concerned with warmth and comfort and
when<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.599> think<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:36.959> warmth<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.410> comfort<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
when I think of warmth and comfort the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.199 
when I think of warmth and comfort the
first<00:03:38.099> thing<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.400> comes<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.670> my<00:03:38.819> mind<00:03:38.849> is

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
first thing that comes to my mind is

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.379 
first thing that comes to my mind is
uggs<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.859> with<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.459> f<00:03:41.669> it<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.060> can<00:03:42.239> be

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
uggs and so with this f it you can be

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.819 
uggs and so with this f it you can be
stylish<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.200> definitely<00:03:44.040> comfortable<00:03:45.769> ok<00:03:46.769> so

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
stylish and definitely comfortable ok so

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.190 
stylish and definitely comfortable ok so
this<00:03:47.280> look<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.730> definitely<00:03:48.000> more<00:03:48.510> about<00:03:48.750> solo

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
this look is definitely more about solo

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.159 
this look is definitely more about solo

necklace<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:58.109> then<00:03:58.319> what<00:03:58.680> I've<00:03:58.829> done<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.220> sort

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
necklace and then what I've done to sort

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.050 
necklace and then what I've done to sort
of<00:03:59.780> differentiate<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.340> have<00:04:02.730> a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
of differentiate this is that I have a

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.789 
of differentiate this is that I have a
colored<00:04:05.090> tank<00:04:06.090> underneath<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:07.139> one<00:04:07.380> happens

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
colored tank underneath this one happens

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.069 
colored tank underneath this one happens
to<00:04:07.889> be<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.099> dark<00:04:08.340> purple<00:04:08.880> which<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.900> thought

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
to be a dark purple which I thought

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.080 
to be a dark purple which I thought
would<00:04:10.230> be<00:04:10.290> good<00:04:10.470> because<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.829> kind<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.160> blends

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
would be good because it kind of blends

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.080 
would be good because it kind of blends
in<00:04:12.389> but<00:04:12.930> not<00:04:13.109> too<00:04:13.319> much<00:04:13.349> so<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:14.010> goes<00:04:14.250> more

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
in but not too much so it goes more

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.750 
in but not too much so it goes more
streamlined<00:04:15.989> but<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.530> can<00:04:16.709> pick<00:04:17.070> any<00:04:17.310> color

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
streamlined but you can pick any color

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.870 
streamlined but you can pick any color
you<00:04:18.299> want<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.979> I<00:04:19.979> just<00:04:20.190> think<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:20.519> is<00:04:20.579> cool

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
you want and I just think this is cool

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.640 
you want and I just think this is cool
because<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.419> gives<00:04:21.450> it<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.780> really<00:04:21.989> like<00:04:22.440> oh

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
because it gives it a really like oh

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.240 
because it gives it a really like oh
yeah<00:04:22.950> I'm

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
it's the same skirt and shirt but I

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.350 
it's the same skirt and shirt but I
chopped<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.820> with<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:46.610> jacket<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:48.060> what<00:04:48.330> I

chopped it with this jacket and what I

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.620 
chopped it with this jacket and what I
really<00:04:48.750> like<00:04:48.960> about<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:50.040> way<00:04:50.190> it's<00:04:50.630> tailored

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
really like about the way it's tailored

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.880 
really like about the way it's tailored
is<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:53.150> cinches<00:04:54.150> in<00:04:54.360> so<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:55.170> flatters

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
is that it cinches in so it flatters

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.350 
is that it cinches in so it flatters
your<00:04:56.070> figure<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.610> then<00:04:58.760> or<00:04:59.760> at<00:04:59.940> least<00:04:59.970> it

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
your figure and then or at least it

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.940 
your figure and then or at least it
looks<00:05:00.660> like<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.990> on<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.200> cameras<00:05:01.560> making<00:05:01.770> it

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
looks like it on the cameras making it

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.710 
looks like it on the cameras making it
work<00:05:02.130> but<00:05:02.490> then<00:05:02.730> I<00:05:02.760> topped<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.180> with<00:05:03.240> scarf

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720

work but then I topped it with scarf
which<00:05:03.870> ever<00:05:04.020> like<00:05:04.260> because<00:05:04.350> it's<00:05:04.820> wild<00:05:05.820> with

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
which ever like because it's wild with

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.700 
which ever like because it's wild with
the<00:05:06.000> pattern<00:05:06.419> but<00:05:06.660> still<00:05:06.930> black<00:05:07.140> and<00:05:07.169> white<00:05:07.500> so

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
the pattern but still black and white so

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.130
