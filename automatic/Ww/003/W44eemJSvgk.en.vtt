00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960
 this is the sack orchard technique 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.500
 shaped pillow bag 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 pitch we can have several plants of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.180
 vegetables in a single bag in a 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.480
 second floor on hard ground like you 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.480
 we call 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.000
 and in this way have our 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.360
 vegetables in our own house here 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.230
 on the second floor of a small sack of 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.980
 50 kilos that we have thrown substratum 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.020
 Padded substrate has approximately 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.480
 30 kilo of substrate 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.579
 and here how can you start Ricardo? 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.670
 has cooked 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.280
 he has been known with a rope of such 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.129
 way that has remained as a soul to 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.350
 our entourage and on the surface , 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.109
 we have said with a knife that we have 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.629
 made small holes in the shape of a cross 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.629
 to plant our lettuces like 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.720
 inhabit the lettuces we also have 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:10.119
 here you will water plants and here 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.580
 we have a caigua plant that goes to 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.600
 be a vine not the system of 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.299
 irrigation 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.450
 first it gets wet to substrate it fills 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.959
 moist of the substrate as you see 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:27.080
 this bag has a system of 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:29.390
 watering here we have made a hole 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.830
 and we 've put a bottle peak in 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.460
 this bottle peak is without a lid 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.230
 and above has a bottle of its lid 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.180
 of the bottle has a small hole 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.180
 to let the water pass 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.730
 in such a way that it will go dripping goes to 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.230
 go moistening all the substrate that 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.640
 is here in our entourage of this 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.130
 way our plants are going to go to 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:03.220
