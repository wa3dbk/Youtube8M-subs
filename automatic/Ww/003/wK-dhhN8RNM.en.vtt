00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
shoe like this and some differences

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.799 
shoe like this and some differences
there<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.880> let's<00:00:36.120> start<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.420> martial

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
there in so let's start with martial

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.100 
there in so let's start with martial
arts<00:00:37.050> shoe<00:00:37.260> right<00:00:37.530> away<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.239> opposed<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
arts shoe right away so as opposed to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.410 
arts shoe right away so as opposed to
regular<00:00:40.290> sneakers<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.129> martial<00:00:41.790> arts<00:00:41.969> shoe<00:00:42.149> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
regular sneakers a martial arts shoe is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.389 
regular sneakers a martial arts shoe is
concerned<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.230> conforming<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.070> foot

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
concerned with conforming to your foot

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.450 
concerned with conforming to your foot
so<00:00:45.090> people<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.750> naturally<00:00:46.379> wide<00:00:46.620> feet<00:00:47.010> tend

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so people with naturally wide feet tend

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.600 
so people with naturally wide feet tend
to<00:00:47.579> find<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.360> little<00:00:48.600> too<00:00:48.870> snug

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
to find these to be a little too snug

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.340 
to find these to be a little too snug
sometimes<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.789> enjoy<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.660> extra<00:00:51.930> support

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
sometimes they enjoy the extra support

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.720 
sometimes they enjoy the extra support
they<00:00:52.469> actually<00:00:52.829> didn't<00:00:53.039> realize<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.430> they

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
they actually didn't realize that they

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.000 
they actually didn't realize that they
should<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.870> sometimes<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
should have it but sometimes it's a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.670 
should have it but sometimes it's a
little<00:00:56.039> too<00:00:56.430> snug<00:00:56.539> people<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:57.690> what<00:00:58.320> would

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
little too snug people with what would

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.790 
little too snug people with what would
be<00:00:58.770> considered<00:00:58.980> regular<00:00:59.670> or<00:00:59.820> typical<00:01:00.120> feet

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
be considered regular or typical feet

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.200 
be considered regular or typical feet
enjoy<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> way<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.280> curves<00:01:02.579> around<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
enjoy the way that curves around so the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.080 
enjoy the way that curves around so the
inside<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:04.229> soft<00:01:04.949> felt<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.519> material

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
inside is a very soft felt like material

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.870 
inside is a very soft felt like material
and<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.720> curves<00:01:06.990> down<00:01:07.290> into<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> soul<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and it curves down into the soul now the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
and it curves down into the soul now the
soul<00:01:09.180> itself<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.750> course<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> key<00:01:10.439> component

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
soul itself of course is a key component

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.000 
soul itself of course is a key component
as<00:01:11.220> opposed<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> regular<00:01:13.080> shoes<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.680> doesn't

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
as opposed to a regular shoes it doesn't

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.969 
as opposed to a regular shoes it doesn't
have<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.460> rigid<00:01:15.000> grooves<00:01:15.979> depending<00:01:16.979> on

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
have very rigid grooves depending on

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.530 
have very rigid grooves depending on
what<00:01:17.220> kind<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.670> shoes<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.939> looking<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.390> like

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
what kind of shoes you looking at like

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.999 
what kind of shoes you looking at like
hiking<00:01:18.720> shoes<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.259> which<00:01:19.350> might<00:01:19.560> dig<00:01:19.799> into

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
hiking shoes that which might dig into

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.300 
hiking shoes that which might dig into
mat<00:01:20.460> instead<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.990> has<00:01:22.140> contours<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.159> its

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
mat instead it has contours but its

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.420 
mat instead it has contours but its
overall<00:01:23.490> rather<00:01:24.360> smooth<00:01:24.990> now<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.250> not

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
overall rather smooth now it's not

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
overall rather smooth now it's not
completely<00:01:26.939> hard<00:01:27.360> rubber<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:28.500> that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
completely hard rubber because that

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
completely hard rubber because that
would<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.890> little<00:01:29.070> too<00:01:29.250> slick<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.880> there's<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
would be a little too slick so there's a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.719 
would be a little too slick so there's a
little<00:01:30.360> grip<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.990> traction<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.490> what

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
little grip and traction to it so what

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.730 
little grip and traction to it so what
you'll<00:01:32.880> find<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.049> attraction<00:01:34.560> for

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you'll find is that the attraction for

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.450 
you'll find is that the attraction for
spinning<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.520> kicking<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.740> it's<00:01:37.740> more<00:01:37.979> grippy

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
spinning and kicking is it's more grippy

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.880 
spinning and kicking is it's more grippy
than<00:01:38.759> regular<00:01:39.030> feet<00:01:39.540> however<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.530> not<00:01:40.590> as

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
than regular feet however it's not as

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.190 
than regular feet however it's not as
grippy<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.430> shoes<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.240> running<00:01:42.600> shoes<00:01:42.899> or

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
grippy as shoes like running shoes or

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.100 
grippy as shoes like running shoes or
hiking<00:01:43.799> boots<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:45.090> there's<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> combination

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
hiking boots so there's a combination

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.990 
hiking boots so there's a combination
there<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> knee<00:01:47.130> injury<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.670> ankle

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
there if you have a knee injury or ankle

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.700 
there if you have a knee injury or ankle
injury<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.450> should<00:01:48.600> be<00:01:48.659> very<00:01:48.780> careful<00:01:48.899> when

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
injury you should be very careful when

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.139 
injury you should be very careful when
using<00:01:49.860> something<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.759> because<00:01:50.970> you're

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
using something like this because you're

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.630 
using something like this because you're
