00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.109
 and 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.570
 Welcome to cooking step by step 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.180
 today we're going to prepare homemade flan flan 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.180
 home 10 minutes because it only takes 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.369
 10 minutes of the cooking time of the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.910
 8 tablespoons of sugar we will use 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.560
 4 to make the candy and another 4 to 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.790
 make flan 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.550
 then the first thing will be 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.460
 looking for a metallic mold and caramelize 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.150
 4 tablespoons of sugar we will put 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.920
 over the fire very shortly and once 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.469
 the sugar has melted 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.170
 let's spread the candy for everyone 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.170
 the edges and let's cool 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.860
 while the mold cools down we're going to 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.860
 beat the three eggs 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.090
 add the 4 tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.020
 add a teaspoon of essence 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.020
 vanilla 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.930
 we mix well 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.190
 and we are adding the three little by little 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.180
 milk glasses 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.869
 which are three small glasses or 600 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.869
 cubic centimeters 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.350
 let's put the mixture inside the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.350
 container with candy 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.130
 we cover it 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.210
 and inside the pressure cooker we are going to 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.210
 put 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.810
 a rag so that the mold is not in 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.070
 contact with the fund we will put about 23 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.070
 centimeters of water 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.490
 the container with the plan inside and 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.490
 we cover 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.680
 once the steam starts to come out 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.680
 we will cook for 10 minutes 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.330
 When the 10 minutes have passed 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.520
 we put out the fire we remove 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.440
 and let's finish cooking 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.440
 with the heat that remains inside the pot 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.690
 and once it's cold we're going to open already 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.690
 unmold the flan 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.420
 with the help of a plate we will give you the 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.420
 return 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.030
 and we have ready the homemade flan 10 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.030
 minutes 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.750
 greetings and until the next video
