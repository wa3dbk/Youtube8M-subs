00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
there yeah we have a primate

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.970 
there yeah we have a primate
in<00:00:35.630> its<00:00:35.870> natural<00:00:36.230> habitat<00:00:36.340> that<00:00:37.340> is<00:00:37.489> called

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
in its natural habitat that is called

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.610 
in its natural habitat that is called
gnaw<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.520> monkey<00:00:41.120> oshino<00:00:41.660> sure<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:45.500> be<00:00:45.590> very

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
gnaw the monkey oshino sure to be very

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:58.150 
gnaw the monkey oshino sure to be very
hostile<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:46.550> we<00:00:46.670> have<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:46.969> jump<00:00:57.039> captured<00:00:58.039> the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
hostile so we have to jump captured the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:12.230 
hostile so we have to jump captured the
primate<00:00:58.519> now<00:00:58.640> say<00:00:58.879> something<00:00:59.239> for<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.449> camera

of our fans in Malaysia we have found a
really<00:01:22.060> rare<00:01:22.240> specimen<00:01:22.810> that<00:01:23.110> can<00:01:23.320> transform

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
really rare specimen that can transform

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.810 
really rare specimen that can transform
itself<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.390> looks<00:01:25.630> check<00:01:26.259> it<00:01:26.380> out

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
itself and it looks check it out

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.650 
itself and it looks check it out
you<00:01:27.820> see<00:01:27.940> what<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:28.450> have<00:01:28.479> here<00:01:28.660> it's<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:30.130> not

childhood stage and what we found out I

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.950 
childhood stage and what we found out I
won't<00:01:41.950> we<00:01:42.070> found<00:01:42.280> out<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.640> after<00:01:43.300> it<00:01:43.479> it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
won't we found out that after it it

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.190 
won't we found out that after it it
grows<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.560> become<00:01:44.680> an<00:01:44.920> adult<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:46.240> mutates

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
grows to become an adult it mutates

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.350 
grows to become an adult it mutates
itself<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.860> stuff<00:01:48.070> like<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.430> this<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.330> the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.779 
itself and stuff like that this is the
first<00:01:49.600> mutation<00:01:49.960> stage<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:51.009> tree<00:01:51.250> moment

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
first mutation stage of the tree moment

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.550 
first mutation stage of the tree moment
the<00:01:51.850> three<00:01:52.060> month<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.600> gonna<00:01:52.869> get<00:01:53.050> like<00:01:53.350> that

time
all<00:01:56.950> right<00:01:57.160> now<00:01:57.399> we<00:01:57.460> have<00:01:57.729> yeah<00:01:57.970> you're<00:01:58.720> gonna

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
all right now we have yeah you're gonna

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.680 
all right now we have yeah you're gonna
grow<00:01:59.200> some<00:01:59.229> horns<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.580> two<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.869> inside

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
grow some horns and two on the inside

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.900 
grow some horns and two on the inside
some<00:02:04.690> wings<00:02:04.990> over<00:02:05.200> here<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:06.009> way<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.550> think

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
some wings over here the way I think

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.880 
some wings over here the way I think
this<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.420> what<00:02:07.720> they<00:02:07.899> reach<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.380> termite<00:02:08.679> you

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890

here right here this is the poisonous
part<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.390> double<00:02:14.170> creature<00:02:15.299> one<00:02:16.299> sting<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.350> go

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
part of double creature one sting you go

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.590 
part of double creature one sting you go
nine<00:02:17.799> in<00:02:18.010> one<00:02:18.190> second<00:02:19.080> all<00:02:20.080> right<00:02:20.140> this<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.799> a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
nine in one second all right this is a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.400 
nine in one second all right this is a
final<00:02:22.600> stage<00:02:23.140> stage<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.829> mutation<00:02:24.310> it's

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
final stage stage of the mutation it's

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.699 
final stage stage of the mutation it's
it<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.560> something<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.070> an<00:02:27.220> awesome<00:02:27.549> and<00:02:28.709> you

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
it of something like an awesome and you

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:42.170 
it of something like an awesome and you
know<00:02:29.890> its<00:02:30.100> mouth<00:02:30.489> becomes<00:02:30.910> solid<00:02:31.660> rock
