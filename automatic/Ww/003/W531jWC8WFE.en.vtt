album<00:03:32.680> because<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.520> hook<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.910> also

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
album because of the hook and also

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.450 
album because of the hook and also
because<00:03:34.750> yg<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.680> doesn't<00:03:35.950> bring<00:03:36.100> much<00:03:36.310> to

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
because yg just doesn't bring much to

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
interested in that I didn't think we

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.949 
interested in that I didn't think we
were<00:03:44.830> interested<00:03:45.190> in<00:03:45.490> this<00:03:45.700> one<00:03:46.450> of<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.750> more

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
were interested in this one of the more

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.870 
were interested in this one of the more
interesting<00:03:47.410> features<00:03:48.070> on<00:03:48.220> here<00:03:48.250> though<00:03:48.670> is

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
interesting features on here though is

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.660 
interesting features on here though is
shy<00:03:49.420> glizzy<00:03:49.660> on<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.380> track<00:03:50.650> gangsta<00:03:51.220> shit<00:03:51.430> and

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
shy glizzy on the track gangsta shit and

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.460 
shy glizzy on the track gangsta shit and
it's<00:03:52.000> not<00:03:52.150> interesting<00:03:52.780> because<00:03:52.930> his<00:03:53.230> verse

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
it's not interesting because his verse

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.140 
it's not interesting because his verse
is<00:03:53.650> really<00:03:53.920> good<00:03:54.130> or<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.550> song<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:55.000> really

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
is really good or the song is really

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.180 
is really good or the song is really
good<00:03:55.330> because<00:03:55.660> again<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.530> would<00:03:56.680> file<00:03:56.920> this

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
good because again you would file this

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.580 
good because again you would file this
one<00:03:57.430> under<00:03:57.640> dolt<00:03:58.360> but<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:58.959> just<00:03:59.050> think<00:03:59.260> shy

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
one under dolt but I just think shy

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.800 
one under dolt but I just think shy
glizzy<00:03:59.770> sounds<00:04:00.310> like<00:04:00.430> eazy-e<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.270> that<00:04:01.660> was

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
glizzy sounds like eazy-e so that was

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.130 
glizzy sounds like eazy-e so that was
kind<00:04:02.020> of<00:04:02.080> interesting<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:04.150> obviously<00:04:04.810> if

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
kind of interesting so obviously if

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.660 
kind of interesting so obviously if
you're<00:04:05.290> just<00:04:05.530> looking<00:04:05.680> for<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.220> couple<00:04:06.459> of

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
you're just looking for a couple of

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.640 
you're just looking for a couple of
bangers<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.300> think<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.870> might<00:04:08.020> like<00:04:08.080> some<00:04:08.320> of

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
bangers I think you might like some of

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.010 
bangers I think you might like some of
these<00:04:08.740> tracks<00:04:09.100> but<00:04:09.610> speaking<00:04:10.090> as<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.270> Jeezy<00:04:10.660> fan

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
these tracks but speaking as a Jeezy fan

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.260 
these tracks but speaking as a Jeezy fan
I<00:04:11.290> think<00:04:11.860> this<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.190> one<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.400> Jesus<00:04:12.940> worst

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
I think this is one of Jesus worst

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.099 
I think this is one of Jesus worst
mixtapes<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.170> all<00:04:14.709> time<00:04:15.550> a<00:04:16.060> couple<00:04:16.750> of<00:04:16.959> the

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
mixtapes of all time a couple of the

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.870 
mixtapes of all time a couple of the
songs<00:04:17.140> are<00:04:17.830> all<00:04:17.950> right<00:04:18.190> but<00:04:18.669> there's<00:04:18.820> just

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
songs are all right but there's just

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.510 
songs are all right but there's just
nothing<00:04:19.330> overly<00:04:19.660> memorable<00:04:20.410> or<00:04:20.620> interesting

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
nothing overly memorable or interesting
