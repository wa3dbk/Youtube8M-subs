explosion<00:00:09.650> so<00:00:10.650> here<00:00:10.830> we<00:00:10.860> go<00:00:10.950> let's<00:00:11.250> try<00:00:11.370> to

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
explosion so here we go let's try to

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.879 
explosion so here we go let's try to
crash<00:00:11.670> our<00:00:11.880> computer<00:00:12.590> when<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.650> give<00:00:13.740> some

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
crash our computer when you give some

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
statistics about this three the three

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.500 
statistics about this three the three
itself<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:17.760> layer<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.330> 3<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:19.070> 166<00:00:20.070> TNT<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.300> all

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
itself one layer of 3 is 166 TNT is all

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.689 
itself one layer of 3 is 166 TNT is all
the<00:00:21.630> zeros<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.609> 174<00:00:23.609> TNT<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:25.189> 174<00:00:26.189> times<00:00:26.369> 5

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the zeros are 174 TNT so 174 times 5

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.890 
the zeros are 174 TNT so 174 times 5
because<00:00:27.000> there's<00:00:27.150> 50<00:00:27.630> s<00:00:27.720> plus<00:00:28.010> 166<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.420> 1030<00:00:30.420> 60

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
because there's 50 s plus 166 is 1030 60

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.610 
because there's 50 s plus 166 is 1030 60
