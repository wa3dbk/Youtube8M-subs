but still works so as we got our
fluorescent<00:00:26.430> paint<00:00:27.029> she<00:00:27.960> gets<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.320> putting

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
fluorescent paint she gets for putting

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.950 
fluorescent paint she gets for putting
that<00:00:28.740> highlighter<00:00:29.250> ink<00:00:29.550> filament<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.359> water

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that highlighter ink filament in water

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.260 
that highlighter ink filament in water
and<00:00:31.260> squeezing<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.920> ink<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:32.430> I've<00:00:33.090> done

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and squeezing out the ink as I've done

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.400 
and squeezing out the ink as I've done
here<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.820> I'm<00:00:35.820> simply<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.809> glow<00:00:37.020> just

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
here and I'm simply to make it glow just

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
top layer if the water glows very

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.170 
top layer if the water glows very
brightly<00:00:49.710> seamless<00:00:50.610> if<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.789> put<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.090> from<00:00:51.300> that

yeah you can see that there's a bright
green<00:00:59.160> line<00:00:59.520> around<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.090> top<00:01:00.739> same<00:01:01.739> thing

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
green line around the top same thing

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.940 
green line around the top same thing
happens<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.609> put<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.940> from<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> bottom

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
if I put the light at the side by the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.960 
if I put the light at the side by the
back<00:01:36.610> very<00:01:37.479> intense<00:01:37.930> light<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:39.460> can<00:01:39.610> see<00:01:39.820> that

right and their life is like I said the
camera<00:01:48.549> distorts<00:01:48.759> a<00:01:49.149> lot<00:01:49.299> of<00:01:49.450> this<00:01:49.659> but<00:01:49.960> it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
camera distorts a lot of this but it

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.399 
camera distorts a lot of this but it
will<00:01:50.649> glow<00:01:50.890> similar<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:52.780> we're<00:01:52.960> also<00:01:53.080> going

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
will glow similar now we're also going

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.770 
will glow similar now we're also going
to<00:01:53.500> show<00:01:53.799> you<00:01:54.780> how<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.810> make<00:01:56.049> imitation

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
to show you how to make imitation

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.719 
to show you how to make imitation
ultraviolet<00:01:58.780> light<00:01:59.200> simply<00:01:59.679> on<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.549> light

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
ultraviolet light simply on the light

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.770 
ultraviolet light simply on the light
scale<00:02:01.149> for<00:02:01.649> frequency<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:02.920> wavelength<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
scale for frequency and wavelength the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.840 
scale for frequency and wavelength the
violet<00:02:05.289> light<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.709> right<00:02:05.890> under<00:02:06.220> ultraviolet

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
violet light is right under ultraviolet

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.539 
violet light is right under ultraviolet
so<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.869> blues<00:02:08.110> under<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:08.920> if<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.190> have<00:02:09.340> a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
so and blues under that so if you have a

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.759 
so and blues under that so if you have a
strong<00:02:09.940> blue<00:02:10.269> light<00:02:10.569> or<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.929> strong<00:02:11.319> purple

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
strong blue light or a strong purple

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.809 
strong blue light or a strong purple
light<00:02:12.390> will<00:02:13.390> make<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.690> glow<00:02:13.840> on<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.440> laser

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
light will make it glow on this laser

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.360 
light will make it glow on this laser
sculpture<00:02:15.819> thing<00:02:16.060> show<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:17.370> colors

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
sculpture thing show you that colors

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.250 
sculpture thing show you that colors
that<00:02:18.519> make<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.819> glow<00:02:19.030> quite<00:02:19.330> intensely<00:02:19.959> are

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
that make it glow quite intensely are

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.680 
that make it glow quite intensely are
the<00:02:20.410> ones<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.769> are<00:02:21.069> bluish<00:02:21.910> purple<00:02:22.360> like

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
the light is sort of making like a it's

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.740 
the light is sort of making like a it's
or<00:02:33.099> like<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> haze<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> middle<00:02:34.330> that's<00:02:34.540> not
