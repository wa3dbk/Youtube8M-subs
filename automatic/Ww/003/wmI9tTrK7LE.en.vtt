00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
before I start I just want to mention

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
before I start I just want to mention
the<00:00:53.579> reason<00:00:53.940> they're<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> 532<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.230> not

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the reason they're in a 532 is not

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.020 
the reason they're in a 532 is not
because<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> play<00:00:56.370> sweaty<00:00:56.699> it's

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
because I want to play sweaty it's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.090 
because I want to play sweaty it's
because<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> only<00:00:58.140> formation<00:00:58.980> that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
because it's the only formation that

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.310 
because it's the only formation that
actually<00:00:59.370> gets<00:00:59.489> me<00:00:59.699> full<00:01:00.090> chemistry<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
actually gets me full chemistry with the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
actually gets me full chemistry with the
players<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.890> wanted<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> use<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.090> it's

players I wanted to use in it and it's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.080 
players I wanted to use in it and it's
basically<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.920> 352<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.159> no<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.760> has<00:01:05.939> any

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
basically a 352 and no one has any

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 
basically a 352 and no one has any
problems<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:07.320> that's<00:01:07.590> happened

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
problems with that all that's happened

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.260 
problems with that all that's happened
is<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.520> wing<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> left<00:01:09.090> wing

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
is it's the right wing and the left wing

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
is it's the right wing and the left wing
back<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.630> drop<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.950> dropped<00:01:11.220> from<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
back of drop of just dropped from the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.550 
back of drop of just dropped from the
right<00:01:11.670> mid<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.060> left<00:01:12.240> mid<00:01:12.420> position<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.020> we

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
right mid and left mid position and we

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.249 
right mid and left mid position and we
don't<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.189> cam<00:01:14.549> instead<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.600> three

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
don't have a cam instead we have three

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.350 
don't have a cam instead we have three
centimeters<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.520> DM<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.180> I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
centimeters and we don't have DM so I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240 
centimeters and we don't have DM so I
think<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.380> sort<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> fair<00:01:19.860> balance

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
think that it's a sort of fair balance

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.770 
think that it's a sort of fair balance
because<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.640> no<00:01:20.759> longer<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.210> those<00:01:21.390> really

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
because we no longer have those really

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.429 
because we no longer have those really
defensive<00:01:22.439> midfielders<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> team<00:01:23.689> but<00:01:24.689> we

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
defensive midfielders in the team but we

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.100 
defensive midfielders in the team but we
obviously<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.250> more<00:01:26.670> defenders<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
obviously do have more defenders as the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.450 
obviously do have more defenders as the
players<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.740> sitting<00:01:29.009> back<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
players that is sitting back but the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.010 
players that is sitting back but the
players<00:01:29.670> i'm<00:01:29.820> using<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.180> anyway<00:01:30.570> aren't

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
players i'm using that anyway aren't

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.719 
players i'm using that anyway aren't
particularly<00:01:31.530> defensive<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.430> they're<00:01:32.579> more

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
particularly defensive so they're more

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
particularly defensive so they're more
like<00:01:32.909> right<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.689> left<00:01:33.840> midfielders<00:01:34.350> anyway

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
like right and left midfielders anyway

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.920 
like right and left midfielders anyway
so<00:01:35.369> let's<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.820> look<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.000> Iniesta<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.780> his

unfortunately<00:02:59.440> here's<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.769> little<00:02:59.980> bit<00:03:00.100> weaker

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
unfortunately here's a little bit weaker

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.670 
unfortunately here's a little bit weaker
i<00:03:00.670> mean<00:03:00.819> if<00:03:00.940> we<00:03:01.030> look<00:03:01.209> at<00:03:01.360> his<00:03:01.870> strength<00:03:02.530> he

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
i mean if we look at his strength he

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.500 
i mean if we look at his strength he
only<00:03:02.830> has<00:03:03.040> 65<00:03:03.670> which<00:03:03.910> really<00:03:04.120> does<00:03:04.330> i<00:03:04.480> think

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
only has 65 which really does i think

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.770 
only has 65 which really does i think

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.500 
vision of 93 so some unbelievable stats

so what can i say about any yester I
think<00:03:31.870> he's<00:03:32.019> an<00:03:32.170> excellent<00:03:32.560> player<00:03:32.890> I

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
think he's an excellent player I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.509 
think he's an excellent player I
personally<00:03:34.090> enjoyed<00:03:34.600> playing<00:03:34.959> with<00:03:35.109> him<00:03:35.519> he

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
personally enjoyed playing with him he

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.210 
personally enjoyed playing with him he
is<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.760> best<00:03:37.209> of<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.540> three<00:03:38.220> sentiments

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
is the best of the three sentiments

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.270 
is the best of the three sentiments
without<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> doubt<00:03:40.739> probably<00:03:41.739> warrants<00:03:42.160> his

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
without a doubt probably warrants his

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.039 
without a doubt probably warrants his
price<00:03:42.549> tag<00:03:42.910> especially<00:03:43.450> since<00:03:43.660> he's<00:03:43.840> been

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
price tag especially since he's been

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.110 
price tag especially since he's been
moved<00:03:44.380> from<00:03:44.500> left<00:03:44.890> wing<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.579> a<00:03:45.609> central

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
moved from left wing to a central

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.240 
moved from left wing to a central
position<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.410> means<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.680> loads<00:03:48.100> of

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
position and it means that loads of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.500 
position and it means that loads of
people<00:03:48.370> going<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.790> be<00:03:48.850> able<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.120> put<00:03:49.239> him<00:03:49.390> into

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
people going to be able to put him into

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.699 
people going to be able to put him into
teams<00:03:49.810> they<00:03:50.019> wouldn't<00:03:50.230> have<00:03:50.320> otherwise<00:03:50.410> been

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
teams they wouldn't have otherwise been

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.500 
teams they wouldn't have otherwise been
putting<00:03:51.280> him<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.519> because<00:03:51.850> obviously<00:03:52.060> out<00:03:52.359> on

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
putting him in because obviously out on

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.360 
putting him in because obviously out on
left<00:03:52.690> wing<00:03:52.780> he<00:03:53.019> has<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.380> likes<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:53.739> Ronaldo<00:03:54.310> to

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
left wing he has the likes of Ronaldo to

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.220 
left wing he has the likes of Ronaldo to
be<00:03:54.549> competing<00:03:54.820> with<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.209> people<00:03:55.840> are<00:03:56.109> going

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
be competing with and people are going

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.720 
be competing with and people are going
to<00:03:56.320> choosing<00:03:56.530> yes<00:03:56.829> storeever<00:03:57.190> an<00:03:57.340> outer<00:03:57.489> are

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
to choosing yes storeever an outer are

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.199 
to choosing yes storeever an outer are
they<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:58.329> be<00:03:58.450> honest<00:03:58.750> so<00:03:59.489> what<00:04:00.489> would<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:00.700> say<00:04:00.730> r

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
they to be honest so what would I say r

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.470 
they to be honest so what would I say r
is<00:04:01.329> sort<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.600> negatives

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
is sort of negatives

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.209 
is sort of negatives
it's<00:04:04.480> hard<00:04:04.780> it's<00:04:04.989> like<00:04:05.230> I'd<00:04:05.650> say<00:04:05.859> the<00:04:06.010> pace

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:06.219 
it's hard it's like I'd say the pace

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.399 
it's hard it's like I'd say the pace
obviously<00:04:06.879> 79<00:04:07.299> pays<00:04:07.569> for<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.840> midfielder<00:04:08.290> is

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
obviously 79 pays for a midfielder is

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.039 
obviously 79 pays for a midfielder is
very<00:04:08.590> good<00:04:08.859> but<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.879> pace<00:04:10.120> coupled<00:04:10.840> with<00:04:10.900> the

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
very good but the pace coupled with the

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.020 
very good but the pace coupled with the
fact<00:04:11.079> he's<00:04:11.469> not<00:04:11.620> very<00:04:11.769> strong<00:04:12.010> means<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.879> he

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
fact he's not very strong means that he

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.910 
fact he's not very strong means that he
quite<00:04:13.269> often<00:04:13.450> gets<00:04:13.689> muscled<00:04:14.109> off<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.290> ball<00:04:14.500> he

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
quite often gets muscled off the ball he

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.300 
quite often gets muscled off the ball he
can't<00:04:15.219> escape<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:16.289> defenders<00:04:17.289> outrun<00:04:18.009> them<00:04:18.190> and

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
can't escape a defenders outrun them and

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.430 
can't escape a defenders outrun them and
stuff<00:04:18.489> like<00:04:18.639> that<00:04:18.699> and<00:04:18.970> he<00:04:19.690> can't<00:04:20.019> push<00:04:20.289> them

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
stuff like that and he can't push them

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.960 
stuff like that and he can't push them
off<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:20.859> you're<00:04:21.009> solving<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.370> horrible<00:04:21.759> middle

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
off so you're solving a horrible middle

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.189 
off so you're solving a horrible middle
of<00:04:22.060> middle<00:04:22.270> ground<00:04:22.300> where<00:04:22.630> he<00:04:22.750> can't<00:04:22.990> do

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
of middle ground where he can't do

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.950 
of middle ground where he can't do
either<00:04:23.470> so<00:04:24.250> usually<00:04:24.699> loses<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.360> ball<00:04:25.509> if<00:04:25.750> your

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
either so usually loses the ball if your

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.600 
either so usually loses the ball if your
shoulders<00:04:26.620> shoulder<00:04:26.919> with<00:04:27.039> a<00:04:27.070> defender

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
shoulders shoulder with a defender

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.790 
shoulders shoulder with a defender
however<00:04:28.509> you<00:04:28.900> know<00:04:28.990> saying<00:04:29.289> that<00:04:29.530> his

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
however you know saying that his

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.920 
however you know saying that his
dribbling<00:04:30.160> is<00:04:30.310> amazing<00:04:30.820> as<00:04:31.060> long<00:04:31.330> as<00:04:31.479> you<00:04:31.750> have

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
dribbling moves within go past defenders

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.850 
dribbling moves within go past defenders
that<00:04:37.539> way<00:04:37.690> as<00:04:38.020> long<00:04:38.080> as<00:04:38.259> they<00:04:38.380> don't<00:04:38.470> look<00:04:38.680> on

very good but I was disappointed at
times<00:04:47.289> especially<00:04:47.440> when<00:04:47.830> he<00:04:48.009> was<00:04:48.039> playing

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
times especially when he was playing

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.370 
times especially when he was playing
balls<00:04:48.669> out<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:48.940> left<00:04:49.210> wingback<00:04:49.990> right

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
balls out to left wingback right

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.129 
balls out to left wingback right
wing-back<00:04:50.650> as<00:04:51.550> they<00:04:51.759> bomb<00:04:52.030> past<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.720> midfield

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
wing-back as they bomb past the midfield

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.279 
wing-back as they bomb past the midfield
and<00:04:53.380> that<00:04:53.889> was<00:04:54.130> sort<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.210> fact<00:04:55.539> that<00:04:55.840> he

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
and that was sort of the fact that he

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.310 
and that was sort of the fact that he
would<00:04:56.740> over<00:04:57.099> hit<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.550> lot<00:04:57.970> a<00:04:58.210> lot<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.930> times<00:04:59.139> he

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
would over hit it and it would just go

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.610 
would over hit it and it would just go
out<00:05:01.030> when<00:05:01.270> you<00:05:01.360> just<00:05:01.570> like<00:05:01.720> oh<00:05:01.990> why<00:05:02.320> can't<00:05:02.380> you

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
finish especially his finesse shot

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.870 
finish especially his finesse shot
that's<00:05:28.900> one<00:05:29.110> thing<00:05:29.139> I<00:05:29.409> noticed<00:05:29.830> like<00:05:29.919> they

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
that's one thing I noticed like they

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.700 
that's one thing I noticed like they
remind<00:05:31.300> me<00:05:31.419> of<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.750> finish<00:05:32.139> shots<00:05:32.409> that<00:05:32.590> you

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
remind me of the finish shots that you

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.710 
remind me of the finish shots that you
get<00:05:32.919> out<00:05:33.039> of<00:05:33.070> a<00:05:33.250> lot<00:05:33.400> of<00:05:33.520> players<00:05:33.729> on<00:05:34.000> fifa<00:05:34.389> 12

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
get out of a lot of players on fifa 12

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.140 
get out of a lot of players on fifa 12
because<00:05:35.289> if<00:05:35.770> you<00:05:36.009> remember<00:05:36.250> fifa<00:05:36.699> 12<00:05:36.940> had

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
because if you remember fifa 12 had

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.390 
because if you remember fifa 12 had
overpowered<00:05:37.690> finesse<00:05:38.229> shot<00:05:38.259> and<00:05:38.680> but<00:05:39.310> they

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
overpowered finesse shot and but they

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.430 
overpowered finesse shot and but they
obviously<00:05:39.520> depowered<00:05:40.240> them<00:05:40.419> for<00:05:40.570> fifa<00:05:40.810> 13<00:05:40.840> and

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
obviously depowered them for fifa 13 and

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.589 
obviously depowered them for fifa 13 and
it<00:05:42.039> seems<00:05:42.310> that<00:05:42.400> Iniesta<00:05:43.060> is<00:05:43.180> like<00:05:43.300> one<00:05:43.449> of<00:05:43.479> the

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
it seems that Iniesta is like one of the

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:44.999 
it seems that Iniesta is like one of the
only<00:05:43.659> players<00:05:44.020> that<00:05:44.259> still<00:05:44.440> has<00:05:44.620> a<00:05:44.650> really

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
only players that still has a really

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.890 
only players that still has a really
good<00:05:45.130> finish<00:05:45.550> shot<00:05:45.789> he<00:05:46.150> sort<00:05:46.389> of<00:05:46.449> gets<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.810> off

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
good finish shot he sort of gets it off

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.839 
good finish shot he sort of gets it off
the<00:05:47.020> ground<00:05:47.199> quickly<00:05:47.530> cuz<00:05:47.979> it<00:05:48.250> loads<00:05:48.520> of<00:05:48.639> coal

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
the ground quickly cuz it loads of coal

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.999 
the ground quickly cuz it loads of coal
into<00:05:49.330> top<00:05:49.720> corner<00:05:50.050> of<00:05:50.110> the<00:05:50.199> goal<00:05:50.349> over<00:05:50.889> and
