the end I decided that I wanted to keep

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.609 
the end I decided that I wanted to keep
the<00:01:32.020> lining<00:01:32.649> of<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:33.009> jacket<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.840> my<00:01:35.140> sleeves

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
the lining of the jacket for my sleeves

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.169 
the lining of the jacket for my sleeves
and<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.159> sweatshirt<00:01:36.729> so<00:01:37.329> I<00:01:37.360> am<00:01:37.719> now<00:01:37.989> on<00:01:38.739> the

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
and the sweatshirt so I am now on the

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.380 
and the sweatshirt so I am now on the
inside<00:01:40.179> of<00:01:40.599> my<00:01:41.020> jacket<00:01:41.759> removing<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:43.000> thread

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
inside of my jacket removing the thread

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.999 
inside of my jacket removing the thread
for<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:45.390> lining<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.659> this<00:01:47.289> is<00:01:47.619> probably

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
for the lining and this is probably

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.050 
for the lining and this is probably
where<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.909> want<00:01:49.119> to<00:01:49.270> pay<00:01:49.509> most<00:01:50.439> attention

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
where you want to pay most attention

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.569 
where you want to pay most attention
