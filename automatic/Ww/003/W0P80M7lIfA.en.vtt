some but they definitely have this knife
oiled<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.209> but<00:02:50.510> that's<00:02:50.810> good<00:02:51.189> how<00:02:52.189> it<00:02:52.340> features

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
oiled up but that's good how it features

blade let's see what number this is this

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.780 
blade let's see what number this is this
is<00:02:59.090> number<00:02:59.500> 806<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.739> thousand<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.579> first

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
is number 806 of a thousand of the first

production run so you know even though

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.940 
production run so you know even though
it's<00:03:05.450> not<00:03:05.569> the<00:03:05.689> first<00:03:05.900> production<00:03:06.079> run<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.620> plan

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it's not the first production run I plan

on using this knife I bought it to use
let's<00:03:11.720> just<00:03:11.810> run<00:03:12.109> through<00:03:12.139> the<00:03:12.409> other<00:03:12.560> tech

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
let's just run through the other tech

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.949 
let's just run through the other tech
specs<00:03:13.069> real<00:03:13.310> quick<00:03:13.549> before<00:03:13.939> we<00:03:14.239> keep<00:03:14.810> looking

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
specs real quick before we keep looking

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.710 
on here can be put on either side and
it's<00:03:30.769> definitely<00:03:31.159> for<00:03:31.459> deep<00:03:31.639> carry<00:03:32.000> that's

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
it's definitely for deep carry that's

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.750 
it's definitely for deep carry that's
one<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:33.049> my<00:03:33.109> big<00:03:33.319> gripes<00:03:33.620> about<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:34.220> benchmade

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
one of my big gripes about the benchmade

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.720 
one of my big gripes about the benchmade
griptilian<00:03:35.180> in<00:03:35.569> comparison<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:37.459> got<00:03:37.700> a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
griptilian in comparison is it's got a

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.309 
griptilian in comparison is it's got a
lot<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:40.060> nub<00:03:41.060> sticking<00:03:41.359> out<00:03:41.780> let's<00:03:42.079> say<00:03:42.290> our

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
lot of nub sticking out let's say our

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.110 
lot of nub sticking out let's say our
handle<00:03:42.859> sticking<00:03:43.069> out<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:43.400> your<00:03:43.430> pocket<00:03:43.639> so

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
handle sticking out of your pocket so

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.879 
handle sticking out of your pocket so
this<00:03:44.359> is<00:03:44.480> definitely<00:03:44.689> deep<00:03:45.169> carry<00:03:45.470> compared

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
this is definitely deep carry compared

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.119 
this is definitely deep carry compared
to<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.129> the<00:03:46.790> 154cm<00:03:47.599> is<00:03:48.199> pretty<00:03:48.409> standard<00:03:48.739> for

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
to that the 154cm is pretty standard for

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.800 
to that the 154cm is pretty standard for

a<00:04:06.139> weight<00:04:06.409> on<00:04:06.620> their<00:04:06.859> website<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:07.819> you<00:04:08.829> know

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
a weight on their website so you know

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.559 
a weight on their website so you know
i'll<00:04:10.069> probably<00:04:10.519> i'll<00:04:10.819> probably<00:04:11.120> go<00:04:11.389> get<00:04:11.510> a

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
i'll probably i'll probably go get a

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.270 
i'll probably i'll probably go get a
scale<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.079> wait<00:04:12.199> here<00:04:12.229> real<00:04:12.739> quick<00:04:12.949> so<00:04:13.159> I'll

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
scale and wait here real quick so I'll

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.469 
scale and wait here real quick so I'll
just<00:04:13.340> be<00:04:13.609> right<00:04:13.639> back<00:04:15.489> alright<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:16.970> we're<00:04:17.329> back

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
just be right back alright so we're back

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.569 
just be right back alright so we're back
and<00:04:17.900> guess<00:04:18.139> what<00:04:18.289> you<00:04:18.709> can<00:04:18.859> see<00:04:19.010> on<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.310> scale

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
and guess what you can see on the scale

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.729 
and guess what you can see on the scale
there<00:04:19.849> that's<00:04:20.090> four<00:04:20.449> point<00:04:20.750> eight<00:04:20.870> ounces<00:04:21.349> so

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
there that's four point eight ounces so

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.589 
there that's four point eight ounces so
just<00:04:22.099> to<00:04:22.190> compare<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.699> the<00:04:22.849> benchmade<00:04:23.240> real

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
just to compare it to the benchmade real

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:29.200 
just to compare it to the benchmade real
quick<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:26.360> bench<00:04:26.570> May<00:04:26.780> griptilian<00:04:27.740> is<00:04:28.210> 3.8

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
quick the bench May griptilian is 3.8

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.969 
quick the bench May griptilian is 3.8
ounces<00:04:29.389> so<00:04:29.870> it's<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.169> little<00:04:30.199> heavier<00:04:30.650> but

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
ounces so it's a little heavier but

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.850 
ounces so it's a little heavier but
that's<00:04:31.159> okay<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:32.570> still<00:04:32.810> an<00:04:32.960> awesome<00:04:33.080> knife

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.350 

that's<00:04:36.860> pretty<00:04:37.039> much<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.310> taps<00:04:37.699> tech<00:04:38.030> specs

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
that's pretty much the taps tech specs

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.219 
that's pretty much the taps tech specs
so<00:04:38.870> let's<00:04:39.259> go<00:04:39.470> over<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.310> rest<00:04:40.550> of<00:04:40.699> the<00:04:40.759> knife<00:04:40.940> I

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
so let's go over the rest of the knife I

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.360 
so let's go over the rest of the knife I
said<00:04:42.229> already<00:04:42.590> it's<00:04:42.770> got<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.009> nice<00:04:43.159> high

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
said already it's got the nice high

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.700 
said already it's got the nice high
pocket<00:04:43.789> clip<00:04:43.940> it's<00:04:44.630> got<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:44.990> flipper<00:04:45.259> on<00:04:45.530> it

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
pocket clip it's got the flipper on it

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.529 
pocket clip it's got the flipper on it
for<00:04:46.039> fast<00:04:46.280> deployment<00:04:46.669> although<00:04:47.330> if<00:04:47.449> you're

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
reading off my notes here blade play we

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.440 
reading off my notes here blade play we
went<00:05:14.930> over<00:05:15.050> that<00:05:15.260> there's<00:05:15.530> barely<00:05:15.800> any<00:05:16.070> uh<00:05:16.450> you

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
went over that there's barely any uh you

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.420 
went over that there's barely any uh you
know<00:05:17.600> what<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:18.140> might<00:05:18.470> be<00:05:18.740> just<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.100> tad

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
know what it might be just the tad

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.100 
know what it might be just the tad
smaller<00:05:19.970> than<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.390> grip<00:05:20.570> tell<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:20.990> I'm

smaller than the grip tell you and I'm

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.060 
smaller than the grip tell you and I'm
thinking<00:05:21.700> and<00:05:22.700> it<00:05:23.600> is<00:05:23.750> just<00:05:24.110> by<00:05:24.260> a<00:05:24.290> hair<00:05:24.380> so

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
thinking and it is just by a hair so

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.660

there you go I might like that a little

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.100 
there you go I might like that a little
longer<00:05:32.000> but<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.360> know<00:05:32.510> what<00:05:32.720> for<00:05:32.930> all
