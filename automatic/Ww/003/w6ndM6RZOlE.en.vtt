00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.930 

all<00:03:11.420> right<00:03:11.600> so<00:03:11.930> that's<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.290> for<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.530> chorus

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
all right so that's it for the chorus

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.839 
all right so that's it for the chorus
then<00:03:13.940> we<00:03:14.120> go<00:03:14.270> back<00:03:14.510> into<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.200> intro

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.289 

and<00:03:19.939> then<00:03:20.780> when<00:03:20.930> we<00:03:21.019> go<00:03:21.109> into<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.409> verse<00:03:22.299> same

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
and then when we go into the verse same

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.399 
and then when we go into the verse same
thing<00:03:23.480> we<00:03:23.629> were<00:03:23.719> doing<00:03:23.749> before<00:03:23.989> with<00:03:24.319> the

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
thing we were doing before with the

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:31.750 
thing we were doing before with the
octaves

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.309 

all<00:03:32.299> right<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.629> then<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.840> goes<00:03:32.959> right<00:03:33.170> back

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
all right and then it goes right back

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.449 
all right and then it goes right back
into<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.530> course<00:03:33.769> which<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.010> already<00:03:34.340> know

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
into the course which you already know

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.830 
into the course which you already know
it's<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.970> same<00:03:35.150> chords<00:03:36.939> okay<00:03:37.939> now<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:38.689> only

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
it's the same chords okay now the only

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.119 
it's the same chords okay now the only
thing<00:03:39.049> that's<00:03:39.230> different<00:03:39.290> here<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:39.950> we're

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
thing that's different here is we're

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.890 
thing that's different here is we're
going<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.280> add<00:03:40.489> octaves<00:03:41.360> again<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.750> give<00:03:41.870> a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
going to add octaves again to give a

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.410 
going to add octaves again to give a
little<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:43.480> little<00:03:44.480> more<00:03:44.629> depth<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:46.420> don't

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
little a little more depth so I don't

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.009 
little a little more depth so I don't
want<00:03:47.629> to<00:03:48.379> play<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.829> triplet<00:03:49.280> rhythm<00:03:50.019> down

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
want to play the triplet rhythm down

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.600 
want to play the triplet rhythm down
here<00:03:51.349> in<00:03:51.440> this<00:03:51.530> low<00:03:51.769> octave<00:03:52.190> because<00:03:52.459> then

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
here in this low octave because then

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.110 
here in this low octave because then
it's<00:03:52.760> going<00:03:52.879> to<00:03:52.940> sound<00:03:53.150> muddy<00:03:54.849> so<00:03:55.849> what<00:03:56.030> I'm

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
it's going to sound muddy so what I'm

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.780 
it's going to sound muddy so what I'm
going<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.269> do<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.720> play<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:59.030> whole<00:03:59.470> octave<00:04:00.470> and

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
going to do is play the whole octave and

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.199 
going to do is play the whole octave and
then<00:04:01.790> keep<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.239> rhythm<00:04:02.450> with<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.230> upper<00:04:03.560> note

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
then keep the rhythm with the upper note

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:13.870 
then keep the rhythm with the upper note
okay<00:04:05.209> so

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.730 

so<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.630> still<00:04:14.840> gives<00:04:15.050> you<00:04:15.140> that<00:04:15.290> feel<00:04:15.590> of

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
so that still gives you that feel of

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.740 
so that still gives you that feel of
that<00:04:15.860> base<00:04:16.240> driving

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
that base driving

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:34.990 
that base driving
without<00:04:19.380> getting<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.860> money

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.119 

okay<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.720> then<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.050> takes<00:04:37.200> us<00:04:37.440> into

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.320
