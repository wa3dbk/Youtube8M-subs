00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
have a couple of tree and this is a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.179 
have a couple of tree and this is a
softer<00:01:15.090> tree<00:01:15.420> also<00:01:15.960> known<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> canopy<00:01:17.040> of

softer tree also known as the canopy of
the<00:01:17.220> tree<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.659> look<00:01:18.840> closely<00:01:19.110> here<00:01:19.590> we

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the tree and if you look closely here we

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.679 
the tree and if you look closely here we
have<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> bunch<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.610> these<00:01:20.759> top<00:01:21.090> fruits<00:01:21.390> growing

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
have a bunch of these top fruits growing

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.350 
have a bunch of these top fruits growing
right<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.439> tree<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:23.400> star<00:01:23.790> fruit<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.180> very

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
right on the tree now star fruit is very

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.990 
right on the tree now star fruit is very
similar<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.869> melon<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> water

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
similar to a melon in the in the water

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.390 
similar to a melon in the in the water
content<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.500> digestibility<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
content of it and the digestibility of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.810 
content of it and the digestibility of
it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.640 
it
so<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> fruit<00:01:31.020> right<00:01:31.290> off<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so there it is a fruit right off the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.380 
so there it is a fruit right off the
tree<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.549> reason<00:01:32.790> why<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:32.970> call<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
tree and the reason why they call this a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.999 
tree and the reason why they call this a
star<00:01:33.659> fruit<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.170> cut<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
star fruit is when you cut it it is the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.990 
star fruit is when you cut it it is the
shape<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.729> star<00:01:36.290> pretty<00:01:37.290> pretty<00:01:37.829> amazing

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
shape of a star pretty pretty amazing

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.520 
shape of a star pretty pretty amazing
and<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.600> our<00:01:39.630> garden<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.380> with
