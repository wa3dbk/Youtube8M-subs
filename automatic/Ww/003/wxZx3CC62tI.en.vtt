00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
make sure when you're doing this that

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.949 
make sure when you're doing this that
you're<00:02:26.240> coding<00:02:26.690> everything<00:02:28.540> nicely<00:02:29.540> and

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
you're coding everything nicely and

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.960 
you're coding everything nicely and
evenly<00:02:30.140> because<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.830> will<00:02:31.010> not<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.520> baking

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
evenly because we will not be baking

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.720 
evenly because we will not be baking
these<00:02:32.120> with<00:02:32.420> any<00:02:32.570> foil<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:33.050> top<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.459> olive

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
these with any foil on top so the olive

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.040 
these with any foil on top so the olive
oil<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.030> going<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.270> protect<00:02:35.420> these<00:02:35.840> from

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
oil is going to protect these from

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.560 
oil is going to protect these from
drying<00:02:36.320> out<00:02:36.560> if<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:37.220> definitely<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:37.940> not<00:02:37.970> want
