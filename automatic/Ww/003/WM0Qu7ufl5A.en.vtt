00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
as well I believe corporal punishment is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.420 
as well I believe corporal punishment is
banned<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.110> tearing<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> shocking

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
banned so tearing this as a shocking

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.249 
banned so tearing this as a shocking
yeah<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.600> that's<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> thing<00:01:31.110> is

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
yeah I think I think that's the thing is

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.080 
yeah I think I think that's the thing is
you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.560> people<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> instill<00:01:32.939> these

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
is bad but it's a sigh a sign rather of

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.800 
is bad but it's a sigh a sign rather of
the<00:02:47.950> problems<00:02:48.489> with<00:02:48.790> our<00:02:48.849> education<00:02:49.420> system

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
the problems with our education system

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.599 
the problems with our education system
when<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.079> students<00:02:50.500> are<00:02:50.650> calling<00:02:51.400> when

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
when the students are calling when

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.110 
when the students are calling when
they're<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.940> ones<00:02:52.150> actually<00:02:53.609> I<00:02:54.609> think<00:02:54.940> that's

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
they're the ones actually I think that's

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.789 
they're the ones actually I think that's
where<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.720> problem<00:02:56.139> is<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.409> think<00:02:56.620> there's

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
where the problem is I think there's

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.349 
where the problem is I think there's
probably<00:02:56.950> some<00:02:57.310> bad<00:02:57.459> apples<00:02:57.819> in<00:02:57.909> this<00:02:58.090> school

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
probably some bad apples in this school

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.839 
probably some bad apples in this school
and<00:02:58.629> this<00:02:59.049> may<00:02:59.290> be<00:02:59.349> protected<00:03:00.220> them<00:03:00.430> maybe

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
and this may be protected them maybe

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.580 
and this may be protected them maybe
from<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.359> maybe<00:03:01.659> they<00:03:01.780> felt<00:03:01.989> like<00:03:02.079> okay<00:03:02.470> I'm

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
from that maybe they felt like okay I'm

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.020 
from that maybe they felt like okay I'm
not<00:03:02.620> gonna<00:03:02.799> get<00:03:03.040> bullied<00:03:03.250> or<00:03:03.549> I'm<00:03:03.670> not<00:03:03.849> gonna
