00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi talent I wanted to know why 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.550
 do you see an album 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.769
 the infinite by the new album because 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.870
 basle finished it means without limit 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.370
 there are near 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.100
 there are no rules there is a 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.470
 little free and that's kind of the spirit of 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.050
 this album was closed 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.630
 at the level of the style at the level of 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.440
 the new universe writing 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.940
 there is no limit I want to 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.830
 to highlight all my influences 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.820
 musical and 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.070
 you have enough enough 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.030
 quite varied that maybe too 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.520
 there really are titles is very 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.530
 different and reggae that's it again 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 dear palace life but that's every 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.660
 title is very different so that was 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.640
 that's been a risk to take and he 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.800
 love to take risks and that's 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.510
 definitely months without an accent 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.530
 so the second question is is this 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.309
 that you could describe me your new 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.309
