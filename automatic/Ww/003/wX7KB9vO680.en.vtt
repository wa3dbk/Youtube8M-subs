 gel I put it as I tell you a lot 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.780
 stage and I do not know why we already put it is and 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:45.080
 it also changes the texture and here they are 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.080

 I ground the bed with a darker color and 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.399
 so let's see the modes now the 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:07.349

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.909
 put a little darker the 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:11.759

 obviously our face measure ok 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:17.310
 to zombies because it leaves them equal to 

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:20.500
 chicks the most shields 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.840
 to the archers because they are the same 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.690

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.870
 the pig and the sheep and the clipper is a 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.770
 little bit a darker color is a 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.960
 little bit of a darker color and it was 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.990
 if it's outside the texture of Kotor
