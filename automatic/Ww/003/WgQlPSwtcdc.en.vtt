00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.080 
get to go a teleporter well you'll
probably<00:01:28.320> pick<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.070> shotgun<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.909> map

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
probably pick up a shotgun in this map

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.640 
probably pick up a shotgun in this map
that's<00:01:30.299> what<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.500> you'll<00:01:31.619> be

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
that's what you do and then you'll be

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980 
that's what you do and then you'll be
able<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.009> kill<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> sniper<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.840> as

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
able to kill the sniper now just as

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.890 
able to kill the sniper now just as
saying<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:35.850> sure<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.390> win<00:01:36.659> even

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
saying you are not for sure to win even

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.660 
saying you are not for sure to win even
if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.350> pick<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> sniper<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.460> have

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
if you do pick up that sniper you have

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.859 
if you do pick up that sniper you have
to<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.909> good<00:01:39.119> about<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> be

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to be good about it you have to be

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
to be good about it you have to be
immediately<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:41.040> shooting<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:41.880> right

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
immediately just shooting them right

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
immediately just shooting them right
when<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.450> get<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> sniper<00:01:43.530> can

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
when you get in because the sniper can

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.429 
when you get in because the sniper can
still<00:01:44.220> kill<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> sniper<00:01:45.659> but

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
still kill you they do have a sniper but

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.899 
still kill you they do have a sniper but
that<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> long-range<00:01:47.460> weapon<00:01:47.790> at<00:01:47.880> close

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
that is a long-range weapon at close

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
that is a long-range weapon at close
range<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> your

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
range so you have to use it to your

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.149 
range so you have to use it to your
advantage

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
advantage

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.620 
advantage
something<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.509> you

something that I really like that you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.120 
something that I really like that you
add<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.079> map<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.530> he<00:01:52.649> added<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> ability

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
add to this map was he added the ability

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.429 
add to this map was he added the ability
to<00:01:53.460> use<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.030> different<00:01:54.390> abilities<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
to use the different abilities so you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.410 
to use the different abilities so you
can<00:01:55.649> use<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> flare<00:01:56.310> or<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.850> use<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> bubble

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
can use a flare or you can use a bubble

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.630 
can use a flare or you can use a bubble
shield<00:01:57.659> or<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.079> use<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> drop<00:01:58.829> shield<00:01:59.159> all

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
shield or you can use a drop shield all

shield or you can use a drop shield all
those<00:01:59.939> different<00:02:00.270> shields<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.960> use<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
those different shields you can use and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
those different shields you can use and
the<00:02:01.439> flare<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.399> really<00:02:02.729> helped<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.149> was

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the flare and they really helped I was

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
the flare and they really helped I was
surprised<00:02:03.689> by<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.899> flare<00:02:04.140> I've<00:02:04.320> never<00:02:04.770> used<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
surprised by the flare I've never used a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.980 
surprised by the flare I've never used a
flare<00:02:05.310> before<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> know<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.119> don't<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.899> why

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
flare before I know I don't know why

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.330 
flare before I know I don't know why
it's<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.290> not<00:02:07.469> usually<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.920> multiplayer

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
it's it's not usually in multiplayer

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.520 
it's it's not usually in multiplayer
matches<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.879> Halo<00:02:09.090> 3<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.289> useful

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
matches on Halo 3 and it's so useful

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.290 
matches on Halo 3 and it's so useful
because<00:02:10.739> when<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.220> drop<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.580> down<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.060> makes

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
because when you drop it down it makes

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.280 
because when you drop it down it makes
it<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it so the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.559 
it so the
the<00:02:13.470> zombie<00:02:14.099> can't<00:02:14.340> see<00:02:14.519> anything<00:02:15.030> at<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.269> and

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
the zombie can't see anything at all and

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.170 
the zombie can't see anything at all and
they<00:02:15.840> can<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.290> see<00:02:16.830> nothing<00:02:17.189> but<00:02:17.340> white<00:02:17.579> so

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
they can just see nothing but white so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.280 
they can just see nothing but white so
it's<00:02:18.299> really<00:02:18.450> hard<00:02:18.689> to<00:02:18.780> actually<00:02:18.870> shoot<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
it's really hard to actually shoot the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.020 
it's really hard to actually shoot the
people<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.159> gives<00:02:20.340> everybody<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.730> really

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
people and it gives everybody a really

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.300 
people and it gives everybody a really
quick<00:02:21.269> advantage<00:02:21.599> now<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.829> you<00:02:22.920> want<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.189> get

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
quick advantage now if you want to get

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.830 
quick advantage now if you want to get
from<00:02:23.459> one<00:02:23.640> obstacle<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:24.180> other<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.689> guy

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
from one obstacle to other and the guy

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.839 
from one obstacle to other and the guy
has<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.079> completely<00:02:25.739> covered<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.310> bubble<00:02:26.640> shield

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
has a completely covered a bubble shield

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.149 
has a completely covered a bubble shield
is<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:27.450> useful<00:02:27.810> for<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.019> because<00:02:28.379> they

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
is really useful for that because they

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.440 
is really useful for that because they
can't<00:02:29.370> shoot<00:02:29.549> through<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.299> put

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
can't shoot through it so you can put

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.449 
can't shoot through it so you can put
that<00:02:30.569> down<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.379> it's<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.620> one-time<00:02:31.920> use

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
that down but it's a one-time use

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.860 
that down but it's a one-time use
because<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.819> can<00:02:32.940> only<00:02:33.060> pick<00:02:33.239> up<00:02:33.390> one<00:02:33.659> thing

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
because you can only pick up one thing

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.960 
because you can only pick up one thing
at<00:02:33.989> once<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.040> really<00:02:35.610> have<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.760> work

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
at once so you really have to work

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.550 
at once so you really have to work
together<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:36.629> anything<00:02:36.989> if<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.200> guys<00:02:37.349> can

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
together and if anything if you guys can

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.259 
together and if anything if you guys can
all<00:02:37.769> work<00:02:37.920> together<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.370> use<00:02:38.489> your<00:02:38.670> abilities

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
all work together and use your abilities

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.780 
all work together and use your abilities
one<00:02:39.989> at<00:02:40.109> a<00:02:40.140> time<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.859> really<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.430> good

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
one at a time it's a really really good

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.750 
one at a time it's a really really good
idea<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.709> really<00:02:43.709> enjoyed<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.129> map<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.609> was

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
idea I really enjoyed this map it was

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.360 
idea I really enjoyed this map it was
made<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.989> can't<00:02:46.379> say<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.829> map<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.010> like

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
made I I can't say that this map is like

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.699 
made I I can't say that this map is like
amazingly<00:02:48.000> made<00:02:48.329> but<00:02:48.569> that's<00:02:48.840> kind<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.200> part

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
amazingly made but that's kind of part

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.410 
amazingly made but that's kind of part
of<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.859> charm<00:02:50.159> of<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:50.579> is<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.760> halo<00:02:51.090> 3
