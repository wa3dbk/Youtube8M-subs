00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.279
 beautiful noon youtube philippe 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.710
 rossier I greet you as the first 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.410
 new successes carriage and thus 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 at the same time to receive our edition 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.330
 snack food series via short and crisp 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.170
 let's start right away 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.880
 today it's really cool soja here 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.340
 she just looks like a snack 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 for the evening what they needed a few 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.429
 lack and soy sauce what he does there 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.439
 quite simply the lack so have 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.350
 actually quite delicious taste 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.210
 but with this sauce he is something of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.000
 subnet it for example for 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.379
 Adventure in between is easy 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.760
 a bit of a lack says, for example 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.670
 Once inside the glass jar there 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.809
 just a bit of soy sauce over it 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.309
 see if we have enough to eat 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.570
 if he does not have enough soy sauce then 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.120
 just stretch it with a bit 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.840
 water just look that already the biggest 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.070
 share of it is so going otherwise 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.070
 Gives this intense taste 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.080
 they are already preparing two now 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.360
 possibilities so if he really the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.009
 have ultimate flavor orgasm 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.619
 then you want the whole thing about for 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.140
 Let it feed for 30 minutes or 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.320
 if he just likes this a bit 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.909
 salty taste then want 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.600
 let the whole thing to 12 minutes easy 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.710
 move in 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.299
 and then we do it right with the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.220
 recipe continues therefore the two 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.479
 possibilities do you taste me 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.070
 of course, there you are 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.720
 they set no limits at all 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.430
 spontaneously so much of what you get out of it 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.310
 Above all, these sheep can do the same 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.509
 direction so this chip direction the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.000
 He is usually the big manufacturer 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.290
 do 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.750
 So I'd say now just like chili 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.130
 or in the curry direction I can 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.990
 I think it's really good to introduce myself 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.270
 Now I'm just in the sauce after what 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.579
 it's pure because you have so much later 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.909
 nice cover on these on this 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.979
 almonds on it therefore let us completely 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.979
 wait a moment and continue directly 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.040
 I just got it out now 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.260
 spooned from the soy sauce of course 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.200
 Skim off a bit and then have 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.659
 the whole here on the baking sheet in the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.549
 guilty ends up heating up as meanwhile 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.980
 ever your oven to 200 degrees before 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.500
 that should be about five to eight 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.939
 make in the oven to dry minutes 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.290
 Of course you can also breathe a bit 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.379
 let it dry before it if he wanted 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.209
 quite a lot of people do their time too 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.439
 allows and how is already said 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.999
 if he has, for example 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.180
 make that inadequate milk recipe 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:43.500
 then I'll be sure 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.700
 know that mandl if you have one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.400
 liquid lies the suck oneself 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.379
 unbelievably full that is the logic 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 after that the longer the in the 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.569
 so now you have to load it in the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.669
 taste of course more intense like it 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.760
 just had already said so 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:59.969
 call times is currently 141 I think so 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.409
 Already let's prepare that for a bit 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:07.519
 after the upswing is everything 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:12.569
 some of it works just make so 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:24.720
 possible rani heitz strive to daughter 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:27.269
 up to 200 high and love in almonds 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.189
 you have already finished on the plate 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.949
 made as easy after that from the tin 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:34.019
 take and make yourself on the plate 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.250
 its space already few weggegessen so 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.509
 very delicious we had very much 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.229
 of course, that says follow that 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:41.729
 only character but you have to watch 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.019
 really look out for the time so 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.900
 really watching eye surface 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.310
 appoint 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.599
 these remnants of the soy sauce 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.129
 if he does not use it as pure 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.049
 air dry last in front of it but directly 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.840
 pure makes the remnants of the 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.739
 soy sauce burn relatively heavy that 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.209
 means I just have it even now 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.680
 I ring out quickly 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.939
 purely 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.430
 then directly you can already the 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.379
 burnt on any case but watch out 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.900
