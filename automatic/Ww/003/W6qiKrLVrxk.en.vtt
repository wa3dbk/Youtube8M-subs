00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.240
 let's see how google + also 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.849
 can apply to what would be the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.529
 virtual learning communities to 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.960
 just like facebook in this case we 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.640
 we have bet we believe that the most 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.650
 interesting are the communities although 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.869
 you could also use the pages 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.789
 in the case of communities 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 They have practically are very similar 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.820
 the same characteristics as 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.370
 what facebook and well then to access 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.590
 just going to the start bar 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.260
 we see that we have in the communities 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.570
 Well in this case if we already belong to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.670
 some we could access it if 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.500
 not here we also find a button 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.030
 create a community with which we 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 would create our community and we will invite 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.239
 to the users that we want to like 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.519
 that on facebook can also be 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.370
 public or private I will go to a 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.920
 community already created and we will see that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.330
 also then it is formed by a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.860
 sort of timeline like that 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.770
 the users where to share the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.340
 news and well then we can see what 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.160
 contributions have made the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.910
 different members of this community 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.009
 we see that we can just like that in 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.590
 our google account + add let's 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.210
 give a +1 is to say that that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.729
 publication we like by clicking on 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.200
 MassÃº does not share the publication or 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.250
 add a comment to said publication 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.830
 and then we can in the news 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.360
 then share as I said 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.920
 photos links videos events and good 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.110
 even within the links we could 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 include a link for example to a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.690
 google document google drive of such 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.960
 way that it would be very easy to share 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.860
 documentation and contents therefore 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.680
 one of the most characteristic 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.720
 interesting that differentiate the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.500
 communities of facebook groups is 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.170
 that will allow us to create categories or 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.229
 hashtags that with what we can 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.890
 do is classify the contents and of 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.320
 This way find them easily 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.990
 through these categories but also 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.660
 It is true that the facebook comments and 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.510
 maybe to today when when you're 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.410
 watching this video, it will work 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.630
 because he commented that facebook he wanted 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.870
 also use the system of 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.240
 hashtags for then to categorize then 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.510
 publications of uploads by 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.510
 users
