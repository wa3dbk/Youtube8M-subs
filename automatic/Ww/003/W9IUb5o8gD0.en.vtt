 football for ten years which made me 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:06.520
 hit it's lomborg engine failure nothing 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.140
 the only dirty thing that makes it 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.140
 works or not it's you 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.200
 the similarities in my board my self 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.299
 both are an aerodynamic threshold 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.590
 for the world time and other ong 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.600
 it's done to take the curves 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.479
 quickly then have a good speed 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.119
 the car was also designed just for 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.840
 that to take cobras beats of 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.840
 existing way 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.160
 if he beats passing in the face 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.660
 it's a feeling of freedom 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.680
 completely would like us to be on a 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.479
 cloud 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.000
 too inconstant I feel on the wheel you 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.710
 sense the road is you the leader of your 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.869
 car is like it's like in 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.220

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.220
