00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
that in mind let's start by defining

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.730 
that in mind let's start by defining
what<00:00:27.190> pot<00:00:27.520> odds<00:00:27.700> really<00:00:28.210> are<00:00:28.440> to<00:00:29.440> put<00:00:29.650> it

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.800 
with the size of the bet you need to
call<00:00:38.560> for<00:00:38.829> example<00:00:39.790> let's<00:00:40.329> say<00:00:40.450> your<00:00:40.630> opponent

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
call for example let's say your opponent

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.360 
call for example let's say your opponent
bets<00:00:41.079> $10<00:00:41.829> into<00:00:42.370> a<00:00:42.399> pot<00:00:42.640> of<00:00:42.790> $90<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:45.010> action

bets $10 into a pot of $90 the action

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.430 
bets $10 into a pot of $90 the action
moves<00:00:45.579> to<00:00:45.790> you<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.180> now<00:00:46.540> you<00:00:47.020> have<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.290> call

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
moves to you and now you have to call

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.389 
moves to you and now you have to call
just<00:00:47.770> $10<00:00:48.460> in<00:00:48.640> order<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:48.940> win<00:00:49.059> $100<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:50.649> $90<00:00:51.280> in

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
just $10 in order to win $100 the $90 in

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.850 
just $10 in order to win $100 the $90 in
the<00:00:51.460> pot<00:00:51.700> and<00:00:52.000> your<00:00:52.180> opponent's<00:00:52.630> $10<00:00:52.960> but<00:00:53.200> this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
the pot and your opponent's $10 but this

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
translates into pot odds of 10 to 1

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.440 
translates into pot odds of 10 to 1
which<00:00:56.680> are<00:00:56.860> very<00:00:57.250> juicy<00:00:57.640> indeed<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.879> what

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
which are very juicy indeed so now what

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.090 
which are very juicy indeed so now what
what<00:01:01.750> now<00:01:02.050> that<00:01:02.079> we<00:01:02.320> know<00:01:02.440> what<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.680> pot<00:01:02.890> odds

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
what now that we know what the pot odds

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.699 
what now that we know what the pot odds
are<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.820> question<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.299> how<00:01:04.719> do<00:01:04.780> we<00:01:04.959> make<00:01:05.289> use

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:05.709 
are the question is how do we make use

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:08.010 
are the question is how do we make use
of<00:01:05.740> them<00:01:06.189> to<00:01:06.909> make<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.090> decision<00:01:07.600> about<00:01:07.899> a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
of them to make a decision about a

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
of them to make a decision about a
specific<00:01:08.259> hand<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.939> a<00:01:10.149> very<00:01:10.659> simple

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
specific hand it's a very simple

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.730 
specific hand it's a very simple
three-step<00:01:12.850> process<00:01:13.060> first<00:01:13.810> we<00:01:14.079> calculate

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
three-step process first we calculate

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.379 
three-step process first we calculate
our<00:01:14.770> pot<00:01:15.100> odds<00:01:15.310> like<00:01:15.520> we<00:01:15.639> did<00:01:15.819> just<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:16.149> minute

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:16.389 
our pot odds like we did just a minute

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
grade second we estimate our odds of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.959 
pot we fold now of course implied odds
which<00:01:39.009> we'll<00:01:39.189> talk<00:01:39.340> about<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.639> little<00:01:39.849> bit

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
which we'll talk about a little bit

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.050 
which we'll talk about a little bit
later<00:01:40.770> suggests<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:42.009> even<00:01:42.700> if<00:01:42.819> you're<00:01:42.939> not

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
later suggests that even if you're not

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.749 
later suggests that even if you're not
getting<00:01:43.209> the<00:01:43.359> right<00:01:43.569> odds<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:45.159> can<00:01:45.399> bet<00:01:45.729> on

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
getting the right odds you can bet on

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.499 
getting the right odds you can bet on
the<00:01:45.939> river<00:01:46.209> and<00:01:46.569> your<00:01:47.079> opponent<00:01:47.499> will<00:01:47.950> call

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the river and your opponent will call

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.690 
the river and your opponent will call
probably<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:49.689> so<00:01:49.740> sometimes<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:51.099> a<00:01:51.490> closed

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
probably and so sometimes in a closed

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.919 
probably and so sometimes in a closed
situation<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.329> might<00:01:52.479> want<00:01:52.689> to<00:01:52.749> make<00:01:52.869> the

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
situation you might want to make the

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.870 
situation you might want to make the
call<00:01:53.259> because<00:01:53.799> you<00:01:53.919> know<00:01:54.159> if<00:01:54.249> you<00:01:54.369> make<00:01:54.639> your

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
call because you know if you make your

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.989 
call because you know if you make your
hand<00:01:55.179> you<00:01:55.749> get<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:56.049> make<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.229> bet<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.999> it'll

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
hand you get to make a bet and it'll

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.909 
hand you get to make a bet and it'll
probably<00:01:58.329> get<00:01:58.539> called<00:01:58.810> that's<00:01:59.229> just<00:01:59.529> simply

outs would be gone that's because you
