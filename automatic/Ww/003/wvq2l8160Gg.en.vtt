00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.609
 simson city hall two thuringians want 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.609
 with cult mopeds to africa 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.700
 what 's the name of a song in the 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.350
 taxi to paris that would sound comfortable 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.270
 two young men from Thuringia 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.189
 ruhla but have a little something 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.380
 chosen and more uncomfortable variant 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.640
 now it did not hold that paris 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.619
 would he be cited small 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.869
 fish for you you want along the 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.200
 Mediterranean coast to travel to Africa 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.590
 on two wheels and something 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.590
 for which 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.420
 the good old little Simson has her 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.250
 now cult status and as well 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.270
 From this they are somehow 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.570
 unbreakable 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.100
 and exactly with these just 50 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.559
 cubic centimeters want to jahn and 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.720
 marco from ruhla and thuringia across 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.890
 drive europe and then even after 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.510
 translate morocco 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.089
 For months, the two plan 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:09.270
 Computer scientist her red four weeks 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:13.920
 concentrated adventure you have to dare a lot 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.920
 I think the adventures we experience 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.880
 that nothing works then you can 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.110
 also call can still try 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.520
 we have spare parts 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.619
 actually a second moped more or 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.420
 less and spare parts with 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.640
 Well, it sounds exhausting but fun 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.070
 it makes somehow also the machines 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.729
 are perfectly maintained and that's how it falls 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.729
 test drive even in the rain not 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.729
 Interesting 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.520
 but at the expected thousands 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.070
 kilometers may sometimes over the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.470
 be given physical are 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.450
 we have been on our tours so far 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.250
 noticed what the butt before hurts 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.850
 becomes home and that's why it's not 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.620
 problem 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.780
 a very toned by therefore becomes 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.210
 Everything fits on board 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.670
 so to speak, is all counted cooker one 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.830
 few clothes and especially spare parts 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.030
 The packaging will of course also 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.869
 rehearsed 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 Now it is shaking and above all it has air 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.060
 we just we rumgesprochen 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.820
 sat together at lunch 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.290
 on with the mopeds on a mountain and 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.430
 We thought about it 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.780
 a bit further than always only here in 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 Thuringia and could drive here 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.790
 and have been to croatia 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.470
 drove and back and now we have 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.200
 thought why not the maximum 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.820
 So get out very ambitious plan 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.300
 stuck we do not know ourselves what 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.010
 create 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.530
 and that's why they have to do that 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.300
 Sprit is everywhere that fits in there 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.860
 we are just super and two 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.800
 we have to take tractors and evil 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.770
 So of all luggage is in front of one 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.080
 Spare parts and oil are 200 to 300 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.360
 kilometer a day that's about that 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.950
 aim first over the old and then always 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.950
 along the mediterranean coast 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.190
 to gibraltar and then by boat 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.480
 to africa the mediterranean sea pulls us 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.590
 actually pretty much the heat that is 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.090
 Of course the moped is not 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.320
 it is raining so much right now 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.860
 it makes him uncomfortable with that 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.230
 more here 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.700
 yes and then we said a coast 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.830
 Long look how far you can get but 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.860
 at least africa in the head at least that 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.570
 target now look what you make 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.640
 both optimists already have some 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.370
 but behind a whole 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.930
 Monthly piece that's new you have 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.690
 resign yourself to salary 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.700
 that's what the whole of Europe is all about 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.500
 17 countries will strip you and then 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.500
 very short africa we wish
