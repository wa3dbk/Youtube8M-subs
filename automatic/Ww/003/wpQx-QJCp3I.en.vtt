00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.680
 Good evening 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.700
 A few months ago we posted a video 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.160
 on the non-repayment by Poste Italiane 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.440
 of those fruit-bearing bonds held by more than one person 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.140
 with the clause of equal repayment right 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.060
 which is indicated by the acronym pfr 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 or cpfr 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.140
 in the event of death of one of the joint account holders 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.720
 Today, with this new video 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.960
 let's return to the subject 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.860
 to clarify an issue and to reiterate a concept 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.020
 Starting with the first: 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.440
 it is our main interest to clarify that 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.780
 the Iocca Chiappetta Law Firm is carrying on 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.600
 and with some success, decreed and consecrated in some sentences 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.960
 a juridical problem completely different from that concerning the finding of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.440
 vouchers and old postal booklets and of which in the last few months there is much talk on the internet 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.000
 In this regard, unfortunately, nothing can be said 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.200
 because, we repeat, we have never dealt with the matter 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.620
 On the contrary, in relation to the event we are dealing with 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.060
 and that the unfortunate owners are the protagonists 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.200
 of postal savings bonds, ordinary or forward 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.660
 provided they have not been prescribed 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:40.720
 and that they are denied the reimbursement for the mere fact of not having brought the "title" to the collection 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.580
 before one of the joint account holders died 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.420
 Well, in this regard, with knowledge of the facts 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.160
 we reiterate that Poste Italiane is interpreting 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.940
 a provision of law "pro domo sua" 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.580
 asserting, evidently wrongly 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.400
 the termination of the clause of equal reimbursement in the event of the death of one of the joint account holders 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:15.240
 and from here deriving, the impossibility of proceeding to the reimbursement of the whole good 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.360
 Needless to say, this position taken by Poste Italiane 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.780
 he does not find us in complete agreement 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.280
 Now, starting from two different assumptions, namely: 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.360
 the first is that postal savings bonds can be registered in one or more joint accounts 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.040
 and that, the second, the shares of each co-holder are assumed in equal parts 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.920
 wanting to synthesize our defensive line to the maximum 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.000
 we can support with sufficient certainty 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.980
 that there are three cases in which the holders of savings bonds can come to visit 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.340
 The first: 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.640
 the postal savings coupon is registered to a single person and this person dies 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.360
 It is clear that in this case Poste Italiane can legitimately claim to know 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:23.940
 who and how many heirs to whom to request the joint but not simultaneous signing of the receipt 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.740
 Second case: 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:36.260
 The interest-bearing voucher is payable to two people, one of whom dies and has an equal repayment clause 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:45.820
 In this case Poste Italiane will have to reimburse the entire voucher against the surviving co-holder 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:54.120
 without the slightest worry about who, of whom and how many are the heirs of the deceased 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.480
 and without fear of incurring responsibility that it would not have in the case, in fact, in which it proceeds 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.480
 reimbursement of the entire voucher in the hands of the sole surviving and requesting co-holder 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:19.560
 It is evident that the possible heirs of the deceased who believed they could legitimately claim 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.720
 rights to the share due to him will have to make his claims exclusively 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.680
 towards the surviving co-holder who received the voucher 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:42.120
 Therefore, in a possible cause, Poste Italiane should remain totally out of it and therefore not be agreed 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.560
 Third hypothesis: 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.720
 the postal savings coupon is registered to three or more people, one of whom dies 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.920
 we always talk about vouchers with the same right to reimbursement clause 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.620
 Well, in this case Poste Italiane will have to reimburse the voucher towards you 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.840
 of the surviving co-holders and applicants, who will have the obligation to sign jointly 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.580
 and not simultaneously the receipt 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:26.700
 Also in this case, as in the previous one, the speech that any heirs of the deceased co-holder is worth 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.640
 who had rights to the share due to them will have to address their reasons 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.440
 exclusively towards the joint account holders who have collected the vouchers 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:48.780
 Therefore, all this being stated, we reiterate that Poste Italiane has no right to request the presentation 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.520
 of the declaration of succession 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.660
 And this in none of the three cases! 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.500
 Thanks and see you soon!
