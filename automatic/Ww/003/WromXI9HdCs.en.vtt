00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.920
 very well and many are those who ask 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.250
 how do you share folders in what 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.750
 is your windows xp in your virtual mode in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.380
 your virtual machine with your system 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.239
 operational host this is a process 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.970
 different from what it is 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.809
 windows 7 in a virtual machine what 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.720
 if you do not know how to share folders 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:46.620
 between what is your virtual windows 7 and 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.390
 your normal windows 7 and host then you 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.809
 I leave here a video so that the checks 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.170
 and good for this video we are going to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.850
 See how to share folders as they see 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.699
 here is my virtual machine that is 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.360
 windows xp service pack 2 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.940
 here is how you can see then we are going to 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.760
 share folders so you can see the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.340
 large screen in windows xp machine 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.450
 virtual and we are going to install what 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.270
 what are these games 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.030
 edicions I've already talked a lot in 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.840
 previous videos these websites to edition 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.840
 they are extensions 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.010
 additions that make your virtualbox a 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.680
 your virtual machine so you can see 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.620
 in the maximum resolution of your screen 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.720
 original ok and good to share 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.960
 folders, it's very easy for us 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.780
 let's go make our machine and 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.970
 here in the configurations 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.830
 and let us first configuration 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.830
 our machine we go to configuration 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.479
 obviously our windows xp machine 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.039
 let's give from shared folders 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.939
 as you can see but I have already enabled 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.759
 a first let's create what we're going to 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.240
 create the I do not know somewhere in your 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.569
 documents wherever they have it 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.670
 example let's go here to documents 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.489
 shared folders and I created a 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.470
 which is called windows xp service pack 2 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:19.450
 is this ok and good to add it 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.360
 just click here on the button 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.380
 more here in selection folder path 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.060
 another and they are deploying this menu until 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.530
 arrive in your folder 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.130
 they want to add there are only in 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.520
 add folder and ready ok study the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.300
 irons and to compose then here is and 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.400
 good to share the folder and have 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.819
 to install the forces decisions 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.500
 inside the psuv 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.810
 virtual machine for example let's 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.810
 enter and you are going to have obviously 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.840
 on screen girl is everything if they put it on 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.580
 full screen is going to see a box 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.800
 inside a box your virtual machine 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.260
 until they install which editions 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.959
 now we are here devices are going 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.959
 there and it's very simple only the ex 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.200
 next next and they arrive at what is the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.810
 installation of the editions school good 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.380
 Once they have already installed them, they will 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.890
 there was in full screen his his machine 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.540
 virtual 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.440
 obviously they have to give who to see 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.380
 the full screen so that it looks like this 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.940
 then you are going to come to read 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.819
 what is sharing folders are going to look 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.190
 this part and we're going to come to what it is 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.079
 my pc ok 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.569
 as you can see then if we go to the 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.310
 network requirements we have nothing though 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.340
 nothing appears to us as what it is 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.620
 windows 7 that appears to us already 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.280
 in the extension and from there we already share 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.220
 good files on this occasion we 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.290
 appears good this time we do not 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.780
 it appears that we what we are going to 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.080
 to do is add a network site let's 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.700
 click on this part and here where it says 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.090
 the assistant we are going to click on 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.060
 next because here we are going to click 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.280
 in next 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.319
 and and as you can see it here commands us 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.819
 a network or internet address we are going to 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.940
 select what is our folder 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.680
 let's see that in examining and sending us 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.560
 the drop-down menu every day of 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.770
 network that we have we are going to open what is 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.830
 the whole network and here we are going sends us the 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.540
 windows network and virtualbox network 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.910
 let's open what is virtual box 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.419
 here we have this machine that is virtual 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.330
 box the software and within this one already 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.190
 comes what is our folder ok the 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.229
 we select with good you will see that is the 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.550
 name at the end windows xp service pack 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.210
 2 and we accept 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.530
 we click on next is it takes a 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:58.530
 name okay says write a name for 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.330
 this network site in this case I'm going 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.520
 to leave it like that which you can 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.040
 put the shared folder as 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.310
 want me I'm not going to leave like that and I give it 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.290
 click on next and says the assistant 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.250
 click on finish has created the following 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:16.230
 network site and we give at the end and as 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.600
 you can see then this site is already running 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.000
 Network opens the folder and already 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.990
 we have here in what is the folder ok 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.210
 for this good we are always going to leave 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:33.670
 here to what is home computer and my pc and 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.610
 in network sites we are going to always have 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.590
 what is our shared folder 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.280
 until it's empty we're going to make a 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:46.510
 try to see what works and why 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:50.310
 example let's create a new and text 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.250
 not a text document we put it hello 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.110
 it's an example let's put it here 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.520
 inside hello 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.379

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:06.220
 and we click control hehe we keep it 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:09.340
 we close and here it's good we're going to click 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.080

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.340
 windows xp service pack 2 and here I give 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:25.000
 what to use there is the file 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.720
 to open our our system 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.620

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:37.190

 We can do anything with our 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.389
 file we go to the shared folder
