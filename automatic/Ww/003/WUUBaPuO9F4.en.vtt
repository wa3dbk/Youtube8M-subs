00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.450
 What are you talking about? 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.570
 the ad diper false at 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.099
 to bring a fan defeat tip and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.040
 You already had enough people here. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.500
 requesting the black hawk video on the channel 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.570
 is not that interesting snow animal 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.449
 it's finding we did not see it that way 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.920
 both videos about the same good to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.060
 have already seen that I have disputed 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.380
 a female is not 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.189
 black b then I thought I'd take her with him. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.690
 riff but it was going to be very easy because she 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 It was already very close, right? 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.850
 a tip you saw at the beginning is 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.010
 You will leave the lodge at around 10 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.520
 You will always be crouched in the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.559
 Friday behind d bear you go in a place 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.170
 where it has the most incidence of them and goes 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.379
 always crouched at it may come until 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.460
 I'm lying down because it's a very 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 complicated staff mainly 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.960
 males but both the male and the female 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 he was in jk nÃ© and I would say 90% of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.909
 Sometimes you will not get out alive then it's me 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.430
 I indicated that you have a strong weapon and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.670
 also if you like to dance with 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.700
 flash is make sure you have a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.850
 good aim that will not be the case today right? 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.159
 I even start the arrow 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.960
 it was not to be exactly in the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.330
 Your head will see you in the front. 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 Where did the arrow go and I explain 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.479
 that's farther ahead 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.759
 He ran there. It 's complicated. You're here. 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 hunting with a flash gun does not have a 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.090
 accuracy to hit a 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:48.420
 vital organ and even then it will run 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:50.729
 pretty strong you're not hitting 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.100
 far away or in case he wants to attack 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.869
 you can change quickly and 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.680
 overthrow him before he knocks you 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.170
 huh 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.820
 There, the image will change now, I already have 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.600
 he in the sights that he was with him by 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.420
 lake 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.090
 there it is gift and he could not run 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.069
 No shot was right at the neck so it's a 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.080
 hug when you see that he is 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.110
 running the best thing to do 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.870
 I think you get the hip and finish 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.440
 he 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.870
 It's going to be a long time. I know it's not 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.709
 Nice is giving a shot after a 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.599
 I do not shoot 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.220
 but if you had hit a 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.319
 arrow so a vital organ of it 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.150
 will probably occur little are 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.370
 arriving there you will see where it was 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.040
 arrow 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.890
 I was right in the middle of my head that in most 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.260
 of the animals would have died on the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.349
 as it thus has the front part of the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.540
 head is very hard then probably 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.709
 nor reached the brain as 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.750
 Did you see that, right? 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.849
 the first arrow that was our part 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.640
 the white sand and after the shot was 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.109
 red part it fell on time and was the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.150
 Personal Video today black bear 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.650
 I hope you have enjoyed it. 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.980
 evaluation until the next 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.980
 went
