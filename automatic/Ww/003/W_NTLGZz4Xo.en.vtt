00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.410
 we are in the garden and we are here 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.890
 you must necessarily start talking 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.350
 of the fundamental role of the method of 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.510
 cultivation with which the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.140
 gaspar method onion gentleman 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:55.850
 has a series of fundamental points 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.620
 in what his method and that we could 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.930
 define 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.519
 in what is the associations and the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:09.700
 rotations a culture method where the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.039
 ground the ground is the fundamental 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.920
 everything that happens from the ground up 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.590
 is a reflection of whether the soil is good or 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.460
 it is wrong 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.850
 the subject of irrigation that is used 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:29.490
 exclusively hose assistant 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.630
 and then the theme of the field that defines the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.530
 production in the method of aspar 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.530
 Knight of Segovia 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.610
 in the advantages that the 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.210
 helper hose is that we have moisture 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.990
 in all that is the ground no point 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.900
 isolated that is what would make us drip 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.030
 like this cultivation method the framework of 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.120
 planting is very dense are own 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.490
 crops that shade and avoid 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.420
 the loss of moisture therefore less 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.420
 need for water 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.629
 a key point of the method of 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.409
 pairs that we never only prepare the 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.659
 ground and let's say we finish it in 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.030
 the moment we make the terraces 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.879
 from there never again does it turn to 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.409
 dig the soil who structures it what 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.190
 loose and all that is the organic matter 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:39.610
 that is the field that we bring you to remember 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.560
 that the field has already passed through 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.019
 earthworms therefore the earthworm 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.970
 specifically and more specifically the 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.120
 that is provided is the soil and the one that gives 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.470
 the structure and the life needed to 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.940
 that the plants have the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.940
 elements they need to live 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.080
 we use a lot the aromatic plants 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.440
 because because what are the aromas 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.090
 many of the possible insects or 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.490
 pests that can harm us are 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.510
 they guide by smells then having 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.510
 some aromatic plants 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:33.310
 by having those scents they can disguise 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.940
 those smells that those crops would bring 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.790
 to the bugs that the attack is a subject 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.560
 fundamental when it comes to food 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.560
 for insects through pollen 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.820
 the tomatoes 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.720
 and the peppers that are specifically 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.450
 the plants that suck most of the earth 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.170
 and that plays a fundamental role the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.450
 rotation that is just after the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.920
 tomatoes and the peppers of the 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.530
 eggplant we have to put something that 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.150
 helps to recover the soil and that is the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.740
 example of the importance of rotation 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.200
 because what will be planted later are 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.030
 legumes in our case we use 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.489
 much the bean in ramen to take advantage 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.320
 the reeds and we use them 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.870
 cruciferous because the cruciferous power 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.950
 the cruciferous through the roots 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.950
 they help to disinfect the soil 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.949
 the longer we are taking in 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.419
 working the terraces 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:46.880
 but results are being notorious is 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.039
 see that they need less water there is less 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.310
 failures in the crops the colors of 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.689
 the plants also totally the 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.919
 diseases are minor 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.919
 in short is that 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.879
 he is exciting to work with 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.119
 method of parked yesterday or segovia 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.789
 precisely because it is that 

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:10.749
 results of the day of the day encourage you to 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.749
 follow more and more
