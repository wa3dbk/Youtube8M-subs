00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 beautiful to all the boys are steve sm e 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.799
 today I will show you the main commands 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 for professional goalkeeper mode 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.160
 immediately 14 with dives and parades 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.049
 normal to do it enough 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.940
 simply be well positioned 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.980
 obviously and then when the player 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.510
 opponent approaches bo pulls to hold 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.220
 press the ics and move the lever 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.960
 left in the direction it is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.090
 going the ball this way the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 your power first lateral position and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.430
 then it will dive as soon as the ball is 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.960
 arrived we now pass to the exits on 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.809
 corner kicks you face is punishment 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 as big as in the normal game e 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.989
 simply press and hold 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.760
 triangle the doorman automatically 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.320
 will go in the direction of the ball 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 you only have to be careful not to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.950
 wrong exit times because otherwise 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.840
 remaining frigate we finally have the dives 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.960
 his feet of the opposing players 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.570
 when they meet us to make them 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.149
 simply go out to them 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.859
 and then press the goalkeeper square 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.229
 automatic but foot distributor 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.330
 certainly not sure to take the ball 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.020
 you have to choose the right time and do 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.240
 much attention these must made 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.760
 see were those main commands 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.610
 most important and there are only 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.189
 the other few who were not 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.350
 feasible to show them with a video see 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.700
 I can tell now I am the car 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.330
 positioning that you just need to keep 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.759
 pressed the ll 1 button the slow movement 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.979
 in front of the ball you always need 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.509
 hold the key down to move the key 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.799
 left stick so the goalkeeper 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.799
 he moved slowly following the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.659
 balloon otherwise there is the door 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.950
 in advance that is not very different from 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.369
 dive however is slightly faster 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.390
 you have to press l 1 and r1 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.540
 simultaneously when I played 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.630
 networks and is close to you and last thing 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.310
 you can make the one a second 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.880
 defender go in pressing on the bearer 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.420
 of ball 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.810
 holding down the circle button this 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.759
 that's all 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.259

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.670
