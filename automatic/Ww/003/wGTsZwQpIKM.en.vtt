in<00:00:21.300> my<00:00:21.990> book<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.710> show<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:23.790> to<00:00:23.820> make<00:00:24.030> a

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
in my book I show how to make a

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.730 
in my book I show how to make a
greenhouse<00:00:25.530> that<00:00:25.860> is<00:00:26.190> very<00:00:26.760> simple<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
greenhouse that is very simple and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.490 
greenhouse that is very simple and
pretty<00:00:28.740> inexpensive<00:00:29.580> -<00:00:29.850> it's<00:00:30.810> made<00:00:31.020> out<00:00:31.290> of

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
pretty inexpensive - it's made out of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.540 
pretty inexpensive - it's made out of
PVC<00:00:31.940> pipes<00:00:32.940> 3/4<00:00:33.630> inch<00:00:33.780> ones<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.550> plastic

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
sheeting and clips and it it really adds

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.790 
sheeting and clips and it it really adds
about<00:00:41.370> three<00:00:41.760> months<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.270> harvest<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.530> your

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
about three months of harvest to your

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.070 
about three months of harvest to your
vegetable<00:00:44.580> growing<00:00:44.879> efforts<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> want<00:00:45.960> to

you<00:00:49.250> really<00:00:50.250> how<00:00:50.430> much<00:00:50.850> food<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.540> get<00:00:51.720> out

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you really how much food you can get out

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.680 
you really how much food you can get out
of<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.590> area<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.400> about<00:00:53.610> six<00:00:54.030> feet<00:00:54.330> wide

beets growing in there and they're going

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.070 
beets growing in there and they're going
to<00:01:03.330> be<00:01:03.480> feeding<00:01:03.839> us<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.980> many<00:01:05.220> months<00:01:05.519> and

then next to that I have about a dozen
Swiss<00:01:10.740> chard<00:01:11.130> plants<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:13.670> two<00:01:14.670> kinds<00:01:15.120> of

Swiss chard plants and two kinds of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.660 
Swiss chard plants and two kinds of
lettuces<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:15.960> we've<00:01:16.170> been<00:01:16.409> eating<00:01:16.800> lettuce

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
lettuces now we've been eating lettuce

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.899 
lettuces now we've been eating lettuce
for<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> past<00:01:18.659> month<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.700> been

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
for the past month and it's just been

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
for the past month and it's just been
really<00:01:20.940> delicious<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.229> fresh<00:01:23.010> salads

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
really delicious to have fresh salads

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.780 
really delicious to have fresh salads
every<00:01:23.640> single<00:01:24.120> night<00:01:24.440> now<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> right<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
every single night now to the right of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.720 
every single night now to the right of
the<00:01:26.970> lettuce<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:28.140> kale<00:01:29.040> plants<00:01:29.640> I

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
the lettuce we have kale plants I

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.750 
the lettuce we have kale plants I
probably<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.480> 15<00:01:30.960> kale<00:01:31.290> plants<00:01:31.770> there<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
probably have 15 kale plants there and

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.000 
probably have 15 kale plants there and
you<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.600> kale<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.260> one<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> those<00:01:34.770> vegetables

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
you know kale is one of those vegetables

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.030 
you know kale is one of those vegetables
that<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.750> helps<00:01:37.170> prevent<00:01:37.500> cancer<00:01:37.590> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that it really helps prevent cancer it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.620 
that it really helps prevent cancer it
has<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.120> sulfur<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.730> now<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.330> of

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
has the sulfur in it now to the right of

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.270 
has the sulfur in it now to the right of
the<00:01:42.810> kale<00:01:43.370> there's<00:01:44.750> about<00:01:45.750> 40<00:01:46.560> parsnips

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the kale there's about 40 parsnips

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
the kale there's about 40 parsnips
coming<00:01:48.030> along<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.940> it's<00:01:50.940> just<00:01:51.030> been<00:01:51.390> great

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
coming along and it's just been great

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200 
coming along and it's just been great
germination<00:01:52.680> rate<00:01:53.070> inside<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.790> greenhouse

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
germination rate inside the greenhouse

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.100 
germination rate inside the greenhouse
for<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.570> parsnips<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.970> then<00:01:56.970> along<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.080> side

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
for the parsnips and then along the side

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.050 
for the parsnips and then along the side
I<00:01:58.770> have<00:02:00.020> carrot<00:02:01.020> plants<00:02:01.520> they<00:02:02.520> had<00:02:02.730> a<00:02:02.760> little

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I have carrot plants they had a little

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.240 
I have carrot plants they had a little
trouble<00:02:03.300> germinating<00:02:04.050> but<00:02:04.200> they're<00:02:04.500> still

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
trouble germinating but they're still

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.700 
trouble germinating but they're still
coming<00:02:05.970> along<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.750> guess<00:02:07.350> they<00:02:07.500> need

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
coming along it's I guess they need

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.070 
coming along it's I guess they need
warmer<00:02:08.250> germination<00:02:09.800> temperatures<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.129> then

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
warmer germination temperatures and then

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.009 
warmer germination temperatures and then
the<00:02:13.080> spinach<00:02:13.650> inside<00:02:14.640> we've<00:02:15.330> also<00:02:15.599> been

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
the spinach inside we've also been

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.699 
the spinach inside we've also been
eating<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.980> weeks<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.670> weeks<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.470> we<00:02:19.470> just

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
eating for weeks and weeks and we just

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.160 
eating for weeks and weeks and we just
pick<00:02:20.069> leaves<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:21.000> don't<00:02:21.180> pick<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> plants<00:02:21.989> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
pick leaves we don't pick the plants and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.649 
pick leaves we don't pick the plants and
if<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.489> technique<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.209> picking

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
if you do this technique just picking

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.960 
if you do this technique just picking
the<00:02:24.780> leaves<00:02:25.019> your<00:02:25.920> spinach<00:02:26.370> plants<00:02:26.819> will

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
the leaves your spinach plants will

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.630 
the leaves your spinach plants will
continue<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.900> make<00:02:28.110> new<00:02:28.409> green<00:02:28.830> growth<00:02:29.280> and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
continue to make new green growth and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.860 
continue to make new green growth and
you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.600> be<00:02:30.750> eating<00:02:31.080> spinach<00:02:31.380> first<00:02:31.890> many

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
you can be eating spinach first many

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.730 
you can be eating spinach first many
many<00:02:33.870> many<00:02:34.170> weeks

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
many many weeks

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.820 
many many weeks
so<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.300> wanted<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.660> see<00:02:36.990> how<00:02:37.650> much

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
so I just wanted you to see how much

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.770 
so I just wanted you to see how much
food<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.460> really<00:02:38.760> get<00:02:38.910> out<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> six

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
food you can really get out of the six

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.260 
food you can really get out of the six
by<00:02:40.020> eight<00:02:40.050> foot<00:02:40.500> area<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.910> center

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
by eight foot area it's the center

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.780 
by eight foot area it's the center
square<00:02:42.600> plan<00:02:42.960> with<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.650> working<00:02:44.130> area<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.640> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
square plan with the working area in the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.790 
square plan with the working area in the
center<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:47.700> find<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.260> remarkable<00:02:49.260> how

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
center and I just find it remarkable how
