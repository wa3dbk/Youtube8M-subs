 also that when it was released hand that 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.270
 because I love the normal palettes here 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.040
 a shadow of the band here 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:40.700
 the palette is thus the only one expected 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:48.800

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:51.080

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.590

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.540

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:39.110

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.269

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.300
 I've never used this palette exactly 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.139
 because of the dodge to ruin the blush 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.310
 Look what this blush is, it's a lot. 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.860
 It's very beautiful, beautiful. I can use it. 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.229
 because it will break everything down but I have 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.289
 that put in use and the colors and that also 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.360
 They're amazing, I've challenged people who 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.690

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.490
