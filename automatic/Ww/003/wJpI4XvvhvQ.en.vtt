00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.759
 he comes out of nowhere the new one 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.830
 Porsche likes porsche says he is one 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.170
 sports car I just say it 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.210
 SUV but all say he sees 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.250
 well i'll take the new car 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.020
 strong on the tooth and feel in 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.120
 the environment of leipzig and on the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.160
 test track of porsche 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.380
 porsche is now also among the compact ones 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.730
 Suvs boarded and had the entry 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.290
 can not be better 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.760
 already is the first one 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.010
 Annual production of the new makern 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.620
 Sold out on the Audi Q5 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.580
 based suv promises a true one 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.580
 to become a blockbuster 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.220
 when it starts then you feel 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.809
 really good in her seat is very 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.840
 sporty offers a lot of lateral support 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.770
 you also need this car 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.110
 Generates plenty of lateral acceleration that 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.600
 is due to porsche torque vectoring plus 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.790
 This is what the rear wheel on the outside of the bend has 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.290
 a higher driving force and allows 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.800
 a better acceleration from the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.800
 turn out 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.399
 Positive is the dual-clutch transmission 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.979
 porsche that makes work easier 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.810
 here on the race track at the steering wheel there 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.759
 you can switch it up and up 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.109
 Turn down really like in one 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.200
 sports car with a capacity of 3 liters 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:29.880
 and 10 250 kw the tiger forwards 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.159
 That's exactly what you can do 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.500
 Indonesian he jumps from 0 to 100 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.079
 km h in just 54 seconds 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.209
 not in vain does porsche call the distinctive 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.750
 the super sports car among the compact ones 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.750
 suvs 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.840
 for the chassis, there is really only 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.130
 a concept it is absolutely perfect like 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.400
 in a sports car 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.680
 it is tight right at the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.290
 steering in helps the very precise steering 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.880
 to sight the curve correctly 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.520
 vertex you can by gas 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 easily oversteer the car 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.700
 the whole thing is really very much for me 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.350
 very easy and easy to control 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.830
 the man may be based on the audi though 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.080
 q5 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.700
 but the two end up just as much 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.700
 like a cat and a tiger 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.670
 So after race track is now terrain 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.260
 the sv also means off-road vehicle and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.349
 then let's see what he's doing there 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.150
 has on it 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.819
 with the standard off-road mode 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.040
 The floor clearance increases by 40 mm 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.739
 In addition, then switch all relevant 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.019
 systems in a terrain program that 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.400
 Porsche traction management allows 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.129
 a variable distribution of the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.840
 drive torque even in the most difficult 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.840
 terrain pleasant to drive 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.290
 almost 100 percent slope for the man 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.290
 can not be a problem 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.070
 maintains the downhill help the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.170
 speed so constantly loses 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.330
 also the steepest downhill their 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.280
 scare 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.820
 45 degrees sideways as well a snap 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.820
 for the tiger 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.299
 the industry clings through the 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:26.249
 variable distribution of drive forces 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.670
 also the wheels formally attached to the 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:28.670
 underground 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.920
 the special thing about our four-wheel system 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.859
 is that depending on the driving situation the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.349
 can distribute moments completely variable 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.599
 there is no fixed distribution but it is 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.680
 is a variable distribution of 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:52.170
 drive torques to demand 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.129
 classically at the sports car tail 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.950
 drives 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.709
 that distinguishes the athletes too and 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.319
 We have the advice for all our suvs 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.389
 intended 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.560
 The driving impression when working is almost like this 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.079
 good as the 911 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.120
 but only almost with the proud 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.280
 weight of 1.9 tonnes can be 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:22.889
 not completely hide that one in one 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:26.669
 Suv sits he has all that you look for 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.530
 from a sporty car that wishes 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.419
 design shows in many details 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.560
 sports car gene the dynamic 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.389
 Curved light pans the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.860
 headlight depending on 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.020
 the speed in the curve 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.570
 decorate the back view of the tiger 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.460
 two double pipes left and right 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.690
 Outside 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.699
 the luggage compartment volume when cultivating 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.770
 is 500 liters and is expandable 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.770
 up to 1500 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.330
 the design is known from the panamera and 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.980
 the new elf the porsche makan comes 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.140
 with three different motors to the 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.630
 start the entry price is at the 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.630
 We tested it and at the 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.820
 diesel variant at just under 58,000 euros in 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.430
 germany who the turbo in the tiger 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.680
 just want to ignite just under 80,000 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.360
 put .... on the table 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.160
 Finally, my conclusion so this 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.860
 Of course, porsche makan is not 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.230
 sports car but he is the sportiest 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.820
 off-road vehicle because I know and he has 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.860
 all that you need is it 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.580
 Comfortable r offers luxury and he is 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.580
 also family suitable
