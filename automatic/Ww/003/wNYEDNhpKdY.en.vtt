00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.959 
stride great I started out with
fantastic<00:01:57.889> rhythm<00:01:58.889> I<00:01:59.069> was<00:01:59.520> getting<00:01:59.850> into

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
fantastic rhythm I was getting into

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.969 
fantastic rhythm I was getting into
things<00:02:00.389> the<00:02:00.779> game<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.139> just<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.740> start

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
things the game was just about to start

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.399 
things the game was just about to start
and<00:02:02.249> I<00:02:02.909> did<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.209> countdown<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.810> Colorado<00:02:04.200> said

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
and I did the countdown in Colorado said

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.399 
and I did the countdown in Colorado said
no<00:02:04.679> whoa<00:02:05.039> whoa<00:02:05.459> whoa<00:02:05.880> wait<00:02:06.270> you're<00:02:06.840> way<00:02:07.049> off<00:02:07.229> on

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
no whoa whoa whoa wait you're way off on

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.870 
no whoa whoa whoa wait you're way off on
the<00:02:07.499> countdown<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.979> got<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.190> start<00:02:08.369> over<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
the countdown we got to start over and

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.550 
the countdown we got to start over and
that<00:02:09.600> just<00:02:09.959> killed<00:02:10.790> my<00:02:11.790> rhythm<00:02:12.560> completely

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
that just killed my rhythm completely

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.000 
that just killed my rhythm completely
killed<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.390> afterwards<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.780> think<00:02:16.319> my

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
killed it afterwards I think my

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.550 
killed it afterwards I think my
intro<00:02:17.610> color<00:02:18.239> was<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.720> say<00:02:19.019> hello<00:02:19.260> guys<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
intro color was like say hello guys and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.300 
intro color was like say hello guys and
I<00:02:19.950> went<00:02:20.329> okay<00:02:21.349> how<00:02:22.349> are<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.620> doing<00:02:22.829> or

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
I went okay how are you doing or

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.880 
I went okay how are you doing or
something<00:02:23.579> like<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:24.239> awful

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
something like that it was just awful

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.619 
something like that it was just awful
but<00:02:25.890> yeah<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.220> type<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.430> stuff<00:02:26.670> happens<00:02:27.090> but

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
but yeah that type of stuff happens but

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.119 
but yeah that type of stuff happens but
at<00:02:27.720> least<00:02:27.840> when<00:02:28.170> I'm<00:02:28.290> doing<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.860> solo

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
at least when I'm doing a solo

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.369 
at least when I'm doing a solo
commentary<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.909> start<00:02:30.180> over<00:02:30.329> which<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
commentary I can start over which I do a

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.369 
commentary I can start over which I do a
lot<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.250> time<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:33.420> average<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.079> think<00:02:34.290> I

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
lot of the time on average I think I

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.229 
lot of the time on average I think I
start<00:02:34.650> over<00:02:34.769> about<00:02:35.069> six<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:35.459> seven<00:02:35.640> times<00:02:35.819> with

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
start over about six or seven times with

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.869 
start over about six or seven times with
each<00:02:36.269> commentary<00:02:36.959> just<00:02:37.560> because<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.190> need<00:02:38.760> to

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
each commentary just because I need to

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.000 
each commentary just because I need to
hit<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.120> rhythm<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.659> if<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.319> can't<00:02:40.560> hit<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.799> in

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
hit that rhythm and if I can't hit it in

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.059 
hit that rhythm and if I can't hit it in
the<00:02:41.069> first<00:02:41.670> opening<00:02:42.239> intro<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:43.680> hey<00:02:43.890> guys

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
the first opening intro like hey guys

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.460 
the first opening intro like hey guys
this<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.370> nuke<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.659> can't<00:02:46.019> follow<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.409> up

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
this is nuke and I can't follow that up

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.030 
this is nuke and I can't follow that up
quickly<00:02:47.010> enough<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.579> just<00:02:47.879> start<00:02:48.090> over<00:02:48.920> most<00:02:49.920> of

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
quickly enough I just start over most of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.649 
quickly enough I just start over most of
the<00:02:50.099> time<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.549> like<00:02:50.609> hey<00:02:50.849> guys<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.299> is<00:02:51.359> nuke

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
the time it's like hey guys this is nuke

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.890 
the time it's like hey guys this is nuke
and<00:02:51.959> uh<00:02:53.090> uh<00:02:54.090> uh<00:02:54.829> start<00:02:55.829> ever<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:57.540> happens<00:02:57.840> a

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
and uh uh uh start ever that happens a

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.470 
and uh uh uh start ever that happens a
lot<00:02:58.049> but<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.620> looks<00:02:58.769> like<00:02:58.829> kannada<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.700> coming

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
lot but it looks like kannada is coming

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.990 
lot but it looks like kannada is coming
down<00:03:00.629> here<00:03:00.900> he<00:03:01.079> is<00:03:01.170> expanding<00:03:01.889> up<00:03:02.099> here<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:02.609> his

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
down here he is expanding up here at his

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.879 
down here he is expanding up here at his
natural<00:03:03.359> expansion<00:03:03.629> while<00:03:03.989> up<00:03:04.290> magic<00:03:04.709> is

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
natural expansion while up magic is

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.520 
natural expansion while up magic is
going<00:03:05.670> out<00:03:05.909> to<00:03:06.540> scout<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.959> wrong<00:03:07.319> direction

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
going out to scout the wrong direction

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.530 
going out to scout the wrong direction
it's<00:03:07.950> going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.159> take<00:03:08.280> him<00:03:08.400> forever<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:09.389> get

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
it's going to take him forever to get

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.930 
it's going to take him forever to get
the<00:03:09.659> kannada<00:03:09.959> since<00:03:10.379> he's<00:03:10.560> scouting

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the kannada since he's scouting

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.899 
the kannada since he's scouting
clockwise<00:03:11.940> here<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:13.680> kannada<00:03:13.980> did<00:03:14.310> go<00:03:14.519> for<00:03:14.879> a

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
clockwise here but kannada did go for a

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.420 
clockwise here but kannada did go for a
fast<00:03:15.359> command<00:03:16.290> center<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:16.829> he's<00:03:16.950> going<00:03:17.159> to<00:03:17.220> try

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
fast command center so he's going to try

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.940 
fast command center so he's going to try
to<00:03:17.489> get<00:03:17.639> that<00:03:17.819> economic<00:03:18.329> advantage<00:03:18.750> before<00:03:19.560> he

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
to get that economic advantage before he

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.159 
to get that economic advantage before he
has<00:03:20.099> any<00:03:20.310> troops<00:03:20.609> on<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.760> ground<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.359> it

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
has any troops on the ground and it

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.449 
has any troops on the ground and it
looks<00:03:22.319> like<00:03:22.459> let's<00:03:23.459> see<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.030> up<00:03:25.010> magic<00:03:26.010> decides

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
looks like let's see if up magic decides

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.449 
looks like let's see if up magic decides
to<00:03:26.699> pump<00:03:27.299> any<00:03:27.540> Marines<00:03:27.900> or<00:03:28.049> not<00:03:28.370> magic<00:03:29.370> is

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
to pump any Marines or not magic is

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.860 
to pump any Marines or not magic is
putting<00:03:29.730> down<00:03:29.879> his<00:03:30.000> factory<00:03:30.389> right<00:03:30.569> here<00:03:30.720> he

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
putting down his factory right here he

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.659 
putting down his factory right here he
is<00:03:30.959> not<00:03:31.139> pumping<00:03:31.349> any<00:03:31.650> marines<00:03:32.040> but<00:03:32.519> he's

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
is not pumping any marines but he's

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.220 
is not pumping any marines but he's
still<00:03:32.879> not<00:03:33.030> floating<00:03:33.299> his<00:03:33.480> barracks<00:03:33.810> over<00:03:34.079> so

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
still not floating his barracks over so

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.520 
still not floating his barracks over so
he<00:03:34.319> could<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:35.810> positioning<00:03:36.810> his<00:03:36.959> barracks<00:03:37.349> in

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
he could be positioning his barracks in

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.670 
he could be positioning his barracks in
a<00:03:37.799> way<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.579> he<00:03:38.790> could<00:03:39.090> pump<00:03:39.629> marines<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:40.169> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
a way that he could pump marines if the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.430 
a way that he could pump marines if the
opportunity<00:03:41.549> arises<00:03:42.389> you<00:03:42.930> see<00:03:43.230> I'm<00:03:43.349> already

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
opportunity arises you see I'm already

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.210 
opportunity arises you see I'm already
screwing<00:03:43.859> up<00:03:44.010> here<00:03:44.629> yeah<00:03:45.629> if<00:03:46.099> basically<00:03:47.099> if

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
screwing up here yeah if basically if

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.680

he's getting a few suvs over there
pulling<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.109> few<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.980> get<00:04:11.639> that<00:04:11.849> base<00:04:12.180> up<00:04:12.389> in

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
pulling a few to get that base up in

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.439 
pulling a few to get that base up in
mining<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.699> he's<00:04:14.699> going<00:04:14.909> to<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> pretty

here<00:04:17.159> if<00:04:17.519> up<00:04:18.060> magic<00:04:18.419> does<00:04:18.989> not<00:04:19.229> pump<00:04:19.880> well<00:04:20.880> does

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
here if up magic does not pump well does

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.300 
here if up magic does not pump well does
not<00:04:21.150> build<00:04:21.570> his<00:04:21.870> command<00:04:22.199> center<00:04:22.470> here<00:04:22.680> at<00:04:22.860> his

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
not build his command center here at his

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.089 
not build his command center here at his
natural<00:04:23.729> soon<00:04:24.000> he<00:04:24.810> has<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.020> star<00:04:25.500> port<00:04:25.800> coming

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
natural soon he has a star port coming

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.980 
natural soon he has a star port coming
up<00:04:26.219> so<00:04:26.760> he's<00:04:26.909> going<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.300> be<00:04:27.419> able<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.630> come<00:04:27.810> in

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
up so he's going to be able to come in

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.330 
up so he's going to be able to come in
with<00:04:28.080> some<00:04:28.289> race<00:04:28.469> and<00:04:28.740> get<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.889> lot<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.099> damage

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
with some race and get a lot of damage

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.110 
with some race and get a lot of damage
done<00:04:29.610> i<00:04:29.639> think

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
done i think

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.379 
done i think
since<00:04:30.780> ya<00:04:31.380> up<00:04:31.590> magic<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.520> finally<00:04:32.970> scouting

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
since ya up magic is finally scouting

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.230 
since ya up magic is finally scouting
thus<00:04:33.570> he<00:04:33.750> sees<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.710> early<00:04:35.370> base<00:04:35.729> coming<00:04:36.120> up

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
thus he sees that early base coming up

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.689 
thus he sees that early base coming up
for<00:04:36.660> kannada<00:04:37.320> so<00:04:37.830> he<00:04:37.919> definitely<00:04:38.130> knows<00:04:38.490> this

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
for kannada so he definitely knows this

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.939 
for kannada so he definitely knows this
is<00:04:38.880> coming<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.360> he<00:04:39.479> might<00:04:39.840> be<00:04:39.990> going<00:04:40.590> in<00:04:40.800> soon

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
is coming so he might be going in soon

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.409 
is coming so he might be going in soon
yeah<00:04:41.190> he's<00:04:41.340> going<00:04:41.610> in<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.880> do<00:04:42.000> some<00:04:42.030> early

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
yeah he's going in to do some early

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.870 
yeah he's going in to do some early
pressure<00:04:42.690> here<00:04:43.110> he<00:04:43.560> has<00:04:43.680> one<00:04:44.190> factory<00:04:44.699> and

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
pressure here he has one factory and

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.310 
pressure here he has one factory and
he's<00:04:44.970> going<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.270> have<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.389> star<00:04:45.660> port<00:04:45.900> soon<00:04:46.110> so

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
he's going to have a star port soon so

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.840 
he's going to have a star port soon so
it<00:04:46.440> could<00:04:46.560> be<00:04:46.590> throwing<00:04:46.919> all<00:04:47.130> of<00:04:47.190> his<00:04:47.490> units

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
it could be throwing all of his units

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.870 
it could be throwing all of his units
just<00:04:48.270> rallying<00:04:48.870> all<00:04:49.110> of<00:04:49.290> those<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:50.250> the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
just rallying all of those to the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.670 
just rallying all of those to the
natural<00:04:51.300> expansion<00:04:51.600> of<00:04:51.930> Kannada<00:04:52.229> here<00:04:52.500> and

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
natural expansion of Kannada here and

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.409 
natural expansion of Kannada here and
Kannada<00:04:53.310> is<00:04:53.490> going<00:04:53.699> to<00:04:53.790> be<00:04:53.880> prepared<00:04:54.210> he's

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
Kannada is going to be prepared he's

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.980 
Kannada is going to be prepared he's
building<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.810> bunker<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.290> he<00:04:55.770> put<00:04:56.040> a<00:04:56.070> couple<00:04:56.430> of

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
building a bunker and he put a couple of

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.870 
building a bunker and he put a couple of
Marines<00:04:57.990> in<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.440> bunker<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:58.949> I<00:04:59.220> don't<00:04:59.760> think

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
Marines in that bunker so I don't think

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.610 
Marines in that bunker so I don't think
he's<00:04:59.970> gonna<00:05:00.120> have<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.389> problem<00:05:00.690> defending<00:05:01.530> that

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
he's gonna have a problem defending that

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.580 
he's gonna have a problem defending that
new<00:05:01.800> base<00:05:02.010> this<00:05:02.789> is<00:05:03.030> looking<00:05:03.510> pretty<00:05:03.570> bad<00:05:03.960> for

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
new base this is looking pretty bad for

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.770 
new base this is looking pretty bad for
up<00:05:04.740> magic<00:05:05.070> already<00:05:05.370> up<00:05:05.639> magic<00:05:06.000> I<00:05:06.150> think<00:05:06.479> needs

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
up magic already up magic I think needs

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.469 
up magic already up magic I think needs
to<00:05:06.870> throw<00:05:07.169> down<00:05:07.380> his<00:05:07.919> base<00:05:08.280> here<00:05:08.610> he's<00:05:09.240> still

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
to throw down his base here he's still

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.310 
to throw down his base here he's still
working<00:05:09.810> off<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:09.960> one<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:11.630> I'm<00:05:12.630> not<00:05:12.900> exactly

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
working off of one and I'm not exactly

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.719 
working off of one and I'm not exactly
sure<00:05:13.470> what<00:05:13.889> he's<00:05:14.039> going<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.250> pump<00:05:14.460> from<00:05:14.580> that

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
sure what he's going to pump from that

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.879 
sure what he's going to pump from that
factory<00:05:15.120> if<00:05:15.300> he<00:05:15.419> goes<00:05:15.630> for<00:05:15.990> some<00:05:16.710> quick

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.960 
from his barracks so he's just going to
push<00:05:34.349> with<00:05:34.530> all<00:05:34.560> kinds<00:05:35.190> of<00:05:35.250> troops<00:05:35.520> here<00:05:35.729> soon

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
push with all kinds of troops here soon

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.339 
push with all kinds of troops here soon
to<00:05:36.210> try<00:05:36.660> to<00:05:36.720> break<00:05:36.930> through<00:05:37.139> the<00:05:37.229> natural

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
to try to break through the natural

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.950 
to try to break through the natural
expansion<00:05:37.800> of<00:05:38.220> konata<00:05:39.030> but<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:39.300> think<00:05:39.570> it<00:05:39.690> could

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
expansion of konata but I think it could

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.020 
expansion of konata but I think it could
be<00:05:40.169> too<00:05:40.380> late<00:05:40.410> kannada<00:05:41.250> is<00:05:41.370> building<00:05:41.700> a<00:05:41.789> pretty

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
be too late kannada is building a pretty

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.200 
be too late kannada is building a pretty
good<00:05:42.210> defense<00:05:42.330> at<00:05:42.690> home<00:05:42.840> and<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:45.060> Wraith

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
good defense at home and the Wraith

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.120 
good defense at home and the Wraith
coming<00:05:45.539> up<00:05:45.630> here<00:05:45.870> more<00:05:46.470> Marines<00:05:46.770> are<00:05:46.919> going<00:05:47.070> to

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
coming up here more Marines are going to

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.860 
coming up here more Marines are going to
come<00:05:47.280> up<00:05:47.430> soon<00:05:47.700> and<00:05:47.970> this<00:05:48.360> is<00:05:48.510> going<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.780> be

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
come up soon and this is going to be

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.110 
come up soon and this is going to be
pretty<00:05:49.050> bizarre<00:05:49.320> but<00:05:49.800> I<00:05:49.979> think<00:05:50.370> up<00:05:50.520> magic<00:05:51.000> is

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
pretty bizarre but I think up magic is

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.629 
pretty bizarre but I think up magic is
going<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.450> try<00:05:51.599> to<00:05:51.630> break<00:05:51.870> through<00:05:52.139> here<00:05:52.639> he

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
going to try to break through here he

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.190 
going to try to break through here he
just<00:05:53.849> definitely<00:05:54.240> doesn't<00:05:54.450> have<00:05:54.599> cool<00:05:54.810> cloak

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
just definitely doesn't have cool cloak

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.779 
just definitely doesn't have cool cloak
yet<00:05:55.410> because<00:05:55.710> he<00:05:55.830> did<00:05:56.039> not<00:05:56.070> put<00:05:56.430> down<00:05:56.460> his

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
yet because he did not put down his

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.120 
yet because he did not put down his
control<00:05:57.539> tower<00:05:57.780> but<00:05:58.380> he's<00:05:58.470> coming<00:05:58.770> up<00:05:58.860> with

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
control tower but he's coming up with

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.420 
control tower but he's coming up with
some<00:05:59.539> SUVs<00:06:00.539> as<00:06:01.139> well<00:06:01.380> with<00:06:01.590> a<00:06:01.620> couple<00:06:01.949> of<00:06:01.979> tanks

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
some SUVs as well with a couple of tanks

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.779 
some SUVs as well with a couple of tanks
and<00:06:02.690> four<00:06:03.690> Marines<00:06:04.560> I<00:06:04.800> believe<00:06:05.130> so<00:06:05.430> yeah<00:06:05.639> he's

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
and four Marines I believe so yeah he's

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.100 
and four Marines I believe so yeah he's
going<00:06:05.940> to<00:06:06.000> try<00:06:06.180> to<00:06:06.210> break<00:06:06.449> through<00:06:06.690> here<00:06:06.960> in

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
going to try to break through here in

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.740 
going to try to break through here in
Kannada<00:06:08.099> I<00:06:08.430> think<00:06:08.789> he<00:06:08.910> might<00:06:09.120> have<00:06:09.180> cancelled

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
Kannada I think he might have cancelled

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.110 
Kannada I think he might have cancelled
a<00:06:09.810> star<00:06:10.050> port<00:06:10.289> there<00:06:10.470> may<00:06:10.620> be<00:06:10.650> a<00:06:11.250> second<00:06:11.940> star

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
a star port there may be a second star

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.670 
a star port there may be a second star
port<00:06:12.360> that<00:06:12.449> he<00:06:12.539> might<00:06:12.720> have<00:06:12.810> built<00:06:12.990> but<00:06:13.530> yeah

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
port that he might have built but yeah

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.140 
port that he might have built but yeah
kannada<00:06:13.979> is<00:06:14.099> going<00:06:14.280> to<00:06:14.370> have<00:06:14.460> race<00:06:14.760> out<00:06:14.970> here
