last fall when I was getting ready to go

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.450 
last fall when I was getting ready to go
on<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> trip<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.100> folks<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.640> verbatim<00:00:36.570> sent<00:00:37.050> me

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
on a trip the folks at verbatim sent me

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.639 
on a trip the folks at verbatim sent me
what<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.610> call<00:00:38.879> their<00:00:39.149> store<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.719> go<00:00:39.930> which

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
what they call their store and go which

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.940 
what they call their store and go which
is<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> really<00:00:41.219> nice<00:00:41.969> little<00:00:42.809> portable<00:00:43.620> hard

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
is a really nice little portable hard

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
is a really nice little portable hard
drive<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> lot<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:47.510> said<00:00:48.510> it's

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
drive and I like it a lot I said it's

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.010 
drive and I like it a lot I said it's
called<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> store<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:50.039> thin<00:00:51.020> they

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
called the store and go it's thin they

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.869 
called the store and go it's thin they
probably<00:00:52.379> make<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> couple<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.370> thinner

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
probably make a couple that are thinner

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.130 
probably make a couple that are thinner
but<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:55.050> having<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:56.449> fatal<00:00:57.449> massive

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
but it's not like having a fatal massive

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.819 
but it's not like having a fatal massive
hard<00:00:58.410> drive<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.270> internal<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.829> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
hard drive like this internal one and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.870 
hard drive like this internal one and
the<00:01:02.460> great<00:01:02.789> thing<00:01:02.820> about<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.880> self

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the great thing about it is that it self

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.810 
the great thing about it is that it self
powered<00:01:06.180> or<00:01:06.689> powered<00:01:07.409> via<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.100> firewire<00:01:08.549> or

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
powered or powered via the firewire or

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.719 
powered or powered via the firewire or
USB<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> don't<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.130> carry<00:01:11.340> around<00:01:11.400> a
