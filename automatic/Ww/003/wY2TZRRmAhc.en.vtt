similar<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:42.209> first<00:03:42.390> game<00:03:42.629> but<00:03:42.810> just

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
similar to the first game but just

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.240 
similar to the first game but just
really<00:03:43.170> all<00:03:43.290> falling<00:03:43.590> flat<00:03:43.799> he<00:03:43.980> was<00:03:44.069> getting

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
really all falling flat he was getting

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.039 
really all falling flat he was getting
pile<00:03:44.430> drived<00:03:44.700> sliding<00:03:45.569> at<00:03:45.659> all<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.959> wrong

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
times well there there was some mix ups

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.000 
times well there there was some mix ups
that<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:48.959> think<00:03:49.230> last<00:03:49.379> metro<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.709> just<00:03:49.859> gets

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010
