 to have an airline be 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.899
 interested in the connection between abidjan 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.820

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.390
 necessary regulation and there I have 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.520

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.990
 excellence mister president the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.480
 Republic 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.740
 then we will train to inform 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.510
 the police informed the police 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.160
 to form the stop zone and we have 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.110
 at the freight level all x-rays 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.940
 necessary to such an extent that we do 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.080
 a control 100% of freight old 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.510
 man wanted is security 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.940
 to have fun and it wants to know it's so 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.830
 ivory coast civil aviation has the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.600
 ability to properly supervise security 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.590
 the security of civil aviation we 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.420
 are given until August to have 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.840
 attains security levels 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.540
 I would say good and then the avenue 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.260
 the tsa after leading so the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.970
 third action 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.739
 so the third component that has some 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.060
 interests it's a company at the line 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.430
 between abidjan than new york 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.110
 the certification of the airport Félix 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.130
 houphouet boigny nothing is neglected for 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.340
 get there 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.810
 what we did is take it 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.739
 all the provisions for that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.350
 actually security and insults 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.100
 airborne is a reality at the 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:23.160
 of abidjan and the audits that we come 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.330
 to pass successfully attests the work 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.430
 that has been accomplished 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.790
 today there are only the assigns 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.470
 right which has the cases the southern access the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.900
 airport platform 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.690
 and it's very optimistic and I think 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.049
 by the end of 2013 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.600
 and logically the airport than waves 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.160
 with this effect we have never been so 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.070
 well placed international airport 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.640
 felix houphouet boigny in 2010 to support 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.799
 962 me their passengers be 50% more 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.450
 than in 2011 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.880
 the target is 1 million 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.800
 passengers in 2013 and over the years 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.920
 inventor what should favor 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.050
 getting the certification and so 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.630
 the arrival of American companies in 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.830
 direct flight to abidjan the ivory coast has 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.720
 a lot to gain 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.900
 if youyous airport sets you off 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.240
 rather to go to Paris to go 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.709
 in the united states we are going on a flight 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:22.050
 live from abyan it's us us 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.900
 We want our airport to be 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.930
 yesterday for actually the politics of 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.720
 open sky and that we have more 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.150
 that today can allow 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.450
 Ivorians to travel all over the 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.370
 world unless a lot to arrive 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.690
 there hurdles went go on the 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.300
 way of certification 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.790
 the government through the anac to 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.670
 seattle has and hopes to see the street door of 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.090
 this fake banker certified before the end of 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.090
 this year
