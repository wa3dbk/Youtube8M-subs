well<00:04:02.439> I<00:04:02.620> just<00:04:03.060> had<00:04:04.060> my<00:04:04.329> master<00:04:04.959> in<00:04:05.430> criminology

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.809 
well I just had my master in criminology
and<00:04:07.269> now<00:04:07.450> i'm<00:04:07.659> studying<00:04:08.400> subject<00:04:09.400> management
