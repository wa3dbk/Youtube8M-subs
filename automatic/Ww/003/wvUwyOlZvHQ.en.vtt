00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
not really that dark around there so I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.350 
not really that dark around there so I
usually<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:24.080> put<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.190> up<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.610> nulls<00:02:25.849> I

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
usually just put it up in the nulls I

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.620 
usually just put it up in the nulls I
know<00:02:27.170> it's<00:02:27.440> not<00:02:27.500> exactly<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:28.160> dark<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.209> would

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
know it's not exactly that dark I would

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.670 
know it's not exactly that dark I would
make<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.959> like<00:02:30.550> like<00:02:31.550> his<00:02:32.170> shaved<00:02:33.170> beard<00:02:33.440> if<00:02:33.620> I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
make it like like his shaved beard if I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.430 
make it like like his shaved beard if I
could<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.780> we're<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:35.810> gonna<00:02:35.959> keep<00:02:36.080> like

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
could but we're just gonna keep like

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.140 
could but we're just gonna keep like
that<00:02:36.650> cuz<00:02:36.920> if<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.129> look<00:02:37.310> at<00:02:37.459> really<00:02:37.790> closely

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
that cuz if you look at really closely

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.180 
that cuz if you look at really closely
at<00:02:38.450> him<00:02:38.599> he<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:39.049> can<00:02:39.230> tell<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.650> does<00:02:39.830> kind<00:02:40.130> of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
at him he you can tell it does kind of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.490 
at him he you can tell it does kind of
go<00:02:40.370> up<00:02:40.459> into<00:02:40.670> wine<00:02:40.880> like<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:44.049> I<00:02:47.500> guess

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
go up into wine like that and I guess

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.589 
go up into wine like that and I guess
the<00:02:48.680> color<00:02:48.920> doesn't<00:02:49.190> really<00:02:50.090> matter<00:02:50.329> I<00:02:50.569> guess

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
the color doesn't really matter I guess

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.900 
the color doesn't really matter I guess
if<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.470> wanted<00:02:51.769> to<00:02:51.980> we<00:02:52.160> can<00:02:52.280> make<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.579> gray<00:02:52.849> so

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
if you wanted to we can make it gray so

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.819 
if you wanted to we can make it gray so
it<00:02:53.209> blends<00:02:53.420> in<00:02:53.540> with<00:02:53.660> this<00:02:54.970> but<00:02:55.970> um<00:02:56.739> I'm<00:02:57.739> just

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829
