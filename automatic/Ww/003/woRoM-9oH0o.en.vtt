in this video I'll show you the changes

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.789 
in this video I'll show you the changes
for<00:00:02.129> overgrowth<00:00:02.550> alpha<00:00:03.049> 117<00:00:04.049> which<00:00:04.470> you<00:00:04.680> can

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
for overgrowth alpha 117 which you can

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.070 
for overgrowth alpha 117 which you can
try<00:00:04.980> if<00:00:05.160> you've<00:00:05.339> pre-ordered<00:00:05.910> this<00:00:06.509> week<00:00:06.779> have

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
to make sure the characters seem more

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.230

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
to test that out the main character

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.720 
to test that out the main character
looks<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> direction<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> camera

looks in the direction of the camera

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.060 
looks in the direction of the camera
when<00:00:27.269> idle<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.810> looks<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.380> enemy<00:00:28.680> characters

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
when idle and looks at enemy characters

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.160 
when idle and looks at enemy characters
when<00:00:29.279> they're<00:00:29.400> nearby<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.330> second<00:00:30.689> animation

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
when they're nearby the second animation

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.319 
when they're nearby the second animation
feature<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.710> eye<00:00:32.099> movement<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.850> blinking

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
feature is eye movement and blinking

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.780 
feature is eye movement and blinking
when<00:00:34.140> characters<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.710> idle<00:00:35.040> they<00:00:35.520> blink

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
when characters are idle they blink

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.490 
when characters are idle they blink
occasionally<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.600> look<00:00:36.960> around<00:00:37.110> in

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
occasionally and look around in

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.229 
occasionally and look around in
different<00:00:37.800> directions<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.670> easy<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.059> tell

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
different directions it's easy to tell

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.729 
different directions it's easy to tell
where<00:00:39.390> predators<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:40.050> looking<00:00:40.379> because

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
where predators are looking because

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.139 
where predators are looking because
they're<00:00:41.100> relatively<00:00:41.489> human-like

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
they're relatively human-like

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.990 
they're relatively human-like
front-facing<00:00:42.809> eyes<00:00:43.340> rabbits<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> other<00:00:44.640> prey

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
front-facing eyes rabbits and other prey

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.940 
front-facing eyes rabbits and other prey
animals<00:00:45.420> tend<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.050> big<00:00:46.260> dark<00:00:46.530> side

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
animals tend to have big dark side

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.860 
animals tend to have big dark side
facing<00:00:47.370> eyes<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:47.910> harder<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> read<00:00:48.480> but

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
facing eyes that are harder to read but

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.240 
facing eyes that are harder to read but
I<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> eye<00:00:49.260> movement<00:00:49.829> still<00:00:49.980> gives

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
I think the eye movement still gives

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.819 
I think the eye movement still gives
them<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.700> lot<00:00:51.030> more<00:00:51.239> life<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.530> partly

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
them a lot more life this is partly

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.049 
them a lot more life this is partly
because<00:00:52.920> they're<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.460> focused<00:00:53.910> on

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
because they're really focused on

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.430 
because they're really focused on
getting<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.390> movement<00:00:54.719> right<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> area

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
getting the movement right in the area

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.799 
getting the movement right in the area
surrounding<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.309> eye<00:00:56.430> rather<00:00:57.149> than<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
surrounding the eye rather than just the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
surrounding the eye rather than just the
eye<00:00:57.840> itself<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.680> example<00:00:59.100> even<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.550> turn

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
eye itself for example even if I turn

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.670 
eye itself for example even if I turn
off<00:00:59.850> his<00:01:00.030> color<00:01:00.270> map<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> still<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
off his color map you can still see the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680 
off his color map you can still see the
eye<00:01:01.710> moving<00:01:02.070> around<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.760> by<00:01:03.120> looking<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
eye moving around just by looking at the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.250 
eye moving around just by looking at the
eyelid<00:01:04.049> motion

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
eyelid motion

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.650 
eyelid motion
the<00:01:06.950> last<00:01:07.160> animation<00:01:07.670> feature<00:01:07.910> I<00:01:08.030> was<00:01:08.300> testing

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
the last animation feature I was testing

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.860 
the last animation feature I was testing
out<00:01:08.750> is<00:01:09.050> automatic<00:01:10.010> lip-sync<00:01:10.630> using<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.720> ANA

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
out is automatic lip-sync using the ANA

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.010 
out is automatic lip-sync using the ANA
soft<00:01:12.230> lip<00:01:12.620> sync<00:01:12.920> tool<00:01:13.510> it<00:01:14.510> actually<00:01:14.840> does<00:01:14.990> a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
soft lip sync tool it actually does a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.450 
soft lip sync tool it actually does a
pretty<00:01:15.230> good<00:01:15.320> job<00:01:15.470> even<00:01:16.250> though<00:01:16.340> it

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
pretty good job even though it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.360 
pretty good job even though it
recommends<00:01:17.060> 17<00:01:17.750> mouth<00:01:18.110> blend<00:01:18.440> shapes<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.010> I

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
recommends 17 mouth blend shapes and I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.440 
recommends 17 mouth blend shapes and I
only<00:01:19.520> added<00:01:19.850> three<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:20.270> far<00:01:20.480> I<00:01:22.450> haven't

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
only added three so far I haven't

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.330 
only added three so far I haven't
decided<00:01:23.660> how<00:01:23.930> much<00:01:24.110> voice<00:01:24.350> acting<00:01:24.770> we<00:01:24.860> want<00:01:25.070> if

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
decided how much voice acting we want if

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.060 
decided how much voice acting we want if
any<00:01:25.810> but<00:01:26.810> I'm<00:01:27.110> experimenting<00:01:27.470> with<00:01:27.950> the

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
any but I'm experimenting with the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.160 
any but I'm experimenting with the
technology<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:29.000> see<00:01:29.150> what's<00:01:29.330> possible<00:01:29.510> if<00:01:29.990> you

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
technology to see what's possible if you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.480 
technology to see what's possible if you
want<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.470> test<00:01:30.650> out<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.950> lip<00:01:31.100> sync<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.400> the
