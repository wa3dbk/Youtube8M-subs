00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
landscape fabric to join we just pinned

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.220 
landscape fabric to join we just pinned

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.249 
receded alright so that's from that
angle<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.909> when<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.240> stained<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.780> same<00:02:06.990> color

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
angle and when it stained the same color

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.059 
angle and when it stained the same color
as<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> deck<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:08.129> it'll<00:02:08.310> look<00:02:08.459> pretty<00:02:08.789> good

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
as a deck I think it'll look pretty good

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.539 
as a deck I think it'll look pretty good
ten<00:02:10.399> then<00:02:10.610> from<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.239> angle<00:02:11.510> here<00:02:12.549> when

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
ten then from this angle here when

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.240 
ten then from this angle here when
everything<00:02:13.819> is<00:02:14.120> leafed<00:02:14.390> out<00:02:15.129> sort<00:02:16.129> of

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
everything is leafed out sort of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.649 
everything is leafed out sort of
irritates<00:02:16.670> me<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.849> little<00:02:17.060> bit<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:17.510> not

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
irritates me a little bit that it's not

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.390 
irritates me a little bit that it's not
all<00:02:17.810> perfectly<00:02:18.349> level<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.860> because<00:02:19.129> it's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
all perfectly level going because it's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.970 
all perfectly level going because it's
heading<00:02:19.760> downward<00:02:20.209> but<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:21.049> think<00:02:21.680> when<00:02:21.829> all

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
heading downward but I think when all

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.550 
heading downward but I think when all
the<00:02:22.099> bushes<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.519> everything<00:02:22.879> are<00:02:23.000> leafed<00:02:23.180> out

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the bushes and everything are leafed out

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.350 
the bushes and everything are leafed out
everything<00:02:24.560> should<00:02:24.739> look<00:02:24.890> good<00:02:25.129> as<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.180> got

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
everything should look good as we got

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.300 
everything should look good as we got
this<00:02:26.510> rock<00:02:26.810> garden<00:02:27.230> here<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.530> think<00:02:27.799> I<00:02:27.920> do<00:02:27.980> need

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
this rock garden here I think I do need

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.979 
this rock garden here I think I do need
to<00:02:28.430> place<00:02:28.640> another<00:02:28.970> large<00:02:29.269> rock<00:02:29.599> in<00:02:29.810> this

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
to place another large rock in this

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.979 
to place another large rock in this
empty<00:02:30.440> spot<00:02:30.769> here<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.629> because<00:02:32.629> this<00:02:32.780> is

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
empty spot here so that because this is

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.199 
empty spot here so that because this is
like<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> natural<00:02:33.500> rock<00:02:33.860> garden<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:35.030> need

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
like a natural rock garden and I need

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.349 
like a natural rock garden and I need
some<00:02:35.480> balance<00:02:35.799> right<00:02:36.799> here<00:02:37.159> so<00:02:37.970> I'll<00:02:38.150> put<00:02:38.329> a

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
some balance right here so I'll put a

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.869 
some balance right here so I'll put a
rock<00:02:38.599> there<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.530> that's<00:02:40.040> how<00:02:40.189> it's<00:02:40.340> looking<00:02:40.609> so

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
rock there so that's how it's looking so

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:47.050 
rock there so that's how it's looking so
far<00:02:43.720> just<00:02:44.720> pan<00:02:45.079> around<00:02:45.379> there<00:02:45.859> and<00:02:46.159> you<00:02:46.909> can

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
far just pan around there and you can

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.250 
far just pan around there and you can
see<00:02:47.209> some<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.599> landscape<00:02:48.049> fabric

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
see some of the landscape fabric

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.020 
see some of the landscape fabric
sticking<00:02:48.739> up<00:02:48.859> right<00:02:49.069> there<00:02:49.310> where<00:02:49.549> we<00:02:49.639> stapled

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
sticking up right there where we stapled

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.490 
sticking up right there where we stapled
it<00:02:50.150> on<00:02:52.959> there<00:02:53.959> we<00:02:54.079> go

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
it on there we go

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.420 
it on there we go
so<00:02:55.280> anyway<00:02:55.940> next<00:02:56.750> step<00:02:57.049> is<00:02:57.409> to<00:02:57.889> install<00:02:58.280> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
so anyway next step is to install the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.309 
so anyway next step is to install the
erver<00:02:58.909> and<00:02:59.150> hopefully<00:02:59.629> we'll<00:02:59.810> be<00:02:59.840> doing<00:03:00.170> that

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
erver and hopefully we'll be doing that

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.149 
erver and hopefully we'll be doing that
today<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.730> I'll<00:03:02.060> add<00:03:02.389> that<00:03:02.420> in<00:03:02.840> if<00:03:02.959> we<00:03:03.109> do<00:03:03.290> okay

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
today so I'll add that in if we do okay

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.940 
today so I'll add that in if we do okay
