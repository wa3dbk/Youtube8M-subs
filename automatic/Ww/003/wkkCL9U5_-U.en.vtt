Thor's hammer running eighty thousand
volts<00:00:21.390> through<00:00:21.930> Thor's<00:00:22.380> hammer<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> thought

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
volts through Thor's hammer so I thought

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
volts through Thor's hammer so I thought

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
claws let's take a look the heart of

claws let's take a look the heart of
this<00:00:32.850> project<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.809> transformer<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.770> pulled

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this project is a transformer I pulled

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:59.280 
this project is a transformer I pulled
from<00:00:35.309> an<00:00:35.430> oil<00:00:35.610> furnace<00:00:38.059> let's<00:00:39.059> give<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.420> shot

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.140 

to<00:01:00.290> be<00:01:00.410> honest<00:01:00.739> I'm<00:01:01.010> not<00:01:01.070> too<00:01:01.220> sure<00:01:01.700> how<00:01:01.730> many

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
to be honest I'm not too sure how many

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.450 
to be honest I'm not too sure how many
volts<00:01:02.330> this<00:01:02.600> transformer<00:01:03.200> puts<00:01:03.410> out<00:01:03.620> it's

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
volts this transformer puts out it's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:16.840 
volts this transformer puts out it's
certainly<00:01:04.760> enough<00:01:05.000> for<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.239> light<00:01:05.390> show

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.310 

and<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:17.940> you<00:01:18.030> angle<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.480> just<00:01:18.750> right

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and if you angle them just right

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.810 
and if you angle them just right
you<00:01:19.440> can<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> Jacob's<00:01:20.160> Ladder<00:01:20.340> effect

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you can get a Jacob's Ladder effect

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:49.160 
you can get a Jacob's Ladder effect
going<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:47.090> well<00:01:48.090> there<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.870> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
going on well there you have it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.740 
going on well there you have it
electrified<00:01:49.979> Wolverine<00:01:50.490> claws<00:01:50.640> these<00:01:51.600> would

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
electrified Wolverine claws these would

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.979 
electrified Wolverine claws these would
certainly<00:01:52.080> ruin<00:01:52.440> someone's<00:01:52.800> day
