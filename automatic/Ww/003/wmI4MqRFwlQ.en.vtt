didn't and I had to be explained this
before<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> even<00:00:40.800> understood<00:00:41.460> because<00:00:41.970> I<00:00:42.000> was

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
before I even understood because I was

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.940 
before I even understood because I was
suspicious<00:00:42.630> my<00:00:43.020> transmission<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.770> not

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
suspicious my transmission was not

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.150 
suspicious my transmission was not
behaving<00:00:44.160> properly<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:46.320> transmission<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
behaving properly the transmission in a

behaving properly the transmission in a
Porsche<00:00:47.400> 928<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> same<00:00:48.990> as<00:00:49.260> most<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
Porsche 928 is not the same as most that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.270 
Porsche 928 is not the same as most that
you<00:00:50.130> would<00:00:50.250> expect<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:51.170> an<00:00:52.170> American<00:00:52.680> car<00:00:52.920> or

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
you would expect like an American car or

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.720 
you would expect like an American car or
whatever<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> same<00:00:55.520> first<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
whatever it's just not the same first of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.660 
whatever it's just not the same first of
all<00:00:56.880> when<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.990> put<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.410> car<00:00:58.650> in<00:00:58.830> drive<00:00:58.860> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
all when you put the car in drive and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.140 
all when you put the car in drive and
drive<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:00.600> normally<00:01:01.080> it<00:01:02.070> will<00:01:02.250> always<00:01:02.550> start

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
drive it normally it will always start

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.980 
drive it normally it will always start
out<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.660> second<00:01:04.759> then<00:01:05.759> shift<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.359> third<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
out in second then shift to third and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.660 
out in second then shift to third and
then<00:01:07.200> shift<00:01:07.499> the<00:01:07.649> fourth<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
then shift the fourth as you get to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.010 
then shift the fourth as you get to
speed<00:01:08.999> it<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.420> 4-speed<00:01:10.079> transmission<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.689> if

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
speed it is a 4-speed transmission so if

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.099 
speed it is a 4-speed transmission so if
you<00:01:13.380> want<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.679> accelerate<00:01:14.039> hard<00:01:14.960> for<00:01:15.960> either

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
you want to accelerate hard for either

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.950 
you want to accelerate hard for either
just<00:01:16.590> drag<00:01:16.950> racing<00:01:17.490> zero<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.969> a<00:01:18.090> hundred<00:01:18.299> tests

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
just drag racing zero to a hundred tests

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.380 
just drag racing zero to a hundred tests
or<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.859> to<00:01:20.009> feel<00:01:20.249> the<00:01:20.280> fun<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.210> high

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
or just to feel the fun of a high

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.770 
or just to feel the fun of a high
performance<00:01:22.020> acceleration<00:01:22.939> then<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.509> in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
performance acceleration then if it's in

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.630 
performance acceleration then if it's in
Drive<00:01:25.079> and<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.740> start<00:01:26.039> from<00:01:26.219> a<00:01:26.369> standstill

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
Drive and you start from a standstill

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.200 
Drive and you start from a standstill
and<00:01:27.210> floor<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.520> start<00:01:29.819> out<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
and floor it it will start out in a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.919 
and floor it it will start out in a
second

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
second

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.849 
second
it<00:01:31.499> will<00:01:31.829> shift<00:01:32.159> early<00:01:32.670> into<00:01:33.539> third<00:01:33.929> it'll

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
it will shift early into third it'll

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.730 
it will shift early into third it'll
shift<00:01:35.069> early<00:01:35.429> into<00:01:36.090> fourth<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.350> you're<00:01:37.590> not

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
shift early into fourth so you're not

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.709 
shift early into fourth so you're not
getting<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.249> RPMs<00:01:38.759> out<00:01:38.999> of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.149> motor<00:01:39.359> to<00:01:39.569> go

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
getting the RPMs out of the motor to go

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.419 
getting the RPMs out of the motor to go
through<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.139> highest<00:01:40.319> power<00:01:40.770> band<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
through the highest power band and

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.279 
through the highest power band and
you're<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:42.149> getting<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> performance<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
you're not getting the performance that

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.550 
you're not getting the performance that
you<00:01:43.439> want<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:44.159> fast<00:01:44.520> acceleration<00:01:45.560> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you want for fast acceleration the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
you want for fast acceleration the
transmission<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.429> designed<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.299> way<00:01:48.539> so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
transmission is designed that way so

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.010 
transmission is designed that way so
that<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.109> both<00:01:49.319> a<00:01:49.560> luxury<00:01:50.009> car<00:01:50.509> smooth<00:01:51.509> easy

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that it's both a luxury car smooth easy

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.830 
that it's both a luxury car smooth easy
driving<00:01:52.590> car<00:01:53.039> but<00:01:53.789> it<00:01:53.880> also<00:01:54.060> has<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.719> ability

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
driving car but it also has the ability

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.730 
driving car but it also has the ability
to<00:01:55.319> be<00:01:55.679> a<00:01:55.709> high-performance<00:01:56.579> street<00:01:56.939> racer

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
to be a high-performance street racer

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.559 
to be a high-performance street racer
now<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> drive<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.429> a<00:01:59.490> street<00:01:59.909> racer<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
now to drive it like a street racer and

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.330 
now to drive it like a street racer and
get<00:02:00.779> the<00:02:00.899> most<00:02:01.109> performance<00:02:01.889> out<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.100> your

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
get the most performance out of your

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.800 
get the most performance out of your
transmission<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.779> is<00:02:04.020> how<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.469> done

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
transmission this is how it's done

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.080 
transmission this is how it's done
it<00:02:06.810> only<00:02:07.049> has<00:02:07.729> second<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:08.940> its<00:02:09.450> lowest<00:02:10.069> option

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
it only has second as its lowest option

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.320 
it only has second as its lowest option
not<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> first

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
not a first

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.310 
not a first
so<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.050> put<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.590> second<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.810> floor<00:02:17.170> it

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
so you put it in second and you floor it

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.360 
so you put it in second and you floor it
and<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:18.490> will<00:02:18.610> start<00:02:19.030> out<00:02:19.210> in<00:02:19.450> first<00:02:20.340> now<00:02:21.340> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and it will start out in first now you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.900 
and it will start out in first now you
you<00:02:22.120> wait<00:02:22.420> until<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.380> goes<00:02:23.560> into<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.340> red<00:02:24.370> line

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
you wait until it goes into the red line

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.290 
you wait until it goes into the red line
and<00:02:25.290> then<00:02:26.290> by<00:02:26.560> itself<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:27.310> will<00:02:27.430> hesitate<00:02:27.670> just

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
and then by itself it will hesitate just

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.390 
and then by itself it will hesitate just
for<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> second<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.080> then<00:02:29.290> by<00:02:29.500> itself<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:30.220> will

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
for a second and then by itself it will

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.550 
for a second and then by itself it will
shift<00:02:30.700> into<00:02:30.970> second<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.660> launch<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.380> car

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
shift into second and launch the car

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.440 
shift into second and launch the car
forward<00:02:33.480> then<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.870> wait<00:02:35.380> in<00:02:36.160> second<00:02:36.820> until<00:02:37.300> it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
forward then you wait in second until it

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.140 
forward then you wait in second until it
hits<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.930> red<00:02:38.110> line<00:02:38.380> again<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.970> you

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
hits the red line again and then you

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.180 
hits the red line again and then you
bump<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.600> into<00:02:40.690> third<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.440> it'll<00:02:41.620> shift<00:02:41.800> into

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
bump it into third and it'll shift into

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.640 
bump it into third and it'll shift into
third<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:43.960> you<00:02:44.110> want<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.410> keep

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
third now if you want to keep

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.370 
third now if you want to keep
accelerating<00:02:45.100> even<00:02:45.670> faster<00:02:46.360> keep<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.260> in

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
accelerating even faster keep it in

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.620 
accelerating even faster keep it in
third<00:02:47.710> until<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.400> hit<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.820> red<00:02:49.000> line<00:02:49.270> again

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
third until you hit the red line again

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.250 
third until you hit the red line again
and<00:02:49.870> then<00:02:50.530> bump<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:50.980> into<00:02:51.070> fourth<00:02:51.900> now<00:02:52.900> by<00:02:53.080> this

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
and then bump it into fourth now by this

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.170 
and then bump it into fourth now by this
time<00:02:53.530> you'll<00:02:53.710> probably<00:02:53.920> be<00:02:54.160> going<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:54.760> 50

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
time you'll probably be going on in 50

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.240 
time you'll probably be going on in 50
kilometers<00:02:55.600> an<00:02:55.750> hour<00:02:55.870> or<00:02:56.200> faster<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:57.010> this

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
kilometers an hour or faster and this

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.100 
kilometers an hour or faster and this
all<00:02:57.460> happens<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.150> very<00:02:58.300> short<00:02:58.720> period<00:02:58.930> of

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
all happens in a very short period of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.390 
all happens in a very short period of
time<00:02:59.760> now<00:03:00.760> myself<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.570> do<00:03:01.690> not<00:03:02.020> like<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:03.040> put<00:03:03.280> it

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
time now myself I do not like to put it

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.700 
time now myself I do not like to put it
into<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.820> red<00:03:04.000> line<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:04.570> like<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.110> shift<00:03:05.350> just

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
into the red line I like to shift just

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.340 
into the red line I like to shift just
before<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.340> red<00:03:06.520> line<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.870> how<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.080> do

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
before the red line this is how you do

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.820 
before the red line this is how you do
that<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:10.630> start<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.170> second<00:03:11.680> which<00:03:11.800> is

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
that you start it in second which is

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.650 
that you start it in second which is
actually<00:03:12.370> going<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.580> start<00:03:12.880> in<00:03:13.030> first<00:03:13.270> from<00:03:13.570> a

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
actually going to start in first from a

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.950 
actually going to start in first from a
standstill<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.980> floor<00:03:15.460> it<00:03:15.570> until<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.720> get

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
standstill you floor it until you get

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.280 
standstill you floor it until you get
just<00:03:17.380> before<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.010> red<00:03:18.190> line<00:03:18.750> then<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.959> bump

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
just before the red line then you bump

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.430 
just before the red line then you bump
it<00:03:20.500> into<00:03:20.739> third<00:03:21.390> it'll<00:03:22.390> shift<00:03:22.600> into<00:03:22.959> second

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
it into third it'll shift into second

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.170 
it into third it'll shift into second
and<00:03:23.560> as<00:03:23.709> soon<00:03:23.980> as<00:03:24.070> it's<00:03:24.280> just<00:03:24.370> in<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.730> second<00:03:25.120> you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
and as soon as it's just in a second you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.440 
and as soon as it's just in a second you
pull<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.540> back<00:03:25.570> into<00:03:26.230> second<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.270> then<00:03:28.270> it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
pull it back into second and then it

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.750 
pull it back into second and then it
will<00:03:28.600> hold<00:03:28.900> into<00:03:29.320> second<00:03:29.770> until<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.400> gets<00:03:30.580> the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
will hold into second until it gets the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.760 
will hold into second until it gets the
red<00:03:30.970> line<00:03:31.209> again<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.840> then<00:03:32.170> bump<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.680> into

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
red line again and then bump it into

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.630 
red line again and then bump it into
third<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.810> then<00:03:34.810> it'll<00:03:35.110> go<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.530> same<00:03:36.489> as

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
third and then it'll go the same as

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.970 
third and then it'll go the same as
before<00:03:36.870> it'll<00:03:37.870> shift<00:03:38.020> in<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.350> third<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.920> then

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
before it'll shift in the third and then

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.470 
before it'll shift in the third and then
if<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.250> want<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.550> keep<00:03:39.670> going<00:03:39.880> faster<00:03:40.450> and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
if you want to keep going faster and

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.160 
if you want to keep going faster and
faster<00:03:40.600> do<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.320> same<00:03:41.530> thing<00:03:41.770> as<00:03:41.950> before<00:03:43.170> now

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
faster do the same thing as before now

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.870 
faster do the same thing as before now
one<00:03:44.440> issue<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.830> a<00:03:45.010> lot<00:03:45.070> of<00:03:45.310> people<00:03:45.610> have

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
one issue that a lot of people have

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.280 
one issue that a lot of people have
because<00:03:46.360> then<00:03:46.540> they<00:03:46.690> think<00:03:46.720> their

because then they think their

transmission is dying when this happens

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.880 
transmission is dying when this happens
they<00:03:51.100> get<00:03:51.280> slips<00:03:51.940> or<00:03:52.270> flares<00:03:53.050> in<00:03:53.470> between

you<00:03:59.890> need<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.130> do<00:04:00.630> first<00:04:01.630> check<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.230> fluid

can very severely affect the performance

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.560 
can very severely affect the performance
of<00:04:11.500> these<00:04:11.620> transmissions<00:04:12.370> they're<00:04:13.300> very

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
of these transmissions they're very

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.370 
of these transmissions they're very
sensitive<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.380> fluid<00:04:15.100> level<00:04:16.260> second<00:04:17.260> and

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
sensitive to the fluid level second and

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.310 
sensitive to the fluid level second and
most<00:04:17.530> important<00:04:18.150> locate<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.390> vacuum<00:04:19.870> module

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
most important locate the vacuum module

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.770 
most important locate the vacuum module
which<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.590> on<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:21.040> transmission<00:04:21.600> take<00:04:22.600> the

cap off in my car it was kind of hidden
a<00:04:25.539> little<00:04:25.750> bit<00:04:25.840> by<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.050> exhaust<00:04:26.500> so

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
a little bit by the exhaust so

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.040 
a little bit by the exhaust so
I had<00:04:27.039> the<00:04:27.400> exhaust<00:04:28.120> had<00:04:28.389> to<00:04:28.539> be<00:04:28.659> dropped<00:04:28.870> to

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
I had the exhaust had to be dropped to

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.839 
I had the exhaust had to be dropped to
do<00:04:29.259> that<00:04:29.469> and<00:04:29.969> I<00:04:30.969> myself<00:04:31.569> turned<00:04:32.439> it<00:04:32.650> for<00:04:33.310> all

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
do that and I myself turned it for all

do that and I myself turned it for all
turns<00:04:34.569> clockwise<00:04:35.939> now<00:04:36.939> my<00:04:37.449> shifts<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.379> flared

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
with later model more advanced the force

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.369 
with later model more advanced the force
or<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.620> slightly<00:04:57.009> different<00:04:57.310> transmissions

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379 
or a slightly different transmissions
