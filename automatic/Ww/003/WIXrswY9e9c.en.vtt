00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.469
 what's going on first thing in the start for you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.299
 Of course some players are happy 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 if you are in the nation or team 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.440
 but deathmatch reach people of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.699
 Today I thought that's it 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.930
 nothing new we have the killstreaks 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.740
 but just search and destroy 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.600
 purely 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.670
 the dogs and swan, of course 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 is destroying looking lose fast 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 my challenge but you become 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 you see at the end if I have reached 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.600
 one actually is the topic today is yes 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.090
 Schiller or calls and there I have 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.829
 a question to you out there 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.600
 what a player with skill 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.520
 So I have to say there is out there 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 not many people really do it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.110
 have since heard a lot of exercise 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.270
 To be honest and a sniper of the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 not ready and she just four 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.410
 and every duel for four 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.780
 switzerland or the kap do without 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.340
 that is not a real sniper for me though 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 These are the people who are right for me 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.090
 Annoy me a few times to 180 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 because how would you have 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.110
 lead you the whole time in front of her 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.229
 builds you a really great class so 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.909
 a really cool sniper class right 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.920
 real cala millor moderate shit on 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.500
 Secondary weapons only with snipers all 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.570
 strengthens points that you have available 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.780
 you in your place so secondary to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.990
 everything can be very moderate on 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.650
 sniper it applies and does not want a second 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.540
 no , no c4 is just with yours 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.979
 So weapon with your sniper and then 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.229
 are you going to get some of that? 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.210
 taken away with c4 or just under 40 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.250
 tell me honestly that's 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.610
 really annoying and that does not have to 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.350
 his 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.880
 a tip from me if I ride properly 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.920
 want to learn just goes out the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 black ops 1 around the sniper server so 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.700
 of course, have the game with it 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.229
 At that time I started at the same time 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.270
 Of course you will start thinking about it 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.770
 are now made ready and creates 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.020
 with luck maybe a child because there 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.520
 play bad cash sniper so one 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.820
 By the way , this was by the way 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.979
 is sometimes over 3000 hours I 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.320
 at that time my time was playing with it 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.509
 spent around my time invested around 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.460
 really good sniper but 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.049
 can you try out yourself time goes 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.030
 just on the server 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.080
 I'll also join in on the left 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.640
 class in for you 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.830
 so you can see what you can see 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.710
 real killer class zone 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.450
 fucking heads he will be there without c4 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.580
 just a purely tor all in the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.250
 box packed and your sniper of course 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.630
 So that's my real g class for 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.520
 In any case, I will write to me later 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.380
 times the comments for you one thing 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.400
 killer class would be me on everyone 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.470
 fall interesting 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.450
 but as I said here is learning right 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.280
 the nearby bonn there is no c4 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.320
 Mist or secondary weapon there you can 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.790
 your talk is a grander 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.710
 pack and that's it for now 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.120
 and then it's six to six 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.970
 the sniper is definitely right 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.890
 fun and bad fun so if you 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.140
 First of all, the turn of the whole thing 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.710
 quickly because of and the sap opposition on 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.510
 Beginning 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.150
 that's why I'm also announced in like 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.130
 of course announced in the new cd at 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.750
 once it wins the whole thing quickly like 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.270
 drawn naturally show around the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.040
 of course, sniper position betrayed too 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.720
 bad track gameplay with normal 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.240
 Weapons will come but you will join 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.070
 me no goal or so a whole crap 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.830
 of course you will be with me in the new one 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.110
 logo designed not see so no rpg 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.940
 or how the whole shit is called there 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.640
 gets a bit quiet around 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.560
 worked with the col movement so the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.810
 Whole industry I will tell you 10 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.250
 clarified whether I will go through for you for you 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.019
 So, definitely leave it there 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.700
 Surprise there is definitely one 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.860
 come to you if you are 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.390
 Just wonder why I always do so 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.670
 I'm a bit sick right now though 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.989
 do not let us stop that 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.030
 I can show you a little bit 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.430
 what skills and what ever 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.620
 a sniper a real sniper for me 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.209
 is without secondary but for and where I am 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.489
 have learned the whole as I said in the 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.350
 black ops 1 and there will be right at the end 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.489
 still a black ops come a script 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.860
 I have that in again 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.050
 and always hope that in 20 runs 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.450
 not so fast so strength as in big 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.920
 because honestly every bob could 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.989
 the child so if he is for example 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.150
 corner this and you with two or three 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.820
 has killed hits like in black ops 2 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.230
 hardcore mode came to me the standard courage 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.480
 in ghost before so that was no more 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.760
 Normally you even know people without 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.320
 So do not look at the black ops 2 where you are 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.120
 Of course you need a little bit 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.860
 a little skate around the guys too 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.229
 to rise now I have the norm 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.810
 So it really comes down to blatant 12 10 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.430
 or 350 are of course also internally 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.260
 few people watched and so I still 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.490
 a few comments can be made in the beginning 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.080
 more people have been in it 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.360
 but the dogs are still suffering 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.250
 maybe in any case 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.189
 gameplay in any case always wrong 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.599
 buck on black ops 1 6 against 6 and so on 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.039
 keep looking at each shape on the 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.990
 servers are definitely there 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.819
 really couple some backdrops 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.560
 server if you like the video of course 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.969
 you liked me thumbs after 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.389
 I would definitely be up there 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.400
 looking forward 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.469
 So we have everything in any case 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.180
 jesus is open again 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:50.800
 for you have fun with the small clip 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.800
 we will hear each other until then 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.889
 Yes
