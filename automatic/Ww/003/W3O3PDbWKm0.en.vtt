rear and it does now I think mostly

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.330 
rear and it does now I think mostly
because<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.960> this<00:03:04.260> extra<00:03:04.710> leverage<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.220> the

at carbon levers they've gone back to
aluminum<00:03:16.620> levers<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.190> like<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.000> feel<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.180> them

let's<00:04:25.410> be<00:04:25.590> realistic<00:04:25.860> there's<00:04:26.400> two<00:04:26.669> things

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
let's be realistic there's two things

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.210 
let's be realistic there's two things
here<00:04:27.180> there's<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.870> lot<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.169> things<00:04:28.410> that<00:04:28.740> eat

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
here there's a lot of things that eat

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.950 
here there's a lot of things that eat
your<00:04:29.370> energy<00:04:29.760> up<00:04:29.790> when<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.300> are<00:04:30.330> writing<00:04:30.840> you

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
your energy up when you are writing you

axles all these things that deflect and
one<00:04:37.140> test<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.500> like<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.740> do<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:38.070> put<00:04:38.460> in<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.610> sudden

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
one test I like to do is put in a sudden

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.460 
one test I like to do is put in a sudden
surge<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.210> acceleration<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:39.900> see<00:04:40.080> what<00:04:40.230> how

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
surge of acceleration and see what how

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.330 
surge of acceleration and see what how
that<00:04:40.650> bike<00:04:40.800> responds<00:04:42.590> some<00:04:43.590> bikes<00:04:43.800> sort<00:04:44.250> of

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
that bike responds some bikes sort of

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.950 
that bike responds some bikes sort of
absorb<00:04:44.790> that<00:04:45.419> initial<00:04:45.870> input<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:47.070> energy<00:04:47.220> and

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
absorb that initial input of energy and

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.870 
absorb that initial input of energy and
then<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.050> speed<00:04:49.229> up<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.500> course<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:50.220> bike<00:04:50.669> like

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
then you speed up of course a bike like

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.970 
then you speed up of course a bike like
this<00:04:51.060> seems<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.720> more<00:04:51.930> like<00:04:52.110> it<00:04:52.320> absorbs

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
this seems the more like it absorbs

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.400 
this seems the more like it absorbs
it's<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.550> spring<00:04:53.940> it's<00:04:54.450> a<00:04:54.510> very<00:04:54.660> lively<00:04:54.900> feel<00:04:55.260> to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
it's a spring it's a very lively feel to

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.140 
it's a spring it's a very lively feel to
it<00:04:55.500> you<00:04:55.530> put<00:04:55.740> some<00:04:55.890> energy<00:04:56.010> into<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.700> it

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
it you put some energy into it and it

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.320 
it you put some energy into it and it
gives<00:04:57.360> me<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.900> lot<00:04:58.050> of<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.290> back<00:04:58.440> so<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.610> go<00:05:00.270> to

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
gives me a lot of it back so you go to

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.250 
gives me a lot of it back so you go to
accelerate<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:02.750> accelerates<00:05:03.750> quickly<00:05:03.930> and

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
accelerate and accelerates quickly and

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.960 
accelerate and accelerates quickly and
efficiently<00:05:04.920> it<00:05:05.250> doesn't<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.580> doesn't<00:05:05.730> take<00:05:05.940> a

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
efficiently it doesn't it doesn't take a

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.100 
efficiently it doesn't it doesn't take a
lot<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.150> your<00:05:06.210> energy<00:05:06.300> from<00:05:06.750> you

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
lot of your energy from you

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.260 
lot of your energy from you
so<00:05:07.440> what<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.650> did<00:05:07.770> was<00:05:08.010> I<00:05:08.160> swapped<00:05:08.460> out<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.910> seat

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
so what I did was I swapped out the seat

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.510 
so what I did was I swapped out the seat
the<00:05:09.390> post<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.870> stem<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.260> bars<00:05:10.520> that's

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
the post the stem the bars that's

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.740 
the post the stem the bars that's
because<00:05:11.670> the<00:05:11.760> stock<00:05:11.970> bike<00:05:12.210> was<00:05:12.420> a<00:05:12.450> little

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
because the stock bike was a little

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.890 
because the stock bike was a little
heavy<00:05:12.960> on<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.170> bling<00:05:14.090> this<00:05:15.090> caddy<00:05:15.480> blings<00:05:15.720> it

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
heavy on the bling this caddy blings it

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.020 
heavy on the bling this caddy blings it
a<00:05:16.050> lot<00:05:16.920> of<00:05:16.950> people<00:05:17.040> want<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.490> ask<00:05:17.670> how<00:05:17.850> much

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
a lot of people want to ask how much

is<00:06:04.680> it<00:06:04.830> worth<00:06:04.950> it<00:06:05.210> because<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.810> stock<00:06:07.080> the

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
is it worth it because the stock the

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.730 
is it worth it because the stock the
list<00:06:07.620> price<00:06:07.800> on<00:06:07.980> this<00:06:08.160> bike<00:06:08.400> is<00:06:08.640> a<00:06:09.240> grand<00:06:09.740> you

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
list price on this bike is a grand you
