00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
cheese sauce on top of the cheese that

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.930 
cheese sauce on top of the cheese that
we<00:04:15.750> sprinkled<00:04:16.139> on<00:04:16.199> top<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.799> pretty<00:04:17.729> much

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
we sprinkled on top and pretty much

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.580 
we sprinkled on top and pretty much
we're<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:18.449> going<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> continue<00:04:18.989> layering

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
we're just going to continue layering

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.590 
we're just going to continue layering
and<00:04:20.039> that<00:04:20.549> layering<00:04:20.789> step<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.329> going<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.539> be

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
and that layering step is going to be

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.219 
and that layering step is going to be
probably<00:04:22.229> two<00:04:22.500> more<00:04:22.770> times<00:04:23.130> so<00:04:24.080> once<00:04:25.080> we're

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
probably two more times so once we're

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.480 
probably two more times so once we're
done<00:04:25.410> layering<00:04:25.830> I'm<00:04:26.010> just<00:04:26.190> going<00:04:26.370> to

done layering I'm just going to

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.339 
done layering I'm just going to
fast-forward<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.240> very<00:04:27.539> end<00:04:27.870> because<00:04:28.229> you

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
fast-forward to the very end because you

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:29.960 
fast-forward to the very end because you
don't<00:04:28.500> need<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.680> see<00:04:28.919> me<00:04:29.070> layered<00:04:29.310> two<00:04:29.789> more

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970
