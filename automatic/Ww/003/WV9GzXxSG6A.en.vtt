00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
you how to build two different types of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.599 
you how to build two different types of
retractable<00:00:24.840> workbench<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.070> first<00:00:26.340> one<00:00:26.580> is

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
retractable workbench the first one is

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
retractable workbench the first one is
simpler<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> build<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.810> means<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
simpler to build but means you have to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
simpler to build but means you have to
have<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.560> work<00:00:28.920> bench<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.460> bottom<00:00:29.910> of

your<00:00:30.090> wall<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.739> second<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.309> more

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
your wall the second one is more

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.370 
your wall the second one is more
complicated<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.390> build<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:36.899> will<00:00:37.050> allow<00:00:37.320> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
complicated to build but will allow you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.020 
complicated to build but will allow you
to<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> workbench<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> middle<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.430 
to build the retractable workbench
rather<00:00:50.879> than<00:00:51.000> build<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.390> block<00:00:51.750> by<00:00:51.960> block<00:00:52.110> or

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
rather than build this block by block or

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.930 
rather than build this block by block or
layer<00:00:52.620> by<00:00:52.829> layer<00:00:52.860> I'm<00:00:53.280> simply<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
layer by layer I'm simply going to

does<00:00:56.489> how<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.120> works<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:58.020> you'll<00:00:58.170> be

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
does how it works and then you'll be

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.930 
does how it works and then you'll be
able<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.649> understand<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.520> build<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> in

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
able to understand it and build it in

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.479 
able to understand it and build it in
your<00:01:00.120> own<00:01:00.149> world<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:01.800> understand<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
your own world to understand the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.429 
your own world to understand the
redstone<00:01:02.940> circuit<00:01:03.210> behind<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> retractable

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
redstone circuit behind the retractable

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
redstone circuit behind the retractable
workbench<00:01:05.040> I've<00:01:05.309> divided<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.970> into<00:01:06.150> three

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
workbench I've divided up into three

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600 
workbench I've divided up into three
different<00:01:06.810> parts<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:08.100> bread<00:01:08.369> part

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
different parts this bread part

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060 
different parts this bread part
represents<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> input<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.500> green<00:01:10.799> part

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
represents the input to this green part

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.399 
represents the input to this green part
here<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.270> most<00:01:12.450> important<00:01:13.049> part<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
here which is the most important part of

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.580 
here which is the most important part of
the<00:01:13.650> circuit<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.610> call<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.659> bar<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the circuit I call it the a bar and this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.740 
the circuit I call it the a bar and this
is<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.220> has<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:18.030> input<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.570> two

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
is because it has one input and two

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.710 
is because it has one input and two
outputs<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.500> call<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.189> outputs<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.240> B<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
outputs I call these outputs a and B and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.740 
outputs I call these outputs a and B and
it<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.470> power<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.189> then<00:01:23.939> B<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it will power up a then B and when it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.280 
it will power up a then B and when it
empowers<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.860> power<00:01:26.189> B<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> have

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
empowers it one power B then a so I have

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.670 
empowers it one power B then a so I have
a<00:01:28.380> look<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.770> action<00:01:29.189> quickly<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> keep

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
a look at that in action quickly so keep

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.359 
a look at that in action quickly so keep
your<00:01:34.799> eye<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.950> these<00:01:35.220> two<00:01:35.280> redstone<00:01:35.729> torches

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
your eye on these two redstone torches

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.450 
your eye on these two redstone torches
and<00:01:39.020> these<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.229> powering<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.799> outputs<00:01:41.250> which

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and these are powering the outputs which

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.109 
and these are powering the outputs which
control<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.939> two<00:01:42.240> different<00:01:42.509> Pistons<00:01:44.119> so

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
control the two different Pistons so

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.910 
control the two different Pistons so
with<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> burr<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.840> our<00:01:45.960> circuit<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.710> can

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
with the a burr in our circuit we can

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.280 
with the a burr in our circuit we can
always<00:01:47.159> retract<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> currently<00:01:48.600> extended

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
always retract the currently extended

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.539 
always retract the currently extended
piston<00:01:50.130> before<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.700> other<00:01:50.850> piston<00:01:51.329> extends

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
piston before the other piston extends

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.950 
piston before the other piston extends
so<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> build<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.479> will<00:01:54.630> need<00:01:54.750> your

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
so to build this you will need your

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.469 
so to build this you will need your
input<00:01:55.140> which<00:01:56.100> goes<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.700> first<00:01:56.939> block<00:01:57.299> on

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
input which goes to this first block on

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.780 
input which goes to this first block on
the<00:01:57.570> abba<00:01:57.840> which<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> input<00:01:58.649> block<00:01:59.100> then

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the abba which is the input block then

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.090 
the abba which is the input block then
we<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.090> our<00:02:00.270> two<00:02:00.570> output<00:02:01.140> blocks<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.740> they

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
we have our two output blocks and they

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.340 
we have our two output blocks and they
both<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.549> redstone<00:02:03.030> torches<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.689> them<00:02:03.840> we

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
both have redstone torches on them we

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.959 
both have redstone torches on them we
have<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.649> fourth<00:02:04.950> block<00:02:05.219> over<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
have this fourth block over here and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.670 
have this fourth block over here and
then<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.390> will<00:02:06.509> need<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.750> lay<00:02:06.930> down<00:02:06.960> repeaters

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
then you will need to lay down repeaters

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.150 
then you will need to lay down repeaters
between<00:02:08.099> them<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.429> shown<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.920> two

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
between them as shown here the two

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.850 
between them as shown here the two
outputs<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.390> sticky<00:02:12.900> pistons<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.530> one

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
outputs go to the sticky pistons and one

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.090 
outputs go to the sticky pistons and one
those<00:02:14.040> outputs<00:02:14.280> will<00:02:14.700> need<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:14.970> inverted

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
those outputs will need to be inverted

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.800 
those outputs will need to be inverted
now<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.280> time<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.760> learn<00:02:17.910> how<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.330> more

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
now it's time to learn how the more

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.190 
now it's time to learn how the more

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
output so when you are building this

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.310 
output so when you are building this
there<00:03:28.980> are<00:03:29.070> two<00:03:29.220> key<00:03:29.400> things<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.880> note<00:03:30.320> first

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
there are two key things to note first

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.140 
there are two key things to note first
of<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.739> repeater<00:03:32.100> setting<00:03:32.519> here<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.910> very

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
of all the repeater setting here is very

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.900 
of all the repeater setting here is very
important<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.530> second<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.519> all<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.820> will

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
important and second of all you will

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.310 
important and second of all you will
need<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.180> strategically<00:03:36.390> place<00:03:37.080> the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
need to strategically place the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.020 
need to strategically place the
repeaters<00:03:37.799> on<00:03:37.950> your<00:03:38.100> output<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.940> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
repeaters on your output so that the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.780 
repeaters on your output so that the
redstone<00:03:39.450> doesn't<00:03:39.780> cross<00:03:39.930> over<00:03:40.640> so<00:03:41.640> let's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
redstone doesn't cross over so let's

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:50.700 
redstone doesn't cross over so let's
have<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.000> look<00:03:42.180> at<00:03:42.269> in<00:03:42.420> action

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.400 

so<00:03:51.710> that<00:03:51.860> concludes<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.580> tutorial<00:03:52.730> as<00:03:53.410> always

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
so that concludes the tutorial as always

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.140 
so that concludes the tutorial as always
