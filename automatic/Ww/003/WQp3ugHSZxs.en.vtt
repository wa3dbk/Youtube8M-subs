00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.500
 hello let us now on this 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.970
 a lesson let's talk about equipment 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.639
 the gym when you do 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:18.920
 bodybuilding either body fitness is not itself 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:22.920
 important the first and most important thing we have 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.699
 grating weightlifting belt of course 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.619
 such you will not find it anywhere 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:36.120
 bought back in the days of the ussr it was there 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.140
 something 90 8080 some ninth year what 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.140
 is it a weightlifting belt and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.020
 weightlifters used it now poetess 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.750
 produce different foreign firms to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.329
 Unfortunately, they are worse in quality. 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.730
 here for this belt is a real jock or 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.860
 power lift there is ready to do anything 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.670
 tried to buy several times 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.180
 although he already there razmahalsya I then 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.689
 there is a present asks me well its shore and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.420
 no one gives her husband is just super but 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.920
 if you do not have such a belt, buy 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.939
 comfortable train 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.560
 that is, they didnâ€™t just take it and bought it 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.759
 take a belt and try on a squat 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.460
 see whether anywhere it is poisonous week 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.540
 it does not pinch the skin there and it happens 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.340
 why do you need a belt is ours 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.320
 back insurance but don't think that you 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.960
 put on a belt and you may not correctly 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.649
 do the exercise he will save you there 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:50.040
 No, this is insurance, plus he 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:53.729
 creates pressure on the abdominal cavity 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.250
 that is, how do you squeeze you somehow 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.640
 were in good shape 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:03.210
 become and exercise easier 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.030
 when to apply a belt on such power 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.619
 exercises like squats and barbells 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.590
 deadlocks 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.680
 sometimes you can on the shoulder 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.190
 mind when weight is big and I recommend 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.110
 do not wear a belt right away 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.200
 gym case belt and walk 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.480
 No, you need a back to strengthen at all 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.430
 it is recommended to wear a belt squats 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.090
 with pants when you already crossed in 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.660
 squats 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.290
 but the weight of 80 kilograms is deadlift too 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.170
 somewhere 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.610
 Well, better than the main traction immediately somewhere 60 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.790
 kilogram wear belt 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:44.360
 he let me take the barbell well and imitate 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.310
 now exercise deadlift back 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.959
 I am direct and I perform movement see 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:59.049
 back straight no matter what my belt is 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:04.180
 there is a technique necessarily important next 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.569
 did the exercise remove the belt and 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:13.310
 lead him 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:17.720
 your place is this we have here 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.989
 another belt emphasis good room 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.019
 there must be enough 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.209
 Belts to all enough but I advise 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.959
 you have your own 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:36.380
 traction how they dress here is the classic 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:41.560
 thrust you pushing the loop in the dryer 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.560
 loop and here you see how here 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:51.400
 why do I need tags 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.830
 recommend name abuse let 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.810
 hand already strengthens forearm 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.670
 strengthened but when a lot of weight 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.850
 let's say on steel tag happens so 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.420
 back pulls legs pulls not 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:09.700
 stand and you because of this 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:13.680
 wind yourself up wind up to the neck 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.930
 rods and can more easily perform 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.580
 exercise to take more weight 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.070
 very good traction helps in 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.960
 pull-ups happen so sweaty 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.370
 palms 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.510
 either your hands get tired and when you 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.380
 pull up well just your hands 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.230
 slide off 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.520
 also tether yourself and it is very 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.880
 well helps by the way when 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.770
 your hands are sweating 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.150
 it is desirable to have glove they 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.300
 sold in sports shops 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.230
 Power, that is, all sorts of other sports 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.940
 stores where 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:56.160
 equipment take gloves and leather 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:00.430
 dress problem smith 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:03.790
 let's talk more about bandages bandages 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.340
 extremely important thing before there was 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.590
 we bought sports bandages at the pharmacy 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.280
 elastic bandage wound 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.040
 kept the knee but of course compared to 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.610
 those bandages that are now available in 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.390
 availability already sold in sports 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.540
 stores 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:27.360
 plastic bandage is much inferior he 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.740
 keeps the knee joint but not so much 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.780
 apply it when you crouch 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.970
 barbell you are wrapping your knee and because 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.270
 this preset goes better i.e. 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:43.810
 insurance of your lap at the moment 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.750
 I do not have bandages we will insert in 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.640
 this lesson 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.110
 small such a lesson which I 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:55.140
 previously recorded in one of my 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.170
 video courses maybe it was trining on 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.620
 mass I told everything there in detail about 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:05.340
 bandages just technique how to reel 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:10.200
 bandage and a and we will insert this lesson you 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.050
 You will be able to see all of it to study here 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.000
 watch sport mintel when you they 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.210
 are needed when you crouch already 100 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.180
 kilogram and higher before this basically they 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.180
 not required here is how they are soaked 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:41.310
 We put a foot there first we wind 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:52.310
 then bottom knee and knee 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:57.950
 crosswise if beam 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:07:00.600
 it protects your joint from injury and 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.550
 allows you to squat with large 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.440
 weights second knee I will not 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.419
 wind up because 100 kilograms 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.190
 which now I will be on the bar 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.190
 for me up small
