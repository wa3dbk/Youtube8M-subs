radar<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.439> gun<00:00:31.590> games<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.309> want<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.120> just

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
radar for gun games so I want to just

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.420 
radar for gun games so I want to just
try<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.570> stay<00:00:33.780> alive<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.309> be

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
try and stay alive but it's going to be

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.310 
try and stay alive but it's going to be
very<00:00:35.460> difficult<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.660> ghosts<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.230> you

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
very difficult to do in ghosts so you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.209 
very difficult to do in ghosts so you
can<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.440> lay<00:00:37.680> down<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.890> hide<00:00:38.190> somewhere

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
can just lay down and hide somewhere

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.729 
can just lay down and hide somewhere
because<00:00:38.820> there<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.090> no<00:00:39.300> radar<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.590> in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
because there is no radar but not in

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
because there is no radar but not in
this<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.280> can't<00:00:41.520> get<00:00:41.670> any<00:00:41.850> kills<00:00:42.120> until

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this one so I can't get any kills until

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.970 
this one so I can't get any kills until
somebody<00:00:42.780> gets<00:00:42.870> 250<00:00:43.440> points<00:00:43.829> oh<00:00:44.059> oh<00:00:45.059> oh<00:00:45.809> oh<00:00:47.329> oh

since<00:04:20.039> I<00:04:20.130> do<00:04:20.190> three<00:04:20.489> games<00:04:20.759> I<00:04:21.030> think<00:04:21.900> I'll<00:04:22.019> try

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
since I do three games I think I'll try

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.300 
since I do three games I think I'll try
and<00:04:22.440> do<00:04:24.259> eight<00:04:25.259> kills<00:04:25.680> I'll<00:04:26.009> give<00:04:26.160> him<00:04:26.250> an

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.730 
eight kill lead before I have to start
doing<00:04:27.840> anything<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.350> think<00:04:28.410> that'll<00:04:28.710> be

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
doing anything I think that'll be

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.680 
doing anything I think that'll be
extremely<00:04:29.610> challenging<00:04:29.639> five<00:04:30.210> kills<00:04:30.509> is

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
extremely challenging five kills is

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.540 
extremely challenging five kills is
already<00:04:31.080> pretty<00:04:31.680> difficult<00:04:31.979> because<00:04:32.370> how

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
already pretty difficult because how

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.550

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
often do you win a gun game by more than

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.740 
often do you win a gun game by more than
five<00:04:34.889> kills<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.580> don't<00:04:36.120> know<00:04:36.180> maybe<00:04:36.330> for<00:04:36.600> some
