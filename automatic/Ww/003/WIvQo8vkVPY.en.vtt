hi guys I just wanted to make one more
quick<00:00:13.089> video<00:00:13.450> I<00:00:13.719> wanted<00:00:13.990> to<00:00:14.080> talk<00:00:14.259> about

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
quick video I wanted to talk about

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.640 
quick video I wanted to talk about
batteries<00:00:15.070> and<00:00:15.370> more<00:00:15.759> specifically<00:00:16.650> lipo

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
batteries and more specifically lipo

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.200 
batteries and more specifically lipo
batteries<00:00:18.039> and<00:00:18.220> even<00:00:18.279> more<00:00:18.669> specifically

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
batteries and even more specifically

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.560 
batteries and even more specifically
buffer<00:00:19.869> tube<00:00:20.050> lipo<00:00:20.439> batteries<00:00:20.829> um

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
buffer tube lipo batteries um

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.689 
buffer tube lipo batteries um
buffer<00:00:23.199> tube<00:00:23.380> lipos<00:00:23.769> and<00:00:24.039> by<00:00:24.220> buffer<00:00:24.550> tube

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
buffer tube lipos and by buffer tube

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.060 
buffer tube lipos and by buffer tube
lipo<00:00:25.060> I<00:00:25.210> mean<00:00:25.420> like<00:00:25.689> batteries<00:00:26.619> like<00:00:26.800> this

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
lipo I mean like batteries like this

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.290 
lipo I mean like batteries like this
that<00:00:27.250> are<00:00:27.310> like<00:00:27.490> really<00:00:27.759> thin<00:00:28.029> you<00:00:28.060> can

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
that are like really thin you can

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.050 
that are like really thin you can
squeeze<00:00:28.630> into<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:29.109> buffer<00:00:29.410> tube<00:00:29.590> of<00:00:29.769> your<00:00:30.060> m4

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
squeeze into the buffer tube of your m4

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.470 
squeeze into the buffer tube of your m4
or<00:00:31.420> other<00:00:31.779> small<00:00:32.140> space<00:00:32.739> in<00:00:32.949> your<00:00:33.300> space<00:00:34.300> can

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
or other small space in your space can

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.540 
or other small space in your space can
find<00:00:34.660> gun<00:00:34.900> they<00:00:35.710> usually<00:00:36.010> even<00:00:36.100> smaller<00:00:36.460> than

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
find gun they usually even smaller than

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.340 
find gun they usually even smaller than
this<00:00:36.760> I<00:00:36.879> mean<00:00:37.030> most<00:00:37.780> people<00:00:38.019> are<00:00:38.110> gonna<00:00:38.199> be

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
this I mean most people are gonna be

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.320 
this I mean most people are gonna be
getting<00:00:38.530> that<00:00:38.589> 1200<00:00:39.129> mah<00:00:39.280> stick<00:00:39.610> about<00:00:39.850> yay

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
getting that 1200 mah stick about yay

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.450 
getting that 1200 mah stick about yay
big<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:42.299> I<00:00:43.299> think<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.629> smallest<00:00:44.229> size<00:00:44.619> buffer

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
big and I think a smallest size buffer

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.009 
big and I think a smallest size buffer
tube<00:00:45.610> lipo<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:46.119> I've<00:00:46.210> seen<00:00:46.449> being<00:00:46.659> used<00:00:46.869> as

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
tube lipo that I've seen being used as

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.439 
tube lipo that I've seen being used as
the<00:00:47.170> it's<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.799> 1000<00:00:48.400> lot<00:00:48.519> energy<00:00:48.820> ones<00:00:49.210> which

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
the it's the 1000 lot energy ones which

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.340 
the it's the 1000 lot energy ones which
is<00:00:49.629> ridiculous<00:00:50.559> and<00:00:50.680> I'll<00:00:50.769> get<00:00:50.949> into<00:00:51.190> that<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
is ridiculous and I'll get into that and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.930 
is ridiculous and I'll get into that and
the<00:00:53.500> reason<00:00:53.799> that<00:00:53.830> I'm<00:00:54.010> bringing<00:00:54.250> this<00:00:54.610> up<00:00:54.790> is

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
the reason that I'm bringing this up is

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.640 
the reason that I'm bringing this up is
because<00:00:55.000> they're<00:00:55.420> so<00:00:55.600> they<00:00:55.960> seem<00:00:56.229> to<00:00:56.379> be<00:00:56.470> so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
because they're so they seem to be so

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.549 
because they're so they seem to be so

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
got an MOA stock on it which you know

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.620 
got an MOA stock on it which you know
does<00:01:12.429> look<00:01:12.609> really<00:01:12.820> cool<00:01:12.939> it<00:01:13.179> looks<00:01:13.329> really

you know realistic and cool because most
people<00:01:16.240> are<00:01:16.329> throwing<00:01:16.509> crane<00:01:16.750> stocks<00:01:17.020> on

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
people are throwing crane stocks on

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.190 
people are throwing crane stocks on
there<00:01:17.409> but<00:01:17.560> there's<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.770> reason<00:01:18.070> for<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:19.200> but

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
there but there's a reason for that but

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.050 
there but there's a reason for that but
the<00:01:20.320> downside<00:01:20.499> of<00:01:20.950> buffer<00:01:21.249> tube<00:01:21.399> lipos<00:01:21.850> is

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
the downside of buffer tube lipos is

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.359 
the downside of buffer tube lipos is
that<00:01:22.359> the<00:01:22.600> capacity<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.289> capacity<00:01:23.409> is<00:01:23.979> so

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
that the capacity the capacity is so

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.539 
that the capacity the capacity is so
small<00:01:24.789> it's<00:01:25.119> it's<00:01:25.600> like<00:01:25.899> and<00:01:26.320> especially<00:01:27.280> for

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
small it's it's like and especially for

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:28.859 
small it's it's like and especially for
people<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:27.999> want<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.299> be<00:01:28.420> running<00:01:28.749> their

again to where it'll still be okay but I

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.720 
again to where it'll still be okay but I
don't<00:02:22.629> recommend<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.439> it's<00:02:24.159> just<00:02:24.430> kind<00:02:24.519> of

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
don't recommend it it's just kind of

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.220 
don't recommend it it's just kind of
risky<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.269> it's<00:02:25.829> it<00:02:26.829> can<00:02:27.099> be<00:02:27.280> unsafe<00:02:27.989> if<00:02:28.989> it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
risky and it's it can be unsafe if it

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.869 
risky and it's it can be unsafe if it

dies on you I usually just say get

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.319 
dies on you I usually just say get
another<00:02:31.090> one<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.650> being<00:02:32.859> said<00:02:33.329> people

voltage it'll tell you that or if you

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.649 
voltage it'll tell you that or if you

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
cut off your battery it'll tell you that

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.809 
but I mean it's just these ridiculously
small<00:03:47.560> batteries<00:03:47.979> and<00:03:48.129> people<00:03:48.370> are<00:03:48.430> trying<00:03:48.669> to

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
small batteries and people are trying to

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.210 
small batteries and people are trying to
light<00:03:49.000> you're<00:03:49.329> like<00:03:49.449> oh<00:03:49.629> but<00:03:50.049> all<00:03:50.109> I'll<00:03:50.829> do<00:03:51.040> all

this stuff and I'm gonna run it off a
buffer<00:03:52.780> tube<00:03:52.930> battery<00:03:53.260> ah<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:54.280> mean<00:03:54.690> take<00:03:55.690> for

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
buffer tube battery ah I mean take for

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.280 
buffer tube battery ah I mean take for
instance<00:03:55.930> my<00:03:56.199> DSG<00:03:56.799> I<00:03:56.829> was<00:03:57.239> initially<00:03:58.290> thinking

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
instance my DSG I was initially thinking

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.199 
instance my DSG I was initially thinking
about<00:03:59.739> running<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.790> off<00:04:00.909> of<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:02.220> 2500<00:04:03.220> mah<00:04:03.370> crane

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
about running it off of a 2500 mah crane

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.429 
about running it off of a 2500 mah crane
stock<00:04:04.479> battery<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.680> found<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:07.510> was<00:04:07.659> made

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
stock battery that I found that was made

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.830 
stock battery that I found that was made
by<00:04:08.590> G<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:08.889> P<00:04:09.010> also<00:04:09.159> intellect<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.060> running

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
by G and P also intellect and running

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.479 
by G and P also intellect and running
that<00:04:10.959> in<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.169> crane<00:04:11.379> stock<00:04:11.650> Ithaca<00:04:12.069> yeah<00:04:12.310> this

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
that in the crane stock Ithaca yeah this

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.369 
that in the crane stock Ithaca yeah this
will<00:04:12.609> be<00:04:12.639> a<00:04:12.729> really<00:04:12.939> cool<00:04:13.090> setup<00:04:13.329> but<00:04:13.599> once<00:04:14.229> I

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
will be a really cool setup but once I

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.529 
will be a really cool setup but once I
got<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.680> Tendo<00:04:14.919> and<00:04:14.949> DSG<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.639> I<00:04:15.699> I<00:04:15.939> test<00:04:16.269> shot

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
got the Tendo and DSG and I I test shot

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.610 
got the Tendo and DSG and I I test shot
it<00:04:16.720> off<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:17.139> my<00:04:18.329> 26<00:04:19.329> 50<00:04:19.630> blue<00:04:19.870> lipo<00:04:20.259> I<00:04:20.289> was

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
it off of my 26 50 blue lipo I was

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.600 
it off of my 26 50 blue lipo I was
dipping<00:04:21.039> that<00:04:21.070> thing<00:04:21.489> like<00:04:22.979> like<00:04:23.979> crazy<00:04:24.340> fast

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
dipping that thing like like crazy fast

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.430 
dipping that thing like like crazy fast
like<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.909> noticed<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.719> the<00:04:25.960> rate<00:04:26.110> of<00:04:26.229> fire

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
like I noticed that the the rate of fire

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.320 
like I noticed that the the rate of fire
would<00:04:26.650> start<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.979> drop<00:04:27.219> like<00:04:27.520> pretty

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
would start to drop like pretty

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.909 
would start to drop like pretty
significantly<00:04:29.050> quickly<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.620> that's<00:04:29.740> when<00:04:29.889> I

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
significantly quickly and that's when I

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:30.990 
significantly quickly and that's when I
realized

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
realized

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.050 
realized
I<00:04:31.120> need<00:04:31.540> a<00:04:31.570> bigger<00:04:31.810> battery<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.410> that's<00:04:32.470> why<00:04:32.980> I

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
I need a bigger battery and that's why I

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.520 
I need a bigger battery and that's why I
decided<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.210> say<00:04:34.300> don't<00:04:34.600> fuck<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.110> I'm<00:04:35.230> just

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
decided to say don't fuck it I'm just

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.310 
decided to say don't fuck it I'm just
gonna<00:04:35.650> be<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.940> hell<00:04:37.120> with<00:04:37.330> looks<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.050> all<00:04:38.170> that

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
my case I just happen to be running such

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.470 
my case I just happen to be running such
an<00:05:01.960> extreme<00:05:02.260> setup<00:05:02.560> but<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:03.160> mean<00:05:03.480> really

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
an extreme setup but I mean really

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.330 
an extreme setup but I mean really
though<00:05:04.690> anything<00:05:05.470> where<00:05:05.620> you're<00:05:05.710> increasing

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
though anything where you're increasing

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.570 
though anything where you're increasing
the<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.550> need<00:05:07.480> for<00:05:07.780> power<00:05:07.930> more<00:05:08.470> than<00:05:08.710> just<00:05:09.490> a

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
the the need for power more than just a

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.330 
the the need for power more than just a
very<00:05:09.760> very<00:05:09.880> stock<00:05:10.540> setup<00:05:10.950> you're<00:05:11.950> gonna<00:05:12.100> need

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
very very stock setup you're gonna need

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.580 
very very stock setup you're gonna need
more<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:12.880> that<00:05:13.570> you're<00:05:14.020> gonna<00:05:14.140> need<00:05:14.350> more

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
more and that you're gonna need more

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.170 
more and that you're gonna need more
juice<00:05:15.370> than<00:05:15.430> these<00:05:16.270> small<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:17.440> know<00:05:17.530> sub<00:05:18.400> 1600

juice than these small you know sub 1600

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.260 
juice than these small you know sub 1600
mAh<00:05:19.500> batteries<00:05:20.500> are<00:05:20.620> gonna<00:05:20.710> offer<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:22.210> I

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
mAh batteries are gonna offer and I

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.840 
mAh batteries are gonna offer and I
really<00:05:22.780> think<00:05:23.080> people<00:05:23.140> should<00:05:23.590> start

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
really think people should start

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.310 
really think people should start
thinking<00:05:24.850> about<00:05:25.300> this<00:05:25.480> as<00:05:25.690> opposed<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.080> just

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
thinking about this as opposed to just

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.780 
thinking about this as opposed to just
you<00:05:26.440> know<00:05:26.560> going<00:05:26.860> for<00:05:27.130> looks<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:27.490> all<00:05:27.610> that

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
you know going for looks and all that

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.330 
you know going for looks and all that
stuff<00:05:28.080> because<00:05:29.080> I'm<00:05:29.410> seeing<00:05:29.680> way<00:05:29.950> too<00:05:30.010> many

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
stuff because I'm seeing way too many
