00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.640 
I'm not quite sure where we're going
with<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:33.930> we're<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> do

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
with it but we're going to have to do

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.960 
with it but we're going to have to do
that<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.920> order<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.220> take<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.430> crank<00:01:35.850> we're

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that in order to take that crank we're

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.609 
that in order to take that crank we're
gonna<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> get<00:01:36.450> these<00:01:36.570> pedals<00:01:36.990> off<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
gonna have to get these pedals off and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
gonna have to get these pedals off and
these<00:01:37.799> pedals<00:01:38.159> could<00:01:38.369> look<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.970> well

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
these pedals could look like it well

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
these pedals could look like it well
really<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.110> only<00:01:40.229> need<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> side<00:01:41.130> off

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
really we only need to get that side off

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.450 
really we only need to get that side off
in<00:01:41.490> order<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> crank<00:01:42.270> off<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:43.460> both

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
in order to get the crank off but both

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.039 
in order to get the crank off but both
pedals<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.299> hurting<00:01:45.479> pretty<00:01:45.780> badly

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
pedals are kind of hurting pretty badly

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.950 
pedals are kind of hurting pretty badly
and<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.549> always<00:01:47.759> comes<00:01:48.090> down<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.329> how

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and I think it always comes down to how

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.020 
and I think it always comes down to how
to<00:01:49.020> get<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> pedal<00:01:49.890> off<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.520> hear<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> all

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to get the pedal off and I hear it all

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.950 
to get the pedal off and I hear it all
the<00:01:51.090> time

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.630 
hitting it on there a little bit that's
right<00:03:28.030> we<00:03:28.209> did<00:03:28.359> using<00:03:28.569> with<00:03:28.780> c-plus<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:30.459> it

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
right we did using with c-plus so it

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.979 
right we did using with c-plus so it
might<00:03:30.790> be<00:03:30.969> back<00:03:31.150> there<00:03:31.359> with<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.629> pipe<00:03:31.810> wrench

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
might be back there with the pipe wrench

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.690 
might be back there with the pipe wrench
right<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:33.670> would<00:03:33.790> make<00:03:33.939> sense<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:36.250> now<00:03:36.400> this

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
right that would make sense so now this

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.520 
right that would make sense so now this
