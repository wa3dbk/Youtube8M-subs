00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello, my name is Sergey and today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.319
 we make mold and lure for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.929
 sheer perch fishing 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.750
 and we will start with making a form for 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.809
 we will need this small 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.630
 sizes that we need to do 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.369
 several holes deep somewhere 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:26.550
 centimeter and millimeters wide 5 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.109
 they are drilled on the same line in order to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.830
 the form could be used more than once 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.200
 after which you need to drill 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.680
 this line which is in your 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.020
 versions 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.500
 you need to cut and along and then 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.600
 you get well and have a form 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.710
 use more than once you need to connect it 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.850
 here is such a vice governor 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.350
 ready form 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.370
 I even have a few here 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 blanks have this form 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.710
 still it can be equipped here so here 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:07.200
 hook so she squeezed us 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.510
 during sun transfusion it unfolds 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.030
 and see that here the hole sawed 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.119
 in half 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.560
 we take out some windows 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.650
 before but you can still use 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.140
 string in order not to drill 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.799
 holes and this is done simply 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.479
 closes form country falls in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.770
 cut millimeters 2 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.439
 down and pour the lead then on this 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.049
 the string will be this data billet 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.780
 as a garland they are removed and you already 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.090
 ready hole here we take 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.960
 take some of the blanks 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:52.280
 the smallest in this blank 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.270
 fishing line through the hole 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.219
 skipped scaffold small flocks 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.130
 small size 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:05.580
 centimeters somewhere so near the wall to 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:10.259
 it was more comfortable on this line 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.530
 worn on two hooks with a sides 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.220
 here is the hook and here is the hook after which 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.670
 puts on a bead like a foot they are she 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.860
 tied up is done sliding but she 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 Steps hook footsteps high not angry then 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.520
 this is already ready bait which is already 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.090
 more than once lead has been used here 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.630
 got dark 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.320
 on the hook wears artificial 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.120
 raspberry or maggots and well fishing line 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.750
 tied so here's a loop and here it is 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.830
 The path from the loops of the bone can be seen this 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.800
 all this is ready 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:52.430
 bait she tied for this 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:55.440
 loop you from fishing line which when catching 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.850
 hits the ground and a little bit 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.690
 rises but that the weight was 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.390
 tip still lay on the ground 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.600
 circles have time and perch hits a little 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.269
 above the ground and 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.459
 thanks for flocking but for this 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.370
 bait can be caught wrong not only 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.480
 about but also another predator is also possible 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.680
 catch and medium sized 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.870
 not a big pike but still mostly 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.400
 biting the perch 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.400
 Thank you all for your attention.
