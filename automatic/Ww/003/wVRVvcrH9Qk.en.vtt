00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:10.760
 hello hello hi hello hello hello i am 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.139
 good radio this is a story of how 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.199
 walk in the water 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:22.560
 so likewise walk on the side 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.560
 the same as we all support here 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.090
 here we close one more we go up 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.090
 here 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.460
 we aim 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.760
 we go back 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.629
 and the legs are going to be very drunk 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.120
 and then we run 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.340
 and dominated in the water 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.570
 and this is all that really dominate 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.950
 in water 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.950
 wow this 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:21.530
 and as we are this there are several ways 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.380
 nothing more as this goes up is something 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.280
 Inca bar 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.280
 so if you're 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.890
 like a height like here because 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.350
 this can go up sometimes 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.350
 just ask yourself this question 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.840
 and you can also explode with this 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.500
 scream 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.500
 good 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:02:00.179
 but what makes this place the legs 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.179
 because there is a limit all the legs 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.600
 and lets you walk wherever you want 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.039
 While 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.759
 the game allows you as 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.759
 here 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.010
 here is all float 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.730
 and if I go here higher 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.730
 plus 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.409
 and so 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.019
 find a higher place but sometimes 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:35.189
 can not you can not pass because there 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.189
 limitations on the map 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.700
 it looks like that day 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.190
 sometimes I 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.780
 America 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.700
 and less 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.120
 and apparently he takes a walk when 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.120
 It runs like walking so fast 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.970
 and that's it 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.740
 or not 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.710
 teacher 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.710
 and good is today 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.720
 all right 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.859
 for him above to vertical 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.170
 wow 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.740
 and so find 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.010
 good 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.910
 and that's it 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.970
 that's all I wish you liked this 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.970
 video 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.980
 do not 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.570
 Well, it's all I hope you liked it 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.570
 if not
