little file called Fair Play plist they
found<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.740> new<00:00:23.279> kind<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.789> ipod<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.230> being

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
found a new kind of ipod that is being

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.349 
found a new kind of ipod that is being
called<00:00:25.859> ipod<00:00:27.199> 42<00:00:28.220> now<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.279> ipod<00:00:29.820> touch<00:00:29.939> 40

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
called ipod 42 now the ipod touch 40

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.580 
called ipod 42 now the ipod touch 40
right<00:00:30.660> now<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.610> being<00:00:32.610> called<00:00:32.940> ipod<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:34.050> one

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
right now is being called ipod for one

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.360 
right now is being called ipod for one
but<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> ipod<00:00:36.000> 42<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:38.100> this

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
but this is the ipod 42 so what this

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.970 
but this is the ipod 42 so what this
basically<00:00:38.610> means<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.860> an

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
basically means is that it's a like an

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.490 
basically means is that it's a like an
alternative<00:00:41.700> model<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.500> fourth

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
alternative model to the fourth

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.190 
alternative model to the fourth
generation<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.329> could<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> new<00:00:46.020> in

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
generation or that we could see a new in

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
generation or that we could see a new in
original<00:00:46.289> ipod<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.700> between<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> new

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
original ipod but in between to be a new

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.470 
original ipod but in between to be a new
generation<00:00:49.110> then<00:00:50.070> we're<00:00:50.640> almost<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
generation then we're almost going to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.459 
generation then we're almost going to
see<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:53.090> huge<00:00:54.090> look<00:00:54.270> identical<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:55.320> not

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
see like a huge look identical it's not

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.740 
see like a huge look identical it's not
going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.129> total<00:00:56.430> redesign<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.300> how

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
going to be like a total redesign of how

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
going to be like a total redesign of how
it<00:00:57.809> looks<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.410> we're<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.770> tell<00:00:58.949> like

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it looks like but we're going tell like

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.580 
it looks like but we're going tell like
different<00:01:00.120> internal<00:01:00.600> specs<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.350> we're

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
different internal specs like we're

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.779 
different internal specs like we're
going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.010> probably<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.640> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
going to probably going to see this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.679 
going to probably going to see this
dual-core<00:01:03.359> a5<00:01:03.619> processor<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.450> in

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
dual-core a5 processor as we now have in

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
dual-core a5 processor as we now have in
the<00:01:06.810> ipad<00:01:07.200> 2<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.590> problem<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> dive<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.369> iphone

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the ipad 2 in problem you dive in iphone

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.630 
the ipad 2 in problem you dive in iphone
5<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> problem<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.159> thing<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
5 so we have that problem one thing the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.130 
5 so we have that problem one thing the
processor<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.570> didn't<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> big

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
processor that we didn't see a big

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.320 
processor that we didn't see a big
change<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.490> perhaps<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:15.090> can

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
change in and they perhaps they can

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
change in and they perhaps they can
operate<00:01:15.540> now<00:01:15.960> i<00:01:15.990> don't<00:01:16.229> think<00:01:16.619> we're<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
operate now i don't think we're going to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.280 
operate now i don't think we're going to
camera<00:01:17.430> off<00:01:17.490> good<00:01:17.729> guess<00:01:18.060> yeah<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> doesn't

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
camera off good guess yeah it doesn't

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.609 
camera off good guess yeah it doesn't
feel<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.979> time<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.210> now

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
feel like it's time to do it right now

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.679 
feel like it's time to do it right now
perhaps<00:01:22.619> also<00:01:22.799> approved<00:01:23.369> by<00:01:23.850> PI<00:01:24.210> network

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
perhaps also approved by PI network

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.940 
perhaps also approved by PI network
within<00:01:24.900> five<00:01:25.320> yards<00:01:25.530> 8<00:01:25.920> 9<00:01:26.100> through<00:01:26.340> 11<00:01:26.369> n<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
within five yards 8 9 through 11 n and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.100 
within five yards 8 9 through 11 n and
also<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> storage<00:01:29.790> could<00:01:30.240> double<00:01:30.900> by

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
also that the storage could double by

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.039 
also that the storage could double by
the<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.950> ipod<00:01:32.340> touch<00:01:32.369> 5th<00:01:32.880> generation<00:01:33.180> seeing

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the the ipod touch 5th generation seeing

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.890 
the the ipod touch 5th generation seeing
sounds<00:01:34.409> kind<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> boring<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.970> yeah<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.750> we

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
sounds kind of boring so yeah but we

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.539 
sounds kind of boring so yeah but we
have<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.229> least<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.650> her<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> iphone<00:01:38.280> 5

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
have at least with her that iphone 5

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.850 
have at least with her that iphone 5
it's<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> total<00:01:40.290> redesign

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
it's going to have like a total redesign

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.490 
it's going to have like a total redesign
and<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> major<00:01:42.450> overhaul<00:01:42.659> so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and it's going to be a major overhaul so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.990 
and it's going to be a major overhaul so
yeah<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:45.240> also<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.610> we're<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.639 
yeah and we also do know that we're the
iphone<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.420> always<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> little<00:01:49.200> better<00:01:49.380> than

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
iphone is always a little better than

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.130 
iphone is always a little better than
the<00:01:49.829> app<00:01:50.670> touch<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:52.290> yeah<00:01:53.450> if<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.750> want

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the app touch so yeah if you want

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
the app touch so yeah if you want
something<00:01:55.320> badass<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.340> should<00:01:56.700> seek<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.210> for

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
something badass you should seek you for

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.499 
something badass you should seek you for
iphone<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.020> ipod<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.250> mostly<00:02:00.060> life<00:02:00.299> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
iphone and ipod but mostly life and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.700 
iphone and ipod but mostly life and
