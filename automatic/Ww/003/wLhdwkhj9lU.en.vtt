00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.030 
to come down here and pretty much cover
it<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.900> we're<00:02:37.079> just<00:02:37.109> going<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.469> accept<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.890> as

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
it so we're just going to accept it as

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.580 
it so we're just going to accept it as
is<00:02:38.280> but<00:02:38.909> it<00:02:39.659> could<00:02:39.689> have<00:02:39.900> been<00:02:39.930> worse<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.530> you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
is but it could have been worse so you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.380 
is but it could have been worse so you
want<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.859> open<00:02:41.099> up<00:02:41.219> that<00:02:41.280> crate<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:41.969> store

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
want to open up that crate in the store

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.289 
want to open up that crate in the store
and<00:02:42.689> just<00:02:43.069> go<00:02:44.069> ahead<00:02:44.159> and<00:02:44.340> inspect<00:02:44.549> all<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
and just go ahead and inspect all of the

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.809 
and just go ahead and inspect all of the
edges<00:02:46.069> particularly<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.159> corners<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.700> make

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
edges particularly the corners and make

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.080 
edges particularly the corners and make
sure<00:02:47.969> they're<00:02:48.090> not<00:02:48.209> chipped<00:02:49.310> alright<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.549> we

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
sure they're not chipped alright so we

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.539 
sure they're not chipped alright so we
just<00:02:51.359> got<00:02:51.810> finished<00:02:52.109> taking<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.799> bathtub

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
just got finished taking the bathtub

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.440 
just got finished taking the bathtub
that<00:02:53.579> we<00:02:53.790> just<00:02:54.000> put<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.359> out<00:02:55.400> we<00:02:56.400> missed<00:02:56.640> there

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
that we just put in out we missed there

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.179 
that we just put in out we missed there
was<00:02:57.569> an<00:02:57.749> issue<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:58.409> we<00:02:58.530> skip<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.920> step

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
was an issue and then we skip the step

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.459 
was an issue and then we skip the step
there's<00:02:59.879> a<00:02:59.969> 2x4<00:03:00.599> over<00:03:00.840> there<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.290> adds

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
there's a 2x4 over there that adds

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.229 
there's a 2x4 over there that adds
support<00:03:01.739> for<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.280> back<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.700> tub<00:03:02.939> it's

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
support for the back of the tub it's

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.080 
support for the back of the tub it's
known<00:03:03.989> as<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.290> stinger<00:03:04.739> that's<00:03:05.430> an<00:03:05.640> important

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
known as the stinger that's an important

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.390 
known as the stinger that's an important
piece<00:03:06.390> because<00:03:06.840> there's<00:03:07.739> nothing<00:03:08.010> holding<00:03:08.189> up

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
piece because there's nothing holding up

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.800 
piece because there's nothing holding up
the<00:03:08.519> back<00:03:08.700> end<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.969> the<00:03:09.090> tub<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:09.569> went<00:03:09.719> ahead

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
the back end of the tub so we went ahead

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.949 
the back end of the tub so we went ahead
and<00:03:10.079> installed<00:03:10.439> that<00:03:10.709> also<00:03:11.549> this<00:03:12.120> wall<00:03:12.480> we

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
and installed that also this wall we

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.459 
and installed that also this wall we
found<00:03:13.290> apparently<00:03:13.859> was<00:03:14.310> not<00:03:14.519> built<00:03:14.819> right<00:03:15.060> and

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
found apparently was not built right and

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.080 
found apparently was not built right and
it's<00:03:16.469> very<00:03:16.680> flimsy<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.280> not<00:03:17.459> supported<00:03:17.939> by

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
it's very flimsy it's not supported by

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.729 
it's very flimsy it's not supported by
anything<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:19.109> we<00:03:19.230> had<00:03:19.319> to<00:03:19.409> cut<00:03:19.590> out<00:03:19.709> some

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
anything so we had to cut out some

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.179 
anything so we had to cut out some
additional<00:03:20.280> sheetrock<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.680> we<00:03:22.680> put<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.920> little

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 
additional sheetrock and we put a little

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:24.890 
additional sheetrock and we put a little
bracket<00:03:23.519> up<00:03:23.849> there<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.239> kind<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.540> tie<00:03:24.749> that

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
bracket up there to kind of tie that

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.360 
bracket up there to kind of tie that
better<00:03:25.139> into<00:03:25.409> place<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.799> now<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.010> wall<00:03:26.249> was

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
better into place so now that wall was

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.520 
better into place so now that wall was
solid<00:03:26.849> and<00:03:26.999> now<00:03:27.659> we<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.900> put<00:03:27.989> our<00:03:28.109> wall<00:03:28.290> board

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
solid and now we can put our wall board

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.679 
solid and now we can put our wall board
up<00:03:28.680> on<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.159> now<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.400> that's<00:03:29.489> done<00:03:29.730> we<00:03:30.239> have

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:30.689 
up on it so now that that's done we have

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.420 
up on it so now that that's done we have
our<00:03:30.810> stager<00:03:31.079> will<00:03:31.409> throw<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.829> tub<00:03:32.010> back<00:03:32.159> into

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
our stager will throw the tub back into

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.770 
our stager will throw the tub back into
place<00:03:33.859> all<00:03:34.859> right<00:03:35.189> I'm<00:03:35.400> going<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.609> be<00:03:35.819> working

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
place all right I'm going to be working

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.160 
place all right I'm going to be working
on<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.849> now<00:03:38.849> that<00:03:38.999> the<00:03:39.090> tubs<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.540> place<00:03:39.840> and

I've got the drain roughs in I'm going

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.830 
I've got the drain roughs in I'm going
to<00:03:43.129> get<00:03:44.129> everything<00:03:44.340> settled<00:03:44.999> down<00:03:45.150> here<00:03:45.569> so

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
to get everything settled down here so

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.640 
to get everything settled down here so
I'm<00:03:45.989> already<00:03:46.760> in<00:03:47.760> an<00:03:47.879> earlier<00:03:48.209> video<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:49.019> put

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
I'm already in an earlier video I put

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.179 
I'm already in an earlier video I put
this<00:03:50.239> drain<00:03:51.239> assembly<00:03:51.359> back<00:03:51.840> there<00:03:52.109> now<00:03:53.010> that

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
this drain assembly back there now that

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.589 
this drain assembly back there now that
it's<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.459> there<00:03:53.639> it's<00:03:53.819> extremely<00:03:54.389> difficult

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
it's in there it's extremely difficult

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.019 
it's in there it's extremely difficult
to<00:03:54.959> get<00:03:55.260> back<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.859> maneuver<00:03:56.370> I've<00:03:56.670> got<00:03:56.909> about

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:57.029 
to get back and maneuver I've got about

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:00.470 
to get back and maneuver I've got about
four<00:03:57.480> inches<00:03:57.779> of<00:03:57.989> space<00:03:58.879> my<00:03:59.879> arms<00:04:00.299> all<00:04:00.450> messed

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
four inches of space my arms all messed

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.660 
four inches of space my arms all messed
up<00:04:00.930> from<00:04:01.139> reaching<00:04:01.560> back<00:04:01.739> there<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.159> tighten

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
up from reaching back there to tighten

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.309 
up from reaching back there to tighten
things<00:04:02.939> I've<00:04:03.150> already<00:04:03.450> kind<00:04:03.659> of<00:04:03.749> adjusted

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
things I've already kind of adjusted

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.379 
things I've already kind of adjusted
these<00:04:05.189> pipes<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.790> tightened<00:04:06.180> them<00:04:06.269> as

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
these pipes and tightened them as

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.289 
these pipes and tightened them as
necessary<00:04:06.599> so<00:04:07.340> first<00:04:08.340> step<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.819> to<00:04:08.969> put<00:04:09.180> this

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
necessary so first step is to put this

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.380 
necessary so first step is to put this
little<00:04:09.540> piece<00:04:09.629> on<00:04:09.959> there<00:04:11.090> the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
little piece on there the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.699 
little piece on there the
hold<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:12.960> place<00:04:13.140> actually<00:04:13.860> know<00:04:14.250> what

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
hold it in place actually know what

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.370 
hold it in place actually know what
before<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.739> do<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.870> this<00:04:18.870> will<00:04:19.049> be<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.230> first

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
before I do that this will be the first

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.080 
before I do that this will be the first
step<00:04:19.650> this<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.950> little<00:04:20.220> gasket<00:04:20.670> that<00:04:20.940> goes

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
step this is a little gasket that goes

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.450 
step this is a little gasket that goes
in<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.480> back<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.590> I'm<00:04:22.650> going<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.860> work<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.280> in

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
in the back so I'm going to work that in

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.630 
in the back so I'm going to work that in
you<00:04:24.330> want<00:04:24.570> this<00:04:24.810> little<00:04:25.740> tiny<00:04:25.980> piece<00:04:26.190> facing

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
you want this little tiny piece facing

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.300 
you want this little tiny piece facing
forward<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.240> these<00:04:28.140> three<00:04:28.620> ends<00:04:28.950> going<00:04:29.190> to

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
forward and these three ends going to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.470 
forward and these three ends going to
the<00:04:29.400> back<00:04:29.610> they<00:04:29.790> pretty<00:04:30.000> much<00:04:30.150> should<00:04:30.390> all

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
the back they pretty much should all

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:38.230 
the back they pretty much should all
look<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.810> same

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.410 

whatever<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.450> do<00:04:40.160> do<00:04:41.160> not<00:04:41.190> drop<00:04:42.030> anything

whatever you do do not drop anything
behind<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.770> tub<00:04:44.360> because<00:04:45.360> getting<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:46.080> will

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
behind the tub because getting it will

00:04:46.320 --> 00:05:12.230 
behind the tub because getting it will
be<00:04:46.500> very<00:04:46.740> difficult<00:05:10.400> this<00:05:11.400> is<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.669> stopper

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
be very difficult this is the stopper

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.500 
be very difficult this is the stopper
goes<00:05:12.660> down<00:05:12.930> here<00:05:14.030> after<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.060> turn<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.390> video

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
goes down here after I turn the video

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.180 
goes down here after I turn the video
off<00:05:15.690> I'm<00:05:16.110> going<00:05:16.230> to<00:05:16.290> go<00:05:16.470> back<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:16.860> make<00:05:17.010> some

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
off I'm going to go back and make some

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.880 
off I'm going to go back and make some
adjustments<00:05:17.280> but<00:05:18.290> two<00:05:19.290> screws<00:05:19.560> are<00:05:19.710> going<00:05:19.740> to

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
adjustments but two screws are going to

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.980 
adjustments but two screws are going to
go<00:05:20.010> in<00:05:20.160> here<00:05:20.190> I'm<00:05:21.180> not<00:05:21.240> going<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.570> put<00:05:21.690> this<00:05:21.780> on

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
go in here I'm not going to put this on

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.170 
go in here I'm not going to put this on
to<00:05:22.229> later<00:05:22.530> this<00:05:22.950> is<00:05:23.100> more<00:05:23.340> finished<00:05:23.760> plumbing

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
to later this is more finished plumbing

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.469 
to later this is more finished plumbing
and<00:05:24.419> I've<00:05:25.410> got<00:05:25.590> some<00:05:25.740> more<00:05:25.919> work<00:05:26.700> to<00:05:26.760> do<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.419> I

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
and I've got some more work to do and I

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.200 
and I've got some more work to do and I
get<00:05:27.780> this<00:05:27.930> all<00:05:28.110> dirty<00:05:28.729> so<00:05:29.729> I'm<00:05:29.820> going<00:05:29.970> to<00:05:30.000> take

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
get this all dirty so I'm going to take

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.010 
get this all dirty so I'm going to take
this<00:05:30.419> out<00:05:31.310> but<00:05:32.310> when<00:05:32.460> it<00:05:32.580> does<00:05:32.790> come<00:05:33.090> time<00:05:33.390> to

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
this out but when it does come time to

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.860 
this out but when it does come time to
adjust<00:05:34.530> this<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:35.040> just<00:05:35.190> spin<00:05:35.520> it<00:05:35.640> around<00:05:35.870> that

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
adjust this you just spin it around that

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.480 
adjust this you just spin it around that
gets<00:05:37.080> longer<00:05:37.500> shorter<00:05:37.950> you<00:05:38.130> need<00:05:38.250> to<00:05:38.340> make

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
gets longer shorter you need to make

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.710 
gets longer shorter you need to make
sure<00:05:38.520> it's<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.940> proper<00:05:39.300> length<00:05:39.510> back<00:05:41.450> so<00:05:42.450> the

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
sure it's the proper length back so the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.630 
sure it's the proper length back so the
next<00:05:42.960> step<00:05:43.229> is<00:05:43.410> going<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.620> be<00:05:43.800> putting<00:05:44.220> in<00:05:44.430> this

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
next step is going to be putting in this

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.570 
next step is going to be putting in this
drain<00:05:45.200> this<00:05:46.200> washer<00:05:46.800> needs<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.190> go<00:05:47.340> underneath

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
drain this washer needs to go underneath

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.170 
drain this washer needs to go underneath
in<00:05:48.330> between<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.780> bathtub<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:50.669> pipe<00:05:50.910> down

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
in between the bathtub and the pipe down

00:05:51.180 --> 00:06:00.070 
in between the bathtub and the pipe down
here<00:05:51.830> so<00:05:52.830> this<00:05:52.979> is<00:05:53.300> if<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:54.450> can<00:05:54.630> squeeze<00:05:55.020> it<00:05:55.229> down

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.409 

again<00:06:01.080> do<00:06:01.890> not<00:06:01.919> drop<00:06:04.070> anything<00:06:05.070> down<00:06:05.460> there<00:06:05.760> so

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
again do not drop anything down there so

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.740 
again do not drop anything down there so
if<00:06:06.540> I<00:06:06.630> would<00:06:06.810> lose<00:06:07.320> that

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
if I would lose that

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:20.290 
if I would lose that
be<00:06:09.590> tough<00:06:09.860> to<00:06:09.980> get<00:06:10.100> back<00:06:19.000> just<00:06:20.000> get<00:06:20.150> this

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
be tough to get back just get this

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.140 
be tough to get back just get this

plumbers<00:06:23.480> putty<00:06:24.190> this<00:06:25.190> is<00:06:25.490> not<00:06:25.760> a<00:06:25.790> step<00:06:26.240> that

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
plumbers putty this is not a step that

plumbers putty this is not a step that
some<00:06:29.240> people<00:06:29.480> skip<00:06:29.750> this<00:06:29.960> but<00:06:30.670> this<00:06:31.670> will<00:06:31.850> help

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
this slide down we're pretty much done I

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.420 
this slide down we're pretty much done I
can<00:07:08.540> start<00:07:08.750> running<00:07:09.050> water<00:07:09.260> in<00:07:09.470> here<00:07:09.680> water

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
can start running water in here water

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.120 
can start running water in here water
should<00:07:10.760> feed<00:07:11.000> into<00:07:11.240> the<00:07:11.330> drain<00:07:11.830> before<00:07:12.830> I

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
should feed into the drain before I

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.710 
should feed into the drain before I
start<00:07:13.460> putting<00:07:13.669> on<00:07:13.760> my<00:07:13.880> wall<00:07:14.150> board<00:07:14.419> and

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
start putting on my wall board and

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.530 
start putting on my wall board and
finishing<00:07:15.530> things<00:07:15.560> I<00:07:16.100> do<00:07:16.700> want<00:07:17.060> to<00:07:17.180> make<00:07:17.330> sure

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
finishing things I do want to make sure

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.300 
finishing things I do want to make sure
that<00:07:17.720> I<00:07:17.780> don't<00:07:17.870> have<00:07:18.140> any<00:07:18.320> leaks<00:07:18.530> so<00:07:19.010> go<00:07:19.190> back

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 
that I don't have any leaks so go back

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.530 
that I don't have any leaks so go back
and<00:07:19.370> check<00:07:20.350> also<00:07:21.350> with<00:07:21.680> this<00:07:21.800> step<00:07:22.060> don't<00:07:23.060> over

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 
and check also with this step don't over

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.520 
and check also with this step don't over
tighten<00:07:23.780> it<00:07:25.120> so<00:07:26.120> that's<00:07:26.330> pretty<00:07:26.540> good<00:07:26.840> just

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.530 
tighten it so that's pretty good just

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:35.410 
tighten it so that's pretty good just
wipe<00:07:27.770> up<00:07:27.950> the<00:07:27.979> excess<00:07:28.130> putty<00:07:30.820> and
