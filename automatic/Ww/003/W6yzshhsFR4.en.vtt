00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello fast today a 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.509
 small inspection a small a small 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.240
 inspection of a fastback 1968 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:18.300
 this one is equipped with a v8 engine of 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 289 québec inc she is the director 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.250
 assisted power steering and that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.640
 see here 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.599
 and apparently has been added recently 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.059
 a set a brake system to 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.660
 disc with the assistance we see here the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.630
 master 29 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.530
 dubois evening francs 6.9 and then we 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.070
 see below through the macaroons 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.450
 racing sends a disco disco game 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.890
 9 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.350
 so this is this car that is 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.460
 probably dancing with that they 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.080
 wear for the mans his painting 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.660
 original 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.290
 it's a project no doubt it is 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.570
 complete and she really has a level of 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.310
 rust but healthy enough a level 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.619
 quite minimal and good bodywork 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.009
 we see this big hole here back 2-2 and 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.649
 powerful and it's practically the 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.950
 only place with regard to the bottom 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.270
 the bottom the bodywork and doors to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.340
 everything else is rather even if he 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.310
 was very very beautiful any little bubble 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.410
 here is reer to continue with them 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.060
 with rust 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.570
 we see behind here it stays 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.840
 solid 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.830
 I saw some rust on the inside 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.550
 of the hall here I do not know if it is 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.319
 will see on the video probably not 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.420
 so here's the inside we see 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.940
 that there is rust la la rust 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.030
 piercing which still part of the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.080
 inner plate here that is gone and then 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.300
 and then well, well, we suspect a little 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.319
 little planks and boards and 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.959
 floors with a hole here at the front 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.380
 before right we see a nice shot of 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.700
 surface rust and even a little 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.620
 say perforating so on the boards 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:17.500
 and so obviously floor has floored to 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:21.260
 replace the interior is in poor condition 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.370
 it's an interior towards time we see 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.890
 the dashboard cap is 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.720
 cut in half the console console that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.310
 can spoil good let jean by the pope 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.120
 at our roof sky door all that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.080
 so good brief a complete inside to 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.840
 see again here is obviously we have to 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.410
 So the mustang fastback 60 us 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.990
 antique 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.930
 came quickly to the bottom of the doors 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.750
 light very very light here bull 2 ​​euros 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.930
 there is nothing strange 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.360
 it's really the other side that has been 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.180
 reached at one place 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.670
 here are the lights by shaw the chrome by 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.730
 against in the air this one is in very 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.560
 very good state 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:13.260
 the front gate is in good condition and I 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.720
 go there some bars and so we disappointed in 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.880
 passing I report a game a game of 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.450
 wheels it must be 15 inches american 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:27.120
 racing tires bf goodrich 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:36.830
 the 205 75 here is everything at this post there 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.830
 here is then declines here 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:47.450
 not this one here it's gone 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:04:01.489
 of the throttle she wants to party 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.090
 since this was going to 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.120
 inside and ben we see an outline 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.890
 who works who is not dead it's 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.600
 that the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.180
 nor deficiency in throwing his dirty but 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.140
 finally here is the ice here 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.410
 face that pin to sow the leb the 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.940
 plastic and is in very good condition 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.230
 a fuel gauge on a sweaty 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.000
 small so hard to say if they 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.250
 operate a priori so the alternator 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.440
 works at prescient pressure 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.870
 of oil the circle 40 not work 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.860
 because it would be bad 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.940
 it's not good cold temperatures that's it 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.940
 to the original car radio here 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.960
 small gauges to your funds can 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.960
 what to add to the restrains 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.330
 Automatic banker here we go the 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.080
 listen to the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.080
 approached the engine 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.050
 So here is an engine that is who and who 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.960
 very good start and then obviously 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.080
 which turns they have very well then the 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.240
 sense here well well sweet steady point 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.270
 in its original state 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.870
 apparently so the mali if 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.409
 electronic arts swore t on 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.460
 and 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.150
 recently that they have 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.860
 here 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.860
 poté the state of the destroyed cases 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.379
 here 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.090
 the engine advantage 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.090
 allaire 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.650
 ac saint lô 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.630
 a girlfriend put me there you go 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.080
 often the tail 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.080
 and the problem 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.690
 no it's a bit too much of a surprise 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.699
 but on the pasture is gone but but 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.520
 no step no rust no hole 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.810
 at 6 here a little bit all a little bit of 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.610
 reference that we see in the video 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.360
 certainly a little light here in 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.759
 underneath there so under the support of 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.860
 battery a bit of rust performing 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.259
 hyper performing not too much but 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.030
 perforant brit is here too a place 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.360
 as well 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.360
 not pretty 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.340
