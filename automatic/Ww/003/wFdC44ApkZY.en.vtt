00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.829 

okay<00:00:03.120> so<00:00:03.179> it's<00:00:04.879> where's<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.029> kinetic<00:00:06.509> energy

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
okay so it's where's the kinetic energy

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.540 
okay so it's where's the kinetic energy
recovery<00:00:07.109> system<00:00:07.589> what<00:00:07.830> you're<00:00:08.010> trying<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.370> do

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
recovery system what you're trying to do

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.089 
recovery system what you're trying to do
is<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.910> wanna<00:00:09.090> store<00:00:09.420> energy<00:00:09.900> when<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.889> car

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
is you wanna store energy when the car

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.280 
is you wanna store energy when the car
is<00:00:11.130> slowing<00:00:11.580> down<00:00:11.719> normally<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.929> kinetic

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
is slowing down normally the kinetic

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.650 
is slowing down normally the kinetic
energy<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.160> vehicle<00:00:14.280> gets<00:00:14.880> wasted<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.420> seat

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
energy of the vehicle gets wasted a seat

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.529 
energy of the vehicle gets wasted a seat
on<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.139> breakfast<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.760> do<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.270> we

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
on the breakfast and what we do is we

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.210 
on the breakfast and what we do is we
have<00:00:18.750> an<00:00:18.990> equal<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.560> obviously<00:00:19.890> torque

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
have an equal but obviously torque

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.250 
have an equal but obviously torque
transfer<00:00:20.460> between<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> vehicle<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
transfer between the vehicle and the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.560 
transfer between the vehicle and the
flywheel<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> while<00:00:23.939> increasing<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
flywheel so while increasing the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.179 
flywheel so while increasing the
flywheel<00:00:24.930> speed<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.439> slow<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> vehicle<00:00:25.949> down

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
flywheel speed we slow the vehicle down

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.419 
flywheel speed we slow the vehicle down
it's<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.910> bit<00:00:27.150> similar<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.599> engine<00:00:28.289> braking<00:00:28.560> so

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it's a bit similar to engine braking so

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.040 
it's a bit similar to engine braking so
then<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.730> car<00:00:29.910> drives<00:00:30.210> around<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.599> corner

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
then the car drives around the corner

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.420 
then the car drives around the corner
and<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> trainer<00:00:31.590> wants<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.980> accelerate

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and the trainer wants to accelerate

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
and the trainer wants to accelerate
again<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.180> now<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.079> energy

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
again and now we can get this energy

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530 
again and now we can get this energy
back<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.579> slow<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> flywheel<00:00:36.329> down

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
back and we can slow the flywheel down

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.600 
back and we can slow the flywheel down
but<00:00:37.170> therefore<00:00:37.559> increase<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> speed<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
but therefore increase the speed of the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.299 
but therefore increase the speed of the
vehicle<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.559> recovered

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
vehicle and you can use that recovered

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.160 
vehicle and you can use that recovered
energy<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.850> two<00:00:42.059> ways<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.629> use<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
energy in two ways you can use it to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.529 
energy in two ways you can use it to
replace<00:00:43.590> engine<00:00:44.100> power<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.300> can

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
replace engine power and then you can

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.410 
replace engine power and then you can
basically<00:00:46.289> save<00:00:46.800> fuel<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.940> also<00:00:48.120> use

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
basically save fuel but you can also use

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.270 
basically save fuel but you can also use
it<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.719> top<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.320> engine<00:00:49.440> power<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.129> then

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it on top of the engine power and then

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
it on top of the engine power and then
you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.550> increase<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.000> performance<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you can increase the performance of the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.029 
you can increase the performance of the
vehicle<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.789> if<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.210> compare<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.860> these

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
vehicle and if you compare one of these

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.060 
vehicle and if you compare one of these
systems<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.230> Houston<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> limo

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
systems here that is Houston in the limo

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.610 
systems here that is Houston in the limo
racing<00:00:59.489> car<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.969> compared<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> Formula<00:01:01.440> One

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
racing car and compared to Formula One

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.490 
racing car and compared to Formula One
car<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.270> then<00:01:03.270> these<00:01:03.600> systems<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> lot

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
car and then these systems are a lot

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
car and then these systems are a lot
more<00:01:04.710> powerful<00:01:05.040> compared<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> their<00:01:05.939> phone

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
more powerful compared to their phone

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020 
more powerful compared to their phone
system<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.560> Formula<00:01:07.979> One<00:01:08.010> regulations<00:01:08.460> are

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
system the Formula One regulations are

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330 
system the Formula One regulations are
quite<00:01:09.240> tight<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.650> don't<00:01:10.920> allow<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
quite tight and they don't allow you to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.090 
quite tight and they don't allow you to
store<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.060> energy<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.900> around<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
store so much energy and around the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.520 
store so much energy and around the
track<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.670> where<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.600> here<00:01:15.780> today<00:01:16.080> we

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
track like where we are here today we

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.380 
track like where we are here today we
can<00:01:16.560> release<00:01:17.130> about<00:01:17.460> twice<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.970> much<00:01:18.119> energy

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
can release about twice as much energy

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.690 
can release about twice as much energy
than<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.290> allowed<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.130> Formula<00:01:20.549> One

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
than what is allowed in in Formula One

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.170 
than what is allowed in in Formula One
and<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.509> system<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.040> quite<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> compact

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and the system here is quite a compact

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
and the system here is quite a compact
and<00:01:24.360> small<00:01:24.689> unit<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:26.009> deliver<00:01:26.280> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and small unit that can deliver this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.359 
and small unit that can deliver this
kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.820> performance<00:01:27.270> levels

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.819 

yeah<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.179> we<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.420> been<00:01:33.659> working<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.320> Dyson

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
yeah so we have been working with Dyson

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.550 
yeah so we have been working with Dyson
for<00:01:35.070> quite<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> few<00:01:35.759> months<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:37.259> think

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
for quite a few months now and I think

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.870 
for quite a few months now and I think
our<00:01:37.890> first<00:01:38.189> talks<00:01:38.520> were<00:01:38.759> back<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> end<00:01:39.960> of

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
our first talks were back at the end of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.620 
our first talks were back at the end of
2011

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
2011

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.139 
2011
so<00:01:42.780> quite<00:01:43.079> some<00:01:43.319> long<00:01:43.500> time<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.219> we<00:01:45.060> have

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so quite some long time now and we have

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.020 
so quite some long time now and we have
designed<00:01:45.359> the<00:01:45.780> system<00:01:46.280> yeah<00:01:47.310> specifically

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
designed the system yeah specifically

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.870 
designed the system yeah specifically
for<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:48.569> are<00:01:48.689> racing<00:01:49.079> car<00:01:49.289> so<00:01:49.649> our<00:01:50.310> system<00:01:50.789> is

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
for they are racing car so our system is

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520 
for they are racing car so our system is
packaged<00:01:51.270> between<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> engine<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
packaged between the engine and the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
packaged between the engine and the
gearbox<00:01:52.579> so<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.969> racing<00:01:54.329> car<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> can

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
gearbox so in a racing car you can

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440 
gearbox so in a racing car you can
imagine<00:01:54.959> the<00:01:55.380> space<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.950> quite<00:01:56.280> tight<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.270> we

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
imagine the space is quite tight so we

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.330 
imagine the space is quite tight so we
have<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.840> make<00:01:58.140> sure<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.500> our<00:01:58.619> system<00:01:59.039> fits

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
have to make sure that our system fits

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.940 
have to make sure that our system fits
quite<00:01:59.549> nicely<00:01:59.670> into<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> racing<00:02:00.929> car<00:02:01.289> that<00:02:01.829> we

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
quite nicely into the racing car that we

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.460 
quite nicely into the racing car that we
can<00:02:01.979> package<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.549> our<00:02:02.700> components<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.289> we

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
can package all our components in and we

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.139 
can package all our components in and we
have<00:02:04.560> managed<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.069> that<00:02:05.099> so<00:02:05.459> all<00:02:05.759> ancillary

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
have managed to do that so all ancillary

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.069 
have managed to do that so all ancillary
off<00:02:06.720> our<00:02:07.110> system<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.759> hydraulic<00:02:08.759> rams

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
off our system so hydraulic rams

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.229 
off our system so hydraulic rams
accumulators<00:02:10.190> all<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.400> sensors<00:02:11.849> everything

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
accumulators all the sensors everything

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.789 
accumulators all the sensors everything
like<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.810> actually<00:02:13.170> packaged<00:02:13.530> within

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
like that is actually packaged within

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.920 
like that is actually packaged within
the<00:02:14.040> bell<00:02:14.190> housing<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> gearbox<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.480> the
