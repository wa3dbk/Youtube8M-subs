00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.479
 This is a traditional toy that 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.359
 we can do ourselves with the 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:08.590
 simpler things that are found in 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.960
 home 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.840
 we take a cardboard strip of it 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.130
 width than a matchbox 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.490
 we wrap this strip around the 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.369
 box 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.500
 then we remove the box and paste the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.450
 strip with tape 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.780
 so that it maintains its form 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.820
 that it is important that there is a little 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.880
 loose so we can re-fit 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.160
 the box of matches in the box 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.810
 matches we take the inside with 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.290
 the matches 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.200
 we are not going to need them 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.510
 and now we partially put the part 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 from outside the matchbox in the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.300
 cardboard hoop 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.300
 and we put two marbles 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.350
 and we finished putting the box of 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.449
 matches on the cardboard strip 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.940
 marbles will make part of the box 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.369
 be heavier than the other for 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.030
 decorate it we can draw for example 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.030
 two pretty 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.130
 Now we are going to place the toy in a 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.750
 inclined table and the monkeys start to 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.250
 fall in the most fun way 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.250
 intriguing that we can think 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.110
 we can also do it with a small 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.290
 plastic box in this case we are 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.840
 using a powder box we place 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.630
 three marbles in it and then we close the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.880
 top we stick a paper in the box 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.240
 plastic to increase friction 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.229
 if we put this box on a ramp this 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.229
 it's going to start falling 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.160
 here we can see some guys from the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.819
 school they have a lot of fun with 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.819
 this game
