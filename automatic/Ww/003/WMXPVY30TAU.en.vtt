jumpin minnow the rebel jumpin minnow
it's<00:01:31.770> an<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.189> an<00:01:32.280> oldie<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.820> goodie<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it's an it's an oldie but a goodie this

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's an it's an oldie but a goodie this
is<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.009> again<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.460> bone<00:01:35.700> color<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.509> pearl

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
is a and again the bone color or pearl

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.039 
is a and again the bone color or pearl
color<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.610> dynamite<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> early

color is just dynamite in the early
season<00:01:40.229> again<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
season again I think it's because it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.800 
season again I think it's because it
imitates<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.960> squid<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:44.549> also<00:01:44.700> has<00:01:44.970> listen

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
imitates a squid and it also has listen

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.370 
imitates a squid and it also has listen
you<00:01:45.899> hear<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
you hear it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.830 
you hear it
little<00:01:46.890> rattles<00:01:47.310> inside<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> Cordell
