down some of that excess and you move
down<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:33.780> see<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:33.930> reflectivity<00:04:34.440> so

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
down you see the reflectivity so

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.830 
down you see the reflectivity so
anthracite<00:04:35.250> anthracite<00:04:36.030> reflectivity<00:04:36.510> down
