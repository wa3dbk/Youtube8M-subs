the<00:01:55.619> turtle<00:01:55.920> beach<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.579> my<00:01:57.149> brother<00:01:57.390> uses

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the turtle beach that I my brother uses

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.709 
the turtle beach that I my brother uses
the<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.409> think<00:01:59.250> they're<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.430> x11<00:02:00.060> stare

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the I think they're the x11 stare

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.660 
the I think they're the x11 stare
they're<00:02:00.960> not<00:02:01.200> really<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.770> good<00:02:02.070> quality<00:02:02.549> at

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
they're not really that good quality at

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.399 
they're not really that good quality at
all<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:03.119> break<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> lot<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> turtle

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
all they break a lot and the turtle

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
all they break a lot and the turtle
beaches<00:02:04.710> there<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.490> bad<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.090> general

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
beaches there just like bad in general

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.510 
beaches there just like bad in general
so<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.899> wouldn't<00:02:07.710> recommend<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
so I wouldn't recommend going with the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.160 
so I wouldn't recommend going with the
turtle<00:02:08.879> beach<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.780> afford<00:02:09.869> them

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
turtle beach but if you can afford them

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.960 
turtle beach but if you can afford them
then<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.890> guess<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.400> that's<00:02:11.730> better

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
then I guess that's that's better

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.760 
then I guess that's that's better
because<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.989> face<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.500> have
