that<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.350> bit<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> punch<00:01:49.680> through<00:01:49.920> there

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
that a little bit of punch through there

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.920 
that a little bit of punch through there
basically<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.240> you're<00:01:51.330> aiming<00:01:51.630> from<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
basically when you're aiming from the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.670 
basically when you're aiming from the
hip<00:01:52.080> without<00:01:52.280> charging<00:01:53.280> okay<00:01:54.380> nice<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> have

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
hip without charging okay nice to have

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.960 
hip without charging okay nice to have
and<00:01:56.009> always<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.490> careful<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
and always be careful with the

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.760 
and always be careful with the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
Thunderbolt if you get too close you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.580 
Thunderbolt if you get too close you
could<00:01:58.950> damage<00:01:59.189> yourself<00:01:59.630> now<00:02:00.630> point<00:02:01.290> strike

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
that they're going to get some nice

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
bleed proc out of it and that's also why

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.050 
bleed proc out of it and that's also why
we<00:02:30.620> add<00:02:30.769> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.099> fang<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.519> fusillade

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
we add in the fang that fusillade

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.430 
we add in the fang that fusillade
because<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.140> such<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> high<00:02:34.840> direct<00:02:35.840> /

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
because this is such a high direct /

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.289 
because this is such a high direct /
damage<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.280> doesn't<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:37.790> have<00:02:38.000> much<00:02:38.030> more

little bit of everything on it now a

you the the other bill here if you want

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.400 
you the the other bill here if you want
to<00:02:48.769> maximize<00:02:49.220> even<00:02:49.549> more<00:02:49.790> okay<00:02:50.569> we<00:02:51.200> could

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
to maximize even more okay we could

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.650 
to maximize even more okay we could
actually<00:02:51.680> go<00:02:51.980> ahead<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.310> change<00:02:52.910> critical

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
actually go ahead and change critical

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.539 
actually go ahead and change critical
delay<00:02:53.989> in<00:02:54.230> here<00:02:54.530> for<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:54.920> hundred<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.280> forty

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549

five nine percent critical chance with a

five nine percent critical chance with a
4.4<00:02:58.970> multiplier<00:02:59.390> which<00:02:59.629> is<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.650> fine<00:03:00.799> as

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
4.4 multiplier which is just fine as

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.680 
4.4 multiplier which is just fine as
well<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.790> you're<00:03:02.120> going<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.299> get<00:03:02.420> slightly

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
well and you're going to get slightly

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.780 
well and you're going to get slightly
more<00:03:03.019> red<00:03:03.260> crits<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.769> I've<00:03:04.190> run<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.489> this<00:03:04.640> way

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
more red crits and I've run it this way

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.460 
more red crits and I've run it this way
no<00:03:04.970> prom<00:03:05.209> at<00:03:05.329> all<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.870> going<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.170> drop<00:03:06.409> down

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
no prom at all it's going to drop down

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.759 
no prom at all it's going to drop down
your<00:03:06.920> fiery<00:03:07.159> just<00:03:07.730> below<00:03:08.359> what<00:03:08.959> this<00:03:09.170> the

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
your fiery just below what this the

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.119 
your fiery just below what this the
original<00:03:10.040> was<00:03:10.819> not<00:03:11.060> too<00:03:11.900> much<00:03:12.260> noticeable

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
original was not too much noticeable

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.710 
original was not too much noticeable
there<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.609> you're<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.269> lose<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.480> little

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
there and you're going to lose a little

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.349 
there and you're going to lose a little
status<00:03:15.230> chance<00:03:15.530> but<00:03:16.159> overall<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.909> gain<00:03:17.180> that

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
status chance but overall you gain that

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.420 
status chance but overall you gain that
extra<00:03:17.569> twenty-five<00:03:18.230> percent<00:03:18.530> critical

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
extra twenty-five percent critical

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.490 
extra twenty-five percent critical
chance<00:03:19.669> and<00:03:19.970> that's<00:03:20.180> always<00:03:20.599> a<00:03:20.780> nice<00:03:21.079> thing<00:03:21.139> to

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
chance and that's always a nice thing to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.909 
chance and that's always a nice thing to
have<00:03:21.620> as<00:03:21.889> well<00:03:22.069> so<00:03:22.639> you<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:22.790> do<00:03:23.090> that<00:03:23.450> if<00:03:23.720> you

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
have as well so you can do that if you

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.920 
have as well so you can do that if you
want<00:03:24.919> to<00:03:25.180> necessary<00:03:26.180> but<00:03:26.419> you<00:03:26.569> can<00:03:26.720> do<00:03:26.810> that

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
want to necessary but you can do that

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.360 
want to necessary but you can do that
and<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.169> have<00:03:27.349> run<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.769> way<00:03:27.889> before<00:03:28.010> and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
and I have run it that way before and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.270 
and I have run it that way before and
it's<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.239> pretty<00:03:29.419> nice<00:03:29.599> thing<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.049> do<00:03:30.200> now<00:03:31.010> build

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
it's a pretty nice thing to do now build

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.390 
it's a pretty nice thing to do now build
a<00:03:31.489> is<00:03:31.790> basically<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.690> same<00:03:32.959> thing<00:03:33.400> except

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
a is basically the same thing except
