especially<00:06:13.160> in<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.310> beginning<00:06:13.430> is<00:06:13.789> I<00:06:14.539> find

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
especially in the beginning is I find

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.290 
especially in the beginning is I find
that<00:06:14.900> it's<00:06:15.139> very<00:06:15.350> very<00:06:15.530> demoralizing<00:06:16.250> to<00:06:16.460> my

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
that it's very very demoralizing to my

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.820 
that it's very very demoralizing to my
clients<00:06:17.720> so<00:06:17.780> that's<00:06:17.960> why<00:06:18.080> whenever<00:06:18.380> I<00:06:18.530> train<00:06:18.800> a

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
clients so that's why whenever I train a

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.100 
clients so that's why whenever I train a
new<00:06:19.100> person<00:06:19.460> I<00:06:19.639> was

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
new person I was

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.200 
new person I was
a<00:06:20.140> little<00:06:20.500> bit<00:06:20.590> of<00:06:20.680> leg<00:06:20.830> look<00:06:21.700> the<00:06:21.850> chest<00:06:22.120> a

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
a little bit of leg look the chest a

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.120 
a little bit of leg look the chest a
little<00:06:22.240> bit<00:06:22.420> back<00:06:22.690> a<00:06:22.900> little<00:06:23.050> bit<00:06:23.200> core<00:06:23.470> okay

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
little bit back a little bit core okay

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.680 
little bit back a little bit core okay
so<00:06:24.580> they<00:06:24.790> kind<00:06:25.030> of<00:06:25.090> get<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.300> whole<00:06:25.450> body

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
so they kind of get the whole body

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.030 
so they kind of get the whole body
moving<00:06:26.050> and<00:06:26.230> they're<00:06:26.350> feeling<00:06:26.680> good<00:06:26.770> the<00:06:26.920> next

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
moving and they're feeling good the next

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.640 
moving and they're feeling good the next
day<00:06:27.250> as<00:06:27.370> opposed<00:06:27.700> to<00:06:27.730> being<00:06:28.020> very<00:06:29.020> very<00:06:29.350> sore

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
day as opposed to being very very sore

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.180 
day as opposed to being very very sore
that's<00:06:30.130> no<00:06:30.250> good<00:06:30.400> so<00:06:31.200> one<00:06:32.200> more<00:06:32.290> time<00:06:32.320> you<00:06:32.740> can
