00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
scrimmage and the next thing you got to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.110 
scrimmage and the next thing you got to
pay<00:00:46.469> attention<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.250> even<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.789> he's<00:00:47.940> not

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
pay attention to is even if he's not

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.510 
pay attention to is even if he's not
between<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> tackles<00:00:48.829> um<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.340> he's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
between the tackles um you know if he's

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.970 
between the tackles um you know if he's
near<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.059> area<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.750> lot<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> times<00:00:52.770> he'll

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
near that area a lot of the times he'll

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
near that area a lot of the times he'll
turn<00:00:53.129> into<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> blocker<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
turn into a blocker so you have to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.020 
turn into a blocker so you have to
experiment<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.500> lab<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.550> each

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
experiment and lab it out with each

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.860 
experiment and lab it out with each
individual<00:00:57.719> playbook<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.440> each<00:00:59.100> dividual

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
individual playbook and each dividual

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.590 
individual playbook and each dividual
individual<00:01:00.870> formation<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.980> player<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
individual formation and player so you

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.469 
individual formation and player so you
know<00:01:03.690> keep<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.199> mind<00:01:04.379> hmm<00:01:05.339> another<00:01:06.270> thing

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
know keep that in mind hmm another thing

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
that I'm running you know obviously this

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.980 
that I'm running you know obviously this
out<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.010> running<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.390> just

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
create a lot more open space because

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.390 
create a lot more open space because
there's<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.479> less<00:01:18.689> defender<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:20.040> then

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
there's one less defender and then

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.920 
there's one less defender and then
another<00:01:20.670> thing<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
another thing we can do is like in this

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.499 
another thing we can do is like in this
I<00:01:22.110> form<00:01:22.439> right<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.970> motion<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
I form right here is I can motion the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
I form right here is I can motion the
tight<00:01:24.720> end<00:01:24.930> over<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.770> flip<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> play

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
tight end over and then flip the play

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
tight end over and then flip the play
and<00:01:26.820> what<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.210> allows<00:01:27.330> me<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.229> motion

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and what that allows me to do is motion

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
and what that allows me to do is motion
that<00:01:29.220> wire<00:01:29.400> receiver<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> left<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that wire receiver on the left and you

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960 
that wire receiver on the left and you
know<00:01:31.049> use<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> clear<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> met<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.070> again<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
know use the clear I met it again and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.330 
know use the clear I met it again and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
them as a lead blocker this is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.230 
them as a lead blocker this is
especially<00:01:47.040> effective<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.850> bigger<00:01:48.030> wide

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
especially effective with bigger wide

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.850 
especially effective with bigger wide
receivers<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.320> use<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.680> pretty

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
receivers but you can use it with pretty

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
receivers but you can use it with pretty
much<00:01:49.979> any<00:01:50.159> wide<00:01:50.340> receiver<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> little

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
much any wide receiver we got a little

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.630 
much any wide receiver we got a little
Thomas<00:01:52.170> leading<00:01:52.500> us<00:01:52.590> leading<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> charge

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
Thomas leading us leading the charge

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
Thomas leading us leading the charge
right<00:01:53.880> now<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:54.960> ahead<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
right now you can go ahead and use that

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.789 
right now you can go ahead and use that
for<00:01:55.860> nice<00:01:56.490> run<00:01:56.759> blocking<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> middle

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
for nice run blocking up the middle

for nice run blocking up the middle
another<00:01:58.799> thing<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.520> create<00:01:59.790> extra

another thing we can do is create extra

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.800 
another thing we can do is create extra
blocking<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.689> know

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
blocking and what we can do is you know

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.469 
blocking and what we can do is you know
obviously<00:02:04.110> black<00:02:04.649> running<00:02:04.920> back

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479

see Louis I blocked

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.440 
see Louis I blocked
to<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> right<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.850> can<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.270> by

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
to the right and you can do that by

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.400 
to the right and you can do that by
hitting<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:17.000> hot<00:02:18.000> route<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.570> then<00:02:19.080> our

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
hitting you know hot route and then our

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.640 
hitting you know hot route and then our
two<00:02:19.950> or<00:02:20.190> our<00:02:20.700> right<00:02:21.060> trigger<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.440> block

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
two or our right trigger but to block

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.710 
two or our right trigger but to block
them<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> left<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.670> got<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.000> use<00:02:24.180> alt<00:02:24.510> or

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
them to the left you got to use alt or

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.330 
them to the left you got to use alt or
left<00:02:25.050> trigger<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.620> actually<00:02:26.070> makes<00:02:26.250> a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
left trigger and that actually makes a

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.800 
left trigger and that actually makes a
huge<00:02:26.490> difference<00:02:26.790> because<00:02:27.030> as<00:02:27.480> you've<00:02:27.690> seen

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
huge difference because as you've seen

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.690 
huge difference because as you've seen
