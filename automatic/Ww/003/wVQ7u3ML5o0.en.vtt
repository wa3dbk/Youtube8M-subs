00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:08.700

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:11.849
 philco model eh onyx watch 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.450
 It has 300 watts of power 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.410
 we will show here the amount of 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.170
 clear 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.320
 I have about half a cup or 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:32.610
 be three large egg whites 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:34.730
 Let's put the machine on let's turn on the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.730
 appliance 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 Othello 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.980
 it has a small 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.980
 manufacturing 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:26.100
 by still having a tire does not have a little 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:29.180
 good result, but clear 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.180
 it's snowy 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:43.440
 only in my opinion it 's a not a 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:44.760
 metal tram but finally philco onyx model 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.709
 watch 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.980
 it is the first time they have had in 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.930
 packaging today it comes with a 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:04:01.890
 fails that it does not turn on 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:05.300
 Look, this is what you have to do here, but it's 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.300
 only things can be said once 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:14.130
 but her performance in the clear does not 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.580
 It was very good, not my opinion. 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.580
