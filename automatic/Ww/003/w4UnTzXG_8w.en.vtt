00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.850

 simple download it so first thing 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.500
 what we have to do and do as 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.840
 It is always going to the link that we have in 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.430

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.640
 and then copy open your internet the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 true that you have and I was already 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.789
 Pasting the link 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 that is going to take you to this page the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.900
 page is not mine by the way there are many 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.500
 things he says 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.770
 good to see already here has the names of 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.710
 all discs is the year in which 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.970
 they got out and that's all this is 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.260
 discography information not to that 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.050
 because in the part that says the link 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.900
 folder there where mega says they're going to 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:16.240
 Right click and open in a new 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:20.590
 260 page tab waiting for you 5 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.310
 second seconds and as soon as 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.159
 they can skip advertising 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.210
 but little bit will load this I think that 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.740
 it takes a little bit I do not remember 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.920
 and I think if it were a little bit 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.750
 because it's something heavy is all this one 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.270
 once they have been opened 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.180
 well the page disappear all these 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.850
 things and here comes the name of the disk and 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.530
 the year in all now the only thing that 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.610
 they have to do is very simple what 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.150
 only thing they have to do is give it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.060
 double click on all 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.260
 to all the discs of these and if they 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.690
 they will start to download here 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.900
 this I 'm going to the buoy 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.670
 Here is the internet once I have them 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.200

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.959
 fast file 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.709
 here what they have to do is put 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.680
 in extracting 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:24.269
 then it is what is extracted from this 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.010
 folder and there you have the CD 1 and 2 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.920

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.780
 decided since not all come like this and 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.150
