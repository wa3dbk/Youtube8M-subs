00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.370
 welcome to the tutorial that shows how 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.859
 download and install the game command 5 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.460
 in 1 is the version for pc is a 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.340

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.910
 As you can see here includes zinc 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.350
 five sets of commands how do you walk 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.780
 behind the lines 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.950
 how I go beyond the duty baby 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.760
 as the 22 23 berlin destination and commands 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.030
 strikeforce 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.910
 here you can see what it includes consists of 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.700
 18 parts 17 feet in 450 megs and the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.350
 last weighs only 239 megabytes the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.380
 password to unzip streep from 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 new punto combo dot of dotcom 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.920
 well once downloaded all the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290
 parts that make up the game command 5 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.989
 in 1 we are going to give part 1 click 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.280
 right extract the password here to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.840
 unzip is www.computicket.com and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.500
 here you start to decompress the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.480
 game consists of two dvds 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.610
 as a recommendation we must have all 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.530
 the parts in the same folder all 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.280
 the parts start the same except the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.470
 last one that always weighs a little less 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.869
 when you finish decompressing messages 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.460
 of error in warning missions is 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.280
 will create the folder to which it contains 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.080
 the images did we enter and here we 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.420
 we found with disk 1 and disk 2 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.820
 let's use the ultra iso program 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.320
 to mount these images in a unit 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.270
 virtual if you do not have it 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.159
 installed in hot field dot com 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.990
 you can find it and download 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.700
 well already having this little program 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.590
 let's give right click to ultra made a 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.960
 drive amount 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.729
 and we're going to team and in devices and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.310
 units already we find the 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.069
 virtual decided unit mounted with the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.600
 disk 1 of the commandos saga we enter and 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.750
 we execute the setup to start the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.750
 installation 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.620
 well here I have seen that the abbot during 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.570
 the run the installer detects me 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.850
 as a possible threat of lately 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.850
 the abbot is generating too many 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.490
 false positives to the point that I'm 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.440
 thinking about uninstalling it from my pc and 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.490
 install another antivirus but good in 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.290
 this case what I'm going to do is 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.730
 disable the antivirus and you pass them 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.930
 this will also disable the antivirus 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.540
 this is a totally content 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.200
 reliable and we run the setup again 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.200
 of the installer 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.860
 and here already if the installer does not come out 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.860
 let's see in install 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.220
 Here we give custom installation 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.280
 we give next here in this step we can 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.890
 choose 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.440
 if we suddenly want to not install any 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.209
 of the games I will install all the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.560
 checked and in my case for the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.720
 tutorial will let install download 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.260
 all checked and I will install the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.390
 we all give here the error where 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.850
 is going to install program files x86 e 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.340
 come out commands and we press 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.860
 install and here you start to be the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.230
 game surely during installation 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.680
 is going to ask us the next must of that 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.750
 we will show it later 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.659
 Here we can see that the installation 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.239
 ask for the next dvd please insert 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:31.000
 disk 2 and click on accept what 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.500
 we are going to do in this case is to leave for 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.570
 the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.570
 for where we have the game downloaded 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.520
 and here we have the disc 2 then we go 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.280
 to do the same thing that we did with the 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.760
 disk not right click ultraiso montÃº 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.340
 drive let's team here says disk 2 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.400
 we go back to the installer and press on 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.730
 accept and ready here and the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.560
 installation we must have patience but 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.030
 missing just a minute and some 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.030
 seconds for the installation to finish 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.660
 ready here and the installation of the game has 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.910
 culminated says complete by completing the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.010
 installation for my pickup pickup is 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.720
 has executed is completely installed 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.640
 then we press in finalize 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.709
 and we're going to go to the route where 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.980
 installed the game that files the 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.330
 program and gone and here we take command 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.380
 we find the 5 1 2 3 4 5 and 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.630
 we can start from the command 1 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.820
 execute from here right click and 4 as 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.400
 administrator if suddenly the game does not 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.600
 it starts or starts them wrong we can 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.600
 start properties 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.060
 properties and in compatibility 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.970
 select some other operating system 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.710
 like for example windows 98 so 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.490
 their games are pretty old windows 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.440
 95 here execute the good resolution 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.419
 play with this in such a way that the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.240
 game works optimally well 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.240
 the same with the commands 2 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.280

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.300
 right to count as administrator what 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.090
 same compatibility and good properties 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.440
