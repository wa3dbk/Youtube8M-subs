was<00:00:25.230> thinking<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.619> using<00:00:25.800> 2<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.279> flank<00:00:26.490> the

halogen<00:00:31.650> lights<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> safety<00:00:32.279> concern

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
halogen lights be a safety concern

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.850 
halogen lights be a safety concern
because<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.149> get<00:00:33.270> hot<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.469> know<00:00:34.649> what

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
because they get hot I do not know what

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.470 
because they get hot I do not know what
the<00:00:34.980> equivalent<00:00:35.250> incandescent<00:00:35.910> wattage

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the equivalent incandescent wattage

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
the equivalent incandescent wattage
would<00:00:36.660> be<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.020> whether<00:00:37.230> or<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.469> these<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.890> be

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
would be and whether or not these can be

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.709 
would be and whether or not these can be
retrofitted<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.090> different<00:00:39.480> type<00:00:39.690> of

bulb signed in the dark Rachel this is a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.020 
bulb signed in the dark Rachel this is a
great<00:00:43.440> question<00:00:43.890> because<00:00:44.070> lighting<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.820> any

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
great question because lighting in any

a bathroom is key you want just the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.430 
a bathroom is key you want just the
right<00:00:50.670> amount<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.149> light<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.930> where<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
right amount of light just where you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.260 
right amount of light just where you
need<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.489> question<00:00:53.640> about<00:00:54.090> these

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
need it now your question about these

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
need it now your question about these
fixtures<00:00:54.690> concerns<00:00:55.289> me<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.250> only

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
fixtures concerns me because if it only

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299 
fixtures concerns me because if it only
is<00:00:56.730> rated<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> 20<00:00:58.020> watt<00:00:58.199> bulb<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.829> would

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
is rated for a 20 watt bulb I would

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.310 
is rated for a 20 watt bulb I would
never<00:00:59.609> consider<00:00:59.910> switching<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.960> bulb<00:01:01.170> out

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
never consider switching the bulb out

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.590 
never consider switching the bulb out
for<00:01:01.649> something<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.730> higher<00:01:03.210> wattage

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
for something that is a higher wattage

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200 
for something that is a higher wattage
to<00:01:04.080> deliver<00:01:04.409> more<00:01:04.830> light<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> big

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to deliver more light this is a big

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.969 
to deliver more light this is a big
concern<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.140> could<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.710> fire

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
concern because it could be a fire

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
concern because it could be a fire
hazard<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:09.119> found<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> past<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
hazard I have found in the past that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.710 
hazard I have found in the past that
there<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.380> inexpensive<00:01:10.890> lights<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:12.240> they

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
there are inexpensive lights but they

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870 
there are inexpensive lights but they
only<00:01:12.900> come<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> 20<00:01:13.770> watt<00:01:13.950> bulb<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.850> I

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
only come with a 20 watt bulb what I

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880 
only come with a 20 watt bulb what I
would<00:01:15.180> recommend<00:01:15.630> doing<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.200> considering

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
would recommend doing is considering

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460 
would recommend doing is considering
spending<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:17.850> more<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.689> find<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
spending a little bit more and find a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
spending a little bit more and find a
fixture<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:21.000> hold<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
fixture that you like that can hold a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.929 
fixture that you like that can hold a
higher<00:01:22.110> watt<00:01:22.500> bulb<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.729> powder

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
higher watt bulb if it's in a powder

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.760 
higher watt bulb if it's in a powder
room<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.869> about<00:01:25.020> any<00:01:25.200> room<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> house

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
room or just about any room in the house

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.679 
room or just about any room in the house
I<00:01:25.979> would<00:01:26.400> suggest<00:01:26.640> putting<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> dimmer

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
I would suggest putting it on a dimmer

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.719 
I would suggest putting it on a dimmer
that<00:01:28.259> way<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.590> you're<00:01:28.710> having<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.070> party<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that way if you're having a party and

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120 
that way if you're having a party and
you<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:29.909> dimmer<00:01:30.689> mood<00:01:31.140> lighting<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:32.100> can

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you want dimmer mood lighting you can

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.910 
you want dimmer mood lighting you can
always<00:01:32.400> turn<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.240> light<00:01:33.390> down<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.740> you're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
always turn the light down but if you're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
always turn the light down but if you're
looking<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.430> full<00:01:35.759> illumination<00:01:36.360> let's<00:01:37.020> say

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
looking for full illumination let's say

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.660 
looking for full illumination let's say
if<00:01:37.259> you're<00:01:37.409> using<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.829> apply<00:01:38.340> makeup

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
if you're using it to apply makeup

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460
