Worth Texas and we've got de Franklin
who's<00:00:06.919> the<00:00:07.919> design<00:00:08.340> expert<00:00:08.880> for<00:00:09.269> Nike<00:00:10.080> putters

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
who's the design expert for Nike putters

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.940 
who's the design expert for Nike putters
and<00:00:10.969> we've<00:00:11.969> talked<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.330> little<00:00:12.450> bit<00:00:12.690> about

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
and we've talked a little bit about

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.709 
and we've talked a little bit about
method<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.549> some<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> technology

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
method and and some of the technology

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.050 
method and and some of the technology
there<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.230> now<00:00:16.379> we've<00:00:16.619> got<00:00:16.890> method<00:00:17.550> core

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
there but now we've got method core

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.050 
there but now we've got method core
drone<00:00:18.750> putter<00:00:19.680> I've<00:00:19.949> shot<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.580> putter<00:00:20.789> out

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
drone putter I've shot the putter out

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.730 
drone putter I've shot the putter out
there<00:00:21.300> we've<00:00:21.570> seen<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.439> you're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
there we've seen it but you're going to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.640 
there we've seen it but you're going to
give<00:00:22.890> us<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.160> little<00:00:23.420> more<00:00:24.420> insight<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:25.019> what

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
give us a little more insight on what

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.410 
give us a little more insight on what
went<00:00:25.830> into<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.369> design<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.269> were

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
went into the design and what you were

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.349 
went into the design and what you were
thinking<00:00:28.160> with<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.400> insert<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
thinking with the insert and with the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.020 
thinking with the insert and with the
design<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> butter<00:00:31.439> okay<00:00:31.890> well<00:00:32.399> you've

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
design of the butter okay well you've

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.880 
design of the butter okay well you've
seen<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> original<00:00:33.630> methods<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.680> first

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
seen the original methods the the first

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.080 
seen the original methods the the first
introduction<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> methods<00:00:35.790> were<00:00:35.880> pretty

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
introduction of the methods were pretty

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.850 
introduction of the methods were pretty
traditional<00:00:36.290> things<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> had<00:00:37.620> seen

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
traditional things that you had seen

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.709 
traditional things that you had seen
pretty<00:00:38.489> frequently<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.420> reason<00:00:39.690> for

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
pretty frequently and the reason for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.360 
pretty frequently and the reason for
that<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.440> had<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> new<00:00:40.739> technology<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
that is we had a new technology in the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.650 
that is we had a new technology in the
face<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.760> had<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> new<00:00:42.090> way<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> roll<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> ball

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
face we had a new way to roll the ball

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.479 
face we had a new way to roll the ball
if<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.559> took<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.829> putter<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.250> looked<00:00:44.430> like

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
if we took a putter that looked like

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.880 
if we took a putter that looked like
this<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:45.000> there<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.750> said<00:00:45.989> hey<00:00:46.200> try<00:00:46.649> our<00:00:46.770> new

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
this out there and said hey try our new

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.580 
this out there and said hey try our new
technology<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.550> face<00:00:48.320> how<00:00:49.320> would<00:00:49.469> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
technology in the face how would you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
technology in the face how would you
know<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.489> did<00:00:50.760> made<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> difference

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
know what really did made the difference

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.950 
know what really did made the difference
so<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.250> method<00:00:53.610> putters<00:00:54.059> were<00:00:54.719> pretty

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
so the first method putters were pretty

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.200 
so the first method putters were pretty
traditional<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.789> we've<00:00:56.969> proven

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
traditional so now that we've proven

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420 
traditional so now that we've proven
that<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.480> technology<00:00:57.719> works<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.309> had

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that that technology works and and had

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.119 
that that technology works and and had
tour<00:00:59.640> success<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.239> wins<00:01:00.859> we<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
tour success and wins we can get a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.270 
tour success and wins we can get a
little<00:01:02.309> bit<00:01:02.550> more<00:01:02.760> creative<00:01:03.629> from<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> dynamic

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
little bit more creative from a dynamic

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.100 
little bit more creative from a dynamic
standpoint<00:01:05.729> from<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> physics<00:01:06.390> standpoint<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
standpoint from a physics standpoint and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.660 
standpoint from a physics standpoint and
make<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> putter<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.130> much<00:01:08.280> more<00:01:08.460> stable

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
make a putter that's much more stable

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.480 
make a putter that's much more stable
maybe<00:01:09.630> looks<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> lot<00:01:10.049> different<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.890> it's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
maybe looks a lot different but it's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.660 
maybe looks a lot different but it's
it's<00:01:11.930> performs<00:01:12.930> much<00:01:13.170> better<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:13.890> with

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it's performs much better and so with

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
it's performs much better and so with
you<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> players<00:01:15.600> buy<00:01:15.930> into<00:01:16.400> one

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
you we have the players buy into one

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.660 
you we have the players buy into one
part<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.229> easy<00:01:19.530> maybe<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
part of it and then the the easy maybe a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.270 
part of it and then the the easy maybe a
little<00:01:21.030> easier<00:01:21.390> part<00:01:21.900> would<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.680> head

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
little easier part would be then head

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.820 
little easier part would be then head
shape<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.090> proven<00:01:24.659> technology<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.560> face

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
shape because proven technology and face

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.219 
shape because proven technology and face
it<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.880> how<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.150> ball<00:01:27.390> comes<00:01:27.689> off<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> face

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it on how the ball comes off the face

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.410 
it on how the ball comes off the face
and<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:29.729> we're<00:01:29.909> working<00:01:30.119> on

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and now you can see now we're working on

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.289 
and now you can see now we're working on
mo<00:01:31.229> eye<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.680> making<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.520> putter<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.119> more

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
mo eye and making the putter a lot more

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
mo eye and making the putter a lot more
state<00:01:33.570> exactly<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.619> about<00:01:34.799> MO<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
state exactly it's about MO and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760 
state exactly it's about MO and
stability<00:01:35.909> through<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> stroke<00:01:36.680> there's<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
stability through the stroke there's a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.219 
stability through the stroke there's a
lot<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.040> things<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:39.150> helps<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> lot

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
lot of things that this helps for a lot

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.109 
lot of things that this helps for a lot
of<00:01:40.259> people<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.890> especially<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.880> guy<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
of people and especially a guy that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.330 
of people and especially a guy that
doesn't<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.509> practice<00:01:42.659> very<00:01:42.930> much<00:01:43.320> so

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
doesn't get to practice very much so

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
doesn't get to practice very much so
Susanne<00:01:45.240> Peterson<00:01:45.659> had<00:01:45.840> success<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.200> this

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
Susanne Peterson had success with this

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.380 
Susanne Peterson had success with this
putter<00:01:46.649> she<00:01:47.189> had<00:01:47.310> gone<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> method<00:01:48.240> o

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
putter she had gone out with a method o
4<00:01:48.780> which<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> double<00:01:49.829> Bend<00:01:50.009> blade<00:01:50.250> style

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
4 which is a double Bend blade style

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.870 
4 which is a double Bend blade style
putter<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.259> she<00:01:52.259> wanted<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.590> more<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> mallet

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
putter and she wanted a more of a mallet

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
putter and she wanted a more of a mallet
style<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.270> didn't<00:01:54.479> offer<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.200> we

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
style and we didn't offer that so we

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.230 
style and we didn't offer that so we
went<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> drawing<00:01:56.340> board<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:57.090> came

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
went to the drawing board and we came

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
went to the drawing board and we came
out<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> method<00:01:57.869> core<00:01:58.049> drone<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.590> what

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
out with the method core drone and what

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.310 
out with the method core drone and what
this<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.630> actually<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.020> framework

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
this is is a it's actually a framework

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.590 
this is is a it's actually a framework
if<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.950> dissect<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.430> putter<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.909> break<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
if you dissect this putter and break it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.690 
if you dissect this putter and break it
down<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.750> its<00:02:03.899> components<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:05.369> actually

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
down to its components it's actually

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
down to its components it's actually
just<00:02:05.880> an<00:02:06.030> empty<00:02:06.240> frame<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.439> way<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.740> can

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
just an empty frame and that way we can

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.499 
just an empty frame and that way we can
manipulate<00:02:08.069> where<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.580> place<00:02:08.819> weights<00:02:09.119> and

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
manipulate where we place weights and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.320 
manipulate where we place weights and
how<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.080> distribute<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.069> way<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.970> like<00:02:12.239> I

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
how we distribute that way so like I

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.400 
how we distribute that way so like I
showed<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.629> earlier

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
showed you earlier

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
showed you earlier
extremely<00:02:14.040> lightweight<00:02:14.280> insert<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
extremely lightweight insert in the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.120 
extremely lightweight insert in the
middle<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> face<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.470> that's<00:02:16.830> where<00:02:17.070> you

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
middle of the face so that's where you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.470 
middle of the face so that's where you
don't<00:02:17.250> want<00:02:17.460> weight<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.030> want<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.270> weight<00:02:18.390> on

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
don't want weight you want the weight on

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.820 
don't want weight you want the weight on
the<00:02:18.570> parameters<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.410> know<00:02:19.530> if<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.650> want

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
the parameters and you know if you want

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.950 
the parameters and you know if you want
it<00:02:19.890> away<00:02:20.100> from<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> face<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:21.600> put<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> very

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
it away from the face so we put a very

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.380 
it away from the face so we put a very
lightweight<00:02:22.200> insert<00:02:22.740> in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.950> face<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.430> then

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
lightweight insert in the face and then

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.030 
lightweight insert in the face and then
in<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.350> sole<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.830> want<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> deep<00:02:26.760> low<00:02:27.060> CG<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.350> to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
in the sole you want a deep low CG so to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.250 
in the sole you want a deep low CG so to
get<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.280> lower<00:02:29.490> we<00:02:30.210> put<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> soleplate<00:02:30.900> that's

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
get it lower we put a soleplate that's

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.900 
get it lower we put a soleplate that's
actually<00:02:31.620> heavy<00:02:32.310> Wow

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
actually heavy Wow

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.310 
actually heavy Wow
yeah<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.330> was<00:02:33.480> thinking<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.900> was<00:02:33.960> going<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.200> be

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
yeah I was thinking it was going to be

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.680 
yeah I was thinking it was going to be
light<00:02:34.560> rubber<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:35.730> got<00:02:35.970> some<00:02:36.390> mass

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
light rubber and that's got some mass

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110 
light rubber and that's got some mass
some<00:02:37.290> weight<00:02:37.500> -<00:02:37.800> exactly<00:02:38.190> that's<00:02:38.490> why<00:02:39.090> I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
some weight - exactly that's why I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.310 
some weight - exactly that's why I
waited<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.510> show<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.020> wanted<00:02:40.230> to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
waited to show that to you I wanted to

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.620 
waited to show that to you I wanted to
see<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.470> surprised<00:02:40.860> yeah<00:02:41.300> yeah<00:02:42.300> I'd<00:02:42.450> never

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
see that surprised yeah yeah I'd never

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.780 
see that surprised yeah yeah I'd never
seen<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:42.960> before<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.830> oh<00:02:44.370> by

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
seen that before it that oh by

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.000 
seen that before it that oh by
comparison<00:02:45.300> it's<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:46.050> night<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.590> day<00:02:46.710> as

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
comparison it's it's night and day as

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.190 
comparison it's it's night and day as
far<00:02:47.250> as<00:02:47.310> what<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:47.940> would<00:02:48.210> have<00:02:48.300> thought<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
far as what I would have thought that

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.600 
far as what I would have thought that
would<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.560> weighed<00:02:49.770> you're<00:02:50.190> right<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.430> looks

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
would have weighed you're right it looks

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.770 
would have weighed you're right it looks
like<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> piece<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.090> rubber<00:02:51.240> but<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.510> actually

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
like a piece of rubber but it's actually

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.170 
like a piece of rubber but it's actually
Optimus<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.130> proprietary<00:02:53.370> material

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
Optimus so it's a proprietary material

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.780 
Optimus so it's a proprietary material
that's<00:02:54.360> very<00:02:54.750> heavy<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.230> its<00:02:55.460> shape<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.640> its

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that's very heavy for its shape and its

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.810 
that's very heavy for its shape and its
look<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.950> use<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.460> get<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.670> weight

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
look so we use that to get the weight

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.910 
look so we use that to get the weight
low<00:03:00.120> okay<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.170> then<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.350> use<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> couple<00:03:01.770> more

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
low okay and then we use a couple more

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.720 
low okay and then we use a couple more
Optimus<00:03:02.460> weights<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.720> heel<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.050> toe<00:03:04.730> aft

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
Optimus weights in the heel and toe aft

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.060 
Optimus weights in the heel and toe aft
in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> back<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.840> putter<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:07.800> now<00:03:07.920> what

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
in the back of the putter so now what

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.940 
in the back of the putter so now what
you've<00:03:08.190> got<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:09.540> weight<00:03:09.810> low<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.320> weight<00:03:10.680> out

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
you've got is weight low and weight out

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.530 
you've got is weight low and weight out
and<00:03:11.250> away<00:03:11.400> from<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.670> ball<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:12.300> you've<00:03:12.390> got<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
and away from the ball so you've got a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.250 
and away from the ball so you've got a
very<00:03:12.600> stable<00:03:13.670> configuration<00:03:15.020> getting<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.110> out

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
very stable configuration getting it out

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.570 
very stable configuration getting it out
and<00:03:16.410> away<00:03:16.530> from<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.740> ball<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.010> kind<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.220> like<00:03:17.370> I

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
and away from the ball is kind of like I

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.160 
and away from the ball is kind of like I
always<00:03:18.000> say<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.240> a<00:03:18.300> tightrope<00:03:18.510> walker<00:03:18.720> with

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
always say it's a tightrope walker with

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.350 
always say it's a tightrope walker with
a<00:03:19.200> long<00:03:19.410> pole<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.340> get<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.610> pole<00:03:20.820> long<00:03:21.030> and

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
a long pole you get that pole long and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.610 
a long pole you get that pole long and
you<00:03:21.600> get<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.810> away<00:03:21.900> from<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.230> middle<00:03:22.380> then

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
you get it away from the middle then

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.280 
you get it away from the middle then
he's<00:03:22.740> more<00:03:22.920> stable<00:03:23.340> same<00:03:24.000> thing<00:03:24.180> here<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.660> get

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
he's more stable same thing here you get

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.050 
he's more stable same thing here you get
it<00:03:25.410> out<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.040> way<00:03:26.160> from<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.400> ball<00:03:26.580> it's

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
it out in the way from the ball it's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.330 
it out in the way from the ball it's
much<00:03:27.270> more<00:03:27.420> stable<00:03:27.630> from<00:03:28.500> left<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.800> right<00:03:29.010> and

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
much more stable from left to right and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.940 
much more stable from left to right and
it<00:03:29.520> would<00:03:29.670> allow<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.540> with<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.440> long

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
it would allow you then with the long

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.490 
it would allow you then with the long
putter<00:03:32.220> or<00:03:32.550> belly<00:03:32.820> crazed<00:03:33.209> putter<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:34.050> do<00:03:34.230> some

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
putter or belly crazed putter to do some

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.350 
putter or belly crazed putter to do some
different<00:03:34.950> things<00:03:35.280> with<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.120> still

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
different things with this and still

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.210 
different things with this and still
have<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.540> stability<00:03:36.930> well<00:03:37.680> what<00:03:37.980> we<00:03:38.070> do

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
have that stability well what we do

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.470 
have that stability well what we do
that's<00:03:38.490> an<00:03:38.610> interesting<00:03:38.970> question<00:03:39.240> what<00:03:39.360> we

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
that's an interesting question what we

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.390 
that's an interesting question what we
do<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:40.170> comes<00:03:40.410> in<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.590> belly<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:40.980> also<00:03:41.100> comes

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
do this comes in a belly it also comes

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.590 
do this comes in a belly it also comes
in<00:03:41.490> a<00:03:41.550> little<00:03:41.730> bit<00:03:41.850> heavier<00:03:42.120> putter<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.480> be<00:03:42.570> a

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
in a little bit heavier putter to be a

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.560 
in a little bit heavier putter to be a
short<00:03:42.930> like<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.440> 33<00:03:43.860> or<00:03:44.040> 32<00:03:44.430> inch<00:03:44.580> putter<00:03:44.820> so

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
short like a 33 or 32 inch putter so

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.350 
short like a 33 or 32 inch putter so
this<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.500> be<00:03:46.530> actually<00:03:47.040> adjusted<00:03:47.820> in<00:03:47.940> density

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
this can be actually adjusted in density

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.080 
this can be actually adjusted in density
so<00:03:49.050> if<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.770> get<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.950> belly<00:03:50.520> putter<00:03:50.700> or<00:03:51.000> a

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
so if you get a belly putter or a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.390 
so if you get a belly putter or a
heavier<00:03:51.959> short<00:03:52.260> putter<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:53.070> looks<00:03:53.250> exactly

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
heavier short putter it looks exactly

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.100 
heavier short putter it looks exactly
the<00:03:53.730> same<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:54.420> just<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:54.720> this<00:03:54.840> piece<00:03:55.080> is

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
the same it's just that this piece is

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.560 
the same it's just that this piece is
heavier<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:55.770> we<00:03:56.640> adjust<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:56.970> way<00:03:57.150> we<00:03:57.300> can<00:03:57.420> get

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
heavier so we adjust the way we can get

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.900 
heavier so we adjust the way we can get
50<00:03:57.900> grams<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.260> difference<00:03:58.650> between<00:03:59.610> weights

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
50 grams of difference between weights

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.860 
50 grams of difference between weights
this<00:04:01.160> all<00:04:02.160> right<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:02.580> now<00:04:02.760> we've<00:04:03.150> gone<00:04:03.360> method

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
this all right so now we've gone method

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.750 
this all right so now we've gone method
and<00:04:04.050> Method<00:04:04.350> Core<00:04:04.590> drone<00:04:04.920> with<00:04:05.280> new

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and Method Core drone with new

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.600 
and Method Core drone with new
technology<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.930> we're<00:04:07.709> gonna<00:04:07.800> get<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.459> the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
technology and we're gonna get in in the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.600 
technology and we're gonna get in in the
next<00:04:08.880> video<00:04:09.150> into<00:04:09.810> some<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.590> your<00:04:10.920> concept

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
next video into some of your concept

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.810 
next video into some of your concept
exactly<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.840> one<00:04:13.020> came<00:04:13.200> out<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.560> fall<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.310> 11

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
exactly this one came out in fall of 11

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.849 
exactly this one came out in fall of 11
we<00:04:15.780> have<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> concept<00:04:16.290> putter<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.590> will<00:04:16.770> be

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
we have a concept putter that will be

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.159 
we have a concept putter that will be
out<00:04:16.980> in<00:04:17.100> mid<00:04:17.400> February<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:17.940> 2012<00:04:18.600> so<00:04:18.959> we<00:04:18.989> can

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
out in mid February of 2012 so we can

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.240 
out in mid February of 2012 so we can
talk<00:04:19.320> about<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.650> one<00:04:19.799> eggs
