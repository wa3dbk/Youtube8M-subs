00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
to good Mike gave me these pieces of

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.640 
to good Mike gave me these pieces of
tubing<00:02:50.239> over<00:02:50.510> here<00:02:50.780> i'm<00:02:50.989> going<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.230> use<00:02:51.380> them

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
tubing over here i'm going to use them

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.710
