00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.539 

okay<00:02:27.189> not<00:02:28.189> there

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.399 
okay not there
and<00:02:30.280> yeah<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:32.150> terror<00:02:32.510> which<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.109> meant<00:02:33.319> to

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
and yeah that terror which is meant to

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.140 
and yeah that terror which is meant to
be<00:02:33.469> the<00:02:33.560> elevator<00:02:34.069> up<00:02:34.219> and<00:02:34.430> then<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.939> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
be the elevator up and then to the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.259 
be the elevator up and then to the
actual<00:02:35.900> spacecraft<00:02:36.170> doesn't<00:02:37.099> say<00:02:37.189> this<00:02:37.459> which

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
actual spacecraft doesn't say this which

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.629 
actual spacecraft doesn't say this which
looked<00:02:38.870> good<00:02:39.349> but<00:02:39.890> don't<00:02:40.099> really<00:02:40.400> work

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
looked good but don't really work

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.640 
looked good but don't really work
because<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.659> had<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.049> through<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.349> fuel

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
because you had to go through the fuel

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.440 
because you had to go through the fuel
tank<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.040> get<00:02:43.250> into<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.549> shuttle<00:02:43.730> which

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
tank to get into the shuttle which

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.209 
tank to get into the shuttle which
obviously<00:02:45.349> you<00:02:45.530> don't<00:02:45.680> really<00:02:45.829> want<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.159> be

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219 
obviously you don't really want to be

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.640 
obviously you don't really want to be
doing<00:02:46.459> because<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.659> fuel<00:02:47.930> tank<00:02:48.139> would<00:02:48.349> blow

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
doing because the fuel tank would blow

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.369 
doing because the fuel tank would blow
up<00:02:48.829> or<00:02:49.040> something<00:02:49.430> probably<00:02:49.969> I<00:02:50.450> also

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
up or something probably I also

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.750 
up or something probably I also
originally<00:02:51.739> tried<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.010> put<00:02:52.129> a<00:02:52.159> skull<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.519> flag

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
originally tried to put a skull and flag

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.610 
originally tried to put a skull and flag
on<00:02:52.909> there<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:53.299> didn't<00:02:53.959> really<00:02:54.230> work<00:02:54.409> either

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
on there but didn't really work either

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.539 
on there but didn't really work either
so<00:02:55.299> yeah<00:02:58.419> so<00:02:59.419> these<00:03:00.019> are<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.319> two<00:03:00.500> big<00:03:00.799> well
