00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
fairly straightforward you'll you are

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.430 
fairly straightforward you'll you are
going<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.089> need<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> torx<00:00:15.599> for<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:15.960> one<00:00:16.109> too

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
going to need a torx for this one too

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.290 
going to need a torx for this one too
but<00:00:17.369> I'll<00:00:17.460> cut<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> little<00:00:18.000> bit<00:00:18.090> so

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
but I'll cut that a little bit so

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.679 
but I'll cut that a little bit so
firstly<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.410> HDD<00:00:20.689> pretty

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
firstly you have HDD pretty

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.929 
firstly you have HDD pretty
straightforward<00:00:22.289> my<00:00:23.070> mind<00:00:23.550> might<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
straightforward my mind might be a

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.160 
straightforward my mind might be a
little<00:00:24.180> bit<00:00:24.300> older<00:00:24.420> version<00:00:24.779> because<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
little bit older version because as the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.080 
little bit older version because as the
HDD<00:00:25.560> at<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.099> roots<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.460> there<00:00:26.640> most<00:00:26.970> of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
HDD at your roots and on there most of

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.490 
HDD at your roots and on there most of
it<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.300> has<00:00:28.250> just<00:00:29.250> chromed<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:30.029> anymore

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
it just has just chromed up anymore

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.030 
it just has just chromed up anymore
basically<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.679> do<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:31.949> you're

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
basically what you can do is you're

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.880 
basically what you can do is you're
gonna<00:00:32.099> flip<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.700> side<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.800> you're<00:00:34.800> gonna

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
gonna flip to this side and you're gonna

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.100 
gonna flip to this side and you're gonna
have<00:00:36.950> these<00:00:37.950> little<00:00:38.190> itty<00:00:38.399> bitty<00:00:38.930> all<00:00:39.930> that

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
have these little itty bitty all that

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.940 
have these little itty bitty all that
one<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:43.670> these<00:00:45.260> little<00:00:46.260> chrome

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
one down for you these little chrome

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.690 
one down for you these little chrome
bolts<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.129> too<00:00:50.250> hard<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> remove

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
bolts and gonna be too hard to remove

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.479 
bolts and gonna be too hard to remove
those<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.629> Torx<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> found<00:00:53.250> about

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
those are Torx but what I found about

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.310 
those are Torx but what I found about
most<00:00:53.789> useful<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.660> using<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:57.449> smallest<00:00:57.960> one

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
most useful was using the smallest one

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.579 
most useful was using the smallest one
of<00:01:00.020> just<00:01:01.020> an<00:01:01.109> allen<00:01:01.379> wrench

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.000 

it's<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.920> mean<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.820> fairly<00:01:06.540> easy<00:01:07.010> believe

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it's I mean it's fairly easy believe

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.359 
it's I mean it's fairly easy believe
it's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.369> 1<00:01:08.700> 6<00:01:08.970> no<00:01:10.220> yeah<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> 1/16<00:01:13.189> yeah<00:01:14.189> it's

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
it's a 1 6 no yeah it's a 1/16 yeah it's

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.090 
it's a 1 6 no yeah it's a 1/16 yeah it's
a<00:01:14.460> 1/16<00:01:15.060> fairly<00:01:15.720> small<00:01:15.900> not<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> Torx<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.920> not

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
a 1/16 fairly small not a Torx it's not

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.760 
a 1/16 fairly small not a Torx it's not
a<00:01:17.130> Torx<00:01:18.500> she<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:21.530> pretty<00:01:22.530> easy

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
a Torx she just pretty easy

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.710 
a Torx she just pretty easy
straightforward

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
straightforward

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.039 
straightforward
I<00:01:24.750> got<00:01:25.200> most<00:01:25.290> amount<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.580> slip<00:01:27.049> what

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
I got most amount you if they slip what

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
I got most amount you if they slip what
I<00:01:28.080> recommend<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:31.759> screw

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I recommend is if you have the screw

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.499 
I recommend is if you have the screw
like<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.390> like

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
like this you have this in there like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.999 
like this you have this in there like
that<00:01:37.430> Bend<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:39.420> twist<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.170> down<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.799> little

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
that Bend then twist this down a little

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.819 
that Bend then twist this down a little
bit<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.960> it'll<00:01:42.960> catch<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.439> corner

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
bit like that and it'll catch the corner

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.910 
bit like that and it'll catch the corner
and<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.790> won't<00:01:45.210> slip<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.470> basically<00:01:46.740> after

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and you won't slip so basically after

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
and you won't slip so basically after
you<00:01:47.070> move<00:01:47.310> those<00:01:47.490> you'll<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.939> four<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.270> those

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you move those you'll have four of those

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.920 
you move those you'll have four of those
and<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> them<00:01:49.490> will<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.700> under<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and one of them will be under the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.740 
and one of them will be under the
Microsoft<00:01:52.380> warranty<00:01:53.369> thing<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> yes

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
Microsoft warranty thing and yes

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.450 
Microsoft warranty thing and yes
I<00:01:54.780> doubt<00:01:55.170> you'll<00:01:55.500> break<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.100> don't<00:01:56.250> worry

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
I doubt you'll break it so don't worry

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.120 
I doubt you'll break it so don't worry
about<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:57.469> carefully<00:01:58.469> take<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.740> off<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.070> took

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
about it carefully take that off I took

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.429 
about it carefully take that off I took
mine<00:01:59.399> off<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.850> all<00:01:59.969> blotchy<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.869> won't

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
mine off and it's all blotchy so I won't

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.020 
mine off and it's all blotchy so I won't
be<00:02:01.560> sending<00:02:01.890> back<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.460> doubt<00:02:02.549> ever

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
be sending back in but I doubt ever

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090 
be sending back in but I doubt ever
break<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.509> anyway<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.810> once<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.560> open<00:02:04.770> it
