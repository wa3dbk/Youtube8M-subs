works for you and you need to figure
that<00:01:26.939> out<00:01:27.000> quickly<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.930> some<00:01:28.530> people<00:01:28.680> are

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
that out quickly so some people are

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.590 
that out quickly so some people are
readers<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> need<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> read<00:01:30.360> something

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.499 
readers and you need to read something
over<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.110> over<00:01:31.290> again<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.759> very<00:01:33.180> hectic

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
over and over again but I'm very hectic

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.840 
over and over again but I'm very hectic
'el<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.530> people<00:01:34.860> who<00:01:34.950> say<00:01:35.159> they're<00:01:35.369> readers

'el of people who say they're readers

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.280 
'el of people who say they're readers
because<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:36.900> you're<00:01:37.020> reading

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
because I think that when you're reading

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.730 
because I think that when you're reading
it's<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:38.400> easy<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.740> actively

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
it's very easy to not be actively

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.770 
it's very easy to not be actively
studying<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.729> when<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> say<00:01:42.090> actively

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
studying and when I say actively

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.139 
studying and when I say actively
studying<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.350> mean<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.579> working<00:01:44.820> your

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
studying I mean like really working your

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.550 
studying I mean like really working your
brain<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.509> really<00:01:45.810> committing<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.409> you're

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
brain and really committing what you're

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
brain and really committing what you're
reading<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> memory<00:01:47.369> because<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.329> you're

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
reading to memory because when you're

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.170 
reading to memory because when you're
reading<00:01:48.860> you're<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.100> kind<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.430> relaxed<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
reading you're just kind of relaxed and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.260 
reading you're just kind of relaxed and
you<00:01:51.270> could<00:01:51.479> zone<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.960> or<00:01:51.990> or<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.060> you're

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you could zone out or or you know you're

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.460 
you could zone out or or you know you're
not<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.600> paying<00:01:54.869> quite<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.290> much

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
not really paying quite as much

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.780 
not really paying quite as much
attention<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:56.009> all<00:01:56.130> you're<00:01:56.280> doing<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.610> reading

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
attention if all you're doing is reading

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.380 
attention if all you're doing is reading

have to write something down if I want
to<00:02:02.579> remember<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.420> don't<00:02:03.479> write<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.780> down

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
to remember it if I don't write it down

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.609 
to remember it if I don't write it down
I<00:02:04.140> am<00:02:05.040> NOT<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.520> remember<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.619> that's

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
I am NOT going to remember it so that's

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.770 
I am NOT going to remember it so that's
what<00:02:07.829> worked<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.129> me<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:09.179> knew<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.509> right

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
what worked for me and I knew that right

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.380 
what worked for me and I knew that right
away<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.319> if<00:02:10.920> there's<00:02:11.489> ever<00:02:11.670> been<00:02:11.760> an<00:02:12.030> exam

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
away and if there's ever been an exam

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.090 
away and if there's ever been an exam
where<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> just

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
where I just

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.830 
where I just
I<00:02:13.130> could<00:02:13.460> just<00:02:13.610> get<00:02:13.790> by<00:02:13.880> by<00:02:14.060> reading<00:02:14.480> because<00:02:14.810> I

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
I could just get by by reading because I

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.360 
I could just get by by reading because I
was<00:02:15.080> lazy<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.680> didn't<00:02:15.980> want<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.220> write

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
was lazy and I didn't want to write

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.910 
was lazy and I didn't want to write
everything<00:02:16.670> down<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.870> don't<00:02:18.230> do<00:02:18.380> as<00:02:18.500> well<00:02:18.530> so

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
everything down I don't do as well so

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.120 
everything down I don't do as well so
how<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.940> write<00:02:20.330> stuff<00:02:20.510> down<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:21.080> I'll<00:02:21.440> read

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
how I write stuff down is I'll read

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.090 
how I write stuff down is I'll read
through<00:02:22.490> my<00:02:22.790> class<00:02:23.390> notes<00:02:23.750> or<00:02:24.050> read<00:02:24.800> through<00:02:25.070> a

chapter in a book a couple times I'll
read<00:02:27.650> through<00:02:27.800> it<00:02:27.890> once<00:02:28.070> or<00:02:28.220> twice<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:28.880> I

read through it once or twice and then I
make<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.960> try<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.530> fit<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.310> one<00:02:31.670> piece<00:02:31.880> of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
make a try to fit it on one piece of

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.390 
make a try to fit it on one piece of
paper<00:02:32.110> try<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.170> fit<00:02:33.440> either<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.740> chapter<00:02:34.070> in<00:02:34.280> the

paper try to fit either a chapter in the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880 
paper try to fit either a chapter in the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
book or a lecture from the class one

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.100 
book or a lecture from the class one
lecture<00:02:37.160> onto<00:02:38.030> one<00:02:38.210> piece<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.570> paper<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.020> I

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
lecture onto one piece of paper and I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.590 
lecture onto one piece of paper and I
have<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.320> bunch<00:02:39.590> here<00:02:39.950> because<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.820> make

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
have a bunch here because I make

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.450 
have a bunch here because I make
millions<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.290> these<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.650> make<00:02:42.830> them<00:02:42.980> for<00:02:43.160> every

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
millions of these I make them for every

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.610 
millions of these I make them for every
lecture<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.030> we've<00:02:44.150> had<00:02:44.270> 20<00:02:44.690> lectures<00:02:44.870> I'll

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
lecture so if we've had 20 lectures I'll

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.520 
lecture so if we've had 20 lectures I'll
have<00:02:45.980> 20<00:02:46.370> pieces<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.760> paper<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.540> here<00:02:48.170> here's

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
have 20 pieces of paper and here here's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.180 
have 20 pieces of paper and here here's
one<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.150> my<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.740> think<00:02:51.740> you<00:02:51.830> can<00:02:52.100> you

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
one so this is my I think you can you

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.640 
one so this is my I think you can you
see<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.610> cardio<00:02:53.060> path<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.620> a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
see this is cardio path so this is a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.550 
see this is cardio path so this is a
cardio<00:02:55.360> study<00:02:56.360> sheet<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.870> there's<00:02:57.110> actually

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
cardio study sheet and there's actually

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.500 
cardio study sheet and there's actually
quite<00:02:57.710> a<00:02:57.830> few<00:02:58.130> in<00:02:58.370> here<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.880> they<00:02:59.300> all<00:02:59.480> look

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
quite a few in here and they all look

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.080 
quite a few in here and they all look
like<00:02:59.810> this<00:03:00.170> with<00:03:00.410> lots<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.830> writing<00:03:01.280> if<00:03:01.880> you

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
like this with lots of writing if you

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.410 
like this with lots of writing if you
can<00:03:02.270> see<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:03.400> what<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.430> do<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:04.880> go<00:03:05.060> through<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
can see so what I do is I go through the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.980 
can see so what I do is I go through the
packet<00:03:05.990> of<00:03:06.110> notes<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:07.280> write<00:03:07.520> down<00:03:07.930> kind<00:03:08.930> of

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
packet of notes and I write down kind of

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.960 
packet of notes and I write down kind of
in<00:03:09.110> an<00:03:09.260> organized<00:03:09.950> outline<00:03:10.430> fashion<00:03:10.850> the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
in an organized outline fashion the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.520 
in an organized outline fashion the
important<00:03:11.360> things<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.690> then<00:03:12.110> anything<00:03:12.380> that

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
important things and then anything that

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.320 
important things and then anything that
I<00:03:12.770> don't<00:03:12.830> know<00:03:13.280> anything<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:13.970> don't<00:03:14.060> think

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
I don't know anything that I don't think

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.030 
I don't know anything that I don't think
I<00:03:14.510> will<00:03:14.690> remember<00:03:15.020> so<00:03:15.590> don't<00:03:15.800> write<00:03:15.920> down

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
I will remember so don't write down

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.740 
I will remember so don't write down
everything<00:03:16.430> because<00:03:16.880> there's<00:03:17.210> no<00:03:17.360> point<00:03:17.660> of

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
everything because there's no point of

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.630 
everything because there's no point of
that<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.590> there's<00:03:18.770> lots<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.040> things<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.340> do

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
that and there's lots of things you do

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.680 
that and there's lots of things you do
know<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.060> that's<00:03:20.210> where<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.480> get<00:03:20.570> into

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
know and that's where you get into

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.060 
know and that's where you get into
trouble<00:03:20.840> because<00:03:21.440> you're<00:03:21.560> reading<00:03:21.950> and

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
trouble because you're reading and

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.350 
trouble because you're reading and
you're<00:03:22.160> like<00:03:22.280> oh<00:03:22.460> I<00:03:22.490> know<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.150> know<00:03:23.180> this

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
you're like oh I know this I know this

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.630 
you're like oh I know this I know this
but<00:03:24.080> there<00:03:24.230> might<00:03:24.350> be<00:03:24.410> one<00:03:24.710> tiny<00:03:25.010> random<00:03:25.430> fact

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
but there might be one tiny random fact

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.340 
but there might be one tiny random fact
where<00:03:25.820> you're<00:03:25.940> like<00:03:26.090> maybe<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.690> didn't<00:03:27.230> know

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
where you're like maybe I didn't know

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.990 
where you're like maybe I didn't know
that<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.890> that's<00:03:28.250> where<00:03:28.430> you'll<00:03:28.580> write<00:03:28.850> it

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
that and that's where you'll write it

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.580 
that and that's where you'll write it
down<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.390> then<00:03:29.450> you'll<00:03:29.810> go<00:03:29.960> back<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.200> and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
down and then you'll go back and and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.170 
down and then you'll go back and and
catch<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.310> whereas<00:03:31.910> if<00:03:32.000> you're<00:03:32.150> just

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
catch that whereas if you're just

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.430 
catch that whereas if you're just
reading<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.810> might<00:03:32.960> have<00:03:33.080> skipped<00:03:33.260> right

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
reading it you might have skipped right

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.220 
reading it you might have skipped right
over<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:34.460> I<00:03:34.490> end<00:03:34.730> up<00:03:34.850> with<00:03:35.000> about<00:03:35.240> one<00:03:35.630> piece

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
over it so I end up with about one piece

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.290 
over it so I end up with about one piece
of<00:03:36.380> paper<00:03:36.500> per<00:03:36.920> lecture<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.520> then<00:03:38.000> what<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.180> do

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
of paper per lecture and then what I do

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.840 
of paper per lecture and then what I do
with<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.780> one<00:03:38.960> piece<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.170> paper<00:03:39.320> is<00:03:39.740> I<00:03:40.580> start

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
with that one piece of paper is I start

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.430 
with that one piece of paper is I start
to<00:03:40.970> write<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.360> up<00:03:41.480> on<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.750> whiteboard<00:03:41.960> I'll

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
to write it up on the whiteboard I'll

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.230 
to write it up on the whiteboard I'll
just<00:03:42.830> take<00:03:43.040> that<00:03:43.070> piece<00:03:43.340> of<00:03:43.370> paper<00:03:43.490> and<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:44.000> just

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
just take that piece of paper and I just

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.050 
just take that piece of paper and I just
copy<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.660> onto<00:03:44.990> a<00:03:45.470> whiteboard<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.730> reason

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
copy it onto a whiteboard and the reason

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.220 
copy it onto a whiteboard and the reason
that<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.240> use<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.540> whiteboard<00:03:48.170> is<00:03:48.440> because<00:03:49.040> I

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
that I use a whiteboard is because I

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.860 
that I use a whiteboard is because I
can't<00:03:51.230> be<00:03:51.590> active<00:03:52.370> in<00:03:52.670> my<00:03:53.000> studying<00:03:53.420> unless

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
can't be active in my studying unless

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.440 
can't be active in my studying unless
I'm<00:03:54.080> up<00:03:54.320> and<00:03:54.770> engaged<00:03:55.310> if<00:03:55.700> I'm<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:56.270> sitting

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
I'm up and engaged if I'm just sitting

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.720 
I'm up and engaged if I'm just sitting
at<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:56.780> desk<00:03:57.020> I<00:03:57.290> kind<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.740> tend<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.070> lose<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:58.520> and

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
at a desk I kind of tend to lose it and

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.600 
at a desk I kind of tend to lose it and
I<00:03:59.060> kind<00:03:59.330> of<00:03:59.390> tend<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.720> just<00:03:59.900> copy<00:04:00.430> visually<00:04:01.430> and

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
I kind of tend to just copy visually and

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.070 
I kind of tend to just copy visually and
it's<00:04:01.790> not<00:04:01.940> even<00:04:02.090> processing<00:04:02.780> through<00:04:02.900> my<00:04:03.050> eye

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
it's not even processing through my eye

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.870 
it's not even processing through my eye
or<00:04:03.590> through<00:04:03.830> my<00:04:03.920> brain<00:04:04.190> it's<00:04:04.460> just<00:04:04.700> I'm

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
or through my brain it's just I'm

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.460 
or through my brain it's just I'm
looking<00:04:05.480> at<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.840> writing<00:04:06.140> down<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
looking at it and writing down the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.750 
looking at it and writing down the
letters<00:04:06.770> but<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:07.100> doesn't<00:04:07.370> really<00:04:07.460> mean

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
letters but it doesn't really mean

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.350 
letters but it doesn't really mean
anything

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
anything

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
anything
so<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:09.140> use<00:04:09.350> a<00:04:09.380> whiteboard<00:04:09.650> let<00:04:10.100> me<00:04:10.190> show<00:04:10.340> you

whiteboard yeah this is my favorite
study<00:04:24.480> tool<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:25.680> used<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.100> be<00:04:26.190> up<00:04:26.370> on<00:04:26.490> my<00:04:26.640> wall

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
study tool it used to be up on my wall

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.720 
study tool it used to be up on my wall
and<00:04:27.330> literally<00:04:28.110> that's<00:04:28.830> all<00:04:29.070> I<00:04:29.100> would<00:04:29.370> use<00:04:29.550> to

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
and literally that's all I would use to

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.930 
and literally that's all I would use to
study<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.330> whiteboard<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.990> have<00:04:31.940> trying

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
study is this whiteboard I have trying

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.290 
study is this whiteboard I have trying
to<00:04:33.090> look<00:04:33.210> for<00:04:33.450> dry<00:04:33.660> erase<00:04:33.870> markers<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.940> have<00:04:35.940> dry

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
to look for dry erase markers I have dry

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.510 
to look for dry erase markers I have dry
erase<00:04:36.510> markers<00:04:36.930> in<00:04:37.110> my<00:04:37.260> purse<00:04:37.680> dry<00:04:38.250> erase

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
erase markers in my purse dry erase

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.000 
erase markers in my purse dry erase
markers<00:04:38.910> in<00:04:39.060> my<00:04:39.210> backpack<00:04:39.450> dry<00:04:40.380> erase<00:04:40.620> markers

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
markers in my backpack dry erase markers

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.090 
markers in my backpack dry erase markers
in<00:04:41.310> pockets<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.300> coats<00:04:42.690> it's<00:04:43.500> kind<00:04:43.800> of<00:04:43.890> crazy

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
in pockets of coats it's kind of crazy

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.860 
in pockets of coats it's kind of crazy
because<00:04:44.790> that's<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.300> best<00:04:45.450> way<00:04:45.570> for<00:04:45.600> me

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
because that's the best way for me

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.240 
because that's the best way for me
because<00:04:46.110> if<00:04:46.230> you're<00:04:46.530> up<00:04:46.710> at<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.950> board

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
because if you're up at the board

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.190 
because if you're up at the board
writing<00:04:48.090> stuff<00:04:48.270> on<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.480> whiteboard<00:04:48.870> you<00:04:48.930> have

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
writing stuff on the whiteboard you have

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.140 
writing stuff on the whiteboard you have
to<00:04:49.380> pay<00:04:49.500> attention<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.040> then<00:04:50.430> if<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:50.640> back<00:04:50.910> up

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
to pay attention and then if you back up

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.600 
to pay attention and then if you back up
and<00:04:51.360> look<00:04:51.660> at<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.530> kind<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:53.010> all<00:04:53.160> syncs<00:04:53.460> in

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
and look at it it kind of all syncs in

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.120 
and look at it it kind of all syncs in
better<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.930> will<00:04:54.990> write<00:04:55.380> these<00:04:55.590> lectures

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
better and I will write these lectures

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.490 
better and I will write these lectures
this<00:04:56.370> one<00:04:56.640> page<00:04:56.910> up<00:04:57.210> on<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.480> board<00:04:57.720> over<00:04:57.930> and

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
this one page up on the board over and

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.110 
this one page up on the board over and
over<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.860> over<00:04:58.890> and<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.310> ends<00:04:59.550> up<00:04:59.610> being<00:04:59.670> like

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
over and over and it ends up being like

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.110 
over and over and it ends up being like
if<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.500> don't<00:05:01.710> if<00:05:01.860> it's<00:05:02.010> not<00:05:02.220> written<00:05:02.430> down<00:05:02.640> here

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
if I don't if it's not written down here

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.810 
if I don't if it's not written down here
I<00:05:03.330> don't<00:05:03.900> know<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.410> because<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.680> won't<00:05:04.980> refer<00:05:05.460> to

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
I don't know it because I won't refer to

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.880 
I don't know it because I won't refer to
the<00:05:06.090> lecture<00:05:06.450> again<00:05:06.630> or<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.080> won't<00:05:07.320> refer<00:05:07.680> to

before<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.340> test<00:05:14.550> when<00:05:14.940> I'm<00:05:15.060> feeling<00:05:15.540> like<00:05:15.750> I

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
before the test when I'm feeling like I

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.360 
before the test when I'm feeling like I
need<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.260> really<00:05:16.470> make<00:05:16.680> sure<00:05:16.740> I've<00:05:16.950> got<00:05:17.100> it<00:05:17.250> all

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
I might go back through the lecture with

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.190 
I might go back through the lecture with
my<00:05:20.040> piece<00:05:20.340> of<00:05:20.490> paper<00:05:20.670> next<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:21.180> me<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.540> follow

my piece of paper next to me and follow

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.660 
my piece of paper next to me and follow
along<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.770> make<00:05:22.950> sure<00:05:23.100> I<00:05:23.130> didn't<00:05:23.520> miss

anything

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
anything

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.970 
anything
and<00:05:24.390> that's<00:05:24.930> where<00:05:25.110> all<00:05:25.140> either<00:05:25.440> highlight

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
and that's where all either highlight

and that's where all either highlight
things<00:05:26.280> that<00:05:26.460> I<00:05:26.490> think<00:05:26.790> I<00:05:26.880> still<00:05:27.240> don't<00:05:27.510> really

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
things that I think I still don't really

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.100 
things that I think I still don't really
know<00:05:28.340> or<00:05:29.340> I'll<00:05:29.730> write<00:05:29.940> down<00:05:30.180> really<00:05:30.690> random

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
know or I'll write down really random

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.220 
know or I'll write down really random
tiny<00:05:32.100> tiny<00:05:32.910> pieces<00:05:33.330> of<00:05:33.360> information<00:05:33.990> like<00:05:34.170> the

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
tiny tiny pieces of information like the

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.380 
tiny tiny pieces of information like the
name<00:05:35.040> of<00:05:35.280> an<00:05:35.400> enzyme<00:05:35.610> that's<00:05:36.150> like<00:05:36.500> 2q<00:05:37.500> 1<00:05:37.830> p6

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
name of an enzyme that's like 2q 1 p6

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
name of an enzyme that's like 2q 1 p6
something<00:05:39.390> you<00:05:39.480> think<00:05:39.750> they<00:05:39.870> won't<00:05:40.050> ask<00:05:40.200> you

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
something you think they won't ask you

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.050 
something you think they won't ask you
but<00:05:40.530> they<00:05:40.650> always<00:05:41.010> ask<00:05:41.220> you<00:05:41.370> that<00:05:41.520> random

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
but they always ask you that random

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.660 
but they always ask you that random
stuff<00:05:42.390> that<00:05:42.420> doesn't<00:05:42.900> matter<00:05:43.020> like<00:05:43.380> what

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
stuff that doesn't matter like what

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.090 
stuff that doesn't matter like what
chromosome<00:05:44.670> is<00:05:44.850> this<00:05:45.030> on<00:05:45.290> who<00:05:46.290> cares<00:05:46.560> but

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
chromosome is this on who cares but

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.530 
chromosome is this on who cares but
they're<00:05:47.370> going<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.550> ask<00:05:47.730> you<00:05:47.910> that<00:05:48.030> stuff<00:05:48.330> and

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
they're going to ask you that stuff and

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.720 
they're going to ask you that stuff and
so<00:05:48.600> if<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.470> can<00:05:49.590> get<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.740> basic<00:05:49.890> outline<00:05:50.280> and

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
so if you can get a basic outline and

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.640 
so if you can get a basic outline and
commit<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.360> basics<00:05:51.690> to<00:05:51.840> memory<00:05:52.140> and<00:05:52.290> then<00:05:52.470> go

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
commit the basics to memory and then go

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.900 
commit the basics to memory and then go
back<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:52.890> get<00:05:53.190> all<00:05:53.220> those<00:05:53.460> little<00:05:53.640> nitpicky

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
back and get all those little nitpicky

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.960 
back and get all those little nitpicky
things<00:05:54.210> by<00:05:55.170> by<00:05:56.010> organizing<00:05:56.700> it<00:05:56.820> into

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
things by by organizing it into

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.600 
things by by organizing it into
something<00:05:57.300> that's<00:05:57.510> digestible<00:05:58.350> one<00:05:59.250> piece<00:05:59.460> of

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
something that's digestible one piece of

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.220 
something that's digestible one piece of
paper<00:05:59.760> is<00:05:59.970> much<00:06:00.210> more<00:06:00.270> digestible<00:06:00.630> than<00:06:01.080> a

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
paper is much more digestible than a

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.100 
paper is much more digestible than a
huge<00:06:01.500> lecture<00:06:01.730> that<00:06:02.730> really<00:06:03.270> works<00:06:03.450> for<00:06:03.600> me<00:06:03.900> it

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
huge lecture that really works for me it

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.710 
huge lecture that really works for me it
does<00:06:04.440> and<00:06:04.830> then<00:06:05.060> if<00:06:06.060> you<00:06:06.210> label<00:06:06.420> them<00:06:06.660> by

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
does and then if you label them by

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.450 
does and then if you label them by
lecture<00:06:07.200> you<00:06:07.350> can<00:06:07.500> always<00:06:07.650> go<00:06:07.890> back<00:06:07.920> to<00:06:08.340> the

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
lecture you can always go back to the

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.910 
lecture you can always go back to the
