clicking on my computer going to manage
and<00:01:17.400> under<00:01:18.090> there<00:01:18.330> you'll<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.750> event<00:01:19.080> viewer

and<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.280> through<00:01:20.580> if<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.240> you

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
and if you go through if you on if you

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
and if you go through if you on if you
make<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.979> expand<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.060> event<00:01:24.330> viewer

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
make if you expand the event viewer

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.300 
make if you expand the event viewer
you'll<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> system

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you'll see you can go to system

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.789 
you'll see you can go to system
applications<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.409> security<00:01:28.409> i<00:01:28.439> believe<00:01:28.710> is

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
applications and security i believe is

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.100 
applications and security i believe is
one<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.509> basically<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:30.990> go

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
one of this and basically you can go

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.420 
one of this and basically you can go
through<00:01:31.350> there<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.619> check<00:01:31.829> different<00:01:32.220> lunch

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
through there and check different lunch

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
through there and check different lunch
so<00:01:32.670> let's<00:01:32.850> say<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.180> computer<00:01:33.570> reboots<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.229> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so let's say your computer reboots or it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.499 
so let's say your computer reboots or it
freezes<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> particular<00:01:36.180> point<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.450> time

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
freezes up at a particular point in time

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.359 
freezes up at a particular point in time
after<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> launch<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.530> application<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:38.130> just

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
after you launch an application or just

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670 
after you launch an application or just
you<00:01:38.490> remember<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.000> time<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.049> froze<00:01:40.409> up

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you remember the time that it froze up

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.399 
you remember the time that it froze up
or<00:01:40.829> rebooted<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.420> reboot<00:01:42.930> back<00:01:43.079> into<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
or rebooted and you reboot back into the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.840 
or rebooted and you reboot back into the
computer<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.130> check<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> event
