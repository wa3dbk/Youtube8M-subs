00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.429
 face that would be how is more or less what 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 what is the white and the pink bow because very 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.140
 simple you only use the fondant and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.610
 her chignon rubber pasta I already 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.470

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.740
 look for it and make it good because I have 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.920
 here and a mold that is what I did 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.010
 This is a 9-inch carton 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.100
 I cut it and more or less I gave it figure 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.520
 according to the figure of the face of the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.370
 woman that would be like this 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.200
 well let's start you can do what 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.390
 same if you make a mistake, you can 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.910
 re-grab cardboard and then more or 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.440
 less trace the figure and it would be with you 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.720
 strategic mold for all 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.720
 pastries that you need to make good 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.550
 I have a white detengan 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.360
 I'm going to cut half because I'm not going to 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.050
 occupying so much is a lot I'm just going to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.050
 cut face 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.130
 I have my tutorial here on how to do the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.130
 constant I invite you to see it 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.400
 let's stretch us our fondant 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.880
 it is very easy to make this monster high 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.880
 ah 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.240
 ah 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.370
 just remember to quit that in you from 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.550
 I agree how wide you thick 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.150
 what do you want? 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.820
 I am mordejÃ¡i 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.159
 until a smooth bone is even 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.100
 more or less 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.560
 there's what I'm going to do I'm going to put what 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.380
 that is my mold here 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.930
 and I'm going to cut it, whether they cut it 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.770
 with your pizza cutter or for example 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.390
 with this what I have here that would be 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.390
 as a scalpel type that is 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.230
 let's cut it carefully 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.090
 we're just plotting in agreement 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.189
 remember that for this you either 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.510
 They want this the gum paste or 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.510
 they want it fondant 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.430
 depending as you occupy it and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.109
 right now I have fondant only 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.159
 I'm showing you but regularly I 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.159
 I make it out of paste paste 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.630
 now we are going to better figure 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.690
 there is 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.360
 we keep the string below 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:11.560
 if for some reason you pull it 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.460
 short you have to give it through is now 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.460
 we approach the rest 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.040
 we remove the cardboard 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.599
 and carefully 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.129
 let's take off remember remember to put 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.830
 sugar glas down so they are not 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.600
 stick 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.490
 let's give it all over the little hill 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.650
 so that the figure of what is the 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.650
 head remember we cut it 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.240
 on the pure shores 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.670
 yes 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.340
 there is 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.550
 you with time at home can 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.209
 do it a little better with all the time 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.209
 in the world 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.800
 here installs a lot 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:22.290
 and you can appreciate it 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.290
 and good now what are we going to do 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.200
 I already have this I 'm going to take the excess 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.180
 of icing sugar that I put that they do not have 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.820
 a lot in other ways 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.130
 remember you look at this part of 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.440
 here madness orillita to round the and 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.650
 I was a bit better head there 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.280
 is now occupy to put also the 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.310
 eyes that would be in this part of here 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.840
 let's put the eyes I have them here 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:56.550
 it's very simple to do so I'm going to put 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.550
 also what is my glue 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.160
 there is 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.620
 the way you are going to see us 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.120
 because I show you more or less locate 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.180
 in this part of here 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.449
 and we hit her one eye let's hit her 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.449
 other 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.320
 Y 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.740
 As he is staying there, we are giving him 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.500
 well now remember that only 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.930
 has what it is in this part of here 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.110
 as a type the little nose or the little bone would be 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.280
 rather 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.280
 let's put it on 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.639
 at this height more or less there 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.749
 and there we are 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:54.110
 I cut the eyes with this cutter 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:57.560
 that would be like oval is the water 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.229
 you have the 73 you can cut it too 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.210
 with your round cutter but to me 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.360
 like this form more because I'm not going to 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.759
 have so much drive and is nothing more 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.139
 cut and I make its edges here and leave 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.590

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:16.490

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.629
 I did the tutorial here on my channel 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.340
 It can be the color you want 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:23.779
 but regularly wearing pink 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.560
 there are people who like purple blue 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:29.630
 I do not know how they want, we're going to stick it 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.900
 in this part of here that is where it goes to 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.900
 paste 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.770
 and we are going to place it as a corner 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.569
