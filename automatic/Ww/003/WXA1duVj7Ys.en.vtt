so<00:02:05.350> if<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:05.950> do<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.100> at<00:02:06.280> home<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.880> if<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.540> can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
so if I can do it at home and if you can

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.510 
so if I can do it at home and if you can
do<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:07.960> at<00:02:08.050> home<00:02:08.259> we<00:02:08.500> just<00:02:08.530> save<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> lot<00:02:09.490> of

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
do it at home we just save a lot of

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.230 
do it at home we just save a lot of
money<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.750> suggest<00:02:11.380> starting<00:02:11.890> at<00:02:12.490> the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
money and I suggest starting at the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.810 
money and I suggest starting at the
bottom<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.959> working<00:02:14.350> your<00:02:14.650> way<00:02:14.740> up<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.400> again

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
bottom and working your way up and again

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.870 
bottom and working your way up and again
you're<00:02:16.030> just<00:02:16.060> dotting<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.990> glue<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
you're just dotting the glue on the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.050 
you're just dotting the glue on the
strap<00:02:19.300> take<00:02:20.170> your<00:02:20.380> tweezer<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.280> then<00:02:21.850> just

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
strap take your tweezer and then just

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.080 
strap take your tweezer and then just
let<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.330> go<00:02:22.740> if<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:24.520> feel<00:02:24.760> like<00:02:24.940> you've

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
let it go if you feel like you've

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.510 
let it go if you feel like you've
dropped<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.810> wrong<00:02:26.020> spot<00:02:26.520> remember

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
dropped it in the wrong spot remember

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.760 
dropped it in the wrong spot remember
you<00:02:27.700> have<00:02:27.940> like<00:02:28.209> three<00:02:28.600> seconds<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.410> move<00:02:29.590> it

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
you have like three seconds to move it

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.070 
you have like three seconds to move it
quickly<00:02:30.010> next<00:02:30.459> up<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.120> turquoise<00:02:31.540> flip-flop

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
quickly next up is a turquoise flip-flop

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.600 
quickly next up is a turquoise flip-flop
which<00:02:32.230> i<00:02:32.350> think<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> great<00:02:33.070> color<00:02:33.280> for<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
which i think is a great color for the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.949 
which i think is a great color for the
summer<00:02:33.850> but<00:02:34.000> what<00:02:34.180> makes<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.540> even<00:02:34.810> more

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
summer but what makes it even more

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.100 
summer but what makes it even more
greater<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.670> I've<00:02:37.060> added<00:02:37.300> some<00:02:37.630> beading

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
greater is that I've added some beading

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.010 
greater is that I've added some beading
and<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.650> love<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.340> gold<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.270> nude<00:02:40.300> shimmer

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
and I love the gold and the nude shimmer

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.800 
and I love the gold and the nude shimmer
beads<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:42.160> time<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.670> would<00:02:42.970> use<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> creamy

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
beads and this time I would use a creamy

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.770 
beads and this time I would use a creamy
white<00:02:44.290> fevicol<00:02:45.100> because<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.120> isn't<00:02:46.330> that

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
white fevicol because this isn't that

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.290 
white fevicol because this isn't that
really<00:02:47.410> shiny<00:02:47.770> plastic<00:02:48.459> it's<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:49.000> slightly

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
really shiny plastic it's just slightly

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.620 
really shiny plastic it's just slightly
shiny<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:51.340> clear<00:02:51.670> fairly<00:02:52.060> quick<00:02:52.239> doesn't

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
shiny but the clear fairly quick doesn't

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.229 
shiny but the clear fairly quick doesn't
work<00:02:52.840> with<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.500> use<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.220> one<00:02:54.520> then<00:02:55.180> you

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
work with it so I use this one then you

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.320 
work with it so I use this one then you
just<00:02:55.600> squeeze<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.230> little<00:02:56.680> bit<00:02:57.070> okay<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:58.180> a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
just squeeze a little bit okay just a

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.420 
just squeeze a little bit okay just a
dot<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.019> then<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.070> get<00:03:00.340> your<00:03:01.180> gold<00:03:01.510> beads<00:03:01.989> and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
dot and then you get your gold beads and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.360 
dot and then you get your gold beads and
you<00:03:03.430> place<00:03:03.760> your<00:03:04.000> hand<00:03:04.360> under<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.739> strap<00:03:06.160> and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
you place your hand under the strap and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.850 
you place your hand under the strap and
when<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:06.970> drop<00:03:07.299> your<00:03:07.330> beads<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.620> just

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
when you drop your beads you just

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.430 
when you drop your beads you just
sprinkle<00:03:09.190> them<00:03:09.519> on<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.720> way<00:03:10.930> you're<00:03:11.110> kind<00:03:11.350> of

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
sprinkle them on that way you're kind of

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.350 
sprinkle them on that way you're kind of
catching<00:03:11.950> most<00:03:12.130> of<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> beads<00:03:12.730> that<00:03:12.970> fall

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
catching most of the beads that fall

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.630 
catching most of the beads that fall
just<00:03:14.110> make<00:03:14.230> sure<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.500> stick<00:03:14.769> them<00:03:14.920> down<00:03:15.220> with

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
just make sure you stick them down with

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.789 
just make sure you stick them down with
your<00:03:15.670> fingers<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.360> give<00:03:16.510> them<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.780> DAB<00:03:17.080> then

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
your fingers just give them a DAB then

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.009 
your fingers just give them a DAB then
with<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> wooden<00:03:18.400> arrow<00:03:18.670> cuticle<00:03:19.390> pusher<00:03:19.780> you

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
with a wooden arrow cuticle pusher you

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.910 
with a wooden arrow cuticle pusher you
can<00:03:20.560> just<00:03:20.890> press<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.459> down<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:22.380> clean<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.590> up

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.300 

all<00:03:26.520> right<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.180> my<00:03:27.330> last<00:03:27.630> one<00:03:28.069> this<00:03:29.069> is<00:03:29.280> a

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
all right and for my last one this is a

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.120 
all right and for my last one this is a
really<00:03:29.580> nice<00:03:29.940> one<00:03:30.180> because<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.530> tan<00:03:31.800> color

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
really nice one because it's a tan color

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.670 
really nice one because it's a tan color
so<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.610> goes<00:03:32.819> with<00:03:33.060> everything<00:03:33.600> but<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
so it goes with everything but the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.190 
so it goes with everything but the
contrast<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.490> beads<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:36.150> really<00:03:36.660> nice<00:03:36.840> now<00:03:37.170> I

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
contrast of beads is really nice now I

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.770 
contrast of beads is really nice now I
would<00:03:37.650> suggest<00:03:38.250> either<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.060> really<00:03:39.510> lovely
