00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
a half curling wand and I tried the half

really nice for loose curls loose waves

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.240 
really nice for loose curls loose waves
and<00:00:51.340> I<00:00:51.700> really<00:00:51.910> like<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.240> UM<00:00:52.800> feel<00:00:53.800> of<00:00:54.070> loose

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
and I really like the UM feel of loose

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.420 
and I really like the UM feel of loose
waves<00:00:54.580> so<00:00:55.480> I<00:00:55.510> hope<00:00:56.020> this<00:00:56.230> comes<00:00:56.830> out<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.250> is

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
waves so I hope this comes out this is

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.870 
waves so I hope this comes out this is
just<00:00:57.670> my<00:00:57.760> natural<00:00:58.150> hair<00:00:58.300> so<00:00:59.340> this<00:01:00.340> is<00:01:00.490> what<00:01:00.640> the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
just my natural hair so this is what the

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.060 
just my natural hair so this is what the
packaging<00:01:01.030> looks<00:01:01.300> like<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:02.380> barrel<00:01:02.740> is<00:01:02.890> like

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
packaging looks like the barrel is like

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.850 
packaging looks like the barrel is like
one<00:01:03.310> and<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.550> half<00:01:03.670> inch<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:05.650> and<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.830> half

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.429 
one and a half inch to one and a half
which<00:01:06.159> is<00:01:06.189> pretty<00:01:06.460> big<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:07.090> I<00:01:07.509> think<00:01:07.840> that

type I would be a good investment they
look<00:02:04.580> really<00:02:04.880> nice<00:02:05.500> so<00:02:06.500> then<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:06.890> comes<00:02:07.040> with

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
look really nice so then it comes with

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.140

protecting<00:02:11.630> glove<00:02:11.810> by<00:02:12.290> film<00:02:12.710> noir<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:14.420> this

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
protecting glove by film noir and this

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.180 
protecting glove by film noir and this
is<00:02:14.720> what<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.110> glove<00:02:15.440> will<00:02:15.620> fly<00:02:15.830> just

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
is what the glove will fly just

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.040 
is what the glove will fly just
basically<00:02:16.760> that's<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.060> one<00:02:17.270> but<00:02:17.510> when<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.959> curl

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
basically that's the one but when I curl

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.360 
basically that's the one but when I curl
my<00:02:18.320> hair<00:02:18.350> with<00:02:18.500> wands<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:18.950> don't<00:02:19.100> like<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.340> use

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
my hair with wands I don't like to use

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.180 
my hair with wands I don't like to use
gloves<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.120> I'm<00:02:20.530> pretty<00:02:21.530> used<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.010> but

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
gloves and so I'm pretty used to it but

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.470 
gloves and so I'm pretty used to it but
if<00:02:22.400> you're<00:02:22.550> not<00:02:22.700> used<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:22.970> working<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.360> would

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
if you're not used to working I would

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.120 
if you're not used to working I would
recommend<00:02:23.870> using<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.290> glove<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.740> then<00:02:24.920> work

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
recommend using the glove and then work

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.490 
recommend using the glove and then work
your<00:02:25.310> way<00:02:25.459> from<00:02:25.550> there<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.810> I'm<00:02:27.110> going<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.320> just

the<00:02:45.440> way<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.590> four<00:02:46.520> time<00:02:46.700> which<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.030> really

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
the way to four time which is really

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.670 
the way to four time which is really
really<00:02:47.600> hop<00:02:47.870> I'm<00:02:48.020> just<00:02:48.170> going<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.350> put<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.530> on

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
really hop I'm just going to put it on

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.670 
really hop I'm just going to put it on
392<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:50.480> heats<00:02:50.690> up<00:02:50.900> pretty<00:02:51.410> fast<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:53.680> since

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
392 and it heats up pretty fast so since

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.800 
392 and it heats up pretty fast so since
I've<00:02:54.830> used<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.310> smaller<00:02:55.549> barrel<00:02:55.820> before<00:02:56.239> so

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
I've used a smaller barrel before so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.750 
I've used a smaller barrel before so
basically<00:02:57.110> ideas<00:02:57.440> just<00:02:57.620> take<00:02:57.920> pieces<00:02:58.580> from

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
basically ideas just take pieces from

basically ideas just take pieces from
the<00:02:59.150> back<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.690> just<00:03:00.470> simple<00:03:00.830> like<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.370> okay

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
the back and just simple like that okay

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.470
