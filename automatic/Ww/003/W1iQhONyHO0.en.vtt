is about two photo editing apps for the
iPad<00:00:06.140> luminance<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.319> Snapseed<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.490> like<00:00:08.970> them

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
iPad luminance and Snapseed I like them

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.360 
iPad luminance and Snapseed I like them
both<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.719> lot<00:00:09.750> but<00:00:10.290> they<00:00:10.650> take<00:00:10.860> different

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
both a lot but they take different

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.730 
both a lot but they take different
approaches<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:11.969> photo<00:00:12.269> editing<00:00:12.690> luminance<00:00:13.620> is

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
approaches to photo editing luminance is

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.169 
approaches to photo editing luminance is
a<00:00:13.769> lot<00:00:14.040> more<00:00:14.160> traditional<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:14.940> about

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
a lot more traditional it's about

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
a lot more traditional it's about
sliders<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.750> actually<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.410> sliders<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
sliders you actually have sliders in the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.000 
sliders you actually have sliders in the
app<00:00:17.340> Snapseed<00:00:18.300> does<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.230> any<00:00:19.529> sliders

edited image I'll show you that you can

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.549 
edited image I'll show you that you can
zoom<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.750> image<00:00:54.780> by<00:00:55.199> double<00:00:55.530> tapping

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
zoom into the image by double tapping

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.160 
zoom into the image by double tapping
and<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.460> drag<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.940> around<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and you can drag it around to get a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.639 
and you can drag it around to get a
closer<00:00:58.469> look<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.579> click<00:00:59.820> on<00:00:59.870> history<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
closer look if you click on history you

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.830 
closer look if you click on history you
can<00:01:01.859> actually<00:01:02.129> view<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> your

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
can actually view all of your

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
can actually view all of your
adjustments<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> original

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
adjustments so this is the original

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.560 
adjustments so this is the original
image<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.369> final<00:01:09.030> image<00:01:09.150> so

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
image and this is the final image so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
image and this is the final image so
there's<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.900> huge<00:01:10.260> difference<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.400> can

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
there's a huge difference and I can

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
there's a huge difference and I can
actually<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:12.210> through<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> progression<00:01:13.439> of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
actually go through the progression of

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.230 
actually go through the progression of
like<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> filters<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.979> little

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
like the filters and all of the little

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.039 
like the filters and all of the little
adjustments<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.360> I've<00:01:18.479> made<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
adjustments that I've made with the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.300 
adjustments that I've made with the
sliders<00:01:20.659> if<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.740> edits<00:01:23.159> I've

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310

sliders if I really like the edits I've
made<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:24.000> actually<00:01:24.600> copy<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.200> edits<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
made I can actually copy the edits and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.200 
made I can actually copy the edits and
paste<00:01:26.340> them<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.700> another<00:01:27.000> image<00:01:27.450> later<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:29.210> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
paste them on another image later and I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.539 
paste them on another image later and I
can<00:01:30.570> view<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.350> adjustments<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.009> I've<00:01:32.220> made

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and still change them if I want to to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.990

you can take a photo or choose existing
I've<00:01:41.310> got<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> library<00:01:42.420> already<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
I've got one in the library already and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.249 
I've got one in the library already and
we<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.280> scroll<00:01:44.670> through<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.600> presets

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
we can scroll through all the presets

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.590 
we can scroll through all the presets
that<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.399> add<00:01:47.640> onto<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> photo<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.479> these

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that you can add onto the photo so these

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.780 
that you can add onto the photo so these
are<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:48.930> pre-made<00:01:49.409> filters<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
are all pre-made filters and so I can

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:01.300 
are all pre-made filters and so I can
preview<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.880> couple<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> them

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.300 

so<00:02:02.310> we'll<00:02:02.520> use<00:02:02.700> vive<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.740> tap<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so we'll use vive and if you tap on the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.399 
so we'll use vive and if you tap on the
adjustments<00:02:06.030> tab<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.810> where<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.200> can

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
adjustments tab this is where you can

something<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.480> see<00:02:45.660> sometimes<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
something you can see sometimes that the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.530 
something you can see sometimes that the
sliders<00:02:47.010> are<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> little<00:02:47.489> hard<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.120> pick<00:02:48.330> up

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
sliders are a little hard to pick up

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.570 
sliders are a little hard to pick up
because<00:02:48.900> they're<00:02:49.110> pretty<00:02:49.680> small<00:02:50.100> compared<00:02:50.519> to

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
because they're pretty small compared to

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.470 
because they're pretty small compared to
this<00:02:50.760> average<00:02:51.239> size<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.690> finger<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:54.239> that's

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
this average size of a finger so that's

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.699 
this average size of a finger so that's
pretty<00:02:54.750> much<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> only<00:02:55.260> thing<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.620> don't

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
pretty much the only thing that I don't

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.270 
pretty much the only thing that I don't
like<00:02:56.160> about<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.580> app<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.290> change<00:02:59.010> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
like about this app we can change the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.550 
like about this app we can change the
tone<00:02:59.550> curve<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.269> like<00:03:00.450> highlights<00:03:01.019> and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
tone curve so like highlights and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.250 
tone curve so like highlights and
shadows<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:03.090> adds<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.569> lot<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.900> depth<00:03:04.140> to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
shadows and this adds a lot of depth to

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.080 
shadows and this adds a lot of depth to
the<00:03:04.470> image<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.370> change<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.910> white

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the image you can change the white

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.050 
the image you can change the white
balance<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.070> can<00:03:08.280> make<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.579> image<00:03:08.610> seem

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
balance so you can make the image seem

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.350 
balance so you can make the image seem
warmer<00:03:09.600> or<00:03:09.750> cooler<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.670> warmer

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.880 
warmer or cooler so I like the warmer
look<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.900> what<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.140> cooler<00:03:13.380> look<00:03:13.650> looks

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
look this is what the cooler look looks

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.670 
look this is what the cooler look looks

can<00:04:11.820> go<00:04:12.030> through<00:04:12.600> tons<00:04:13.169> of<00:04:13.590> different

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
can go through tons of different

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.400 
can go through tons of different
Stiles<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:15.669> you'll<00:04:16.669> see<00:04:16.820> at<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:16.940> bottom<00:04:17.410> the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
Stiles and you'll see at the bottom the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.870 
Stiles and you'll see at the bottom the
different<00:04:18.709> styles

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
different styles

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.870 
different styles
now<00:04:20.239> I'm<00:04:20.389> adjusting<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.320> brightness<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:22.190> can

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
now I'm adjusting the brightness I can

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.590 
now I'm adjusting the brightness I can
adjust<00:04:23.449> the<00:04:23.810> texture<00:04:24.440> strength<00:04:24.949> and<00:04:25.669> if<00:04:26.510> you

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
adjust the texture strength and if you

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.629 
adjust the texture strength and if you
slide<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.139> right<00:04:27.320> it's<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.770> maximum<00:04:28.430> and

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
slide to the right it's the maximum and

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.270 
slide to the right it's the maximum and
then<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:28.850> left<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.419> minimum<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:32.919> if<00:04:33.919> you

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
then the left is the minimum and if you

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.150 
then the left is the minimum and if you
want<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:34.669> can<00:04:34.850> also<00:04:35.229> use<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.500> shuffle<00:04:36.949> button

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
want you can also use the shuffle button

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.850 
want you can also use the shuffle button
to<00:04:37.760> apply<00:04:38.000> random<00:04:38.419> combinations<00:04:39.350> of<00:04:39.560> all

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
to apply random combinations of all

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.830 
to apply random combinations of all
these<00:04:40.010> different<00:04:40.520> styles<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.120> effects<00:04:41.510> and

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
these different styles and effects and

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.629 
these different styles and effects and
there's<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:42.620> many<00:04:42.710> combinations<00:04:43.460> that

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
there's so many combinations that

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.310 
there's so many combinations that
they're<00:04:44.330> always<00:04:44.479> pretty<00:04:44.810> much<00:04:44.960> going<00:04:45.139> to<00:04:45.229> be

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
they're always pretty much going to be

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.870 
they're always pretty much going to be
different<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:45.830> this<00:04:45.979> is<00:04:46.040> a<00:04:46.160> really<00:04:46.430> nice<00:04:46.639> way

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
different and this is a really nice way

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.000 
different and this is a really nice way
to<00:04:47.150> add<00:04:47.720> effects<00:04:48.020> if<00:04:48.200> you<00:04:48.290> don't<00:04:48.470> want<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.680> be

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
to add effects if you don't want to be

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.030 
to add effects if you don't want to be
sliding<00:04:49.430> your<00:04:49.550> finger<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:54.380> I'll<00:04:54.620> apply<00:04:54.979> this

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
sliding your finger so I'll apply this

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.469 
sliding your finger so I'll apply this
effect<00:04:55.610> by<00:04:56.270> hitting<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.630> apply<00:04:56.930> button<00:04:57.200> and

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
effect by hitting the apply button and

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.060 
effect by hitting the apply button and
after<00:04:59.479> applying<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.229> effect<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.889> can

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
after applying the effect you can

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.159 
after applying the effect you can
compare<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:02.090> original<00:05:02.210> image<00:05:02.870> with<00:05:03.050> the

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
compare the original image with the

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.650 
compare the original image with the
edited<00:05:03.650> image<00:05:03.950> and<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:05.000> can<00:05:05.030> just<00:05:05.300> see<00:05:05.510> the

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
edited image and you can just see the

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.750 
edited image and you can just see the
difference<00:05:07.600> we<00:05:08.600> can<00:05:08.810> add<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.139> frame<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:10.039> just

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
difference we can add a frame and just

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.070 
difference we can add a frame and just
like<00:05:10.910> with<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.180> other<00:05:11.210> effect<00:05:11.690> you<00:05:11.840> can

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
like with the other effect you can

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.070 
like with the other effect you can
adjust<00:05:12.830> different<00:05:13.550> aspects<00:05:14.180> of<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.449> frame<00:05:14.720> so

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
adjust different aspects of the frame so

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.689 
adjust different aspects of the frame so
I'm<00:05:15.289> adjusting<00:05:15.530> width<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.220> then<00:05:16.370> I<00:05:16.520> can

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
I'm adjusting width and then I can

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.480 
I'm adjusting width and then I can
adjust<00:05:17.000> offset<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:18.280> there's<00:05:19.280> different

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
adjust offset and there's different

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.379 
adjust offset and there's different
styles<00:05:20.060> of<00:05:20.150> frames<00:05:20.419> to<00:05:20.539> choose<00:05:20.930> from<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.650> you

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
styles of frames to choose from and you

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.350 
styles of frames to choose from and you
can<00:05:23.389> also<00:05:23.660> shell<00:05:24.380> through<00:05:24.979> them<00:05:25.220> just<00:05:25.669> like<00:05:25.970> in

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
can also shell through them just like in

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.589 
can also shell through them just like in
the<00:05:27.110> other<00:05:27.350> effect<00:05:28.039> so<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.729> can<00:05:29.240> hit<00:05:29.419> the

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
the other effect so I can hit the

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.659 
the other effect so I can hit the
shuffle<00:05:30.050> button<00:05:30.200> multiple<00:05:31.070> times<00:05:31.310> and<00:05:31.520> you'll

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
shuffle button multiple times and you'll

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.080 
shuffle button multiple times and you'll
see<00:05:31.820> different<00:05:32.000> variations<00:05:32.840> of<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:34.220> frames

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.360 

but<00:05:38.090> by<00:05:38.479> far<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.990> coolest<00:05:39.169> effect<00:05:39.710> I<00:05:39.889> think<00:05:39.950> is

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
but by far the coolest effect I think is

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.610 
but by far the coolest effect I think is
selective<00:05:40.910> adjust<00:05:41.240> because<00:05:41.750> this<00:05:42.169> lets<00:05:42.410> you

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
selective adjust because this lets you

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.980 
selective adjust because this lets you
adjust<00:05:42.800> specific<00:05:43.490> parts<00:05:43.820> of<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.000> image<00:05:44.479> so

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
adjust specific parts of the image so

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.650 
adjust specific parts of the image so
you<00:05:45.020> can<00:05:45.110> add<00:05:45.380> a<00:05:45.410> point<00:05:45.680> to<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.919> image<00:05:46.340> and

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
you can add a point to the image and

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.850 
you can add a point to the image and
place<00:05:47.660> it<00:05:47.870> wherever<00:05:48.050> you<00:05:48.410> want

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
place it wherever you want

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.379 
place it wherever you want
I'm<00:05:49.099> just<00:05:49.430> placing<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:49.849> pretty<00:05:50.090> much<00:05:50.180> in<00:05:50.330> the

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
I'm just placing it pretty much in the

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.510 
I'm just placing it pretty much in the
middle<00:05:50.419> here<00:05:50.810> and<00:05:50.990> once<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:52.010> move<00:05:52.220> it<00:05:52.400> around

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
middle here and once you move it around

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.700 
middle here and once you move it around
it<00:05:52.849> actually<00:05:52.970> zooms<00:05:53.510> in<00:05:53.810> so<00:05:54.349> you<00:05:54.470> can<00:05:54.590> see

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
it actually zooms in so you can see

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.969 
it actually zooms in so you can see
exactly<00:05:55.070> where<00:05:55.340> you're<00:05:55.430> placing<00:05:55.669> it<00:05:55.940> and<00:05:56.979> so

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
exactly where you're placing it and so

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.520 
exactly where you're placing it and so
the<00:05:58.190> little<00:05:58.340> B<00:05:58.669> represents<00:05:59.360> brightness<00:05:59.930> so

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
the little B represents brightness so

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.930 
the little B represents brightness so
right<00:06:00.740> now<00:06:00.919> I'm<00:06:01.190> adjusting<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.789> brightness

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
right now I'm adjusting the brightness

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.990 
right now I'm adjusting the brightness
of<00:06:02.389> that<00:06:02.570> spot<00:06:02.810> of<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.080> image<00:06:03.320> I<00:06:03.590> can<00:06:04.430> drag<00:06:04.760> up

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
of that spot of the image I can drag up

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.409 
of that spot of the image I can drag up
to<00:06:05.389> adjust<00:06:05.900> the<00:06:06.080> contrast<00:06:06.349> and<00:06:07.280> then<00:06:08.090> we<00:06:08.270> can

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
to adjust the contrast and then we can

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.560 
to adjust the contrast and then we can
change<00:06:08.660> it<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.200> adjusting<00:06:09.680> the<00:06:09.830> saturation<00:06:10.570> so

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
change it to adjusting the saturation so

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.230 
change it to adjusting the saturation so
just<00:06:11.930> to<00:06:12.050> prove<00:06:12.289> that<00:06:12.349> it's<00:06:12.680> only<00:06:13.240> adjusting

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
just to prove that it's only adjusting

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.000 
just to prove that it's only adjusting
one<00:06:14.510> specific<00:06:15.020> part<00:06:15.169> of<00:06:15.289> the<00:06:15.380> image<00:06:15.620> I'm<00:06:15.830> going

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
one specific part of the image I'm going

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.520 
one specific part of the image I'm going
to<00:06:16.070> add<00:06:16.190> another<00:06:16.520> point<00:06:16.820> and<00:06:17.180> we'll<00:06:18.169> put<00:06:18.320> it<00:06:18.440> on

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
to add another point and we'll put it on

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.620 
to add another point and we'll put it on
the<00:06:18.620> left<00:06:18.919> so<00:06:19.310> you<00:06:19.400> can<00:06:19.580> just<00:06:19.729> see<00:06:20.270> the

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
the left so you can just see the

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.110 
the left so you can just see the
difference<00:06:21.250> so<00:06:22.250> you<00:06:22.280> can<00:06:22.400> adjust<00:06:22.849> again

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
difference so you can adjust again

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.420 
difference so you can adjust again
brightness<00:06:23.780> contrast<00:06:24.500> and<00:06:25.219> saturation

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
brightness contrast and saturation

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.310 
brightness contrast and saturation
so<00:06:28.430> you<00:06:28.520> can<00:06:28.700> see<00:06:28.940> that<00:06:29.180> the<00:06:29.300> left<00:06:29.570> side<00:06:29.720> looks

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
so you can see that the left side looks

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.030 
so you can see that the left side looks
a<00:06:30.410> lot<00:06:30.800> different<00:06:31.250> from<00:06:31.520> the<00:06:31.880> middle<00:06:32.330> and<00:06:33.040> I

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
a lot different from the middle and I

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.740 
a lot different from the middle and I
know<00:06:34.490> that<00:06:34.790> this<00:06:35.090> doesn't<00:06:35.420> really<00:06:35.510> look<00:06:35.690> good

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
know that this doesn't really look good

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.570 
know that this doesn't really look good
but<00:06:36.260> you<00:06:36.470> can<00:06:36.710> make<00:06:36.800> it<00:06:36.920> look<00:06:37.070> nice<00:06:37.280> if<00:06:37.460> you

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
but you can make it look nice if you

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.210 
but you can make it look nice if you
actually<00:06:37.910> try<00:06:38.150> so<00:06:39.020> this<00:06:39.350> app<00:06:39.500> may<00:06:39.770> be<00:06:39.830> a<00:06:39.980> little

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
actually try so this app may be a little

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.400 
actually try so this app may be a little
confusing<00:06:40.640> at<00:06:40.850> first<00:06:40.880> but<00:06:41.690> tutorials<00:06:42.200> do

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
confusing at first but tutorials do

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.990 
confusing at first but tutorials do
appear<00:06:42.680> on<00:06:42.800> the<00:06:42.920> screen<00:06:43.190> for<00:06:43.370> the<00:06:43.460> first<00:06:43.700> few

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
appear on the screen for the first few

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.970 
appear on the screen for the first few
times<00:06:44.150> you<00:06:44.360> use<00:06:44.630> it<00:06:44.810> and<00:06:45.230> they're<00:06:45.410> very<00:06:45.650> easy

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
times you use it and they're very easy

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.700 
times you use it and they're very easy
to<00:06:46.220> understand<00:06:46.790> and<00:06:47.090> you<00:06:47.990> can<00:06:48.020> always<00:06:48.230> revert

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
to understand and you can always revert

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.860 
to understand and you can always revert
