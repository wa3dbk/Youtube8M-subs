00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.320 

I<00:00:12.650> wonder<00:00:13.370> whether<00:00:13.490> you<00:00:13.760> spend<00:00:14.030> any<00:00:14.210> time

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
I wonder whether you spend any time

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.590 
I wonder whether you spend any time
thinking<00:00:15.110> about<00:00:15.230> copper<00:00:15.980> no<00:00:16.850> not<00:00:17.150> just<00:00:17.330> about

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
thinking about copper no not just about

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.500 
thinking about copper no not just about
the<00:00:17.750> element<00:00:18.170> but<00:00:18.860> about<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.670> impact<00:00:20.210> that

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
the element but about the impact that

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.460 
the element but about the impact that
copper<00:00:21.230> has<00:00:21.470> had<00:00:21.770> on<00:00:22.550> human<00:00:23.180> beings<00:00:23.440> over<00:00:24.440> a

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
copper has had on human beings over a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.640 
copper has had on human beings over a
period<00:00:24.830> of<00:00:25.040> several<00:00:25.400> thousand<00:00:26.150> years<00:00:26.650> copper

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
period of several thousand years copper

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.560 
period of several thousand years copper
is<00:00:27.770> one<00:00:27.980> of<00:00:28.100> the<00:00:28.160> most<00:00:28.369> important<00:00:28.970> elements<00:00:29.450> it

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
is one of the most important elements it

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.720 
is one of the most important elements it
was<00:00:29.689> certainly<00:00:29.990> known<00:00:30.259> to<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.650> ancients<00:00:31.130> and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
was certainly known to the ancients and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.370 
was certainly known to the ancients and
it<00:00:31.939> is<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.240> one<00:00:32.480> which<00:00:32.810> is<00:00:32.840> driven

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
it is the one which is driven

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.250 
it is the one which is driven
technological<00:00:34.370> change<00:00:34.700> a<00:00:35.030> gain<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.990> game

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
technological change a gain and a game

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.010 
technological change a gain and a game
through<00:00:36.740> the<00:00:36.800> ages<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:37.579> so<00:00:38.240> I'd<00:00:38.510> like<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.810> tell

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
through the ages and so I'd like to tell

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.050 
through the ages and so I'd like to tell
you<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.320> little<00:00:39.560> bit<00:00:39.680> about<00:00:40.340> this<00:00:40.520> element<00:00:40.790> now

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
you a little bit about this element now

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.500 
you a little bit about this element now
if<00:00:41.450> you<00:00:41.900> take<00:00:42.200> a<00:00:42.260> look<00:00:42.560> at<00:00:42.860> some<00:00:43.250> copper<00:00:43.730> it

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
if you take a look at some copper it

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.090 
if you take a look at some copper it
does<00:00:44.840> have<00:00:45.140> that<00:00:45.710> fantastic<00:00:46.870> beautiful

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
does have that fantastic beautiful

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.090 
does have that fantastic beautiful
orange<00:00:49.100> color<00:00:49.310> doesn't<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:50.410> but<00:00:51.410> I'd<00:00:51.770> like<00:00:51.950> you

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
orange color doesn't it but I'd like you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.620 
orange color doesn't it but I'd like you
to<00:00:52.220> look<00:00:52.340> at<00:00:52.400> game<00:00:52.700> because<00:00:53.210> if<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:53.450> actually

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
to look at game because if you actually

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.280 
to look at game because if you actually
polished<00:00:54.380> copper<00:00:54.650> carefully<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:56.140> here<00:00:57.140> we

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
polished copper carefully and here we

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.210 
polished copper carefully and here we
have<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.890> pan<00:00:58.880> which<00:00:59.750> is<00:00:59.900> being<00:01:00.080> polished<00:01:00.530> quite

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
have a pan which is being polished quite

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.340 
have a pan which is being polished quite
well<00:01:01.490> you<00:01:02.210> can<00:01:02.360> actually<00:01:02.480> see<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.050> it's<00:01:03.230> got

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
well you can actually see that it's got

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.179 
well you can actually see that it's got
a<00:01:03.380> rather<00:01:03.620> pinkish<00:01:04.280> Sheen<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:05.119> it<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.680> if<00:01:06.680> you

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
a rather pinkish Sheen to it and if you

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.160 
a rather pinkish Sheen to it and if you
leave<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.610> around<00:01:07.880> or<00:01:08.180> if<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.330> heat<00:01:08.659> it<00:01:08.689> up<00:01:08.930> a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
leave it around or if you heat it up a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.760 
leave it around or if you heat it up a
bit

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
bit

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.760 
bit
then<00:01:10.250> what<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:10.490> does<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.509> darkens<00:01:12.110> it

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
then what it does is it darkens it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.249 
then what it does is it darkens it
darkens<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.580> it<00:01:13.909> gets<00:01:14.060> coated<00:01:14.420> with<00:01:14.930> a<00:01:14.960> layer

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
darkens is it gets coated with a layer

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.330 
darkens is it gets coated with a layer
of<00:01:15.590> oxide<00:01:17.020> now<00:01:18.020> where<00:01:18.259> do<00:01:18.380> we<00:01:18.469> get<00:01:18.649> our<00:01:18.859> copper

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
of oxide now where do we get our copper

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.450 
of oxide now where do we get our copper
from<00:01:19.490> well<00:01:20.359> copper<00:01:20.899> is<00:01:21.079> actually<00:01:21.920> mined

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
from well copper is actually mined

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.120 
from well copper is actually mined
throughout<00:01:23.090> Central<00:01:23.659> Africa<00:01:24.109> other<00:01:24.770> places

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
throughout Central Africa other places

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.249 
throughout Central Africa other places
of<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.369> world<00:01:25.460> but<00:01:25.909> certainly<00:01:26.210> Zambia<00:01:26.749> with

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
of the world but certainly Zambia with

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.499 
of the world but certainly Zambia with
famous<00:01:27.740> for<00:01:28.130> its<00:01:28.249> copper<00:01:28.609> mines<00:01:28.819> and<00:01:29.270> I'm

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
famous for its copper mines and I'm

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.809 
famous for its copper mines and I'm
going<00:01:29.719> to<00:01:29.810> pour<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.319> little<00:01:30.350> bit<00:01:30.859> of<00:01:31.069> copper<00:01:31.670> of

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
going to pour a little bit of copper of

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.160 
going to pour a little bit of copper of
a<00:01:31.939> copper<00:01:32.359> ore<00:01:32.799> into<00:01:33.799> this<00:01:34.069> beaker<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:36.020> is

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
a copper ore into this beaker this is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.020 
a copper ore into this beaker this is
malachite<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:37.399> fact<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:37.819> synthetic

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
malachite in fact it's synthetic

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.539 
malachite in fact it's synthetic
malachite<00:01:38.780> rather<00:01:39.109> than<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.039> sort<00:01:40.189> of<00:01:40.280> real

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
malachite rather than the sort of real

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.620 
malachite rather than the sort of real
crude<00:01:41.240> or<00:01:41.889> but<00:01:42.889> this<00:01:43.039> is<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.219> copper<00:01:43.999> hydroxy

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
crude or but this is a copper hydroxy

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.389 
crude or but this is a copper hydroxy
carbonate<00:01:45.139> and<00:01:45.319> you<00:01:45.560> can<00:01:45.679> see<00:01:45.889> that<00:01:46.039> it's<00:01:46.189> got

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
carbonate and you can see that it's got

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.879 
carbonate and you can see that it's got
that<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.909> read<00:01:47.240> glorious<00:01:48.109> kind<00:01:48.439> of<00:01:48.499> greenish

that that read glorious kind of greenish
color<00:01:49.399> which<00:01:49.939> has<00:01:49.969> made<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.689> valuable<00:01:51.020> as<00:01:51.560> a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
color which has made it so valuable as a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.510 
color which has made it so valuable as a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.640 
the wonderful sort of crystal faces on
the<00:02:21.709> copper<00:02:22.069> sulfate<00:02:22.489> copper<00:02:23.330> itself

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
the copper sulfate copper itself

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.839 
the copper sulfate copper itself
is<00:02:25.900> relatively<00:02:26.900> inert<00:02:27.470> if<00:02:27.739> you<00:02:28.640> actually

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
is relatively inert if you actually

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.319 
is relatively inert if you actually
leave<00:02:29.659> it<00:02:29.810> around<00:02:29.900> in<00:02:30.260> air<00:02:30.470> very<00:02:31.400> very<00:02:31.819> slowly

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
leave it around in air very very slowly

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.839 
leave it around in air very very slowly
it<00:02:33.019> will<00:02:33.200> pick<00:02:33.439> up<00:02:33.470> oxygen<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.459> can<00:02:34.610> see

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
it will pick up oxygen and you can see

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.479 
it will pick up oxygen and you can see
that<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.209> tarnishes<00:02:35.930> gently<00:02:36.439> it<00:02:37.099> actually

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
that it tarnishes gently it actually

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.000 
that it tarnishes gently it actually
goes<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.700> rather<00:02:38.120> dull<00:02:38.569> brownish<00:02:39.349> color<00:02:39.650> and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
goes a rather dull brownish color and

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.160 
goes a rather dull brownish color and
it's<00:02:40.430> this<00:02:40.640> very<00:02:40.939> inertness<00:02:41.450> which<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.049> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
it's this very inertness which is the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.460 
it's this very inertness which is the
reason<00:02:42.379> why<00:02:42.709> copper<00:02:43.280> has<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:43.670> often<00:02:43.939> been<00:02:44.269> used

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
reason why copper has so often been used

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.520 
reason why copper has so often been used

drain pipes astonishingly are actually
made<00:02:51.319> of<00:02:51.470> copper<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.129> is<00:02:52.489> wonderful<00:02:52.909> to<00:02:53.150> see

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
made of copper and is wonderful to see

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.140 
made of copper and is wonderful to see
the<00:02:53.540> brand-new<00:02:54.079> ones<00:02:54.470> beautifully<00:02:55.400> glinting

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
and shiny and then they slowly aged and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.140 
and shiny and then they slowly aged and
eventually<00:02:59.900> what<00:03:00.109> they<00:03:00.230> develop<00:03:00.709> are<00:03:01.340> these

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
eventually what they develop are these

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.229 
eventually what they develop are these
patches<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:03.049> what<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.069> called<00:03:04.310> ver<00:03:04.609> degree<00:03:04.970> and

patches of what is called ver degree and
that<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:05.959> of<00:03:06.079> course<00:03:06.790> what<00:03:07.790> happens<00:03:08.239> as<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
that is of course what happens as the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.530 
that is of course what happens as the
copper<00:03:09.349> picks<00:03:09.620> up<00:03:09.829> water<00:03:10.159> and<00:03:10.519> carbon<00:03:11.090> dioxide

from<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.840> air<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.439> gradually<00:03:13.400> begins<00:03:13.730> to

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
from the air and gradually begins to

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.289 
from the air and gradually begins to
give<00:03:14.030> rise<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.329> that<00:03:15.109> lovely<00:03:15.739> green<00:03:16.099> color<00:03:16.430> but

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
give rise to that lovely green color but

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.479 
give rise to that lovely green color but
given<00:03:17.629> the<00:03:17.750> right<00:03:17.780> sorts<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.349> reagents<00:03:18.950> you

given the right sorts of reagents you

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.699 
given the right sorts of reagents you
can<00:03:19.639> actually<00:03:19.939> get<00:03:20.090> copper<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.959> react<00:03:21.230> very
