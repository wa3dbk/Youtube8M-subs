00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.020
I am making a basic T-Shirt

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.600
from my pattern number 1502

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:09.384
This is a slimline cut

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:12.808
which I have found is popular with both girls and guys

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:15.086
You have seen this jersey before

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:18.808
It's cotton, quite firm and not very stretchy

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.820
It will make a great T-shirt

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.840
It's 145cm, roughly 57", across the width

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.480
I have a piece here of 1.2mtrs, that's 48"

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.040
which is a good length for my T-shirt

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.780
plus extra for trimming

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.220
I'm going to prewash it

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.620
as most jerseys will shrink in the length

00:00:42.348 --> 00:00:45.868
The edge is a little wavy. Washing will get rid of this

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:48.733
The jersey selvedge is not like a woven fabric

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.260
It can be distorted

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.820
So it's best to leave some space between the edge

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.860
and your pattern

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.180
Usually when you buy fabric that is folded

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.380
the inside is the right side

00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:01.864
But often with jersey, as in this case

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.980
the right side is the outside

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.560
So be wary of that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.840
This colour is gorgeous

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.760
and is going to make a great T-shirt

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.660
I shall wash it at 30 or 40 degrees

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:15.699
and tumble dry in the same way as a finished garment

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.627
In the meantime we can prepare the pattern

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:23.136
I have downloaded the pattern in size 34

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520
from my T-shirts pattern page

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.640
This pattern is available to my Members

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.320
YOU CAN NOW BUY IT SEPARATELY!

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.699
I usually print using the fast print setting to save ink

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.826
as it is clear enough

00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:36.520
You can see the difference here

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.460
The standard setting show up better for this video

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:42.285
If this is your first download

00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:44.433
You can see how easy it is to lay out

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:47.955
The columns are numbered and rows have letters

00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:58.701
Lay all the sheets out

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.220
Use some weights. This time I'm using curtain weights

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.620
Line up the sheets and stick with tape

00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:15.355
The one inch square pattern grid will be in line

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.220
Always make sure your pattern

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.960
is printed to the correct scale

00:02:19.316 --> 00:02:22.516
Print one page first before you do anything else

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:29.467
I usually use the cheapest paper - 80gms

00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:32.474
If I think I am going to use the pattern

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.320
over and over again

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.559
I might use thicker paper

00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:42.041
Cut the pieces out

00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:54.758
So that's the pattern cut out. Front, back, sleeve

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.740
You will find that some patterns

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.087
have the two sleeves drafted to make laying out easier

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:03.382
This time the sleeve is symmetrical

00:03:04.028 --> 00:03:06.108
So you can cut two the same way up

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:17.295
Look out for the next stage

00:03:17.607 --> 00:03:19.607
I will be uploading it shortly
