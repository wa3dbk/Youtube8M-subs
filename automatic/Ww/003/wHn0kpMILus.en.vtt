so we're going to go ahead and lube the

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.770 
so we're going to go ahead and lube the
chain<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.310> tune<00:00:02.730> up<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.000> derailleur<00:00:03.300> because

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
chain and tune up the derailleur because

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.390 
chain and tune up the derailleur because
when<00:00:03.929> you're<00:00:04.049> riding<00:00:04.200> an<00:00:04.440> off-road<00:00:04.950> type<00:00:05.220> of

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
when you're riding an off-road type of

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.710 
when you're riding an off-road type of
bike<00:00:05.549> like<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:06.180> know<00:00:06.270> they<00:00:06.390> get<00:00:06.540> dirty

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
bike like this you know they get dirty

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.960 
bike like this you know they get dirty

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
well why don't you just jump right into

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.339 
well why don't you just jump right into
it<00:00:12.230> okay

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
it okay

it okay
sure<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.429> use<00:00:14.849> any<00:00:15.150> type<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.599> chain

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
sure you can just use any type of chain

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.099 
sure you can just use any type of chain
lube<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.730> basically<00:00:17.730> start<00:00:18.270> from<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.660> rear

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
lube and basically start from the rear

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.160 
lube and basically start from the rear
and<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:20.010> turn<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.580> chain<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.779> while<00:00:21.930> you're

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and just turn the chain the while you're

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
and just turn the chain the while you're
applying<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.710> oil<00:00:23.039> kind<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.060> letting<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.390> drip

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
applying the oil kind of letting it drip

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.349 
applying the oil kind of letting it drip
on<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:25.019> yeah<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> would<00:00:26.699> suggest<00:00:26.939> if

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
on there yeah so I would suggest if

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.779 
on there yeah so I would suggest if
you're<00:00:27.570> riding<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.320> dry<00:00:28.710> conditions

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you're riding in dry conditions

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.550 
you're riding in dry conditions
you<00:00:30.090> only<00:00:30.210> need<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.480> leave<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> chain<00:00:31.199> maybe

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
you only need to leave the chain maybe

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.370 
you only need to leave the chain maybe
once<00:00:32.460> every<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> one<00:00:33.660> or<00:00:33.750> two<00:00:33.780> weeks<00:00:34.079> if

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
once every one to one or two weeks if

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
once every one to one or two weeks if
you're<00:00:34.530> riding<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:34.950> wet<00:00:35.130> conditions<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.850> can

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
you're riding in wet conditions you can

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.020 
you're riding in wet conditions you can
definitely<00:00:36.690> lube<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.590> chain<00:00:37.980> more<00:00:38.670> often

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
definitely lube the chain more often

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.049 
definitely lube the chain more often
such<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.570> even<00:00:40.230> after<00:00:40.530> every<00:00:41.250> ride<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:41.969> does

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
such as even after every ride what does

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.819 
such as even after every ride what does
it<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.570> why<00:00:42.750> lube<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.079> chain<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:43.710> all

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it do like why lube the chain at all

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.380 
it do like why lube the chain at all
well<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> keep<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> chain<00:00:45.239> in

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
well it's going to keep the chain in

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.810 
well it's going to keep the chain in
much<00:00:45.539> better<00:00:45.690> condition<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.579> it's<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
much better condition and it's going to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.819 
much better condition and it's going to
prolong<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.660> life<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.500> prevent

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
prolong the life of it and prevent

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
prolong the life of it and prevent
corrosion<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.640> seems<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.390> would<00:00:51.570> when

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
corrosion it seems like it would when

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.600 
corrosion it seems like it would when
you<00:00:52.289> say<00:00:52.410> corrosion<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.010> some<00:00:53.190> chains<00:00:53.430> can

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you say corrosion so some chains can

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.830 
you say corrosion so some chains can
they<00:00:53.699> rust<00:00:53.940> or<00:00:54.180> are<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.600> stainless

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
they rust or are they all like stainless

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.319 
they rust or are they all like stainless
steel<00:00:55.199> some<00:00:56.039> chains<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.820> definitely<00:00:57.149> rush

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
steel some chains can definitely rush

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.930 
steel some chains can definitely rush
our<00:00:57.809> chains<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.199> using<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.739> non<00:00:59.550> rusting

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
our chains are using a non rusting

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.970 
our chains are using a non rusting
material<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.600> they're<00:01:00.809> all<00:01:00.960> stainless<00:01:01.440> okay

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
material so they're all stainless okay

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
material so they're all stainless okay
cool<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.609> allows<00:01:02.820> those<00:01:03.090> links<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> sort<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
cool so it allows those links to sort of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.710 
cool so it allows those links to sort of
pivot<00:01:04.439> more<00:01:04.979> freely<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.729> probably

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
pivot more freely and that probably

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.270 
pivot more freely and that probably
makes<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.200> bit<00:01:07.380> easier<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.979> shift

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
makes it a little bit easier to shift

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.340 
makes it a little bit easier to shift
gears<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> stuff<00:01:09.150> too<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.110> was<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
gears and stuff too and that was the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.630 
gears and stuff too and that was the
second<00:01:10.710> part<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.340> we're<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
second part of this so we're going to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
second part of this so we're going to
talk<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.600> derailleur<00:01:12.930> back<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.530> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
talk about the derailleur back here and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.499 
talk about the derailleur back here and
if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> hear<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.520> your<00:01:15.119> bike<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.450> like

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
if you hear your your bike it's like

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.410 
if you hear your your bike it's like
ttttt<00:01:16.200> no<00:01:16.409> scraping<00:01:16.950> noise<00:01:17.220> what<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> do

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
ttttt no scraping noise what can you do

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.179 
ttttt no scraping noise what can you do
to<00:01:18.570> sort<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.840> tune<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.229> real<00:01:19.409> quick<00:01:19.619> yeah

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to sort of tune that up real quick yeah

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.800 
to sort of tune that up real quick yeah
so<00:01:20.520> depending<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> system<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.630> bike

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so depending on the system on your bike

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.480 
so depending on the system on your bike
you've<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> couple<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> adjustments<00:01:22.979> for

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you've got a couple of adjustments for

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.310 
you've got a couple of adjustments for
your<00:01:23.610> trailer<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.600> start<00:01:24.869> pedaling

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
your trailer so if you start pedaling

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
your trailer so if you start pedaling
and<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.860> notice<00:01:26.280> some<00:01:26.430> clicking<00:01:26.850> sound<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and you notice some clicking sound the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.870 
and you notice some clicking sound the
chain<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.290> indexing<00:01:29.250> properly<00:01:29.700> on

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
chain is just not indexing properly on

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.929 
chain is just not indexing properly on
the<00:01:30.090> different<00:01:30.900> cogs<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.130> first<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.790> all

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the different cogs you can first of all

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
the different cogs you can first of all
use<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.509> quick<00:01:33.780> adjustments<00:01:34.380> which<00:01:35.040> are

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
use your quick adjustments which are

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
use your quick adjustments which are
connected<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> gear<00:01:36.840> shifter<00:01:37.259> cool<00:01:37.740> them

connected to the gear shifter cool them

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.100 
connected to the gear shifter cool them
so<00:01:38.130> by<00:01:38.460> turning<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:39.030> clockwise<00:01:39.659> or

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so by turning it clockwise or

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.899 
so by turning it clockwise or
counterclockwise<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.369> adjust<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
counterclockwise you can adjust the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.870 
counterclockwise you can adjust the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
tension on the the cable okay

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
tension on the the cable okay
second<00:01:45.360> adjustment<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.110> use<00:01:46.439> there's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
second adjustment you can use there's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.310 
second adjustment you can use there's
another<00:01:47.070> quick<00:01:47.460> adjustment<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.960> edge<00:01:49.110> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
another quick adjustment on the edge of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.870 
another quick adjustment on the edge of
the<00:01:49.439> derailleur<00:01:49.890> okay<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.490> also<00:01:50.610> turn

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the derailleur okay you can also turn

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.359 
the derailleur okay you can also turn
this<00:01:51.090> clockwise<00:01:51.479> or<00:01:52.049> counterclockwise<00:01:52.829> so

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
this clockwise or counterclockwise so

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.630 
this clockwise or counterclockwise so
while<00:01:53.970> you're<00:01:54.210> turning<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.110> crank<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.430> can

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
while you're turning the crank you can

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.069 
while you're turning the crank you can
twist<00:01:57.270> these<00:01:57.780> adjustments<00:01:58.500> until<00:01:59.280> you<00:02:00.079> remove

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
twist these adjustments until you remove

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.069 
twist these adjustments until you remove
the<00:02:01.530> clicking<00:02:02.250> sound<00:02:02.490> ok<00:02:03.420> that's<00:02:03.659> sort<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the clicking sound ok that's sort of a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.109 
the clicking sound ok that's sort of a
quick<00:02:04.380> adjustment<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:05.159> you're<00:02:05.430> wanting<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> do

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
quick adjustment if you're wanting to do

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.219 
quick adjustment if you're wanting to do
more<00:02:06.329> fine<00:02:06.600> tuning<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.590> use<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.840> low<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
more fine tuning you can use the low and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.089 
more fine tuning you can use the low and
high<00:02:11.060> adjustment<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:13.319> derail

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
high adjustment on the derail

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.849 
high adjustment on the derail
so<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:14.999> low<00:02:15.209> would<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.689> for<00:02:15.989> low<00:02:16.109> gears<00:02:16.469> and

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
so the low would be for low gears and

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.470 
so the low would be for low gears and
the<00:02:16.980> high<00:02:17.129> would<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.489> for<00:02:17.700> high<00:02:17.849> gears<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.420> you

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the high would be for high gears and you

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.539 
the high would be for high gears and you
can<00:02:18.900> actually<00:02:19.219> look<00:02:20.219> at<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:21.180> cog<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.249> back

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
can actually look at the cog in the back

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.839 
can actually look at the cog in the back
and<00:02:23.999> make<00:02:24.719> sure<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.109> it's<00:02:25.290> lining<00:02:25.680> ups<00:02:25.980> with

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
and make sure that it's lining ups with

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.030 
and make sure that it's lining ups with
the<00:02:27.150> middle<00:02:27.389> of<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.629> chain<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.469> specific

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the middle of the chain on that specific

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.399 
the middle of the chain on that specific
gear<00:02:29.310> cool<00:02:29.670> Wow<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.840> saying<00:02:31.139> low

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
gear cool Wow so and you saying low

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.649 
gear cool Wow so and you saying low
gears<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.889> is<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.069> like<00:02:32.129> these<00:02:32.480> larger<00:02:33.480> ones

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
gears so is that like these larger ones

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.149 
gears so is that like these larger ones
yeah<00:02:34.439> exactly

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
yeah exactly

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.920 
yeah exactly
so<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.730> would<00:02:35.849> be<00:02:35.909> your<00:02:36.000> lowest<00:02:36.389> and<00:02:36.659> then

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
so this would be your lowest and then

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.629 
so this would be your lowest and then
this<00:02:37.079> would<00:02:37.230> be<00:02:37.319> your<00:02:37.500> highest<00:02:37.680> yeah<00:02:38.069> okay<00:02:38.579> so

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
this would be your highest yeah okay so

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.039 
this would be your highest yeah okay so
if<00:02:38.879> I'm<00:02:39.030> at<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.209> low<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.689> that's<00:02:39.810> where<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
if I'm at the low and that's where the

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.080 
if I'm at the low and that's where the
clicking<00:02:40.379> is<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.650> kind<00:02:41.159> of<00:02:41.219> adjust<00:02:41.549> that<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.939> L

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
clicking is I kind of adjust that the L

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.739 
clicking is I kind of adjust that the L
screw<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.049> yep<00:02:43.590> exactly<00:02:44.280> exactly<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.819> you

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:45.749 
screw and yep exactly exactly and you

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.839 
screw and yep exactly exactly and you
don't<00:02:45.900> want<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.079> turn<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.469> too<00:02:46.650> much<00:02:46.829> just<00:02:47.400> turn

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
don't want to turn it too much just turn

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.209 
don't want to turn it too much just turn
it<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.269> quarter<00:02:48.750> turn<00:02:48.900> four<00:02:49.260> time<00:02:49.379> okay<00:02:49.739> that's

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.219 
it a quarter turn four time okay that's

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.619 
it a quarter turn four time okay that's
awesome<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.879> know<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.599> a

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
awesome and you know this is a

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.659 
awesome and you know this is a
higher-end<00:02:51.870> drivetrain<00:02:52.469> SRAM<00:02:52.739> via<00:02:52.980> GT<00:02:53.400> it's

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
higher-end drivetrain SRAM via GT it's

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.189 
higher-end drivetrain SRAM via GT it's
like<00:02:53.909> one<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.449> higher<00:02:54.629> end<00:02:54.900> for<00:02:54.959> their

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
like one of the higher end for their

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.709 
like one of the higher end for their
urban<00:02:55.319> model<00:02:55.859> if<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.489> have<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:56.939> a<00:02:56.969> lower-end

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
urban model if you have like a lower-end

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.250 
urban model if you have like a lower-end
derailleur<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.310> Sherman<00:02:59.579> attorney<00:03:00.030> TX<00:03:00.750> it

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
derailleur like a Sherman attorney TX it

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.780 
derailleur like a Sherman attorney TX it
might<00:03:01.469> not<00:03:01.620> have<00:03:01.799> all<00:03:01.949> those<00:03:02.069> adjustments<00:03:02.340> and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
might not have all those adjustments and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.970 
might not have all those adjustments and
what's<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.329> difference<00:03:03.719> why<00:03:04.139> pay<00:03:04.469> more<00:03:04.680> for<00:03:04.739> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
what's the difference why pay more for a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.890 
what's the difference why pay more for a
nicer<00:03:05.310> derailleur<00:03:05.609> what<00:03:05.939> do<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.060> get<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.480> find

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
nicer derailleur what do you get I find

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.559 
nicer derailleur what do you get I find
the<00:03:07.019> higher<00:03:07.230> end<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:08.069> go<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.459> get<00:03:09.000> crisper

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
the higher end you go you get crisper

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.860 
the higher end you go you get crisper
shifting<00:03:10.079> just<00:03:10.650> more<00:03:10.859> durability<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.879> how

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
shifting just more durability and how

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.550 
shifting just more durability and how
fast<00:03:13.169> the<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:14.040> derailleur<00:03:14.909> works<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.599> how

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
fast the the derailleur works and how

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.249 
fast the the derailleur works and how
much<00:03:16.859> it<00:03:17.129> can<00:03:17.250> shift<00:03:17.879> under<00:03:18.150> load<00:03:18.419> so<00:03:18.870> got<00:03:19.229> it

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:19.259 
much it can shift under load so got it

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:20.539 
much it can shift under load so got it
if<00:03:19.590> you're<00:03:19.709> going<00:03:19.859> uphill<00:03:20.099> or<00:03:20.310> downhill

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
if you're going uphill or downhill

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.369 
if you're going uphill or downhill
you'll<00:03:21.269> be<00:03:21.419> able<00:03:21.509> to<00:03:21.689> get<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.870> same<00:03:21.989> shifting

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
you'll be able to get the same shifting

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.409 
you'll be able to get the same shifting
performance<00:03:22.859> okay<00:03:23.340> well<00:03:23.699> the<00:03:23.879> other<00:03:24.000> thing<00:03:24.299> to

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
performance okay well the other thing to

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.780 
performance okay well the other thing to
talk<00:03:24.599> about<00:03:24.629> was<00:03:25.049> as<00:03:25.229> you<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:26.340> know<00:03:26.430> we<00:03:26.549> put<00:03:26.699> on

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
talk about was as you you know we put on

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.039 
talk about was as you you know we put on
sub<00:03:27.030> lubrication<00:03:27.569> we<00:03:27.689> might<00:03:27.840> want<00:03:28.019> to

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
sub lubrication we might want to

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.599 
sub lubrication we might want to
actually<00:03:28.199> shift<00:03:28.620> through<00:03:28.889> those<00:03:29.129> different

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
actually shift through those different

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.849 
actually shift through those different
gears<00:03:29.939> so<00:03:30.479> that<00:03:30.720> each<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.319> chain<00:03:31.620> rings

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
gears so that each of the chain rings

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.969 
gears so that each of the chain rings
back<00:03:32.069> there<00:03:32.310> get<00:03:32.629> get<00:03:33.629> a<00:03:33.659> little<00:03:33.930> bit<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.229> Lube

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
back there get get a little bit of Lube

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.390 
back there get get a little bit of Lube
on<00:03:35.129> them<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.459> then<00:03:35.909> we've<00:03:36.030> got<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.209> rag<00:03:36.479> here<00:03:36.900> I

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
on them and then we've got a rag here I

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.619 
on them and then we've got a rag here I
think<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.519> good<00:03:38.759> when<00:03:38.970> you've<00:03:39.150> when<00:03:39.509> you've

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
think it's good when you've when you've

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.979 
think it's good when you've when you've
kind<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:39.930> cycled<00:03:40.379> through<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:41.629> use<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:42.810> towel

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
kind of cycled through to use the towel

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.479 
kind of cycled through to use the towel
to<00:03:43.229> kind<00:03:43.409> of<00:03:43.470> get<00:03:43.620> off<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.769> little<00:03:44.129> bit<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
to kind of get off a little bit of the

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.979 
to kind of get off a little bit of the
extra<00:03:44.879> Lube<00:03:45.060> because<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.389> idea<00:03:45.629> isn't<00:03:45.780> you

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
it's just to sort of mostly get it into

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.890 
it's just to sort of mostly get it into
those<00:03:50.099> links<00:03:50.669> and<00:03:50.879> then<00:03:51.209> kind<00:03:51.449> of<00:03:51.540> brush<00:03:51.720> it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900

those links and then kind of brush it
off<00:03:52.019> at<00:03:52.229> the<00:03:52.379> end<00:03:52.409> so<00:03:53.250> that's<00:03:53.310> not<00:03:53.459> about<00:03:53.609> right
