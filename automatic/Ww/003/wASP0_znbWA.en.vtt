00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
what's what we call the 1938 tube stock

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
what's what we call the 1938 tube stock
which<00:00:30.150> started<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.779> come<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.140> service<00:00:31.410> in

which started to come into service in

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.540 
which started to come into service in
1938<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> actually<00:00:34.079> carried<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.829> service

Transport on London Underground and in

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.049 
Transport on London Underground and in
actual<00:00:48.930> fact<00:00:49.050> they're<00:00:49.260> still<00:00:49.410> running<00:00:50.059> today

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
actual fact they're still running today

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.799 
actual fact they're still running today
on<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.379> are<00:00:52.949> white<00:00:53.280> where<00:00:54.120> some<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.750> are

over 70 years old and so they're the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.520 
over 70 years old and so they're the
oldest<00:00:57.289> running<00:00:58.430> trains<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.760> country

well the really big feature about the 38
stop<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> fact<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.260> all<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.739> electrical

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
stop is the fact that all the electrical

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.280 
stop is the fact that all the electrical
equipment<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.180> under<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> floor<00:01:06.720> which<00:01:06.960> made

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

had previously lived before we move down
to<00:03:20.579> Buckinghamshire<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.390> we<00:03:21.480> came<00:03:21.630> into

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
to Buckinghamshire so we came into

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.039 
to Buckinghamshire so we came into
Euston<00:03:22.079> on<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> train<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.069> then<00:03:23.130> went<00:03:23.400> down

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
Euston on the train and then went down

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.830 
onto the underground station at Euston
and<00:03:28.079> got<00:03:28.440> into<00:03:28.650> one<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.860> these<00:03:28.980> red<00:03:29.400> trains

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
and got into one of these red trains

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.080 
and got into one of these red trains
that<00:03:30.840> pulled<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.319> on<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.430> Sunday<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.790> think<00:03:32.880> it

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
that pulled in on the Sunday I think it

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.670 
that pulled in on the Sunday I think it
must<00:03:33.239> have<00:03:33.299> been<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.660> wasn't<00:03:33.870> potato<00:03:34.110> busy

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
must have been so it wasn't potato busy

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.449 
must have been so it wasn't potato busy
well<00:03:35.099> my<00:03:35.250> father<00:03:35.989> who<00:03:36.989> hadn't<00:03:37.620> grown<00:03:38.190> up<00:03:38.340> in

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
well my father who hadn't grown up in

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.979 
well my father who hadn't grown up in
London<00:03:38.760> although<00:03:38.940> wouldn't<00:03:39.450> have<00:03:39.540> traveled

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
London although wouldn't have traveled

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.509 
London although wouldn't have traveled
regularly<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.560> tube<00:03:40.739> but<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:40.950> think<00:03:41.130> they

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
regularly on the tube but I think they

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.880 
regularly on the tube but I think they
lived<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.819> mission<00:03:42.120> which<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:43.110> little<00:03:43.769> way<00:03:43.860> from

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
lived a mission which a little way from

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
lived a mission which a little way from
Morden

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
Morden

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.460 
Morden
but<00:03:45.450> he<00:03:45.599> must<00:03:45.989> have<00:03:46.049> travelled<00:03:46.319> on<00:03:46.380> the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
but he must have travelled on the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.410 
but he must have travelled on the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
duplication told me lay that the people

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.360 
duplication told me lay that the people
that<00:03:51.569> hung<00:03:52.260> onto<00:03:52.440> these<00:03:52.709> things<00:03:53.069> during<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
that hung onto these things during the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.129 
that hung onto these things during the
Russia<00:03:53.549> are<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.850> standing<00:03:54.269> passengers<00:03:54.450> were

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
Russia are the standing passengers were

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.250 
Russia are the standing passengers were
called<00:03:55.410> strap<00:03:56.160> hangers<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.870> for<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> long<00:03:58.049> time

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
called strap hangers and for a long time

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.470 
called strap hangers and for a long time
I<00:03:58.470> actually<00:03:58.859> thought<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.489> grab<00:03:59.730> handles<00:04:00.150> that

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
I actually thought the grab handles that

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.960 
I actually thought the grab handles that
are<00:04:00.859> officially<00:04:01.859> called<00:04:02.010> grab<00:04:02.250> handles<00:04:02.819> were

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
are officially called grab handles were

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.629 
are officially called grab handles were
called<00:04:03.180> strap<00:04:03.480> hangers<00:04:03.840> but<00:04:04.709> these<00:04:05.310> things

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
called strap hangers but these things

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.160 
called strap hangers but these things
were<00:04:05.790> actually<00:04:05.940> good<00:04:06.269> strapping<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.870> this

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
were actually good strapping is this

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.050 
were actually good strapping is this
they're<00:04:07.380> not<00:04:07.590> they<00:04:08.040> grab<00:04:08.700> handles

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
they're not they grab handles

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.740 
they're not they grab handles
efficiently<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.430> understand<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.420> they

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
efficiently and I understand that they

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.780 
efficiently and I understand that they
in<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.319> design<00:04:13.650> went<00:04:13.980> back<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.310> gear<00:04:14.549> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
in the design went back to gear the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.430 
in the design went back to gear the
abysm<00:04:15.030> cars<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.299> company<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.690> made<00:04:18.989> the

abysm cars so the company that made the
knots<00:04:19.709> on<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.070> end<00:04:20.549> we're<00:04:20.970> actually<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.359> same

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
knots on the end we're actually the same

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.540 
knots on the end we're actually the same
company<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.019> made<00:04:22.200> knobs<00:04:22.919> on<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.340> kid
