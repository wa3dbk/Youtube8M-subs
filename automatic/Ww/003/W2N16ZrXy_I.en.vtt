finished<00:00:06.089> result<00:00:06.420> will<00:00:06.600> look<00:00:06.629> something<00:00:06.899> like

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
finished result will look something like

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.040 
finished result will look something like
this<00:00:07.849> now<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.910> can<00:00:09.059> shoot<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.780> can<00:00:09.929> do

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
this now you can shoot this you can do

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.660 
this now you can shoot this you can do
whatever<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.440> want<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.889> can<00:00:11.040> use<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.400> for<00:00:11.610> a

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
whatever you want you can use it for a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.950 
whatever you want you can use it for a
lot<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.820> different<00:00:11.910> things<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.780> what's

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
lot of different things but what's

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.629 
lot of different things but what's
happening<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> little<00:00:13.950> plane<00:00:14.250> here

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
happening is we have a little plane here

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.849 
happening is we have a little plane here
that<00:00:15.480> has<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.929> texture<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> it's

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
that has this texture on it and it's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.070 
that has this texture on it and it's
going<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.039> track<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.520> camera<00:00:17.940> always<00:00:18.359> so

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
going to track to the camera always so

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.910 
going to track to the camera always so
it<00:00:19.199> looks<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.710> gives<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.220> glow<00:00:20.460> effect

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
it looks like it gives it a glow effect

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.500 
it looks like it gives it a glow effect
so<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.430> how<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> works<00:00:24.029> now<00:00:24.269> I'm<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
so that's how it works now I'm going to

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.810 
so that's how it works now I'm going to
teach<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.660> how<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.640> open<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.789> new

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
teach you how to do it open up a new

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.310 
teach you how to do it open up a new
blender<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.390> don't<00:00:27.599> want<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> cube<00:00:28.109> because

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
blender I don't want the cube because

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.410 
blender I don't want the cube because
that<00:00:28.859> just<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:29.250> lame<00:00:31.099> UV<00:00:32.099> sphere<00:00:32.160> set<00:00:33.149> smooth

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that just be lame UV sphere set smooth

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.360 
that just be lame UV sphere set smooth
give<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> texture<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> want<00:00:35.750> blues<00:00:36.750> cool

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
give it a texture you want blues cool

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.310 
give it a texture you want blues cool
now<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.239> effects<00:00:39.540> sake<00:00:39.840> I'm<00:00:40.079> gonna<00:00:40.230> make

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
now just for effects sake I'm gonna make

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.729 
now just for effects sake I'm gonna make
it<00:00:40.469> z<00:00:40.980> transparency<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.500> shadeless<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it z transparency and shadeless and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.240 
it z transparency and shadeless and
let's<00:00:44.370> go<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.850> glsl<00:00:45.629> s4<00:00:45.930> way<00:00:46.559> better<00:00:46.829> shadows

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
let's go into glsl s4 way better shadows

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.069 
let's go into glsl s4 way better shadows
in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> game<00:00:47.550> engine<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.690> press<00:00:48.899> p

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
in the game engine now if you press p

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.959 
in the game engine now if you press p
right<00:00:49.260> now<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> look<00:00:50.579> crap

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
right now it's going to look crap

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.670 
right now it's going to look crap
because<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.539> don't<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.260> texture

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
because we don't have it in texture

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
because we don't have it in texture
Dakota<00:00:53.160> textured<00:00:53.550> node<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:53.910> press<00:00:54.120> P

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
Dakota textured node and then press P

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
Dakota textured node and then press P
and<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.379> look<00:00:55.469> something<00:00:55.500> like

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and it's going to look something like

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.130 
and it's going to look something like
that<00:00:56.270> I'm<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> turn<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> half<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that I'm just going to turn the half it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 
that I'm just going to turn the half it
down<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.620> bit<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.579> effects<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.120> later

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
down a little bit for effects for later

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.580 
down a little bit for effects for later
you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.690> kind<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.960> see<00:01:01.170> through<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.410> now

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you can kind of see through it now

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.460 
you can kind of see through it now
because<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.039> did<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:03.080> but<00:01:04.080> now<00:01:04.199> we're<00:01:04.379> going

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
because I did that but now we're going

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.609 
because I did that but now we're going
to<00:01:04.530> add<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.949> plane<00:01:05.400> hide<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.810> fall

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to add a plane hide this little fall

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.850 
to add a plane hide this little fall
with<00:01:08.100> H<00:01:08.420> selecting<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.630> press<00:01:09.810> H<00:01:10.020> add<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
with H selecting it then press H add a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.320 
with H selecting it then press H add a
new<00:01:11.100> cube<00:01:11.400> add<00:01:11.640> textures<00:01:12.360> add<00:01:13.549> UV<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.790> then

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
new cube add textures add UV and then

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.050 
new cube add textures add UV and then
you<00:01:15.840> VTE<00:01:16.680> X<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.430> we're<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> map<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
you VTE X and then we're going to map to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.560 
you VTE X and then we're going to map to
alpha<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.040> we're<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> turn<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.570> Z

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
alpha and then we're going to turn on Z

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.969 
alpha and then we're going to turn on Z
transparency<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.350> turn<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.830> way

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
transparency and turn it all the way

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
transparency and turn it all the way
down<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:26.549> we're<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> turn<00:01:28.110> on

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
down and then we're going to turn on

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.109 
down and then we're going to turn on
others<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:30.770> okay<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.009> now<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.610> need<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.790> an

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
others do okay and now all we need is an

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.130 
others do okay and now all we need is an
image<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:34.979> need<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.130> unwrap<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.579> i<00:01:36.140> right

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
image and we need to unwrap it i right

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.990 
image and we need to unwrap it i right
clicked<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:38.040> press<00:01:38.220> split<00:01:38.520> area<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
clicked and then press split area and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300 
clicked and then press split area and
then<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.150> clicked<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.619> need<00:01:40.710> an<00:01:40.950> image

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
then I clicked and now we need an image

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
then I clicked and now we need an image
to<00:01:41.700> make<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:41.970> thing<00:01:42.180> look<00:01:42.240> good<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.840> made<00:01:43.439> this

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
to make this thing look good I made this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.289 
to make this thing look good I made this
in<00:01:43.860> GIMP<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.549> we're<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.790> going<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> start

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
in GIMP but we're just going to start

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.260 
in GIMP but we're just going to start
over<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.380> did<00:01:46.970> there's<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
over so you can see what I did there's a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.030 
over so you can see what I did there's a
million<00:01:48.720> different<00:01:48.869> ways<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:49.680> in

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
million different ways to do this but in

no excuse me add alpha channel delete

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.320 
no excuse me add alpha channel delete
and<00:02:17.620> now<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.460> do<00:02:18.550> whatever<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.940> want<00:02:19.090> I

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
and now you can do whatever you want I

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.120 
and now you can do whatever you want I
just<00:02:19.510> chose<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> brush<00:02:20.080> chose<00:02:20.590> something<00:02:21.010> like

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
just chose a brush chose something like

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.230 
just chose a brush chose something like
this<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.670> then<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.750> drew<00:02:23.320> like<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.240> I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
this and then I drew like that and I

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.270 
this and then I drew like that and I
guess<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:25.600> could<00:02:25.750> just<00:02:25.780> crop<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.260> down<00:02:26.440> oh<00:02:29.280> is

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
guess we could just crop it down oh is

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.620 
guess we could just crop it down oh is
that<00:02:30.520> that's<00:02:30.820> easy<00:02:31.120> wrong<00:02:31.420> tool<00:02:31.890> crap<00:02:33.630> there

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
that that's easy wrong tool crap there

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.570 
that that's easy wrong tool crap there
we<00:02:34.720> go<00:02:34.840> right<00:02:35.800> tool<00:02:36.209> sighs<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.450> enter<00:02:38.580> file

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
we go right tool sighs it enter file

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.510 
we go right tool sighs it enter file
save<00:02:40.570> as<00:02:41.490> GL<00:02:42.490> 0<00:02:42.520> W<00:02:43.290> PNG<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.709> ping<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.100> important

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
save as GL 0 W PNG the ping is important

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.070 
save as GL 0 W PNG the ping is important
because<00:02:45.610> that's<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.970> file<00:02:46.150> type<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.810> saves

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
because that's a file type and it saves

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.620 
because that's a file type and it saves
the<00:02:47.350> Alpha<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.340> can<00:02:48.489> see<00:02:48.640> through<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:48.940> I'm

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
the Alpha so you can see through it I'm

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.000 
the Alpha so you can see through it I'm
going<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.780> save<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:50.050> my<00:02:50.110> desktop<00:02:50.170> save

it's<00:03:57.390> just<00:03:57.570> always<00:03:57.870> in<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.230> file<00:03:58.410> okay<00:03:58.740> so<00:03:59.190> now

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
it's just always in the file okay so now

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.140 
it's just always in the file okay so now
it's<00:03:59.430> going<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.640> show<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.710> press<00:04:01.710> p

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
that's a little bit too small we're

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.200 
that's a little bit too small we're
going<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.230> size<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.650> up<00:04:04.740> press<00:04:05.220> P<00:04:05.490> and<00:04:05.760> now

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
going to size it up press P and now

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.250 
going to size it up press P and now
let's<00:04:06.360> kind<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.570> got<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.720> glow<00:04:06.900> effects<00:04:07.170> so

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
let's kind of got a glow effects so

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.960 
let's kind of got a glow effects so
we're<00:04:07.320> going<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.530> go<00:04:07.650> 0<00:04:08.070> into<00:04:08.370> your<00:04:08.460> camera<00:04:08.820> and

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
we're going to go 0 into your camera and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.650 
we're going to go 0 into your camera and
then<00:04:09.330> we're<00:04:09.480> going<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.630> add<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:11.060> all<00:04:12.060> this<00:04:12.390> stuff

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
then we're going to add a all this stuff

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.690 
then we're going to add a all this stuff
sensor<00:04:13.110> actuator<00:04:13.620> controller<00:04:14.660> always<00:04:16.700> hooked

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
sensor actuator controller always hooked

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.450 
sensor actuator controller always hooked
up<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.270> an<00:04:18.450> edit<00:04:18.720> object<00:04:19.200> track<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.920> camera

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
up to an edit object track to camera

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.250 
up to an edit object track to camera
okay<00:04:23.460> when<00:04:23.910> an<00:04:24.030> object<00:04:24.150> tracks<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.990> tracks

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
okay when an object tracks it tracks

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.920 
okay when an object tracks it tracks
with<00:04:25.410> as<00:04:25.530> Y<00:04:25.770> axis<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.820> for<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.420> would<00:04:27.570> play

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
with as Y axis so for if we would play

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.750 
with as Y axis so for if we would play
right<00:04:28.200> now<00:04:28.230> at<00:04:28.620> track<00:04:28.860> with<00:04:29.010> its<00:04:29.130> y<00:04:29.220> axis<00:04:29.610> and

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
right now at track with its y axis and

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.030 
right now at track with its y axis and
you'd<00:04:29.880> barely<00:04:30.180> see<00:04:30.450> anything<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:31.140> we<00:04:31.830> need<00:04:31.950> to

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
you'd barely see anything I we need to

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.390 
you'd barely see anything I we need to
do<00:04:32.160> 3d<00:04:32.580> too<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.360> wouldn't<00:04:33.690> even<00:04:33.750> see<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.400> so

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
do 3d too so you wouldn't even see it so

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.370 
do 3d too so you wouldn't even see it so
now<00:04:35.520> what<00:04:35.640> we<00:04:35.730> need<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.970> do<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:36.360> rotate<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.290> on

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
now what we need to do is rotate it on

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.450 
now what we need to do is rotate it on
its<00:04:37.530> x-axis<00:04:38.190> 90<00:04:39.110> rotated<00:04:40.110> on<00:04:40.230> its<00:04:40.380> z<00:04:40.560> axis<00:04:40.950> 180

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
its x-axis 90 rotated on its z axis 180

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.120 
its x-axis 90 rotated on its z axis 180
and<00:04:41.760> then<00:04:42.660> press<00:04:42.960> p<00:04:43.170> and<00:04:43.380> there<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.950> go<00:04:43.980> you

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
and then press p and there you go you

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.750 
and then press p and there you go you
have<00:04:44.310> your<00:04:44.580> glowing<00:04:44.790> effect<00:04:45.120> um<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:46.530> can<00:04:46.760> make

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
have your glowing effect um you can make

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.850 
have your glowing effect um you can make
this<00:04:47.910> ball<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.630> don't<00:04:48.780> have<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.140> have<00:04:49.290> any<00:04:49.320> Z

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
this ball you don't have to have any Z

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.910 
this ball you don't have to have any Z
transparency<00:04:50.700> or<00:04:50.730> anything<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:52.620> can<00:04:52.740> have

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
the Alpha all the way up you can just

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.570 
the Alpha all the way up you can just
have<00:04:54.960> just<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:55.650> glowing<00:04:56.010> ball<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:56.400> don't<00:04:56.520> even

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580

have<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.880> have<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.270> shadeless<00:04:57.540> that<00:04:58.200> just

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
have to have the shadeless that just

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.440 
have to have the shadeless that just
gives<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.800> good<00:04:59.430> effect<00:04:59.760> because<00:05:00.120> why<00:05:00.270> would

just make sure to parent this to the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.050 
just make sure to parent this to the
ball<00:05:16.770> so<00:05:17.070> when<00:05:17.160> you<00:05:17.250> move<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.520> ball<00:05:17.700> the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
ball so when you move the ball the

Aaron's control p so when you move the
ball<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:25.490> actual<00:05:26.490> texture<00:05:26.820> moves<00:05:27.060> with<00:05:27.180> it

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
ball the actual texture moves with it

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.290 
ball the actual texture moves with it
too<00:05:27.620> so<00:05:28.620> thanks<00:05:29.520> for<00:05:29.580> watching<00:05:29.910> my<00:05:30.030> video
