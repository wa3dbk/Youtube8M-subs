 Hi , how are you? What's up? 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.390
 It was so in the last days there with these 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.099
 lives that we are presenting to the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.870
 you 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.590
 about this Sunday series the graphic in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.150
 House 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.040
 today we will present the second 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.020
 video and today we will show a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.850
 very cool thing you'll like 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.400
 The video that I'm going to present today 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.460
 talks about a customer need 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.980
 had i been doing a fair in sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.590
 a box to put letter to logo 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.230
 He looks nice, I'm going back, I'm showing. 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.780
 here now for you if you want the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.940
 original drawing he needed 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.200
 and then I got the challenge because I 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.090
 I wanted to make this video for you 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 show how could make letter box 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.290
 using this for yourself 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.129
 styrofoam the letter k is usually used in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.809
 was made of metallic material and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.340
 is also made of acrylic sometimes the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.750
 people use a lot of wood today 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.629
 assaults that are emerging in the market 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.800
 But we decided to make a 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.289
 Different way I used pvc styrofoam 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.760
 the combination was nice was light gave 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.409
 site because the person needed in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.170
 Paul, we decided to ride and 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.030
 present it there in that video 2 that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 We will now introduce you to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.600
 is from my series in the home graphics 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 good first let's go to the materials 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.619
 necessary for you to do a study 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.900
 does not mean that you have to 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.640
 do but it's just for you to know what it was 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.860
 used 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.050
 Let's go to the materials two plates and this 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.570
 could 30 millimeters 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.900
 glue to styrofoam a pvc board of 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.030
 two millimeters blue and 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.600
 that has to do with our game 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.430
 that we made a ruler or dash and 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.340
 can be made of wood to learn these 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.390
 letters in the case in this case in the case we use 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.510
 an acrylic style stylus and vhb tapes 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.360
 for those who do not know that this tape was a 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.140
 which looks like a transparent window and 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.660
 serves to hang things sells 3m comes 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.090
 this material is also very resistant 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.009
 this material 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.380
 good c'mon the good first tutorial 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.869
 we have to stick the sticker on the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.390
 pvc and this you can follow this 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.959
 video we did recently leaving 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.739
 here the link after using the stylus 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.209
 and we cut vv pvc very carefully 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.040
 not to cut your finger 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.140
 Ideally, you should force the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.620
 cut in vc first make a juice in 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.239
 plate as if it were a guide for later 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.640
 pressing this milk for real is the 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.560
 Poor thing could be that if you 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.360
 Direct press by the name of 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.300
 exactly the path you want 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.519
 causing great accuracy and not so 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.780
 nice 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.390
 there are machines that make this cut 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.070
 as is the case of discharge that does this 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.430
 electronically using a drill bit 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.470
 adaptation to cut the material more 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.420
 So we're talking about doing this. 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.610
 manually that is for you to use 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.490
 would save this money and also 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.160
 learn how the process works 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.709
 after remembering the letters cuba without going 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.180
 now the home and if we lose the body that 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.540
 is what will form the letter our 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.940
 Canjica using now may oppose priest 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.280
 benzing bag - port apply pvc 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.520
 on top of the body 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.200
 It's going to take a little while before that sex. 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.190
 after dry but our next step 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.370
 is not easy it will be cutting the doctor 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.319
 your surplus using the pvc board 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.320
 which was previously cut as 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.209
 guide uses a thinner stylus to 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.250
 can remember the curves perfectly 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.560
 in this case you can also use the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.380
 computer tells the people coming in 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.970
 stationery but will have to have a 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.220
 certain ability to use this type of 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.010
 computer man team is not so simple 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.959
 how much seems 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.090
 after that which generated all the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.190
 surplus power and language 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.410
 previously what we learn to cut 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.269
 once and now we will make a small 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.120
 camp on the sides 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.810
 this path would be a break in the case 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.239
 we will use the clinic paint when painting 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.709
 the sides in the same predominant color 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.690
 that material you leave material 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.420
 more harmonious taking that part 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.489
 development bank 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.739
 using the piece now just assemble the piece 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.889
 the ruler in the region where he spoke with 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.450
 acrylic of Frida was already at home 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.610
 very technical but you can use 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.950
 way the metal 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.930
 the letters e and the logo a formal one 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.050
 directions and image that you have 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.440
 planned and put the head in place 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.919
 be exposed we put and now people 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.590
 will present these photos to you from 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.180
 with the piece already installed and you 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.940
 realizes that it has an entire background 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.130
 painted yellow with the goalkeeper who was 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.220
 It was also designed that the 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.750
 picture of a village with printed canvas that 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.919
 was stapled in this picture to form 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.620
 drawing 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:01.660
 Then you see that Lyon is in the 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.380
 face-to-face mounted good I think it is 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.150
 that 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.120
 He gave it to get an idea of how you can 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.970
 make this rate using simple material 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.760
 as an example by relying on this idea 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.490
 you can also test with others 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:20.190
 materials such as formica wood foam 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.190
 end paper use your creativity
