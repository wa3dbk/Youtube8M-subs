00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.510
 we are with this belisario at the conference you are sure of the public 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.590
 administrations after brunette guidelines 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.319
 then read the transparency lawn 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.779
 dessi disability skills 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.929
 such a point blank question as a city cyst 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.650
 November in 2010 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.110
 around 2010 are one of the watch service sites among are not sites 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.860
 self-referentiality are not sites in which they can afford not to have 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.819
 a strategy 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.090
 so if until today 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.000
 we have discounted the defects that they are. spontaneity and the prevalence of 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.929
 showcase sites 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.899
 from today and tomorrow tickets to brunette there the way that I betrayed my wife of 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.339
 guide change gear seems to me the other towards sites that we have future transparency 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:47.850
 which is the public administration 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.480
 i effective way 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.409
 B series 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.479
 allow the citizen to interact with the administration and the wine to enjoy 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.969
 of services therefore city demon host not the self-referential information that 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.909
 interest only the administration has never satiated must put 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.640
 in the shoes of the citizen he must ask himself things the city does not want to find on 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.290
 place 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.560
 spy especially the citizen putizza of the ueber site 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.110
 hamelin replacing the traditional door thus gaining 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.780
 in addition to efficiency, it also improves the quality of life 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.650
 of the community 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.590
 stress can positive putting will be done a good job well stress 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.890
 negative there is something that needs to be reviewed and guidelines are the occasion 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.970
 to do it 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.620
 if the example before that 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.280
 net rate in very mykonos fabric speak of certified e-mail 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.000
 echo - some as a registered letter 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.310
 is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.909
 that came to you though 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.230
 also by fax 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.810
 and this is a mad simplification or even what we are about 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.920
 that is, speaking 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.690
 sis also the telematic services are 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.010
 still normative - regulatory 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.990
 valid pros continue to send the fax because 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.790
 it is a cultural problem we grew up with the paper and then fairy 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.990
 do security 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.920
 always make this a public go or that I am public 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.780
 administration to write to me at the address pec as it is the law gives me 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.070
 law is a right for citizens to ask administrations to have 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.389
 reports apologize internal super blood 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.389
 listening to this administration for this cultural problem 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.830
 he thought I should send the same communication as well as attack 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.660
 also by fax and as a fax 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.860
 na is the physical the cartoccio ds greater security 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.130
 it is only because of a digital cultural problem today and the laws that regulate it 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.889
 they give the same guarantees of reliability 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.229
 certainty 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.399
 that from the carpaccio on the contrary if possible they were more so there is no more 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.699
 need the paper above all of the citizen on the foot 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:40.579
 last question aladdin lawn. of the awareness that one must have in the book 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:41.519
 digital 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.250
 the regulations are not lacking only 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.760
 there are none in the and we had also talked about 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.169
 in conference proceedings 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.939
 of the Western intentions are certainly good then up 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.299
 according to you, your intention will be your intention 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.440
 which we will succeed in the next n years 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.619
 really digitize this promise 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.950
 they hit a vignette 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.110
 sail - said reforms are needed for this country 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.349
 mf another character answered 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.349
 there is also a need for a country for these reforms in the sense that in the end 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.259
 laws are made to be applied if they remain on paper 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.159
 in administrations don't apply the end we'll talk about sample of 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.689
 an innovation that does not exist 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.309
 my obviously this is not to say that lg are the best possible of i am 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:26.070
 attempt 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.450
 surely perfectible then is the hope that this is 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.559
 administrations the uses do not read apply them 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.369
 emma and then confronting the citizens they understand what they don't 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:39.749
 it works and tell me for example they suggest to the minister that Mary is ironing 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.499
 the next guidelines those for 2011 this is one thing not 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:46.059
 work with a bottom-up mechanism you can write better laws 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.619
 via learned also I cry go on current date 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:53.779
 but it was penalized manifest I really propose on speaking this 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:54.529
 what that 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:55.400
 king 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.999
 it is certainly a sort of combustion, whether cultural or technological 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:05.240
 that for andra I imagine the Latin ride of the gelmini 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.729
 you just have to hope for a document 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:09.890
 the idea is this 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.890
 with a series of people brands 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.780
 working in this sector we have developed a manifesto for the open 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.670
 housekeeper who can read acts from the site www.datacol.it 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.449
 what is it? 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.580
 we have bern given that in the rest of the world naceri alatri e is affirming itself 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.490
 of the open government. open gorman which means the administration uses the 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.550
 technologies the new way to be open to the community 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.500
 say everything that gives all the data relating to productivity there 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.150
 At the same time, feedback to proposals should be opened to citizens 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.319
 not as subjects but as collaborators as partners as partners to me this thing 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.650
 it's going all over the world 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.370
 the year after the obama managerial affirmation of a year ago of 8 December of 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.030
 2009 from England to Greece from Iceland to Brazil to Lithuania 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.449
 warmed up, the countries that don't hit your new one have multiplied 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.469
 model this new Italian administrative paradigm 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.410
 I am absent except for some examples like the Piedmont region 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.879
 www. data. piemonte.it 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.120
 or data. istat.it between these two isolated examples 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.370
 there is no organic strategy so we tried to write 10 from the bottom up 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.599
 Simple principles clearly accessibility 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.169
 and that they served to make everyone understand the city administration why it 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.500
 I take to Vernante a challenge that is worth facing 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.140
 perna is obviously only the first to make the poster. we've received 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.640
 hundreds of comments mr we go to experienced manifestation of interest ram 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.310
 by many subjects there will be a phase 2 phase 2 will be from the bottom 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.100
 to try to free some public data nl to make contests for the 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.830
 implementation of applications 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.599
 so that they show that it is a model that works because they are gods 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.360
 low-income citizens with few resources can make it work let alone 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.189
 which can be concrete benefits of improving efficiency 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.259
 administrative and quality of life improvement for citizens 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.629
 can reach if the administration had 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.889
 national perspective 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.240
 is the hope is that in a year maybe we are here and do not pay more than 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.460
 www.datacol.it but let's talk about www. date. goco.it that is a sidi portal 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.360
 in Italian institutional of open beta hooker or john nutrono pro
