your fish they're much much smaller in
it<00:03:08.590> but<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.489> probably<00:03:09.970> avoid<00:03:10.359> neon<00:03:10.900> sized<00:03:11.280> fish

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280

another<00:03:17.500> thing<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:18.870> keep<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:19.959> mind<00:03:20.019> about

another thing to keep in mind about

another thing to keep in mind about
snakeskin<00:03:20.769> graeme<00:03:21.069> is<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.639> it's<00:03:21.790> not<00:03:21.970> really

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
snakeskin graeme is that it's not really

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.599 
snakeskin graeme is that it's not really
that<00:03:24.000> common<00:03:25.000> it's<00:03:25.810> not<00:03:26.019> rare<00:03:26.620> either<00:03:26.949> so<00:03:27.430> it's

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
that common it's not rare either so it's

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.670 
that common it's not rare either so it's
a<00:03:27.669> moderately<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.660> guess<00:03:29.260> it's<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:29.500> an

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
a moderately I guess it's just an

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.009 
a moderately I guess it's just an
infrequently<00:03:30.280> seen<00:03:30.549> fish<00:03:30.819> cuz<00:03:31.599> I<00:03:31.720> had<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.870> lot

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
infrequently seen fish cuz I had a lot

from games and I'll hold this guy so

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.229 
from games and I'll hold this guy so
yeah<00:03:36.970> not<00:03:37.299> much<00:03:38.909> differences<00:03:39.909> between<00:03:40.120> a

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
yeah not much differences between a

snake skin Grammy and the other members
are<00:03:42.159> genus<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:43.720> uh<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.349> biggest<00:03:44.849> followed

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
are genus it's uh the biggest followed

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.610 
are genus it's uh the biggest followed

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.649 
spod Grammy and the Pearl and but it's
probably<00:03:51.310> I'd<00:03:51.699> say<00:03:51.760> it's<00:03:52.090> probably<00:03:52.180> slightly

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
probably I'd say it's probably slightly

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.789 
probably I'd say it's probably slightly
more<00:03:52.930> aggressive<00:03:53.379> than<00:03:53.470> Pearl<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:55.620> lot<00:03:56.620> more

more aggressive than Pearl a lot more

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.469
