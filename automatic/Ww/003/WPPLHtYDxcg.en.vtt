I've<00:02:46.140> got<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.470> loop<00:02:46.739> that's<00:02:46.920> adjustable<00:02:47.870> so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
I've got this loop that's adjustable so

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.630 
I've got this loop that's adjustable so
we've<00:02:49.019> got<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.500> we're<00:02:49.739> going<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:49.890> chain<00:02:50.220> 2

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
we've got that we're going to chain 2

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.910 
we've got that we're going to chain 2
and<00:02:52.160> we're<00:02:53.160> going<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.310> begin<00:02:53.730> with<00:02:54.590> going<00:02:55.590> into

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and we're going to begin with going into

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.150 
and we're going to begin with going into
each<00:02:56.280> stitch<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:58.100> pulling<00:02:59.100> up<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.340> loop

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.320 

and<00:03:05.160> you're<00:03:05.280> gonna<00:03:05.400> pull<00:03:05.580> them<00:03:05.700> up<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:05.940> tall<00:03:06.180> as

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
and you're gonna pull them up as tall as

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.830 
and you're gonna pull them up as tall as
you<00:03:06.360> can<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:08.459> you're<00:03:08.610> leaving<00:03:09.090> all<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.630> loops

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
you can and you're leaving all the loops

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.790 
you can and you're leaving all the loops
on<00:03:10.170> your<00:03:10.200> hook<00:03:12.200> we're<00:03:13.200> going<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.410> work<00:03:13.590> our<00:03:13.770> way

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
on your hook we're going to work our way

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:24.780 
on your hook we're going to work our way
all<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.550> way<00:03:14.580> around

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.390 

you<00:03:25.360> can<00:03:25.540> kind<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.870> crunch<00:03:26.200> your<00:03:26.469> slipper

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.250 

so<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:32.269> easier<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.750> hold<00:03:32.870> on<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.170> these

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
so that it's easier to hold on to these

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.550 
so that it's easier to hold on to these
loops<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:38.150> keep<00:03:38.360> going<00:03:38.390> around<00:03:38.959> till<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:39.319> get

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
loops so keep going around till you get

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:49.320 
loops so keep going around till you get
to<00:03:39.680> your<00:03:39.769> marker

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.480 

and<00:03:49.930> now<00:03:50.080> we're<00:03:50.230> going<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.380> wrap<00:03:50.620> our<00:03:50.890> yarn<00:03:50.950> and

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
and now we're going to wrap our yarn and

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.100 
and now we're going to wrap our yarn and
we're<00:03:51.760> going<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:51.910> pull<00:03:52.150> through<00:03:52.360> all<00:03:52.660> the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
we're going to pull through all the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:01.059 
we're going to pull through all the
loops<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.560> our<00:03:53.590> hook

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.550 

now<00:04:01.640> pull<00:04:01.969> up<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.390> pretty<00:04:02.959> high<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:03.379> that<00:04:03.500> you

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
now pull up that pretty high so that you

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.839 
now pull up that pretty high so that you
don't<00:04:03.769> lose<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.189> you<00:04:04.280> definitely<00:04:04.610> don't<00:04:04.670> want

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
don't lose it you definitely don't want

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.880 
don't lose it you definitely don't want
that<00:04:04.879> to<00:04:05.000> come<00:04:05.239> out<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.930> cut<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.709> yarn<00:04:06.950> off

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
that to come out and cut the yarn off

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.319 
that to come out and cut the yarn off
we're<00:04:09.890> gonna<00:04:09.980> go<00:04:10.250> back<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.849> tighten<00:04:11.090> that

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
we're gonna go back and tighten that

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:18.060 
we're gonna go back and tighten that
down<00:04:15.280> grab<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:16.549> yarn<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.389> pull<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:17.780> through

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
down grab this yarn and pull it through

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.200 
down grab this yarn and pull it through
and<00:04:19.359> pulling<00:04:20.359> tightly<00:04:20.870> down<00:04:21.520> on<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.759> stitch

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
and pulling tightly down on that stitch

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.999 
and pulling tightly down on that stitch
you<00:04:23.630> can<00:04:23.780> take<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.050> stitch<00:04:24.350> marker<00:04:24.770> out<00:04:24.830> if

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
you can take this stitch marker out if

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.450 
you can take this stitch marker out if
it's<00:04:25.130> getting<00:04:25.430> in<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.550> way

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
it's getting in the way

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.760 
it's getting in the way
tightening<00:04:28.460> down<00:04:28.669> on<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.120> shaping<00:04:29.960> that

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.830 

pulling<00:04:33.770> down<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.340> you<00:04:34.460> can<00:04:34.669> make<00:04:35.509> the<00:04:35.660> loop

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
pulling down that you can make the loop

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.379 
pulling down that you can make the loop
larger<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.889> leave<00:04:37.160> kind<00:04:37.910> of<00:04:38.000> like<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.150> little

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
larger and leave kind of like a little

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.460 
larger and leave kind of like a little
peep<00:04:38.960> toe<00:04:39.259> there<00:04:40.160> if<00:04:41.030> you'd<00:04:41.270> like<00:04:41.570> just<00:04:42.229> make

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
peep toe there if you'd like just make

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.200 
peep toe there if you'd like just make
sure<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.710> do<00:04:42.860> them<00:04:42.979> consistently<00:04:43.759> this<00:04:44.030> one

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.050 
sure you do them consistently this one
I've<00:04:44.330> got<00:04:44.360> closed<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:48.490> make<00:04:49.490> sure<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:49.849> make

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
I've got closed so make sure you make

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.420 
I've got closed so make sure you make
them<00:04:50.300> match<00:04:50.539> and<00:04:51.470> then<00:04:51.770> I'm<00:04:51.860> gonna<00:04:51.979> pull<00:04:52.280> it

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
them match and then I'm gonna pull it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.879 
them match and then I'm gonna pull it
through<00:04:52.639> again<00:04:54.400> tightening<00:04:55.400> down<00:04:55.460> on<00:04:55.849> that

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
through again tightening down on that

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.670
