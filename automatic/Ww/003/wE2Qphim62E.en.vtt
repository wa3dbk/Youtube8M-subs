wanted<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.399> do<00:02:00.700> was<00:02:01.270> create<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.959> world<00:02:02.379> that<00:02:03.369> was

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
wanted to do was create a world that was

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.330 
wanted to do was create a world that was
just<00:02:03.970> as<00:02:04.119> complex<00:02:04.599> as<00:02:04.959> what's<00:02:05.679> going<00:02:06.009> on<00:02:06.160> in

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
just as complex as what's going on in

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.210 
just as complex as what's going on in
the<00:02:06.429> world<00:02:06.459> now<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.379> raises<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.890> same

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
the world now and that raises the same

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.940 
the world now and that raises the same
kind<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.819> ambiguous<00:02:10.479> moral<00:02:11.050> questions<00:02:11.530> and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
kind of ambiguous moral questions and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.880 
kind of ambiguous moral questions and
makes<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.760> wonder<00:02:13.030> about<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:14.500> difference

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
makes you wonder about the difference

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.160 
makes you wonder about the difference
between<00:02:14.980> good<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.700> evil<00:02:15.760> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
between good and evil and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.470 
between good and evil and
what<00:02:18.170> fear<00:02:18.470> does<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.890> people<00:02:19.150> I'm<00:02:20.150> frequently

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
what fear does to people I'm frequently

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.570 
what fear does to people I'm frequently
asked<00:02:20.930> who<00:02:21.020> my<00:02:21.140> favorite<00:02:21.320> fantasy<00:02:22.010> author<00:02:22.310> is

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
asked who my favorite fantasy author is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.850 
asked who my favorite fantasy author is
and<00:02:23.170> it's<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.290> very<00:02:24.320> difficult<00:02:24.650> question

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
and it's a very difficult question

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.900 
and it's a very difficult question
because<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.970> read<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.230> many<00:02:27.350> authors<00:02:27.910> growing

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
because I read so many authors growing

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.760 
because I read so many authors growing
up<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.210> all<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.510> them<00:02:29.660> have<00:02:29.870> had<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.080> major

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
up and all of them have had a major

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.670 
up and all of them have had a major
influence<00:02:31.160> on<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.750> first<00:02:32.990> book<00:02:33.320> without

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
influence on the the first book without

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.520 
influence on the the first book without
pictures<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.640> ever<00:02:34.790> read<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:36.200> wasn't

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
pictures that I ever read that wasn't

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.780 
pictures that I ever read that wasn't
assigned<00:02:37.130> by<00:02:37.370> school<00:02:37.640> was<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.240> hobbit<00:02:38.650> so

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
assigned by school was the hobbit so

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.220 
assigned by school was the hobbit so
obviously<00:02:40.790> I'm<00:02:41.000> very<00:02:41.270> rooted<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.750> traditional

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
obviously I'm very rooted in traditional

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.530 
obviously I'm very rooted in traditional
fantasy<00:02:42.460> from<00:02:43.460> there<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.670> read<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.060> lot<00:02:44.210> of<00:02:44.330> Terry

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
fantasy from there I read a lot of Terry

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.500 
fantasy from there I read a lot of Terry
Brooks<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.220> as<00:02:46.220> I've<00:02:46.460> said<00:02:46.490> Tara<00:02:47.330> books

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
Brooks and as I've said Tara books

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.530 
Brooks and as I've said Tara books
particularly<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.140> elfstones<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.620> Shannara

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
particularly the elfstones of Shannara

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.910 
particularly the elfstones of Shannara
set<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.690> groundwork<00:02:51.020> for<00:02:51.140> what<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.560> wanted<00:02:51.860> to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
set the groundwork for what I wanted to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.110 
set the groundwork for what I wanted to
do<00:02:52.190> in<00:02:52.490> writing<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.600> fantasy<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:55.430> also<00:02:55.610> I

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
do in writing and fantasy but also I

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.230 
do in writing and fantasy but also I
think<00:02:56.590> currently<00:02:57.590> george<00:02:58.220> RR<00:02:58.370> martin<00:02:58.820> is<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
think currently george RR martin is the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.190 
think currently george RR martin is the
author<00:02:59.600> whose<00:03:00.020> most<00:03:01.720> forced<00:03:02.720> me<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:02.990> raise<00:03:03.170> my

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
author whose most forced me to raise my

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.070 
author whose most forced me to raise my
game<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:04.010> writing<00:03:04.460> by<00:03:05.150> showing<00:03:05.600> me<00:03:05.720> just<00:03:05.960> how

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
game in writing by showing me just how

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.040 
game in writing by showing me just how
much<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.470> can<00:03:06.590> do<00:03:06.970> how<00:03:07.970> complex<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.690> can<00:03:08.870> get

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
much you can do how complex you can get

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.010 
much you can do how complex you can get
and<00:03:09.350> how<00:03:10.180> intricate<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.330> can<00:03:11.480> be<00:03:11.660> with<00:03:11.900> your

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
and how intricate you can be with your

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.620 
and how intricate you can be with your
characters<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.920> still<00:03:13.250> create<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.240> cohesive

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
characters and still create a cohesive

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.260 
characters and still create a cohesive
story<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.890> next<00:03:16.160> book<00:03:16.340> will<00:03:16.370> be<00:03:16.580> very

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
story the next book will be very

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.140 
story the next book will be very
different<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.840> lot<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:18.020> ways<00:03:19.030> perhaps<00:03:20.030> a

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
different in a lot of ways perhaps a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.950 
different in a lot of ways perhaps a
little<00:03:20.210> more<00:03:20.360> brutal<00:03:20.750> as<00:03:22.180> all<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.690> plans

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
little more brutal as all of the plans

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.980 
little more brutal as all of the plans
that<00:03:24.110> I've<00:03:24.290> laid<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:25.210> come<00:03:26.210> to<00:03:26.330> fruition<00:03:26.540> and

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
that I've laid have come to fruition and

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.290 
that I've laid have come to fruition and
now<00:03:27.370> there<00:03:28.370> will<00:03:28.460> be<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.580> clash<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:29.120> peoples<00:03:29.990> and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
now there will be a clash of peoples and

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.640 
now there will be a clash of peoples and
ideals<00:03:33.850> but<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.090> it's<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:36.080> promises<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.560> be

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
ideals but it's it's it promises to be

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.980 
ideals but it's it's it promises to be
very<00:03:36.710> exciting<00:03:37.220> i'm<00:03:37.340> in<00:03:38.240> some<00:03:38.480> ways<00:03:38.630> i'm<00:03:38.810> more

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
very exciting i'm in some ways i'm more

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.270 
very exciting i'm in some ways i'm more
excited<00:03:39.050> about<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.620> then<00:03:39.740> i<00:03:39.830> was<00:03:39.980> about<00:03:40.190> the

excited about it then i was about the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.560 
excited about it then i was about the
first<00:03:40.490> one<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:42.100> hopefully<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:44.150> readers<00:03:44.420> will
