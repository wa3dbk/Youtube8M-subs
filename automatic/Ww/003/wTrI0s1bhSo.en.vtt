know<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:40.040> I<00:00:41.040> nursed<00:00:41.520> an<00:00:41.700> xbox<00:00:42.030> 360

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
know like that and I nursed an xbox 360

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
know like that and I nursed an xbox 360
it<00:00:44.640> wasn't<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> true<00:00:45.660> 12<00:00:46.170> 1<00:00:46.289> pixel<00:00:46.620> display

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it wasn't a true 12 1 pixel display

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
it wasn't a true 12 1 pixel display
resolution<00:00:48.020> even<00:00:49.020> at<00:00:49.140> 1080p<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.780> mean<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
resolution even at 1080p so I mean it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.420 
resolution even at 1080p so I mean it
was<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.360> rows<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.230> rows<00:00:55.430> after

more pixels that are on the screen

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.590 
more pixels that are on the screen
that's<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> PlayStation<00:02:13.349> 3

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
that's the PlayStation 3

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.260 
that's the PlayStation 3
better<00:02:13.840> image<00:02:14.140> quality<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.520> xbox<00:02:15.820> 360

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
you know up up and down this way and

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.800 
you know up up and down this way and
sideways<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.920> way<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.000> was<00:04:07.120> like<00:04:07.270> this<00:04:07.750> is

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
sideways this way and I was like this is

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.680 
sideways this way and I was like this is
just<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.350> crappiest<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:10.060> this<00:04:10.300> is<00:04:10.450> not<00:04:10.660> true

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
just the crappiest that this is not true

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.570 
just the crappiest that this is not true
1<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.260> 1<00:04:11.410> pixel<00:04:11.650> resolution<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.280> could<00:04:12.430> totally

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
1 to 1 pixel resolution I could totally

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.580 
1 to 1 pixel resolution I could totally
tell<00:04:12.910> because<00:04:13.150> these<00:04:13.390> lines<00:04:13.750> are<00:04:14.020> everywhere

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
tell because these lines are everywhere

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.620 
tell because these lines are everywhere
and<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.890> just<00:04:15.070> sucks<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.760> then<00:04:16.299> I<00:04:16.330> look<00:04:16.450> at<00:04:16.510> the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
and it just sucks and then I look at the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.680 
and it just sucks and then I look at the
PlayStation<00:04:16.840> 3<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:18.480> there's<00:04:19.480> nothing

there's<00:04:20.109> no<00:04:20.230> lines<00:04:20.530> nothing<00:04:21.010> it's<00:04:21.310> true<00:04:21.549> one

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
there's no lines nothing it's true one

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.250 
there's no lines nothing it's true one
on<00:04:21.880> one<00:04:21.970> pixel<00:04:22.240> resolution<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.810> looked<00:04:23.080> very

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
on one pixel resolution I looked very

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.990 
on one pixel resolution I looked very

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
and I looked really close and it was

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.129 
and I looked really close and it was
true<00:04:36.340> when<00:04:36.520> one<00:04:36.760> pixel<00:04:37.030> resolution<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.870> dots

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
true when one pixel resolution the dots

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.110 
true when one pixel resolution the dots
were<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.530> tiny<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:38.919> so<00:04:39.040> small<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.580> can't<00:04:39.610> even
