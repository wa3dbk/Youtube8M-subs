let's check this out okay and we'll
leave<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.680> where<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.189> was<00:01:32.369> at<00:01:33.079> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.229> add

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
leave that where that was at you can add

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
leave that where that was at you can add
