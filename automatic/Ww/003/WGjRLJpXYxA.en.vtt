ladies love today gee this is a we drew

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.249 
ladies love today gee this is a we drew
a<00:00:09.789> simple<00:00:10.299> shift<00:00:10.509> so<00:00:10.660> that<00:00:10.690> you<00:00:10.900> could<00:00:11.049> focus

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:11.259 
a simple shift so that you could focus

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.369 
a simple shift so that you could focus
on<00:00:11.559> the<00:00:12.009> ocean<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:13.719> is<00:00:13.869> the<00:00:14.019> state<00:00:14.230> of<00:00:14.259> the

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379 
on the ocean this is the state of the

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.500 
on the ocean this is the state of the
art<00:00:14.589> of<00:00:14.799> ocean<00:00:15.400> simulation<00:00:16.030> is<00:00:16.150> a<00:00:16.179> software

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
art of ocean simulation is a software

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.919 
art of ocean simulation is a software
you<00:00:16.750> did<00:00:16.960> several<00:00:17.439> a<00:00:17.560> couple<00:00:17.830> years<00:00:18.039> ago<00:00:18.099> and

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:18.929 
you did several a couple years ago and

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.689 
you did several a couple years ago and
you<00:00:19.929> can<00:00:20.080> see<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:20.259> the<00:00:20.470> ocean<00:00:20.769> simulator<00:00:21.460> is

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
you can see that the ocean simulator is

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.999 
you can see that the ocean simulator is
free<00:00:22.090> you<00:00:22.720> know<00:00:22.839> most<00:00:23.019> of<00:00:23.259> most<00:00:23.619> of<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:23.769> waves

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
free you know most of most of the waves

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.179 
free you know most of most of the waves
are<00:00:24.189> relatively<00:00:24.670> consistent<00:00:25.919> there's<00:00:26.919> those

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
are relatively consistent there's those

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.939 
are relatively consistent there's those
there's<00:00:27.789> no<00:00:27.939> spray<00:00:28.449> there's<00:00:28.810> no<00:00:29.019> this<00:00:29.859> is

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
there's no spray there's no this is

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.290 
there's no spray there's no this is
about<00:00:30.070> as<00:00:30.249> far<00:00:30.429> as<00:00:30.490> we<00:00:30.669> can<00:00:30.789> go<00:00:30.849> with<00:00:31.179> it

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
about as far as we can go with it

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.540 
about as far as we can go with it
there's<00:00:31.509> no<00:00:31.630> spray<00:00:31.990> there's<00:00:32.169> no<00:00:32.320> foam<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:32.950> it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
there's no spray there's no foam and it

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.670 
there's no spray there's no foam and it
doesn't<00:00:33.850> it<00:00:34.059> doesn't<00:00:34.120> respond<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.170> win<00:00:35.379> it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
doesn't it doesn't respond to win it

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.590 
doesn't it doesn't respond to win it
doesn't<00:00:35.920> really<00:00:35.980> matter<00:00:36.250> what<00:00:36.579> wind<00:00:37.149> blows<00:00:37.390> up

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
doesn't really matter what wind blows up

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.439 
doesn't really matter what wind blows up
over<00:00:37.899> this<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:39.190> pretty<00:00:39.430> much<00:00:39.610> like<00:00:39.670> this<00:00:40.180> and

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
over this it's pretty much like this and

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.400 
over this it's pretty much like this and
so<00:00:41.050> we<00:00:41.199> decided<00:00:41.559> that<00:00:42.899> interactive<00:00:43.899> ocean

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
so we decided that interactive ocean

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.080 
so we decided that interactive ocean
simulation<00:00:45.010> can<00:00:45.190> really<00:00:45.430> go<00:00:45.579> to<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.820> next

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
simulation can really go to the next

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.490 
simulation can really go to the next
level<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:46.449> you've<00:00:46.539> seen<00:00:46.899> some<00:00:47.079> work<00:00:47.289> that

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
level and you've seen some work that

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.099 
level and you've seen some work that
pioneer<00:00:48.460> work<00:00:48.640> that<00:00:48.820> was<00:00:48.940> recently<00:00:49.210> done<00:00:49.600> by

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
Pi where the ships sank and a tsunami

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.840 
Pi where the ships sank and a tsunami
that<00:00:56.440> ocean<00:00:56.920> simulation<00:00:57.609> is

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
that ocean simulation is

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.790 
that ocean simulation is
state-of-the-art<00:00:58.300> that's<00:00:58.870> fantastic<00:00:59.559> work

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
state-of-the-art that's fantastic work

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.080 
state-of-the-art that's fantastic work
now<00:01:00.219> what<00:01:00.370> we're<00:01:00.460> going<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.640> do<00:01:00.730> here<00:01:01.000> is

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
now what we're going to do here is

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.599 
now what we're going to do here is
completely<00:01:01.870> in<00:01:01.989> real<00:01:02.170> time<00:01:02.379> it's<00:01:03.160> completely

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
completely in real time it's completely

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.670 
completely in real time it's completely
real<00:01:03.789> time<00:01:04.030> soon<00:01:04.269> so<00:01:04.720> for<00:01:04.930> example<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:05.439> gamer

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
real time soon so for example a gamer

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.590 
real time soon so for example a gamer
could<00:01:05.950> actually<00:01:06.100> be<00:01:06.400> on<00:01:06.580> one<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.150> those<00:01:07.240> ships

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
could actually be on one of those ships

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.420 
could actually be on one of those ships
and<00:01:07.930> as<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.770> wind<00:01:09.430> picks<00:01:09.670> up<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:12.220> wind

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
and as the wind picks up as the wind

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.350 
and as the wind picks up as the wind
picks<00:01:12.520> up<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:14.080> ocean<00:01:14.439> will<00:01:14.590> start<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:15.880> respond

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
picks up the ocean will start to respond

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.220 
picks up the ocean will start to respond
accordingly

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
accordingly

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.830 
accordingly
and<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.100> this<00:01:19.250> would<00:01:19.430> be<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:19.970> would<00:01:20.180> say<00:01:20.510> what<00:01:20.720> is

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
and so this would be I would say what is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.800 
and so this would be I would say what is
it<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:21.470> a<00:01:21.500> Beaufort<00:01:22.160> level<00:01:22.640> 60<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:23.540> is<00:01:23.780> a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
it this is a Beaufort level 60 this is a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.720 
it this is a Beaufort level 60 this is a
rough<00:01:24.680> seas<00:01:26.110> there<00:01:27.110> are<00:01:28.690> 20,000<00:01:29.690> sensors

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
rough seas there are 20,000 sensors

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.010 
rough seas there are 20,000 sensors
around<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:32.180> whole

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
around the whole

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.429 
around the whole
and<00:01:33.259> is<00:01:33.920> sensing<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.700> water<00:01:34.969> pressure<00:01:35.439> from

the<00:01:39.570> physics<00:01:40.020> simulator<00:01:40.530> help<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> boat<00:01:41.490> how

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the physics simulator help the boat how

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
the physics simulator help the boat how
to<00:01:41.939> ship<00:01:42.330> how<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> respond<00:01:43.020> depending<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.530> its
