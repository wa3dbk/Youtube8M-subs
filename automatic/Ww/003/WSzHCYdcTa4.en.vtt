George<00:00:14.350> is<00:00:14.530> probably<00:00:14.800> most<00:00:15.040> famous<00:00:15.100> for

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
George is probably most famous for

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.910 
George is probably most famous for
spearheading<00:00:16.990> a<00:00:17.050> lot<00:00:17.170> of<00:00:17.290> the<00:00:17.380> early<00:00:17.680> stages

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
spearheading a lot of the early stages

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.070 
spearheading a lot of the early stages
of<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:18.190> human<00:00:18.460> genome<00:00:18.730> project<00:00:18.790> so<00:00:19.450> he

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
of the human genome project so he

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.690 
of the human genome project so he
developed<00:00:20.529> a<00:00:20.590> lot<00:00:20.740> of<00:00:20.830> the<00:00:20.950> first<00:00:21.160> generation

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
developed a lot of the first generation

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.070 
developed a lot of the first generation
automated<00:00:23.310> sequencers<00:00:24.310> that<00:00:25.150> kind<00:00:25.990> of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
automated sequencers that kind of

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.050 
automated sequencers that kind of
started<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:27.040> human<00:00:27.310> genome<00:00:27.520> project<00:00:27.939> and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
started the human genome project and

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.340 
started the human genome project and
then<00:00:28.240> have<00:00:28.450> gone<00:00:28.630> on<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:28.960> develop

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
then have gone on to develop

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.280 
then have gone on to develop
next-generation<00:00:29.920> sequencing<00:00:30.580> technologies

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
next-generation sequencing technologies

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.410 
next-generation sequencing technologies
and<00:00:32.290> that's<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:33.280> lot<00:00:33.730> of<00:00:33.850> that<00:00:34.030> work<00:00:34.239> has<00:00:34.270> been

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
and that's a lot of that work has been

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.270 
and that's a lot of that work has been
in<00:00:34.750> just<00:00:35.230> trying<00:00:35.410> to<00:00:35.470> discover<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.860> genomes

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
in just trying to discover the genomes

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.860 
in just trying to discover the genomes
and<00:00:36.489> understand<00:00:36.879> them

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
and understand them

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.100 
and understand them
I<00:00:38.220> think<00:00:39.220> for<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.640> long<00:00:39.850> time<00:00:40.059> George's<00:00:40.480> also<00:00:40.809> in

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
I think for a long time George's also in

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.990 
I think for a long time George's also in
parallel<00:00:41.470> started<00:00:42.250> developing<00:00:42.610> a<00:00:42.699> lot<00:00:42.820> of<00:00:42.910> new

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
parallel started developing a lot of new

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.210 
parallel started developing a lot of new
technologies<00:00:43.570> on<00:00:43.900> how<00:00:44.110> to<00:00:44.170> engineer<00:00:44.470> biology

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
technologies on how to engineer biology

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.340 
technologies on how to engineer biology
and<00:00:45.460> trying<00:00:45.729> to<00:00:45.850> make<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.809> synthesis<00:00:47.229> of

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
and trying to make the synthesis of

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.229 
and trying to make the synthesis of
genes<00:00:47.650> and<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.400> engineering<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:48.879> biology

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
genes and the engineering of biology

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.140 
genes and the engineering of biology
easier<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.110> faster<00:00:50.290> and<00:00:50.589> better<00:00:50.799> I<00:00:51.100> would<00:00:52.000> say

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
easier and faster and better I would say

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.149 
easier and faster and better I would say
the<00:00:52.299> lab<00:00:52.449> in<00:00:52.629> general<00:00:52.960> is<00:00:53.110> definitely<00:00:53.650> more

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
the lab in general is definitely more

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.549 
the lab in general is definitely more
technology<00:00:54.879> focused<00:00:55.320> there<00:00:56.320> have<00:00:56.440> been<00:00:56.500> a

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
technology focused there have been a

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.049 
technology focused there have been a
number<00:00:56.769> of<00:00:56.890> problems<00:00:57.250> that<00:00:57.400> have<00:00:57.519> come<00:00:57.879> out<00:00:58.000> of

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
number of problems that have come out of

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.939 
number of problems that have come out of
the<00:00:58.210> lab<00:00:58.390> then<00:00:58.659> continue<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.290> be<00:00:59.379> worked<00:00:59.589> on<00:00:59.710> in

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
the lab then continue to be worked on in

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.880 
the lab then continue to be worked on in
the<00:01:00.040> lab<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.780> lot<00:01:02.170> of<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.350> focus<00:01:02.589> has<00:01:02.860> been

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
the lab but a lot of the focus has been

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.609 
the lab but a lot of the focus has been
developing<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.790> technologies<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.720> be<00:01:05.409> able<00:01:05.440> to

developing of technologies to be able to

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.520 
developing of technologies to be able to
discover<00:01:05.979> new<00:01:06.400> types<00:01:06.790> of<00:01:06.970> problems<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.530> solve

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
discover new types of problems and solve

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.370 
discover new types of problems and solve
existing<00:01:08.860> ones<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:10.840> is<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:10.960> number<00:01:11.290> of

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
existing ones there is a number of

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.289 
existing ones there is a number of
things<00:01:11.409> going<00:01:11.650> on<00:01:11.890> in<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.070> lab<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:12.430> there's

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
things going on in the lab so there's

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.300 
things going on in the lab so there's
one<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.350> big<00:01:14.530> things<00:01:14.680> as<00:01:14.860> a<00:01:14.920> Personal

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.020 
Genome Project there have been 10
volunteers<00:01:17.020> sequence<00:01:17.740> so<00:01:17.890> far<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.549> all<00:01:18.789> their

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
volunteers sequence so far and all their

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.359 
volunteers sequence so far and all their
medical<00:01:19.210> histories<00:01:19.780> are<00:01:20.109> public<00:01:21.039> including

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
their names and who they are and also

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.959 
their names and who they are and also
other<00:01:24.219> things<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.549> have<00:01:24.640> come<00:01:24.759> from<00:01:24.880> that

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
other things that have come from that

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.599 
other things that have come from that
are<00:01:25.210> biological<00:01:25.689> material<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.109> the

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
are biological material so the

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:28.560 
are biological material so the
production<00:01:27.609> of<00:01:27.759> stem<00:01:27.939> cells<00:01:28.210> from<00:01:28.420> those

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
production of stem cells from those

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.569 
production of stem cells from those
people<00:01:28.719> and<00:01:29.250> differentiation<00:01:30.250> into

people and differentiation into
different<00:01:30.789> tissues<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.509> lot<00:01:31.689> of<00:01:31.719> what<00:01:31.899> we

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
different tissues so a lot of what we

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.690 
different tissues so a lot of what we

medical cases to a large extent
initially<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.710> get<00:01:44.829> a<00:01:44.859> catalog<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.689> who<00:01:46.689> we<00:01:46.840> are

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
initially to get a catalog of who we are

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.050 
initially to get a catalog of who we are
and<00:01:47.229> how<00:01:47.350> we<00:01:47.409> differ<00:01:47.679> and<00:01:48.039> and<00:01:48.280> how<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.850> might

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
and how we differ and and how that might

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.330 
and how we differ and and how that might
apply<00:01:49.359> to<00:01:49.570> how<00:01:50.079> we<00:01:50.140> treat<00:01:50.469> ourselves<00:01:50.710> in

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
apply to how we treat ourselves in

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.989 
apply to how we treat ourselves in
medicine<00:01:51.999> and<00:01:52.149> also<00:01:52.299> how<00:01:52.600> we<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:54.520> some<00:01:54.670> extent

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
medicine and also how we to some extent

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.510 
medicine and also how we to some extent
engineer<00:01:55.479> our<00:01:55.780> own<00:01:55.929> our<00:01:56.229> own<00:01:56.289> systems<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.219> how

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
engineer our own our own systems and how

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.669 
engineer our own our own systems and how
that<00:01:57.729> changes<00:01:58.450> amongst<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.899> population<00:01:59.289> I

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
that changes amongst the population I

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.090 
that changes amongst the population I
think<00:02:00.549> that's<00:02:00.999> some<00:02:01.299> of<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.450> initial

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
think that's some of the initial

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.069 
think that's some of the initial
applications<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.310> beyond<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:03.999> you<00:02:04.240> know

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
applications and beyond that you know

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.190 
applications and beyond that you know
so<00:02:06.079> but<00:02:07.119> it's<00:02:08.119> it's<00:02:08.539> really<00:02:08.630> kind<00:02:09.110> of

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
so but it's it's really kind of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.770 
so but it's it's really kind of
something<00:02:10.069> that's<00:02:10.220> necessary<00:02:10.670> for<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.450> idea

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
something that's necessary for this idea

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.630 
something that's necessary for this idea
of<00:02:11.870> personalized<00:02:12.380> medicine<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:13.040> really<00:02:13.310> take

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
of personalized medicine to really take

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.880 
of personalized medicine to really take
off<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.420> understood<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.620> know<00:02:15.709> it's

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
off and be understood but you know it's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.130 
off and be understood but you know it's
it's<00:02:16.069> at<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> very<00:02:16.580> beginning<00:02:16.940> stages<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.599> as

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
it's at the very beginning stages and as

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.050 
it's at the very beginning stages and as
technology<00:02:18.709> improves<00:02:19.099> I<00:02:19.310> think<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.700> lot<00:02:19.910> of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
technology improves I think a lot of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.000 
technology improves I think a lot of
this<00:02:20.180> will<00:02:20.360> seem<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.660> lot<00:02:20.810> less<00:02:21.019> fantastical

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
this will seem a lot less fantastical

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.690 
this will seem a lot less fantastical
again<00:02:23.200> we<00:02:24.200> also<00:02:24.349> work<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.860> lot<00:02:25.099> of<00:02:25.130> biofuel

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
again we also work on a lot of biofuel

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.240 
again we also work on a lot of biofuel
related<00:02:26.090> aspects<00:02:26.569> so<00:02:27.110> more<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> bacterial

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
related aspects so more on the bacterial

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.759 
related aspects so more on the bacterial
and<00:02:28.660> algae<00:02:29.660> side<00:02:30.400> we<00:02:31.400> have<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.580> Center<00:02:31.880> for

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
and algae side we have a Center for

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.940 
and algae side we have a Center for
trying<00:02:33.769> to<00:02:33.800> discover<00:02:35.260> novel<00:02:36.260> pathways<00:02:36.440> to

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
trying to discover novel pathways to

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.270 
trying to discover novel pathways to
make<00:02:37.130> better<00:02:37.549> biofuels<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.890> labs<00:02:40.040> very

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
make better biofuels so the labs very

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.520 
make better biofuels so the labs very
diverse<00:02:40.580> in<00:02:40.790> its<00:02:40.849> applications<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:42.019> think

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
diverse in its applications but I think

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.170 
diverse in its applications but I think
the<00:02:42.680> unifying<00:02:43.220> theme<00:02:43.489> is<00:02:43.730> technology

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
the unifying theme is technology

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.850 
the unifying theme is technology
development<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.019> get<00:02:45.200> at<00:02:45.410> some<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.769> these

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
development to get at some of these

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.589 
development to get at some of these
problems<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.640> been<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.819> little<00:02:47.030> vexing

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
problems that have been a little vexing

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.770 
problems that have been a little vexing
a<00:02:47.959> lot<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.130> has<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.430> do<00:02:49.549> center<00:02:49.940> around<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
a lot of it has to do center around the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.900 
a lot of it has to do center around the
manipulation<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:52.069> DNA<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.640> and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
manipulation and of DNA and and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.470 
manipulation and of DNA and and
detection<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.720> DNA<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:54.700> obviously<00:02:55.700> PCR<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.239> lot

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
detection of DNA so obviously PCR a lot

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.470 
detection of DNA so obviously PCR a lot
of<00:02:56.569> PCR<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.349> PCR<00:02:57.950> machines<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:58.579> also<00:02:58.730> you

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
of PCR and PCR machines but also you

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.089 
of PCR and PCR machines but also you
know<00:02:59.599> running<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.959> lot<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.170> gels<00:03:00.410> both<00:03:00.709> agarose

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
know running a lot of gels both agarose

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.250 
know running a lot of gels both agarose
and<00:03:01.250> page<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:03.560> visualization

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
and page and and and just visualization

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.509 
and page and and and just visualization
mostly<00:03:06.260> DNA<00:03:06.620> based<00:03:06.860> technologies<00:03:07.340> but

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
mostly DNA based technologies but

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.559 
mostly DNA based technologies but
everything<00:03:07.880> from<00:03:07.910> high-throughput

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
everything from high-throughput

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.840 
everything from high-throughput
sequencing<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.620> sequencing<00:03:10.370> technologies

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
sequencing and sequencing technologies

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.750 
sequencing and sequencing technologies
to<00:03:11.590> essentially<00:03:12.590> high-throughput<00:03:12.859> synthesis

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
to essentially high-throughput synthesis

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.190 
to essentially high-throughput synthesis
in<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.910> form<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.239> chips<00:03:14.329> you<00:03:14.810> know<00:03:14.959> there's

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
in the form of chips you know there's

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.020 
in the form of chips you know there's
only<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.410> many<00:03:15.590> people<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:16.640> many<00:03:16.730> hands

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
only so many people and in so many hands

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.990 
only so many people and in so many hands
and<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:17.920> everything<00:03:18.920> we<00:03:19.040> do<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.370> try<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.609> how<00:03:19.940> do

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
and so everything we do is try to how do

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.960 
and so everything we do is try to how do
we<00:03:20.120> reduce<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.840> time<00:03:21.049> that<00:03:21.109> we<00:03:21.560> spend<00:03:21.889> I<00:03:22.160> mean

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
we reduce the time that we spend I mean

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.729 
we reduce the time that we spend I mean
just<00:03:23.299> even<00:03:23.420> in<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:23.720> example<00:03:24.019> running<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.500> gel

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
just even in this example running a gel

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.430 
just even in this example running a gel
takes<00:03:25.519> time<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.600> if<00:03:26.900> we<00:03:27.019> can<00:03:27.170> increase

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
takes time and and if we can increase

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.710 
takes time and and if we can increase
that<00:03:27.680> speed<00:03:27.859> and<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.880> make<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.329> easier<00:03:29.690> to

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
that speed and and make it easier to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.610 
that speed and and make it easier to
analyze<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.350> helps<00:03:30.650> us<00:03:30.799> in<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.250> lot<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.489> ways

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
analyze that helps us in a lot of ways

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.570 
analyze that helps us in a lot of ways
when<00:03:33.620> we<00:03:33.680> had<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.860> opportunity<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.340> try<00:03:34.519> the

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
when we had the opportunity to try the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.229 
when we had the opportunity to try the
easy<00:03:35.030> system<00:03:36.370> what<00:03:37.370> ended<00:03:37.549> up<00:03:37.640> happening<00:03:37.700> was

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
easy system what ended up happening was

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.390 
easy system what ended up happening was
basically<00:03:38.930> everyone<00:03:39.620> switched<00:03:39.890> over<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.159> it

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
basically everyone switched over to it

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.220 
basically everyone switched over to it
mostly<00:03:40.670> because<00:03:40.849> it<00:03:41.060> was<00:03:41.150> very<00:03:41.360> fast<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.110> easy

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
mostly because it was very fast and easy

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.640 
mostly because it was very fast and easy
to<00:03:42.409> use<00:03:42.560> there's<00:03:42.920> no<00:03:43.069> but<00:03:43.819> sync<00:03:44.060> really<00:03:44.299> with

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
to use there's no but sync really with

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.460 
to use there's no but sync really with
you<00:03:45.650> know<00:03:45.769> zoom<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.459> focus<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:47.480> automatically

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
you know zoom and focus it automatically

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.990 
you know zoom and focus it automatically
does<00:03:48.709> most<00:03:48.920> of<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.159> and<00:03:49.340> sets<00:03:49.549> the<00:03:49.700> exposure

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
does most of that and sets the exposure

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.350 
does most of that and sets the exposure
and<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.450> images<00:03:51.319> are<00:03:51.650> great<00:03:52.030> shelduck<00:03:53.030> easy

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
and the images are great shelduck easy

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.539 
and the images are great shelduck easy
sits<00:03:53.690> on<00:03:53.810> our<00:03:53.840> bench<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:54.980> it's<00:03:55.159> right<00:03:55.340> next

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
sits on our bench and so it's right next

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.190 
sits on our bench and so it's right next
to<00:03:55.730> where<00:03:55.970> we<00:03:56.180> run<00:03:56.360> our<00:03:56.510> gels<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:56.900> we<00:03:57.049> can

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
to where we run our gels so we can

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.289 
to where we run our gels so we can
quickly<00:03:57.349> just<00:03:57.890> see<00:03:58.489> if<00:03:58.549> our<00:03:58.700> gels<00:03:58.909> running

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
quickly just see if our gels running

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.330 
quickly just see if our gels running
long<00:03:59.510> enough<00:03:59.780> which<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:00.709> really<00:04:01.010> actually

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
long enough which is really actually

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.160 
long enough which is really actually
change<00:04:01.909> the<00:04:02.090> way<00:04:02.209> we<00:04:02.359> use<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.689> gel<00:04:02.870> image<00:04:03.079> or

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
change the way we use the gel image or

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.289 
change the way we use the gel image or
so<00:04:03.290> now<00:04:03.530> we<00:04:03.590> don't<00:04:03.920> just<00:04:04.040> use<00:04:04.459> it<00:04:04.670> as<00:04:04.790> our<00:04:04.879> final

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
so now we don't just use it as our final

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.539 
so now we don't just use it as our final
picture<00:04:06.140> we<00:04:06.349> actually<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:06.769> put<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.250> in<00:04:07.370> there

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
picture we actually just put it in there

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.720 
picture we actually just put it in there
to<00:04:07.700> check<00:04:08.030> how<00:04:08.599> far<00:04:08.870> it's<00:04:09.019> Ronnie<00:04:09.639> that<00:04:10.639> would

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
to check how far it's Ronnie that would

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.280 
to check how far it's Ronnie that would
say<00:04:10.849> it<00:04:10.940> would<00:04:11.030> take<00:04:11.180> about<00:04:11.389> 5<00:04:11.659> to<00:04:11.810> 10<00:04:11.959> minutes

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
say it would take about 5 to 10 minutes

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.129 
say it would take about 5 to 10 minutes
in<00:04:12.530> previous<00:04:13.190> gels<00:04:13.430> but<00:04:13.849> you<00:04:14.060> know<00:04:14.180> it's<00:04:14.510> gel

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
in previous gels but you know it's gel

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.009 
in previous gels but you know it's gel
image<00:04:15.560> now<00:04:15.829> takes<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.549> matter<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.120> seconds<00:04:17.600> and

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
image now takes a matter of seconds and

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.890 
image now takes a matter of seconds and
if<00:04:18.109> you're<00:04:18.229> running<00:04:18.380> through<00:04:18.949> 10<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.519> 20<00:04:19.789> a<00:04:19.820> day

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
if you're running through 10 to 20 a day

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.740 
if you're running through 10 to 20 a day
that<00:04:20.900> adds<00:04:21.169> up<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:23.210> could<00:04:23.600> easily

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
that adds up and so it it could easily

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.540 
that adds up and so it it could easily
save<00:04:24.110> us<00:04:24.260> hours<00:04:24.350> in<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:24.710> day<00:04:24.740> depends<00:04:25.340> on<00:04:25.460> the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
save us hours in a day depends on the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.840 
save us hours in a day depends on the
day<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:29.139> while<00:04:30.139> we<00:04:30.260> like<00:04:30.440> running<00:04:30.860> gels<00:04:31.100> what

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
day so while we like running gels what

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.640 
day so while we like running gels what
we're<00:04:32.000> really<00:04:32.120> interested<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.539> is<00:04:33.260> solving

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
we're really interested in is solving

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.230 
we're really interested in is solving
problems<00:04:33.949> in<00:04:34.070> developing<00:04:34.400> technologies<00:04:34.970> and

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
problems in developing technologies and

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.010 
problems in developing technologies and
anything<00:04:36.229> that<00:04:36.260> saves<00:04:37.099> our<00:04:37.340> time<00:04:37.580> on<00:04:38.090> doing

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
anything that saves our time on doing

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.629 
anything that saves our time on doing
the<00:04:39.110> day-to-day<00:04:39.289> things<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:40.099> we're<00:04:40.520> not

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
the day-to-day things that we're not

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.580 
the day-to-day things that we're not
trying<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.090> improve<00:04:41.539> per<00:04:41.780> se<00:04:41.930> like<00:04:41.960> taking<00:04:42.500> a

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
trying to improve per se like taking a

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.610 
trying to improve per se like taking a
gel<00:04:42.830> image<00:04:43.449> products<00:04:44.449> that<00:04:44.570> help<00:04:44.660> us<00:04:44.900> improve

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
gel image products that help us improve

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.379 
gel image products that help us improve
that<00:04:46.010> like<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.250> gel<00:04:46.400> doc<00:04:46.550> easy<00:04:46.849> really<00:04:47.150> helped

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
that like the gel doc easy really helped

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.990 
that like the gel doc easy really helped
us<00:04:48.820> do<00:04:49.820> science<00:04:50.120> faster<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:50.690> better
