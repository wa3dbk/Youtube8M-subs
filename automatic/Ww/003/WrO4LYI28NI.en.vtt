familiar<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.960> their<00:01:31.290> perfumes<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.070> think

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
familiar with their perfumes I think

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.560 
familiar with their perfumes I think
they<00:01:32.430> correlate<00:01:32.939> with<00:01:33.119> some<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.450> their

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
they correlate with some of their

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.910 
they correlate with some of their
perfumes<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.229> least<00:01:34.409> that's<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.799> they've

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
perfumes at least that's what they've

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.100 
perfumes at least that's what they've
done<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> past<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.329> familiar

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
done in the past and not as familiar

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.170 
done in the past and not as familiar
with<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.829> their<00:01:37.979> perfumes<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:39.000> I'm

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
with what their perfumes are but I'm

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.950 
with what their perfumes are but I'm
guessing<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.229> did

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
guessing that is what they did

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.710 
guessing that is what they did
right<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.409> now<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.250> items<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:43.090> i<00:01:43.420> got

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
and I thought these were really cute

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.510 
and I thought these were really cute
because<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.450> have<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.990> matching<00:01:56.680> bra<00:01:56.950> for<00:01:57.340> them

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
because I have the matching bra for them

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.930 
because I have the matching bra for them
and<00:01:57.909> then<00:01:58.600> there's<00:01:59.229> another<00:01:59.610> similar<00:02:00.610> pair

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.090 
there's just like a nice comfy of black
underwear<00:02:04.509> I<00:02:05.080> just<00:02:05.440> think<00:02:05.649> that<00:02:05.710> these<00:02:05.890> are
