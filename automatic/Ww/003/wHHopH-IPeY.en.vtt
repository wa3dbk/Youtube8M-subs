00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
as odd is that because my boards are one

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.870 
as odd is that because my boards are one
piece<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.449> wood<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:25.260> they're<00:00:25.880> smelled

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:25.630 

that's<00:01:13.140> pretty<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.619> mean<00:01:13.830> that's<00:01:13.950> pretty<00:01:14.070> solid

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.800 

so<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:26.939> one<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:28.110> has<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> different<00:01:29.040> sound

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
so you see one it has a different sound

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.749 
so you see one it has a different sound
obviously<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.110> has<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> darker<00:01:31.590> sound

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
obviously this one has a darker sound

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.590 
obviously this one has a darker sound
deeper<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.360> got<00:01:33.600> more<00:01:33.750> pop<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.850> also

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
deeper so it's got more pop and also

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:46.050 
deeper so it's got more pop and also
don't<00:01:36.900> believe<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:38.270> just<00:01:39.270> watch<00:01:39.479> me

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.460 

so<00:01:47.060> looks<00:01:47.240> like<00:01:47.300> I<00:01:47.480> can't<00:01:47.690> get<00:01:47.780> any<00:01:47.930> pop<00:01:48.200> I

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
so looks like I can't get any pop I

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.910 
so looks like I can't get any pop I
didn't<00:01:48.800> think<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:50.200> got<00:01:51.200> my<00:01:51.290> next<00:01:51.530> fingerboard
