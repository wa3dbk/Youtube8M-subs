00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
everything else is me so let's just move

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.670 
everything else is me so let's just move
along<00:00:37.920> two<00:00:38.460> generations<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.719> our<00:00:40.170> first<00:00:40.469> off

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
along two generations and our first off

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.880 
along two generations and our first off
is<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.370> return<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.730> Kosmos<00:00:42.420> now<00:00:43.260> remember

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is the return of Kosmos now remember

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
is the return of Kosmos now remember
from<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> Transformers<00:00:44.670> Universe<00:00:44.850> line<00:00:45.300> we

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
from the Transformers Universe line we

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.900 
from the Transformers Universe line we
do<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> legends<00:00:46.260> cosmos<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.340> he<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:47.670> be

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
do get a legends cosmos and he will be

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.529 
do get a legends cosmos and he will be
back<00:00:48.120> again<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.469> legends<00:00:49.920> format<00:00:50.539> for

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
back again in legends format for

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.529 
back again in legends format for
generations<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.250> same

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
generations I think this is the same

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.930 
generations I think this is the same
legends<00:00:54.539> cosmos<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.620> gone<00:00:55.800> before<00:00:56.070> but

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
legends cosmos and we gone before but

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.250 
legends cosmos and we gone before but
for<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.180> people<00:00:57.300> miss<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:57.899> he<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
for the people miss out because he was a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
for the people miss out because he was a
harder<00:00:58.559> five-figure<00:00:59.010> yes<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.480> them

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
harder five-figure yes you can get them

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.599

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
sick robot mode I might have to pick up

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.950 
sick robot mode I might have to pick up
since<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> gold<00:01:15.150> bug<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
really cool i'm digging it a lot very

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.289 
really cool i'm digging it a lot very
nice<00:01:26.970> vehicle<00:01:27.360> mode<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.549> course<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.970> robot

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
nice vehicle mode and of course is robot

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.210 
nice vehicle mode and of course is robot
mode<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.140> i'm<00:01:31.290> hearing<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
mode from what i'm hearing the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.950 
mode from what i'm hearing the
transformers<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> lot<00:01:33.450> easier<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
transformers will be a lot easier to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.280 
transformers will be a lot easier to
transform<00:01:34.610> they'll<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.850> bigger<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.509> warranty

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
transform they'll be bigger and warranty

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.530 
transform they'll be bigger and warranty
to<00:01:37.500> hell<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> less<00:01:38.009> difficulty<00:01:38.790> transform<00:01:39.360> i

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
to hell the less difficulty transform i

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.819 
to hell the less difficulty transform i
think<00:01:39.750> that's<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.990> fair<00:01:40.170> trade-off<00:01:40.470> because

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
think that's a fair trade-off because

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.429 
think that's a fair trade-off because
man<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:42.240> had<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.570> too<00:01:42.630> many<00:01:42.930> difficult

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
man we had way too many difficult

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.810 
man we had way too many difficult
transformers<00:01:43.890> i<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.070> some<00:01:44.490> people<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.759> a
