if<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.580> have<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.030> steampunker<00:00:12.750> oh<00:00:12.900> my<00:00:13.110> god

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
if you have the steampunker oh my god

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.589 
if you have the steampunker oh my god
let<00:00:13.440> me<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.679> kill<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.009> guy<00:00:14.360> ok<00:00:15.360> there<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.570> go

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
let me just kill this guy ok there we go

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.900 
let me just kill this guy ok there we go
so<00:00:16.199> basically<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.070> accidentally<00:00:17.550> opened

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
so basically I just accidentally opened

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.300 
so basically I just accidentally opened
it<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.300> key<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:19.080> nevermind<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:20.039> not

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it with the key but nevermind I'm not

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.210 
it with the key but nevermind I'm not
going<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> use<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.880> da<00:00:21.170> because<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:22.590> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
going to use the da because then you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.590 
going to use the da because then you
wouldn't<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.580> able<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.970> get<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.330> without

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
wouldn't be able to get in without

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.509 
wouldn't be able to get in without
killing<00:00:24.930> Pantera<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.650> basically<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.369> have

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
killing Pantera so basically if you have

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.560 
killing Pantera so basically if you have
the<00:00:26.640> steampunker<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:28.140> use<00:00:28.740> teleporters

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
the steampunker you can use teleporters

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.600 
the steampunker you can use teleporters
to<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.810> inside<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.769> dungeon<00:00:32.219> now<00:00:32.460> that

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
to get inside the dungeon now that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.610 
to get inside the dungeon now that
sounds<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.210> straightforward<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.110> I

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
sounds really straightforward and I

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.799 
sounds really straightforward and I
can't<00:00:34.890> believe<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.190> actually<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.700> works<00:00:35.940> but

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
can't believe it actually it works but

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.900 
can't believe it actually it works but
it<00:00:36.989> does<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.129> basically<00:00:38.640> you

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it does as you can see basically you

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.580 
it does as you can see basically you
just<00:00:38.940> put<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> teleporter<00:00:39.719> here<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.469> i

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
just put a teleporter here and i

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.400 
just put a teleporter here and i
teleport<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:42.660> wire<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
teleport it there and you wire up one of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.160 
teleport it there and you wire up one of
the<00:00:43.530> sides<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.250> I'm<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> wire<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.170> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the sides so I'm going to wire up that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.790 
the sides so I'm going to wire up that
side<00:00:46.789> to<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.030> side<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:49.500> I'm<00:00:49.590> gonna

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
side to that side and then I'm gonna

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.600 
side to that side and then I'm gonna
just<00:00:50.010> put<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:50.989> wood<00:00:51.989> down<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.949> link<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
just put some wood down so I can link it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.500 
just put some wood down so I can link it
to<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> switch<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:55.039> put<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> switch<00:00:56.280> down<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.910> then

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
to a switch I put a switch down and then

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.229 
to a switch I put a switch down and then
you<00:00:57.600> link<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.469> think<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.640> I'm<00:00:59.969> not

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you link it up I think like this I'm not

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.369 
you link it up I think like this I'm not
an<00:01:00.390> expert<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.960> wire<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.850> any<00:01:02.850> quick<00:01:03.090> it

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
an expert with wire and any quick it

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.190 
an expert with wire and any quick it
look<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.170> can

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
look like and there you go you can

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.420 
look like and there you go you can
actually<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.890> inside<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.280> temple<00:01:08.670> without

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
actually get inside the temple without

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.190 
actually get inside the temple without
opening<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> door<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.450> does<00:01:12.720> work<00:01:12.960> even

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
opening the door now this does work even

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
with you and there you go and that is a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.039 
with you and there you go and that is a
way<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.869> inside<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
way on how you can get inside and

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.590 
way on how you can get inside and
outside<00:01:40.259> from<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> jungle<00:01:41.340> without<00:01:42.150> killing

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
outside from the jungle without killing

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380 
outside from the jungle without killing
Pantera<00:01:43.049> very<00:01:43.590> simple<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.909> can't<00:01:45.210> believe

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
Pantera very simple and I can't believe

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.230 
Pantera very simple and I can't believe
something<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.750> that's<00:01:46.020> been<00:01:46.259> overlooked<00:01:47.240> it

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
something like that's been overlooked it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.510 
something like that's been overlooked it
yeah<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.110> guess<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:49.799> cheating

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
yeah I guess it's not really cheating

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.630 
yeah I guess it's not really cheating
cuz<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.509> taking<00:01:51.720> advantage<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.640> game

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
cuz it is just taking advantage of game
