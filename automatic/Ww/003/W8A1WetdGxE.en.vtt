bottom the bottom across the top going

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.410 
bottom the bottom across the top going
through<00:00:48.110> my<00:00:49.110> split<00:00:49.440> ring<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.420> I

through my split ring as I do that I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.299 
through my split ring as I do that I
will<00:00:51.660> take<00:00:53.420> my<00:00:54.420> right<00:00:55.020> hand<00:00:55.050> side<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.680> over<00:00:56.129> and

will take my right hand side go over and
under<00:00:56.910> through<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> loop<00:00:58.100> there<00:00:59.239> I'm<00:01:00.239> gonna

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
under through the loop there I'm gonna

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.959 
under through the loop there I'm gonna
take<00:01:00.600> my<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.899> side<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.170> go<00:01:01.410> over<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.850> under

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
through the loop right here

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.670 
through the loop right here
same<00:01:06.240> exact<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.930> we've<00:01:07.140> been<00:01:07.350> doing<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.320 
same exact not we've been doing the
whole<00:01:07.740> time<00:01:08.420> I'm<00:01:09.420> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.720> ahead<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
whole time I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.320 
whole time I'm going to go ahead and
since<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:14.610> you'll

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
since this up a little bit and you'll

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.620 
since this up a little bit and you'll
see<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.780> split<00:01:16.290> ring<00:01:16.729> will<00:01:17.729> fit<00:01:18.060> real

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
see that that split ring will fit real

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.100 
see that that split ring will fit real
nicely<00:01:20.299> right<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.479> between<00:01:21.810> all<00:01:21.960> these

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
nicely right in between all these

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.270 
nicely right in between all these
threads<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.280> tighten<00:01:23.640> everything<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:25.280> now

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
threads as you tighten everything up now

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
threads as you tighten everything up now
at<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.180> point<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.540> time<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.930> thought<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.500> I

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
at one point in time I thought that I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.340 
at one point in time I thought that I
would<00:01:28.650> need<00:01:29.070> more<00:01:30.030> than<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.450> knot<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.990> top<00:01:31.200> of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
would need more than one knot on top of

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.890 
would need more than one knot on top of
the<00:01:31.439> split<00:01:31.710> ring<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:33.210> did<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.720> way

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the split ring and I did one that way

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
the split ring and I did one that way
and<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.110> put<00:01:34.320> two<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:34.500> three<00:01:34.650> knots<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.250> top<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and I put two or three knots on top of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
and I put two or three knots on top of
the<00:01:35.729> split<00:01:35.970> ring<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.630> found<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> look

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the split ring and I found it look

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.590 
the split ring and I found it look
really<00:01:37.590> funny<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.610> didn't<00:01:38.970> quite<00:01:39.210> look<00:01:39.540> right

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
really funny it didn't quite look right

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.069 
really funny it didn't quite look right
it<00:01:39.990> didn't<00:01:40.290> sit<00:01:40.500> right

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
it didn't sit right

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.859 
it didn't sit right
but<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.850> knot<00:01:45.180> right

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
but with this you just do one knot right

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
but with this you just do one knot right
over<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> top<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> make<00:01:47.610> sure<00:01:47.640> it's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
over the top you want to make sure it's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.830 
over the top you want to make sure it's
really<00:01:48.240> snug<00:01:49.040> know<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.220> square<00:01:50.490> knot<00:01:50.840> does

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
really snug know the square knot does

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.780 
really snug know the square knot does
kind<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.380> seem<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> back<00:01:52.860> itself<00:01:53.220> off<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> little

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
kind of seem to back itself off a little

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.819 
kind of seem to back itself off a little
bit<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.149> its<00:01:54.329> own<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:55.409> why<00:01:55.500> we're<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.770> to

really<00:02:08.160> tight

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
really tight

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.500 
really tight
pick<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> court<00:02:11.039> now<00:02:11.430> you'll<00:02:11.640> see<00:02:11.879> I've<00:02:12.030> got<00:02:12.239> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
pick a court now you'll see I've got a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.809 
pick a court now you'll see I've got a
little<00:02:13.349> over<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> foot<00:02:13.799> left<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.459> each<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.730> these

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819

little over a foot left of each of these
greens<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:16.519> not<00:02:17.519> too<00:02:17.700> much<00:02:17.849> left<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.299> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.940 
greens and not too much left of the
black<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:18.810> judge<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.230> black<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.799> well

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
black so we judge the black really well

black so we judge the black really well
I<00:02:20.159> probably<00:02:20.849> could<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.180> gone<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.659> couple<00:02:22.409> feet

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
I probably could have gone a couple feet

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.970 
I probably could have gone a couple feet
shorter<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.610> green<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:25.080> I'd<00:02:25.500> rather<00:02:25.739> have

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
shorter on the green but I'd rather have

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.960 
shorter on the green but I'd rather have
a<00:02:26.010> little<00:02:26.099> too<00:02:26.819> much<00:02:27.319> than<00:02:28.319> not<00:02:28.349> enough<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.819> if

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
a little too much than not enough and if

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.690 
a little too much than not enough and if
we<00:02:30.120> were<00:02:30.269> using<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.690> larger<00:02:31.410> ball<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:32.549> that

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
we were using a larger ball for that

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.470 
we were using a larger ball for that
Monkey<00:02:33.030> Fist<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:34.140> would<00:02:34.319> have<00:02:34.410> taken<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.890> up

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
Monkey Fist it would have taken that up

we want to heat the end of this quarter
really<00:02:38.519> good<00:02:40.849> get<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:41.970> good<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.209> good<00:02:43.049> and

really good get it good and good and
gooey<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.709> then<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.310> lick<00:02:44.489> your<00:02:44.610> finger

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
gooey and then you can lick your finger

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.940 
gooey and then you can lick your finger
and<00:02:45.440> mash<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.650> down<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.109> will<00:02:49.200> expand<00:02:49.650> when

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and mash it down and it will expand when

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.170 
and mash it down and it will expand when
it<00:02:50.220> does<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.620> melt<00:02:53.340> itself<00:02:53.700> into<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
it does that and melt itself into the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.250 
it does that and melt itself into the
nearby<00:02:54.930> chord<00:02:56.209> thereby<00:02:57.209> locking<00:02:57.480> itself<00:02:58.079> in

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
nearby chord thereby locking itself in

nearby chord thereby locking itself in
place<00:03:01.609> so<00:03:02.609> we<00:03:02.760> won't<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.269> worry<00:03:03.480> about

place so we won't have to worry about

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.589 
place so we won't have to worry about
this<00:03:05.690> not<00:03:06.690> backing<00:03:07.200> itself<00:03:07.709> off<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:09.120> coming

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
this not backing itself off and coming

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.180 
this not backing itself off and coming
loose<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:10.019> all<00:03:10.109> as<00:03:10.349> long<00:03:10.379> as<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.739> get<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.950> really

loose at all as long as you get a really

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.559 
loose at all as long as you get a really
good<00:03:11.400> cinch<00:03:12.200> get<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.379> chord<00:03:13.650> good<00:03:13.919> and<00:03:14.040> high
