00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.930
 now we are going to teach to be the ointments 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.249
 for this we are going to make a sliding knot 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.109
 let's pass a chain 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:14.269
 and we are going to pull the house to the height that we do not if we have 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.909
 then we climb the thread that we have back 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.810
 we make a loop 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.650
 and we had it 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.140
 for this house that is sides 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 and now in the middle we're going to re-enter the width 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 and we make a half point 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 we smell to pull to the desired height 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 we make a loop 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.630
 Poplars 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.360
 now we put the hook in the middle 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.550
 prolongation to the asad 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 and we go back to take out 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810
 and that's how the first round of foam is formed 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.710
 here to casinos the amount that we need from chains 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 and to weave the second round 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.590
 let's count four reasons 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.150
 and in the room we did not clarify and be a half point 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.940
 this way we are not coming back 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.960
 to continue weaving 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 and now pray be sea foam let's do two reasons 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 there we wanted the first one this is the second one 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.569
 we were going to clarify now the hook in the second one world 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 here we make a half point 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.100
 finally we do two other reasons we are going to be leaving two in two 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.139
 we must clean up the two reasons and we clarify them in the second point 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.590
 I wanted first and the cyst the second point here we stay and we make a medium 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.609
 point 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.609
 So we will continue until we finish this round 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.159
 if you see here we are going to mark 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.159
 icahn the four-in-four motives 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.799
 here we are already arriving at the end of the turn 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.019
 in this case if we want to be a triangular shawl in which we go 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.209
 decreasing in extremes 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.209
 instead of doing two reasons we are going to be just a reason 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:54.249
 we were going to weave a double high point 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.309
 to be able to place ourselves at the center of this motive 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.759
 here then let's do the two fairies we nail in the last point 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:11.399
 and we make the high point 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:16.409
 that is going to place us at the center of this motive, we will be able to continue weaving 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.719
 from this point 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.719
 pesic made the decrease 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:26.159
 another way to decrease a point in this round if we do not want is the high point 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.969
 wafers 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:28.539
 is the next 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.539
 let's be the first part of the reason 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.929
 let's be a loop 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.969
 we nail in the last point 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.699
 we falab 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.349
 we are going to pull it to the size of the previous motive 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.249
 we make a loop and if we miss 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:48.689
 in this way we are left 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:53.199
 this diamond-shaped motif like the previous ones and we are already in the center 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.129
 to start knitting 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.750
 I continued we would continue weaving to go back and start lowering a point 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:00.079
 in each round 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.079
 with this we managed to make a triangular shawl 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.730
 Beijing the last motive 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.720
 We are going to do this as we said in the villas because we are going to start 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.939
 decrease 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.909
 then we turn the fabric 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.430
 and we are going to make two sea foams more motives more 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.509
 maybe so in the second reason 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:30.069
 and as we have been doing, let's clarify in the second point 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.169
 he conquered the second point 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.759
 which is now the central part of the previous motive 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.770
 and here you can see 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.610
 the decrease was already made 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.479
 in this way in each round decreasing a point or we will finish in 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.020
 a single reason in peak 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.020
 and in this way we will have the mule chaltÃ©n 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.729
 if we want to continue straight and not make decreases at the end of the 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:07.490
 return 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.490
 in kansas ee is to finish our course 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.749
 We are going to weave these two reasons on the reasons for the previous round 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.259
 we turn to the tissue 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.159
 and what will be different this time is to make three reasons instead 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.740
 of two 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.740
 this is what we are going to do only in this part to be able to turn and who 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.740
 weaved to continue straight 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.360
 what are we doing the three reasons 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.020
 that we are going to nail in the first point 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.099
 this is at the center of the reason for the previous round 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.949
 here we make the half point and in this way the being 3 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.039
 reasons only here at the end 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.039
 the straight tissue is formed 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.770
 here we would continue knitting in a normal way 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.639
 every two reasons as we were doing and nailing in the second point 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.500
 we're only going to do those 3 reasons that at the start of each round 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.740
 and maybe the order 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.740
 the straight way the tissue 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.359
 and that we are going to do it is always in extremes
