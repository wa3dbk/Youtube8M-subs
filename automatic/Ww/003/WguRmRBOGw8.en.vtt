would<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.619> said<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:17.220> probably<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
would have said that's probably the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
would have said that's probably the
worst<00:01:18.150> english<00:01:18.420> i've<00:01:18.750> ever<00:01:18.869> used<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.590> I'm

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
worst english i've ever used but I'm

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.380 
worst english i've ever used but I'm
yeah<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.430> then<00:01:20.610> generally<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
yeah and then generally just going to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090 
yeah and then generally just going to
use<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.659> fire<00:01:22.049> spell<00:01:22.439> set<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.890> because<00:01:23.009> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
use a fire spell set up because that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.770 
use a fire spell set up because that
obviously<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.700> their<00:01:23.970> weakness<00:01:24.090> but

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
obviously is their weakness but

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.670 
obviously is their weakness but
hopefully<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.350> should<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> very

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
hopefully it should be a very

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
hopefully it should be a very
interesting<00:01:26.189> power<00:01:26.610> I've<00:01:27.030> got<00:01:27.210> myself<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
interesting power I've got myself a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.270 
interesting power I've got myself a
winter<00:01:28.140> storage<00:01:28.380> Scrolls<00:01:28.710> obviously<00:01:29.130> with

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
winter storage Scrolls obviously with

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.620

the loot town i'm going to be banking
the<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.320> loop<00:01:31.530> obviously<00:01:31.950> i'll<00:01:32.040> make<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> note

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the the loop obviously i'll make a note

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.490 
the the loop obviously i'll make a note
of<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:33.000> sure<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.299> guys<00:01:33.450> i<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:34.170> wind

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
of all the loops that that is there to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.319 
of all the loops that that is there to
go<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.650> won't<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.250> tracking<00:01:38.670> chimes<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
go and I won't be tracking chimes and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
go and I won't be tracking chimes and
whenever<00:01:39.960> I've<00:01:40.140> gone<00:01:40.259> down<00:01:40.470> there<00:01:40.590> before<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
but charms are really not a major part

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.429 
but charms are really not a major part

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
so like money making for farming that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
so like money making for farming that
sort<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:49.049> say<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.530> don't<00:01:49.979> think<00:01:50.189> it's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
sort of thing say I don't think it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.460 
sort of thing say I don't think it's
very<00:01:50.579> interesting<00:01:50.970> side<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.079> gala<00:01:52.259> beach

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
out the charms I think I did it in the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260 
out the charms I think I did it in the
last<00:01:55.710> video<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> gonna<00:01:56.369> beast<00:01:56.579> power<00:01:56.880> and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
is probably one of the weirdest things

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.200 
is probably one of the weirdest things
I've<00:02:12.300> actually<00:02:12.450> ever<00:02:12.690> come<00:02:12.930> across

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
I've actually ever come across

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.150 
I've actually ever come across
and<00:02:13.480> you'll<00:02:14.020> see<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.410> minute<00:02:14.500> exactly<00:02:15.070> what

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
and you'll see in a minute exactly what

I<00:02:15.190> mean<00:02:15.430> for<00:02:16.150> some<00:02:16.270> reason<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:17.290> bone<00:02:17.500> crushers

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
I mean for some reason the bone crushers

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.470 
I mean for some reason the bone crushers
not<00:02:18.100> actually<00:02:18.400> working<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.880> I'd<00:02:19.030> love<00:02:19.420> for

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
not actually working and I'd love for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.660 
not actually working and I'd love for
you<00:02:19.750> guys<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.990> actually<00:02:20.200> tell<00:02:20.500> me<00:02:20.620> why<00:02:20.800> like

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
you guys to actually tell me why like

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.150 
you guys to actually tell me why like
look<00:02:21.940> as<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.270> can<00:02:22.390> see<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.840> drops<00:02:23.200> like<00:02:23.980> I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
look as you can see as it drops like I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.400 
look as you can see as it drops like I
don't<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.970> bones<00:02:25.180> aren't<00:02:25.510> crushing<00:02:25.960> I've<00:02:26.140> got

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
don't the bones aren't crushing I've got

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.540 
don't the bones aren't crushing I've got
the<00:02:26.500> bone<00:02:26.650> crusher<00:02:26.890> mandatory<00:02:27.400> it's

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
the bone crusher mandatory it's

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.070 
the bone crusher mandatory it's
definitely<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.030> there<00:02:28.240> but<00:02:28.480> I'm<00:02:28.690> just

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
definitely in there but I'm just

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.110 
definitely in there but I'm just
wondering<00:02:29.260> why<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.620> might<00:02:30.010> be<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.490> maybe

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
wondering why that might be and maybe

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.670 
wondering why that might be and maybe
there<00:02:31.300> was<00:02:31.390> an<00:02:31.480> update<00:02:31.660> or<00:02:31.930> something<00:02:32.230> if<00:02:32.560> you

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
there was an update or something if you

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.080 
there was an update or something if you
guys<00:02:32.830> could<00:02:33.010> elaborate<00:02:33.520> when<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.850> thing

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
guys could elaborate when this thing

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.430 
guys could elaborate when this thing
goes<00:02:34.270> up<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.720> would<00:02:34.810> be<00:02:34.840> absolutely<00:02:35.200> awesome

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
goes up that would be absolutely awesome

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.140 
goes up that would be absolutely awesome
but<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.310> really<00:02:36.610> strange<00:02:36.700> how<00:02:37.000> they're

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
but that is really strange how they're

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.360 
but that is really strange how they're
not<00:02:37.360> actually<00:02:37.510> crashing<00:02:38.080> down<00:02:38.200> um<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:39.010> it's

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
not actually crashing down um and it's

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.980 
not actually crashing down um and it's
not<00:02:39.550> because<00:02:39.670> I'm<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:39.970> safe<00:02:40.300> spotted<00:02:40.720> or

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990

not because I'm like safe spotted or
anything<00:02:41.230> like<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.380> they<00:02:41.740> just<00:02:41.920> generally

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
anything like that they just generally

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.150 
anything like that they just generally
aren't<00:02:42.670> aren't<00:02:43.150> working<00:02:43.660> um<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.800> yeah<00:02:44.980> if
