we're<00:00:00.539> now<00:00:00.690> looking<00:00:00.870> at<00:00:01.170> how<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.560> lay<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:01.860> floor

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
we're now looking at how to lay a floor

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
we're now looking at how to lay a floor
by<00:00:02.730> secret<00:00:03.720> nailing<00:00:04.170> method<00:00:04.589> so<00:00:05.000> we<00:00:06.000> talked

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
by secret nailing method so we talked

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.579 
by secret nailing method so we talked
about<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.569> little<00:00:06.720> bit<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.560> last

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
about this a little bit in the last

video just to remind you it's a method

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.470 
video just to remind you it's a method
of<00:00:11.370> fixing<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.880> floor<00:00:12.120> where<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.300> have<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
of fixing a floor where you have a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.509 
of fixing a floor where you have a
timber<00:00:13.009> subfloor<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.190> we're<00:00:14.340> going<00:00:14.460> to

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
timber subfloor because we're going to

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.090 
timber subfloor because we're going to
nail<00:00:15.120> these<00:00:15.389> boards<00:00:15.839> with<00:00:16.410> these<00:00:16.560> fixings

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
nail these boards with these fixings

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.849 
nail these boards with these fixings
into<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> subfloor<00:00:18.510> beneath<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.650> is

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
into the subfloor beneath this is

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.120 
into the subfloor beneath this is
suitable<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.580> either<00:00:20.880> solid<00:00:21.359> floors<00:00:21.750> or

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
suitable for either solid floors or

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.340 
suitable for either solid floors or
engineer<00:00:23.130> boards<00:00:23.550> okay<00:00:23.930> we've<00:00:24.930> got<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> first

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
engineer boards okay we've got the first

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.250 
engineer boards okay we've got the first
run<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.970> wedged<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.170> way

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
run in here it's wedged all the way

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
run in here it's wedged all the way
around<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.070> keep<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.400> place<00:00:29.640> again

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
around just to keep it in place again

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.999 
around just to keep it in place again
like<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> floating<00:00:31.230> floor<00:00:31.679> we've<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:31.920> an

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
like the floating floor we've got an

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.889 
like the floating floor we've got an
expansion<00:00:32.579> gap<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> back<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> edge

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
expansion gap at the back and the edge

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.900 
expansion gap at the back and the edge
is<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.620> 10<00:00:34.890> millimeters<00:00:36.980> this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.489> wax

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
is about 10 millimeters this is the wax

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.729 
is about 10 millimeters this is the wax
back<00:00:39.149> paper<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.890> waxy<00:00:41.219> side<00:00:41.460> goes<00:00:41.760> down<00:00:42.739> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
back paper the waxy side goes down and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.130 
back paper the waxy side goes down and
we<00:00:43.980> fix<00:00:44.340> through<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.690> reason<00:00:46.050> for

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
we fix through it now the reason for

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.510 
we fix through it now the reason for
this<00:00:47.180> underlay<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:49.230> although<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
this underlay is that although this is a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
this underlay is that although this is a
chipboard<00:00:50.879> floor<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.960> highly<00:00:52.289> stable

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
chipboard floor and it's highly stable

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.740 
chipboard floor and it's highly stable
and<00:00:52.890> won't<00:00:53.250> hold<00:00:53.460> moisture<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.420> might<00:00:54.600> be

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and won't hold moisture you might be

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
and won't hold moisture you might be
nailing<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.350> old<00:00:55.620> floorboards<00:00:56.370> for

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
nailing on to old floorboards for

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760 
nailing on to old floorboards for
example<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.809> Victorian<00:00:58.289> house<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.680> old

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
example so in a Victorian house with old

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.729 
example so in a Victorian house with old
pine<00:00:59.039> boards<00:00:59.550> there'll<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.500> moisture<00:01:01.500> level

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
pine boards there'll be a moisture level

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
pine boards there'll be a moisture level
in<00:01:01.800> those<00:01:02.010> boards<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.730> considerably

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
in those boards which is considerably

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.450 
in those boards which is considerably
higher<00:01:03.780> than<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.379> kiln<00:01:04.710> dried<00:01:05.040> wood<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
higher than this kiln dried wood and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
higher than this kiln dried wood and
over<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> long<00:01:06.090> run<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.170> be

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
over the long run there can be

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.320 
over the long run there can be
transference<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.979> moisture<00:01:08.460> from<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.909> into

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
transference of moisture from one into

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.210 
transference of moisture from one into
the<00:01:09.360> other<00:01:09.450> causing<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> swell<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.680> this

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the other causing this to swell up this

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
the other causing this to swell up this
simply<00:01:11.729> prevents<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> happening<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:12.960> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
simply prevents that happening so I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
simply prevents that happening so I
always<00:01:13.290> put<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.560> down<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.920> any<00:01:14.070> timber

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
always put this down on any timber

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.109 
always put this down on any timber
background<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:15.960> ready<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.290> start

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
background then we're ready to start

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.190 
background then we're ready to start
we're<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.360> using<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.750> Porter

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we're going to be using this Porter

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740 
we're going to be using this Porter
nailer<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:20.159> fixing<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.610> floor<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.630> the

nailer for fixing this floor but the
first<00:01:22.080> run<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.860> actually<00:01:23.340> better<00:01:23.700> fixed

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
first run is actually better fixed

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.210 
first run is actually better fixed
through<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> face<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> board<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.040> that

fired at 45 degrees through the tongue

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.009 
fired at 45 degrees through the tongue
and<00:02:50.250> into<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.970> floor<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.569> fired<00:02:51.810> by

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
and into the floor and it's fired by

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.690 
and into the floor and it's fired by
hitting<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.739> there's<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.340> shoe<00:02:53.549> on<00:02:53.670> the

hitting this so there's a shoe on the
bottom<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.630> sits<00:02:55.019> just<00:02:55.370> there<00:02:56.370> grab<00:02:56.790> over

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
bottom that sits just there grab over

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.599 
bottom that sits just there grab over
that<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:57.660> marrow<00:02:57.870> give<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.200> big<00:02:58.319> whack

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.069 

two<00:03:02.609> waxes<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.269> often<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.569> case<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.989> then

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
two waxes is often the case and then

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.430 
two waxes is often the case and then
spread<00:03:04.380> them<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.220> next<00:03:05.430> fixing<00:03:06.269> is

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
spread them out so the next fixing is

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.500 
spread them out so the next fixing is
well<00:03:07.440> 300<00:03:08.010> he's<00:03:08.489> being<00:03:08.880> pretty<00:03:09.030> keen<00:03:09.329> you

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
well 300 he's being pretty keen you

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.819 
well 300 he's being pretty keen you
could<00:03:09.660> spread<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:09.900> out<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.109> bit<00:03:10.170> more<00:03:12.709> again<00:03:13.709> we

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
could spread it out a bit more again we

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.259 
could spread it out a bit more again we
want<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.010> keep<00:03:14.190> these<00:03:14.430> header<00:03:14.700> joints<00:03:15.060> tight

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
want to keep these header joints tight

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.940 
want to keep these header joints tight
so<00:03:15.480> we<00:03:15.569> might<00:03:15.750> use<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> reverse<00:03:16.170> knocker<00:03:16.650> at<00:03:16.859> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
so we might use a reverse knocker at the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:34.830 
so we might use a reverse knocker at the
other<00:03:17.069> end<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.340> pull<00:03:17.700> them<00:03:17.790> up

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.960 

same<00:03:35.840> thing<00:03:36.140> for<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.410> third<00:03:36.650> row<00:03:37.010> again<00:03:37.820> we're

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
same thing for the third row again we're

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.500 
same thing for the third row again we're
leaving<00:03:38.210> an<00:03:38.330> expansion<00:03:38.900> gap<00:03:39.110> at<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:39.650> end

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.580 

hopefully<00:03:47.510> you've<00:03:47.630> got<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> good<00:03:47.810> idea<00:03:47.990> how
