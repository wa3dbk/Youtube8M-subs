ports around the iceberg try to keep her

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.320 
ports around the iceberg try to keep her
hitting<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> propellers<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:20.910> looks<00:00:21.210> pretty

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
hitting the propellers that looks pretty

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.660 
hitting the propellers that looks pretty
good

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.370 

okay<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.449> now<00:00:24.689> we're<00:00:24.869> watching<00:00:25.019> an

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
okay so now we're watching an

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.980 
okay so now we're watching an
accelerated<00:00:25.980> time<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:27.060> see<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.420> first<00:00:27.689> five

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
accelerated time we see the first five

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.140 
accelerated time we see the first five
compartments<00:00:28.410> blood<00:00:28.890> they<00:00:29.099> equalize<00:00:29.669> pretty

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
compartments blood they equalize pretty

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.790 
compartments blood they equalize pretty
quickly<00:00:30.419> bow<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.289> pulled<00:00:31.710> down

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.370 

we<00:00:36.340> see<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.640> port<00:00:36.880> list<00:00:37.120> or<00:00:37.780> list<00:00:37.990> looks<00:00:38.200> right

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
we see the port list or list looks right

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.350 
we see the port list or list looks right
now<00:00:38.560> looks<00:00:38.740> like<00:00:38.830> about<00:00:38.920> 9<00:00:39.220> degrees<00:00:39.370> well<00:00:40.270> you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
now looks like about 9 degrees well you

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.900 
now looks like about 9 degrees well you
can<00:00:40.480> really<00:00:40.630> see<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.170> effect<00:00:41.980> of<00:00:42.400> that<00:00:42.460> that

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
can really see the effect of that that

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:51.779 
can really see the effect of that that
list<00:00:43.210> on<00:00:43.450> them<00:00:43.600> on<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.900> flooding

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.549 

so<00:00:52.789> yeah<00:00:53.210> superstructure<00:00:53.989> starts<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.440> get

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
so yeah superstructure starts to get

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:02.490 
so yeah superstructure starts to get
pulled<00:00:54.770> under

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.560 

funnels<00:01:03.400> collapse<00:01:03.790> at<00:01:04.030> their<00:01:04.180> base<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:07.510> the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
funnels collapse at their base now the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.840 
funnels collapse at their base now the
bow<00:01:07.870> is<00:01:08.110> accelerating<00:01:08.950> downward<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.670> look

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
bow is accelerating downward that look

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.580 
bow is accelerating downward that look
that<00:01:10.000> looks<00:01:10.180> good<00:01:10.390> we're<00:01:11.140> starting<00:01:11.410> to<00:01:11.470> see

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
that looks good we're starting to see

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.130 
that looks good we're starting to see
the<00:01:11.710> stern<00:01:11.950> come<00:01:12.340> up<00:01:12.550> we<00:01:13.420> got<00:01:13.540> our<00:01:13.630> maximum

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
the stern come up we got our maximum

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.770 
the stern come up we got our maximum
peak<00:01:14.350> stress<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.010> yep<00:01:15.400> boom<00:01:15.610> rocket<00:01:16.480> breaks

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
peak stress and yep boom rocket breaks

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.650 
peak stress and yep boom rocket breaks
okay<00:01:17.590> bow<00:01:17.830> swinging<00:01:18.310> down<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:19.060> was<00:01:19.180> good

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
okay bow swinging down that was good

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.550 
okay bow swinging down that was good
the<00:01:20.650> double<00:01:20.950> keel<00:01:21.130> hang<00:01:21.400> on<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:23.290> then<00:01:23.410> they

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
the double keel hang on and then they

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.030 
the double keel hang on and then they
separate<00:01:24.070> bow<00:01:24.760> plunges<00:01:25.300> straight<00:01:25.540> down<00:01:26.040> right

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
separate bow plunges straight down right

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.820 
separate bow plunges straight down right
got<00:01:27.340> math<00:01:27.580> snapping<00:01:28.090> back<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.810> funnels<00:01:29.710> are

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
got math snapping back the funnels are

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.260 
got math snapping back the funnels are
ripping<00:01:30.130> backward<00:01:30.520> pulling<00:01:30.850> off<00:01:30.970> all<00:01:31.120> the

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
ripping backward pulling off all the

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.980 
ripping backward pulling off all the
davits

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
davits

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.830 
davits
bow<00:01:33.620> is<00:01:33.680> going<00:01:33.920> down<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.340> torpedo<00:01:34.840> here's

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
bow is going down like a torpedo here's

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.480 
bow is going down like a torpedo here's
the<00:01:35.990> angle<00:01:36.170> when<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.590> falls<00:01:36.830> when<00:01:37.190> it<00:01:37.220> blows

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
the angle when it falls when it blows

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.700 
the angle when it falls when it blows
through<00:01:37.520> into<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.000> stable<00:01:38.450> position<00:01:38.630> let's<00:01:39.560> see

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
through into a stable position let's see

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.560 
through into a stable position let's see
the<00:01:39.830> start

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
the start

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.810 
the start
feeling<00:01:42.410> way<00:01:42.620> over<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.130> port<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.640> looks

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
feeling way over to port that looks

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.180 
feeling way over to port that looks
right<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.720> she<00:01:45.110> goes<00:01:45.260> up<00:01:45.560> that's<00:01:45.740> right<00:01:45.980> she

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
right and she goes up that's right she

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.650 
right and she goes up that's right she
goes<00:01:46.310> almost<00:01:46.640> vertical<00:01:47.000> just<00:01:47.240> when<00:01:47.390> she<00:01:47.510> goes

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
goes almost vertical just when she goes

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.590 
goes almost vertical just when she goes
on<00:01:47.810> during<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.050> boom<00:01:48.380> implodes

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
on during that boom implodes

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.420 
on during that boom implodes
now<00:01:50.600> she<00:01:50.720> accelerates<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.980> all<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.220> stuff

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
now she accelerates and all the stuff

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.700 
now she accelerates and all the stuff
starts<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.790> rip<00:01:52.970> off<00:01:53.150> she<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.230> shell<00:01:54.440> plating

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
starts to rip off she the shell plating

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.990 
starts to rip off she the shell plating
going<00:01:54.950> there<00:01:55.310> goes<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.550> double<00:01:55.820> bottom

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
going there goes the double bottom

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.800 
going there goes the double bottom
little<00:01:56.840> bottom<00:01:57.080> frizz<00:01:57.380> being<00:01:57.680> off<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.600> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
little bottom frizz being off and the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.270 
little bottom frizz being off and the
strands<00:02:00.080> falling<00:02:00.440> through

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
strands falling through

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.970 
strands falling through
so<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> Stern's<00:02:03.000> falling<00:02:03.480> aft<00:02:04.440> end<00:02:04.740> down

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
so now the Stern's falling aft end down

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.600 
so now the Stern's falling aft end down
and<00:02:06.110> we<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.470> spiraling

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
and we see the spiraling

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.510 
and we see the spiraling
it<00:02:10.600> comes<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.990> bow<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.830> was<00:02:12.010> falling<00:02:12.250> at<00:02:12.430> a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
it comes the bow that was falling at a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.990 
it comes the bow that was falling at a
stable<00:02:12.910> position<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.380> hits<00:02:14.650> yeah<00:02:15.220> boom<00:02:15.490> it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
stable position and it hits yeah boom it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000 
stable position and it hits yeah boom it
kind<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.240> breaks<00:02:16.480> his<00:02:16.630> back<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.590> we<00:02:17.710> see<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
kind of breaks his back and we see the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.500 
kind of breaks his back and we see the
hydraulic<00:02:18.430> outburst<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.060> Down<00:02:19.240> blast

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
hydraulic outburst and a Down blast

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.640 
hydraulic outburst and a Down blast
effect<00:02:19.900> let's<00:02:20.440> see<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.710> start
