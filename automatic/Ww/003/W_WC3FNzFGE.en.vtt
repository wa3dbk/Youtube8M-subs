by proxy on the oil industry so Brad you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.719 
by proxy on the oil industry so Brad you
know<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.119> talk<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> lot<00:02:00.689> about<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.020> structural

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
know you talk a lot about the structural

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.980 
know you talk a lot about the structural
problems<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> Canadian<00:02:03.450> market<00:02:03.810> with

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
problems with the Canadian market with

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.719 
problems with the Canadian market with
the<00:02:04.079> demographics<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:04.979> wouldn't<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.490> be

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the demographics but wouldn't that be

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.760 
the demographics but wouldn't that be
also<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.180> case<00:02:06.390> with<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> US<00:02:07.140> market<00:02:07.649> or

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
also the case with the US market or

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.290 
also the case with the US market or
European<00:02:08.280> markets<00:02:08.700> where<00:02:08.879> there's<00:02:09.239> very

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
European markets where there's very

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.410 
European markets where there's very
little

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
little

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.480 
little
very<00:02:11.110> little<00:02:11.290> growth<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:11.950> terms<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
very little growth in terms of the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.890 
very little growth in terms of the
birthrate<00:02:12.820> I<00:02:12.940> know<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.270> Canadian<00:02:13.450> birthrate

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
birthrate I know the Canadian birthrate

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.380 
birthrate I know the Canadian birthrate
is<00:02:14.020> weaker<00:02:14.320> than<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.590> US<00:02:14.830> but<00:02:15.100> but<00:02:15.640> still<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
is weaker than the US but but still the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.180 
is weaker than the US but but still the
immigration<00:02:16.930> picture<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.350> arguably<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.010> little

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
immigration picture is arguably a little

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.820 
immigration picture is arguably a little
bit<00:02:18.280> stronger<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.510> Canada<00:02:20.110> than<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.590> US

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
bit stronger in in Canada than in the US

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.250 
bit stronger in in Canada than in the US
for<00:02:21.010> example<00:02:21.490> so<00:02:21.690> why<00:02:22.690> why<00:02:23.320> can't<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.890> guess

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
for example so why why can't it I guess

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.920 
for example so why why can't it I guess
well<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.010> great<00:02:27.160> question<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.780> we've<00:02:28.780> had

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
well it's a great question so we've had

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.270 
well it's a great question so we've had
strong<00:02:29.140> integration<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.800> Canada<00:02:30.100> for<00:02:30.220> a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
strong integration in Canada for a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.700 
strong integration in Canada for a
period<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.520> time<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.880> think<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.210> will<00:02:31.710> get

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
period of time I think it will get

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.170 
period of time I think it will get
weaker<00:02:33.100> you'll<00:02:33.310> see<00:02:33.460> less<00:02:33.610> immigrants<00:02:34.000> coming

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
weaker you'll see less immigrants coming

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.880 
weaker you'll see less immigrants coming
over<00:02:34.510> there<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.230> an<00:02:35.350> argument<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.710> be<00:02:35.800> made

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
over there is an argument to be made

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.820 
over there is an argument to be made
that<00:02:36.210> every<00:02:37.210> country<00:02:37.420> or<00:02:37.870> every<00:02:38.170> region<00:02:38.590> the

that every country or every region the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
US Canada Europe that have low

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.170 
US Canada Europe that have low
population<00:02:41.890> growth<00:02:42.040> naturally<00:02:42.610> are<00:02:42.790> fighting

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
population growth naturally are fighting

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.550 
population growth naturally are fighting
for<00:02:43.330> immigrants<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.870> some<00:02:44.020> degree<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
for immigrants of some degree and

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.260 
for immigrants of some degree and
immigrants<00:02:45.400> are<00:02:45.460> going<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.640> follow<00:02:45.760> Economic

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
immigrants are going to follow Economic

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.100 
immigrants are going to follow Economic
Opportunity<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.800> think<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.490> case<00:02:48.640> of

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
Opportunity and I think in the case of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.110 
Opportunity and I think in the case of
Canada<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:51.070> big<00:02:51.280> difference<00:02:51.610> now<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.970> that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
Canada the big difference now is that

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.600 
Canada the big difference now is that
you<00:02:52.209> have<00:02:52.330> whole<00:02:52.570> prices<00:02:53.020> which<00:02:53.320> are<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:54.520> know

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
you have whole prices which are you know

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.580 
you have whole prices which are you know
have<00:02:54.730> increased<00:02:55.120> on<00:02:55.240> basically<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.750> straight

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
have increased on basically a straight

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.040 
have increased on basically a straight
line<00:02:56.770> for<00:02:57.010> over<00:02:57.220> 25<00:02:57.670> years<00:02:57.700> now<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.540> the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
line for over 25 years now and the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.810 
line for over 25 years now and the
housing<00:02:59.470> markets<00:02:59.800> in<00:02:59.920> general<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.280> lot<00:03:00.580> less

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
housing markets in general a lot less

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.020 
housing markets in general a lot less
affordable<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.840> when<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.500> layer<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.310> the

affordable and when you layer in the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.310 
affordable and when you layer in the
other<00:03:04.180> dynamic<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.840> we<00:03:04.959> need<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.140> talk<00:03:05.260> about

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
other dynamic that we need to talk about

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.860 
other dynamic that we need to talk about
is<00:03:05.650> how<00:03:05.860> does<00:03:06.040> currency<00:03:06.430> play<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.880> how<00:03:07.810> do

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
is how does currency play in how do

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.630 
is how does currency play in how do
immigrants<00:03:08.650> feel<00:03:08.770> about<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.220> economic

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
immigrants feel about the economic

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.400 
immigrants feel about the economic
opportunity<00:03:10.209> let's<00:03:10.630> say<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.080> Canada

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
opportunity let's say in the Canada

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.380 
opportunity let's say in the Canada
versus<00:03:11.680> u.s.<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.190> you're<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.370> foreign<00:03:12.820> buyer<00:03:13.030> or

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
versus u.s. if you're a foreign buyer or

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.910 
versus u.s. if you're a foreign buyer or
an<00:03:13.630> immigrant<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.230> you've<00:03:14.350> bought<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.590> house

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
an immigrant and you've bought a house

an immigrant and you've bought a house
in<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.160> last<00:03:15.430> but<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.750> last<00:03:16.810> year

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
in the last but just in the last year

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.259 
in the last but just in the last year
for<00:03:17.380> example<00:03:17.410> if<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.519> had<00:03:18.610> bought<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.790> US<00:03:19.060> house

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
for example if you had bought a US house

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.060 
for example if you had bought a US house
you<00:03:19.900> would<00:03:19.989> actually<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.739> house<00:03:20.860> in<00:03:20.980> the

you would actually the house in the

you would actually the house in the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
United States you would be looking at

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.460 
United States you would be looking at
gains<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.750> purely<00:03:22.959> on<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.200> currency

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
gains just purely on the currency

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.320 
gains just purely on the currency
dynamic<00:03:24.040> if<00:03:24.519> you're<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> foreign<00:03:25.030> buyer<00:03:25.150> you

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
dynamic if you're a foreign buyer you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.759 
dynamic if you're a foreign buyer you
let<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.510> house<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.870> less<00:03:26.019> expose<00:03:26.350> in<00:03:26.500> Canada

a<00:03:29.620> 15<00:03:29.920> percent<00:03:30.250> loss<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:31.269> I<00:03:31.300> think<00:03:31.450> some<00:03:31.870> of

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
a 15 percent loss so I think some of

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.960 
a 15 percent loss so I think some of
that<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:33.100> know<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.340> guys<00:03:33.519> are<00:03:33.700> intimately

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
these people taking on mortgages but

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.600 
these people taking on mortgages but
rather<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:57.100> immigrant<00:03:57.550> population

so if we look at the drivers of

two and a half three percent mortgage
rate<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.950> don't<00:04:54.490> think<00:04:54.640> there's<00:04:54.760> anywhere<00:04:55.120> in

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
rate I don't think there's anywhere in

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.960 
rate I don't think there's anywhere in
the<00:04:55.480> world<00:04:55.840> literally<00:04:56.770> in<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.010> world<00:04:57.310> where<00:04:57.940> a

the world literally in the world where a

the world literally in the world where a
similar<00:04:58.270> borrower<00:04:58.870> with<00:04:59.020> that<00:04:59.140> credit

similar borrower with that credit

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.050 
similar borrower with that credit
profile<00:04:59.890> could<00:05:00.130> actually<00:05:00.310> get<00:05:00.640> that<00:05:00.820> kind<00:05:01.000> of

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
profile could actually get that kind of

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.910 
profile could actually get that kind of
mortgage<00:05:01.390> at<00:05:01.510> that<00:05:01.630> rate<00:05:01.840> so<00:05:02.650> is<00:05:02.770> there<00:05:02.890> a

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
mortgage at that rate so is there a

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.190 
mortgage at that rate so is there a
credit<00:05:03.250> problem<00:05:03.550> sure<00:05:03.760> we're<00:05:04.690> pushing<00:05:04.930> up

there in the housing downturn here the
the<00:05:36.220> levels<00:05:36.520> in<00:05:36.730> terms<00:05:36.910> of<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.060> debt

the levels in terms of the debt
servicing<00:05:37.660> costs<00:05:37.990> were<00:05:38.080> much<00:05:38.440> lower<00:05:38.740> that

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
servicing costs were much lower that

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.700 
servicing costs were much lower that
caused<00:05:39.730> the<00:05:39.910> housing<00:05:40.240> market<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:40.510> turnover<00:05:41.020> so

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
caused the housing market to turnover so

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.190 
caused the housing market to turnover so
I<00:05:41.740> think<00:05:41.950> well<00:05:42.910> I<00:05:42.940> know<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.240> government<00:05:43.660> is<00:05:43.750> is

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
I think well I know the government is is

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.660 
I think well I know the government is is
so<00:05:44.440> uncomfortable<00:05:44.770> with<00:05:45.070> those<00:05:45.190> levels<00:05:45.520> I

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
so uncomfortable with those levels I

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.160 
so uncomfortable with those levels I
think<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:46.120> issue<00:05:46.270> here<00:05:46.420> is<00:05:46.720> that<00:05:46.870> you're<00:05:47.080> at

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
think the issue here is that you're at

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.690 
think the issue here is that you're at
the<00:05:47.290> lower<00:05:47.440> bound<00:05:47.740> on<00:05:47.860> mortgage<00:05:48.190> rates<00:05:48.430> the

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
the lower bound on mortgage rates the

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.940 
the lower bound on mortgage rates the
consumer<00:05:49.630> is<00:05:49.750> completely<00:05:50.350> stretched<00:05:50.740> in

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
consumer is completely stretched in

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.980 
consumer is completely stretched in
terms<00:05:51.130> of<00:05:51.250> servicing<00:05:51.700> that<00:05:51.730> debt<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.780> if<00:05:52.930> you

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
terms of servicing that debt so if you

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.330 
terms of servicing that debt so if you
have<00:05:53.080> any<00:05:53.320> sort<00:05:53.590> of<00:05:53.680> negative<00:05:53.860> variance

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
have any sort of negative variance

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.130 
have any sort of negative variance
whether<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.670> be<00:05:54.790> jobs<00:05:55.150> just<00:05:55.630> to<00:05:55.750> slow<00:05:55.990> down

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
whether it be jobs just to slow down

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.680 
whether it be jobs just to slow down
overall<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:57.370> credit<00:05:57.730> quality<00:05:58.030> situation

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
overall the credit quality situation

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.260 
overall the credit quality situation
will<00:05:59.200> become<00:05:59.530> very<00:06:00.160> apparent<00:06:00.580> that<00:06:00.910> there<00:06:01.150> are

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
will become very apparent that there are

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.420 
will become very apparent that there are
a<00:06:01.300> lot<00:06:01.510> of<00:06:01.540> borrowers<00:06:01.990> out<00:06:02.140> there<00:06:02.380> that<00:06:03.310> are

a lot of borrowers out there that are

a lot of borrowers out there that are

extraordinarily stressed and that's what

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.270 
extraordinarily stressed and that's what
we<00:06:05.050> expect<00:06:05.350> to<00:06:05.440> evolve<00:06:05.710> over<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:05.920> next<00:06:05.980> few

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
we expect to evolve over the next few

we expect to evolve over the next few
