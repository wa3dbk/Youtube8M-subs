noon<00:01:36.930> today<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.320> decided<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.130> wasn't<00:01:38.790> gonna<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060

able to finish it and so in an hour I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.870 
able to finish it and so in an hour I
threw<00:01:42.329> something<00:01:42.630> together<00:01:43.610> which<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.700> why<00:01:44.850> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
threw something together which is why I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.929 
threw something together which is why I
got<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.270> thing<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.439> thing<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.610> spring

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
got this thing this thing is not spring

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.530 
got this thing this thing is not spring
powered<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.790> good<00:01:50.790> old<00:01:50.939> gravity-powered

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
powered it's a good old gravity-powered

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.249 
powered it's a good old gravity-powered
one<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.619> based<00:01:52.860> off<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.430> think

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
one and this is based off I think

sure my computer's camera reverses but

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.869 
sure my computer's camera reverses but

this<00:03:37.879> is<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.090> prop<00:03:38.450> thinking<00:03:39.410> for<00:03:39.560> Halloween

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
this is a prop thinking for Halloween

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.080 
this is a prop thinking for Halloween
might<00:03:41.209> be<00:03:41.389> miles<00:03:42.609> Desmond<00:03:43.609> Miles<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:46.639> overall

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
might be miles Desmond Miles the overall

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.390 
might be miles Desmond Miles the overall
length<00:03:47.389> you<00:03:47.959> can<00:03:48.079> see<00:03:48.290> how<00:03:48.500> far<00:03:48.709> it<00:03:48.859> passes<00:03:49.250> my

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
length you can see how far it passes my

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.970 
length you can see how far it passes my
fingers<00:03:50.590> just<00:03:51.590> good<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:54.260> retracted<00:03:54.769> length

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
fingers just good the retracted length

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
fingers just good the retracted length
is<00:03:55.220> 10<00:03:55.549> inches<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.299> believe<00:03:57.519> yeah<00:03:58.519> it's<00:03:58.730> 10

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
is 10 inches I believe yeah it's 10

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.909 
is 10 inches I believe yeah it's 10
inches<00:03:59.329> retracted<00:04:01.780> extended<00:04:02.780> well<00:04:05.919> extended

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
inches retracted extended well extended

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.420 
inches retracted extended well extended
it<00:04:07.190> looks<00:04:07.519> like<00:04:07.730> it's<00:04:08.169> 21<00:04:09.169> and<00:04:09.319> a<00:04:09.379> half<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:10.400> I

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
it looks like it's 21 and a half so I

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.409 
it looks like it's 21 and a half so I
just<00:04:13.430> double-check<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.470> yeah

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
just double-check that yeah

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.689 
just double-check that yeah
extended<00:04:17.419> its<00:04:17.570> 20<00:04:17.930> 1/2<00:04:18.349> so<00:04:18.620> extended<00:04:19.370> its<00:04:19.459> over

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
extended its 20 1/2 so extended its over

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.230 
extended its 20 1/2 so extended its over
twice<00:04:20.260> its<00:04:21.260> original<00:04:21.409> length<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.880> there's

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
twice its original length and there's

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.760 
twice its original length and there's
nothing<00:04:23.570> holding<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:23.930> in<00:04:24.080> no<00:04:24.320> locking

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
nothing holding it in no locking

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.450 
nothing holding it in no locking
mechanism

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
mechanism

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.420 
mechanism
yeah<00:04:26.470> I<00:04:27.580> know<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:30.139> Spartan<00:04:30.530> one-to-four<00:04:31.100> has

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
yeah I know the Spartan one-to-four has

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.900 
yeah I know the Spartan one-to-four has
a<00:04:31.460> great<00:04:31.789> fucking<00:04:32.720> mechanism<00:04:33.199> to<00:04:33.319> keep<00:04:33.500> the

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
a great fucking mechanism to keep the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.020 
a great fucking mechanism to keep the
last<00:04:34.910> tier<00:04:35.470> locked<00:04:36.470> out<00:04:38.289> with<00:04:39.289> respect<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:40.130> be

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
last tier locked out with respect to be

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.390 
last tier locked out with respect to be
second<00:04:41.479> tier<00:04:41.660> so<00:04:41.930> they<00:04:42.080> think<00:04:42.979> when<00:04:43.099> it<00:04:43.220> comes

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
second tier so they think when it comes

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.180 
second tier so they think when it comes
out<00:04:43.639> they<00:04:43.819> lock<00:04:44.030> together<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:44.979> then<00:04:45.979> from

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
out they lock together and then from

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.499 
out they lock together and then from
there<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.550> says<00:04:46.759> a<00:04:46.789> simple<00:04:47.180> locking

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
there you says a simple locking

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.350 
there you says a simple locking
mechanism<00:04:48.199> I<00:04:48.610> attached<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.789> his<00:04:49.880> wrist<00:04:50.150> that

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
mechanism I attached to his wrist that

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.559 
mechanism I attached to his wrist that
just<00:04:50.840> kind<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.050> pushes<00:04:51.380> down<00:04:51.830> on<00:04:52.240> here<00:04:53.240> so<00:04:53.449> the

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
just kind of pushes down on here so the

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.680 
just kind of pushes down on here so the
second<00:04:54.080> tier<00:04:54.259> doesn't<00:04:54.560> move<00:04:54.710> around<00:04:54.889> and<00:04:55.690> then

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
second tier doesn't move around and then

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.600 
second tier doesn't move around and then
he<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.289> the<00:04:57.410> same<00:04:57.620> locking<00:04:57.919> mechanism<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.460> hold

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
he is the same locking mechanism to hold

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.100 
he is the same locking mechanism to hold
everything<00:04:59.380> inside<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:02.360> he<00:05:02.449> can<00:05:02.599> move<00:05:02.750> his<00:05:02.810> arm

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
everything inside so he can move his arm

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.370 
everything inside so he can move his arm
around<00:05:04.479> but<00:05:05.479> yeah<00:05:05.710> that's<00:05:06.710> my<00:05:08.110> gravity<00:05:09.110> hidden

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
around but yeah that's my gravity hidden

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.339 
around but yeah that's my gravity hidden
blade<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:11.840> want<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.160> take<00:05:13.160> a<00:05:13.190> peek<00:05:13.520> at<00:05:14.349> Spartan

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
blade you want to take a peek at Spartan

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.600 
blade you want to take a peek at Spartan
1<00:05:15.560> 2<00:05:15.740> 4<00:05:17.440> that's<00:05:18.440> where<00:05:18.650> I<00:05:18.680> got<00:05:18.889> the<00:05:19.009> design<00:05:19.280> from

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
1 2 4 that's where I got the design from

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.759 
1 2 4 that's where I got the design from
and<00:05:21.009> see<00:05:22.009> you<00:05:22.099> guys<00:05:22.250> later<00:05:22.280> bye
