00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.700
 and nintendo is on the rope 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.950
 Loose nor nintendo 3ds nor will you have 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.740
 achieved the sales targets of 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.140
 Nintendo Nintendo foresees losses 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.260
 annual for the fiscal year total of 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.760
 2013 worth 35 billion 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.850
 yen what is the same as 246.36 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.800
 million euros a figure 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.350
 chilling at least is what has 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.560
 could inform the central itself 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.810
 japanese good sales of nintendo 3ds 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.030
 have been but unfortunately without 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.220
 achieve the objectives proposed by 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.500
 nintendo the console has strong 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.660
 sales in the Japanese market in the case 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.960
 of nintendo 3ds that you have sold 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.140
 approximately 4.9 million units 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.660
 all this in 2013 so it stays 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.180
 the doors of the nintendo lens 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.329
 5 million units of Nintendo 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.800
 3ds is that if they get close enough 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.200
 attentive to the words of nintendo that 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.180
 they say however outside Japan though 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.540
 It has increased market share 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.670
 by launching attractive titles 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.770
 in the year nintendo 3ds has not reached 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.440
 our sales goals nintendo 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 stresses that even though nintendo 3ds 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.120
 has been the most sold console in 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.910
 markets like the USA has not reached the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.190
 forecasts that Nintendo had planned 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.410
 but let 's talk about the weak point of 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.110
 nintendo in these moments let's talk about 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.600
 whose wiiu situation in the case of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.360
 this desktop console from nintendo to 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.520
 seem to have experienced some progress 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.130
 at the end of the year they have been 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 throwing several attractive titles after 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.200
 the summer and have launched packs at prices 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.020
 affordable according to nintendo both in 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.100
 europe as in usa as with nintendo 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.229
 3ds 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.380
 apparently will not reach the objectives 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.360
 of recovery that they had thought of 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.550
 nintendo but this time the thing is more 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.920
 would be in the case of wii the margin is 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.770
 much bigger the sales of states 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.380
 united and europe in particular point 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.720
 have been significantly lower than 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.820
 our original forecasts both in 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.160
 hardware like in games obviously 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.810
 all this affects something to nintendo and it's 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.270
 in all those losses 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.610
 are going to pay attention to the forecast of 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.489
 losses looming for the company 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.709
 Nintendo Nintendo has explained that no 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.989
 achieve your sales goals this 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.760
 leads them to predict estimates 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.760
 lower for total sales and 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.160
 benefits why they review their 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.720
 fiscal forecasts up to losses 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.670
 worth 35 billion yen 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.310
 246 with 35 million euros for the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.680
 total of the fiscal year that will close on 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.530
 next March 31 of this same 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.690
 year more than complicated situation for 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.690
 nintendo and especially for wii
