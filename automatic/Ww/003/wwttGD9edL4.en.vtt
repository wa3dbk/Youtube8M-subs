00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
fruit are easier to pick and easier to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.660 
fruit are easier to pick and easier to
handle<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.390> fruit<00:01:18.780> has<00:01:19.049> got<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.369> one

handle this fruit has got to be on a one
to<00:01:20.850> ten<00:01:20.880> I'd<00:01:21.330> call<00:01:21.600> most<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> varieties<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to ten I'd call most of the varieties of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710 
to ten I'd call most of the varieties of
red<00:01:23.040> or<00:01:23.189> pink<00:01:23.430> dragon<00:01:23.640> fruit<00:01:24.030> I've<00:01:24.210> eaten<00:01:24.450> I'd

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
red or pink dragon fruit I've eaten I'd

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.160 
red or pink dragon fruit I've eaten I'd
probably<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.619> ahead<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.950> give<00:01:26.840> four<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.020> A<00:01:28.080> six

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
probably go ahead and give four to A six

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.770 
probably go ahead and give four to A six
perhaps<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.340> fruit<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> easily<00:01:30.299> as<00:01:30.420> seven

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
perhaps this fruit is easily as seven

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.789 
perhaps this fruit is easily as seven
two<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:30.930> eight

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
two and eight

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.100 
two and eight
it's<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.610> significantly<00:01:33.360> better<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.990> it's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it's it's significantly better and it's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140 
it's it's significantly better and it's
worth<00:01:34.409> removing<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> stem<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.729> we're<00:01:36.060> gonna

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
worth removing the stem so we're gonna

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.730 
worth removing the stem so we're gonna
go<00:01:36.329> ahead<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.689> pick<00:01:36.869> some<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.170> these<00:01:37.259> off<00:01:37.500> I'll

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
go ahead and pick some of these off I'll

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.749 
go ahead and pick some of these off I'll
show<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> how<00:01:39.829> here's<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> close-up<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
show you how here's the close-up of the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.870 
show you how here's the close-up of the
fruits<00:01:42.680> this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> first<00:01:44.280> time<00:01:44.610> these

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
fruits this is the first time these

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.410 
fruits this is the first time these
plants<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.509> cropped<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.320> my<00:01:46.530> garden

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
plants have cropped here in my garden

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.410 
plants have cropped here in my garden
the<00:01:48.420> yield<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:49.009> significant<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.220> very<00:01:50.909> happy

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the yield is significant I'm very happy

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.850 
the yield is significant I'm very happy
about<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.049> see<00:01:52.409> here

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
about what I see here

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
about what I see here
I<00:01:53.060> haven't<00:01:54.060> actually<00:01:54.360> counted<00:01:54.869> them<00:01:55.049> but

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
I haven't actually counted them but

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.429 
I haven't actually counted them but
they're<00:01:55.649> fruit<00:01:56.009> all<00:01:56.280> over<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> place<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.439> so

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
they're fruit all over the place here so

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.289 
they're fruit all over the place here so
I<00:01:58.740> guess<00:01:58.950> we're<00:01:59.130> gonna<00:01:59.250> find<00:01:59.549> ourselves<00:01:59.729> one

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I guess we're gonna find ourselves one

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.200 
I guess we're gonna find ourselves one
that<00:02:00.479> looks<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.020> pretty<00:02:01.079> ripe<00:02:02.210> that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that looks like it's pretty ripe that

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.209 
that looks like it's pretty ripe that
guy<00:02:03.479> right<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:03.780> he<00:02:04.530> looks<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> good

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
guy right there he looks like a good

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.300 
guy right there he looks like a good
candidate<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.509> I'll<00:02:06.659> remove<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.439> so

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
candidate so I'll remove that one so

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
candidate so I'll remove that one so
when<00:02:08.580> picking<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.149> yellow<00:02:09.420> dragon<00:02:09.869> fruit<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
first thing we have to do is get rid of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.860 
first thing we have to do is get rid of
those<00:02:12.209> spines
