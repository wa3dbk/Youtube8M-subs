00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
in this I believe 185 inch wingspan

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.750 
in this I believe 185 inch wingspan
glider<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.500> above<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> yeah<00:00:47.309> well<00:00:47.550> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
glider you have above it yeah well you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.639 
glider you have above it yeah well you
know<00:00:47.910> me<00:00:48.089> and<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.269> gliders<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.839> like<00:00:49.019> the<00:00:49.230> big

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
know me and the gliders I like the big

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.889 
know me and the gliders I like the big
scale<00:00:49.890> some<00:00:50.190> planes<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.030> had<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:51.660> good

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
scale some planes and we had really good

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.000 
scale some planes and we had really good
success<00:00:52.109> with<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.620> blanik

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
success with the blanik

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.689 
success with the blanik
and<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:55.379> blending<00:00:55.739> was<00:00:55.920> great<00:00:56.249> in<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.609> many

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
and the blending was great in so many

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.489 
and the blending was great in so many
ways<00:00:57.030> however<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.170> didn't<00:00:58.379> offer

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
ways however it really didn't offer

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.439 
ways however it really didn't offer
itself<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> good<00:00:59.460> sort<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.179> soft

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
itself to have a good sort of soft

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
itself to have a good sort of soft
launching<00:01:00.809> system<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.249> lot<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> people

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
launching system and a lot of people

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
launching system and a lot of people
want<00:01:02.999> to<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.179> the<00:01:03.300> big<00:01:03.449> sail<00:01:03.659> planes<00:01:03.929> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
want to have the big sail planes that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500 
want to have the big sail planes that
they<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.280> know<00:01:05.370> how<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.519> arrow<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
they don't know how to arrow to or the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.320 
they don't know how to arrow to or the
none<00:01:06.690> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.870> slope<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.500> we're<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.770> let's

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
none of the slope so we're like let's

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.610 
none of the slope so we're like let's
let's<00:01:09.330> make<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.810> nice<00:01:09.930> glider<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> then

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
let's make a really nice glider and then

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.530 
let's make a really nice glider and then
have<00:01:10.890> an<00:01:11.010> electric<00:01:11.340> launch<00:01:11.550> system<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.300> so

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
have an electric launch system for it so

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
have an electric launch system for it so
that<00:01:13.350> was<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> idea<00:01:13.680> behind<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.520> whole

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that was the idea behind the whole

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.430 
that was the idea behind the whole
project<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.450> needed<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> follow-on<00:01:16.229> from

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
project and we needed a follow-on from

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.230 
project and we needed a follow-on from
the<00:01:16.590> blanik<00:01:16.800> Missa<00:01:17.100> Blahnik<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.640> successful

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the blanik Missa Blahnik was successful

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.230 
the blanik Missa Blahnik was successful
in<00:01:18.390> new<00:01:18.540> varieties<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:19.820> we're<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:20.969> happy

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
in new varieties so we're really happy

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.109 
in new varieties so we're really happy
it's<00:01:21.450> had<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:21.869> very<00:01:22.409> well<00:01:22.740> received<00:01:23.119> you

good so we want to try and help seed

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.270 
good so we want to try and help seed
that<00:01:29.820> segment<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.840> our<00:01:31.200> sea<00:01:31.500> which<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.799> great

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
that segment of our sea which is great

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.389 
that segment of our sea which is great
as<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:32.880> our<00:01:32.969> bigger<00:01:33.240> atoll<00:01:33.570> vent

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
as you know with our bigger atoll vent

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.240 
as you know with our bigger atoll vent
it's<00:01:35.399> four<00:01:36.210> point<00:01:36.390> seven<00:01:36.659> meters<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it's four point seven meters it's a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.980 
it's four point seven meters it's a
little<00:01:38.520> bit<00:01:38.640> smaller<00:01:38.969> than<00:01:39.060> third<00:01:39.420> scale<00:01:39.750> it's

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
little bit smaller than third scale it's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.160 
little bit smaller than third scale it's
not<00:01:40.140> quite<00:01:40.350> third<00:01:40.590> scale<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:42.509> that's<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.960> lot

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
not quite third scale and that's a lot

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.870 
not quite third scale and that's a lot
of<00:01:43.289> that's<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.829> with<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.670> that

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
of that's to do with it's just like that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.910 
of that's to do with it's just like that
sweet<00:01:45.180> spot<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.600> size<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.200> shipping<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.890> we

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
sweet spot in size for shipping so we

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.880 
sweet spot in size for shipping so we
can<00:01:47.100> ship<00:01:47.219> it<00:01:47.280> effectively<00:01:48.380> it's<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> big<00:01:49.649> model

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
can ship it effectively it's a big model

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.830 
can ship it effectively it's a big model
but<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.250> not<00:01:50.310> too<00:01:50.670> big<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.329> won't<00:01:51.570> fit<00:01:51.750> in

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
but it's not too big there won't fit in

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
but it's not too big there won't fit in
people's<00:01:52.109> cars<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.649> breaks<00:01:52.890> down<00:01:52.979> pretty

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
people's cars it breaks down pretty

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.240 
people's cars it breaks down pretty
small<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:53.909> fit<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.299> most<00:01:54.509> cars<00:01:55.100> uses<00:01:56.100> all

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
small little fit in most cars uses all

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.740 
small little fit in most cars uses all

pretty much standard equipment
we<00:01:57.960> designed<00:01:58.579> retrack<00:01:59.579> systems<00:01:59.969> specifically

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
we designed retrack systems specifically

away<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.439> go

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
away you go

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.240 
away you go
it's<00:02:08.190> fantastic<00:02:09.320> with<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.500> power<00:02:10.920> system

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
it's fantastic with the power system

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.380 
it's fantastic with the power system
that<00:02:11.280> you're<00:02:11.430> using<00:02:11.460> on<00:02:11.760> what<00:02:12.180> type<00:02:12.360> of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that you're using on what type of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.180 
that you're using on what type of
battery<00:02:12.780> requirements<00:02:13.290> does<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.500> have<00:02:13.650> well

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
battery requirements does it have well

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.500 
battery requirements does it have well
what<00:02:14.550> we're<00:02:14.700> trying<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.970> do<00:02:15.090> with<00:02:15.240> all<00:02:15.360> our

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
what we're trying to do with all our

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.750 
what we're trying to do with all our
power<00:02:15.750> systems<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.710> kind<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.430> one

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
power systems is is kind of have one

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.430 
power systems is is kind of have one
platform<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.720> work<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.080> several

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
platform that can work in several

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.980 
platform that can work in several
different<00:02:19.560> aircraft<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.520> same

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
different aircraft so it's the same

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.750 
different aircraft so it's the same
battery<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.320> speed<00:02:22.560> control<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:23.220> use<00:02:23.520> in

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
battery and speed control that we use in

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.610 
battery and speed control that we use in
the<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.360> haboos<00:02:24.659> series<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.590> jets<00:02:25.800> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the in the haboos series of jets you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.820 
the in the haboos series of jets you
so<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.430> success<00:02:27.640> 5,000<00:02:28.629> pack

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
so it's a success 5,000 pack

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.800 
so it's a success 5,000 pack
I<00:02:29.860> think<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.580> an<00:02:30.730> 80<00:02:30.909> amp<00:02:31.120> speed<00:02:31.390> controller

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
I think it's an 80 amp speed controller

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.259 
I think it's an 80 amp speed controller
and<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.349> power<00:02:32.620> 60<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.250> flight<00:02:33.489> power<00:02:33.700> 60<00:02:34.090> motor

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
and a power 60 a flight power 60 motor

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.170 
and a power 60 a flight power 60 motor
which<00:02:35.140> will<00:02:35.319> sustain<00:02:35.530> about<00:02:36.129> a<00:02:36.159> 25<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.790> 30

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
which will sustain about a 25 to 30

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.210 
which will sustain about a 25 to 30
degree<00:02:37.540> climb<00:02:37.900> rate<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:38.950> get<00:02:39.069> about

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
degree climb rate and you can get about

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.009 
degree climb rate and you can get about
six<00:02:39.519> or<00:02:39.700> seven<00:02:40.000> launches<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.569> eight<00:02:40.750> or<00:02:40.900> nine

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
six or seven launches to eight or nine

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.979 
six or seven launches to eight or nine
hundred<00:02:41.049> feet<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.000> pack<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.659> still<00:02:43.840> have

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
hundred feet on that pack and still have

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.339 
hundred feet on that pack and still have
some<00:02:44.230> left<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.390> what's<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.659> projected

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
some left so what's the projected

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.720 
some left so what's the projected
availability<00:02:48.000> well<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:49.239> on<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.569> water<00:02:50.019> so

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
availability well it's on the water so

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.250 
availability well it's on the water so
we're<00:02:51.730> saying<00:02:52.030> six<00:02:52.510> or<00:02:52.659> seven<00:02:52.930> weeks<00:02:53.049> you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
we're saying six or seven weeks you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.680 
we're saying six or seven weeks you
should<00:02:53.379> see<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.799> in<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.920> stores

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
should see it in the stores

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.119 
should see it in the stores
well<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.750> looks<00:02:55.900> beautiful<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.440> certainly

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
well it looks beautiful and certainly

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.369 
well it looks beautiful and certainly
well<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.480> said<00:02:58.690> it'll<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:58.900> great<00:02:59.079> for<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
well as you said it'll be great for the

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.509 
well as you said it'll be great for the
segment<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.829> doesn't<00:02:59.950> have<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> way<00:03:00.459> to

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
segment that doesn't have a way to

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.280 
segment that doesn't have a way to
launch<00:03:00.760> their<00:03:00.970> aircraft<00:03:01.359> if<00:03:01.840> they<00:03:01.989> don't<00:03:02.170> have

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
launch their aircraft if they don't have

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.289 
launch their aircraft if they don't have
an<00:03:02.410> arrow<00:03:02.620> toe<00:03:02.920> or<00:03:03.190> other<00:03:03.310> way<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.519> launch<00:03:03.790> this

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
an arrow toe or other way to launch this

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.960 
an arrow toe or other way to launch this
we'll<00:03:04.450> get<00:03:04.540> them<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.140> air<00:03:05.290> simply<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.340> you

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
we'll get them in the air simply and you

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.970 
we'll get them in the air simply and you
said<00:03:07.180> up<00:03:07.629> to<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> seven<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.319> nine<00:03:08.500> launches

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
said up to the seven to nine launches

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.160 
said up to the seven to nine launches
yeah<00:03:09.609> bet<00:03:09.790> seven<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.209> nine<00:03:10.390> launches<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.019> you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
yeah bet seven to nine launches and you

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.890 
yeah bet seven to nine launches and you
can<00:03:11.470> have<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:11.799> towable<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.909> launch<00:03:13.569> a<00:03:13.750> ball

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
can have it towable and launch a ball

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.690 
can have it towable and launch a ball
within<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.620> same<00:03:14.829> application

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
within the same application

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.149 
within the same application
it<00:03:16.060> requires<00:03:16.450> no<00:03:16.569> nose<00:03:17.230> ballast<00:03:17.709> if<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.040> do

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
it requires no nose ballast if you do

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.339 
it requires no nose ballast if you do
the<00:03:18.310> electric<00:03:18.700> motor<00:03:18.909> if<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.959> don't<00:03:20.140> want<00:03:20.260> to

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
the electric motor if you don't want to

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.599 
the electric motor if you don't want to
do<00:03:20.409> electric<00:03:20.620> motor<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.129> so<00:03:21.250> you've<00:03:21.370> got<00:03:21.519> to

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
do electric motor it's so you've got to

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.339 
do electric motor it's so you've got to
put<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.209> LED<00:03:22.540> in<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.810> front<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.200> get<00:03:23.319> a

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
put that in LED in the front to get a

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.589 
put that in LED in the front to get a
balance<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.250> tell<00:03:24.849> people<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.180> put<00:03:25.480> the

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
balance so I tell people just put the

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.300 
balance so I tell people just put the
motor<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.140> take<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.680> propeller<00:03:26.980> off<00:03:27.159> if

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
motor in it take the propeller off if

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.460 
motor in it take the propeller off if
you<00:03:27.430> want<00:03:27.609> you<00:03:27.730> can<00:03:27.879> narrow<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.420> or<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.319> can

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
you want you can narrow it or you can

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.080 
you want you can narrow it or you can
never<00:03:29.620> talk<00:03:29.829> with<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.190> motor<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.669> then<00:03:30.790> fly

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
never talk with the motor and then fly

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.629 
never talk with the motor and then fly
back<00:03:31.120> if<00:03:31.569> you<00:03:31.690> run<00:03:31.870> out<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.049> lift<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.590> it's<00:03:33.459> cool

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
back if you run out of lift so it's cool

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.800 
back if you run out of lift so it's cool
aeroplane<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.269> actually<00:03:34.569> put<00:03:34.780> the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
aeroplane we actually put the

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.069 
aeroplane we actually put the
