shoot you up and over big bunny hop over

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.110 
shoot you up and over big bunny hop over
that<00:02:25.870> obstacle<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.740> we're<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.790> ramp

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
that obstacle and we're on to this ramp

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.870 
that obstacle and we're on to this ramp
now<00:02:28.630> for<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:28.930> ramp<00:02:29.260> just<00:02:29.680> keep<00:02:30.400> both<00:02:30.610> tires

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
now for this ramp just keep both tires

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.760 
now for this ramp just keep both tires
down<00:02:31.210> as<00:02:31.420> long<00:02:31.570> as<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:32.020> full<00:02:32.380> throttle

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
down as long as you can full throttle

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.290 
down as long as you can full throttle
all<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:32.980> way<00:02:33.130> make<00:02:33.760> sure<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:34.000> have<00:02:34.090> full
