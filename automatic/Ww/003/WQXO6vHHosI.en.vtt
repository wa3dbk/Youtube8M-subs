00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
like is something called advanced oh is

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.800 
like is something called advanced oh is
or<00:01:31.200> optical<00:01:31.710> image<00:01:32.009> stabilization

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
or optical image stabilization

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.270

Panasonic's<00:01:33.810> advanced<00:01:34.259> oh<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.710> helped

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
Panasonic's advanced oh is helped

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
Panasonic's advanced oh is helped
suppress<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> effects<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.450> handshake<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
suppress the effects of handshake as you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.710 
suppress the effects of handshake as you
shoot<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:38.130> both<00:01:38.280> motion<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.939> still<00:01:39.390> images

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
shoot for both motion and still images

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.030 
shoot for both motion and still images
remember<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.320> take<00:01:40.470> stills<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.920> this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
remember you can take stills with this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.399 
remember you can take stills with this
as<00:01:41.189> well<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.970> way<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> system<00:01:42.570> works<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.990> it's

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
as well the way the system works is it's

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
as well the way the system works is it's
using<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> these<00:01:44.250> tiny<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.700> gyro

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
using all of these tiny little gyro

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.060 
using all of these tiny little gyro
sensors<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.049> detect<00:01:46.320> even<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> smallest
