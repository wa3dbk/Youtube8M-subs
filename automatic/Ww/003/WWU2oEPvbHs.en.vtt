00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
i think very important like the whole

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.170 
i think very important like the whole
business<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> tourism<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.950> consumerism<00:00:35.430> the

isms<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.810> world<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.260> very<00:00:37.440> fascinated<00:00:37.590> by

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
isms of the world I'm very fascinated by

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.979 
isms of the world I'm very fascinated by
I<00:00:38.340> mean<00:00:38.850> for<00:00:38.970> example<00:00:39.000> tourism<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
I mean for example tourism is the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.780 
I mean for example tourism is the
biggest<00:00:40.230> industry<00:00:40.650> in<00:00:40.830> the<00:00:40.950> world<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.430> that's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
biggest industry in the world and that's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.310 
biggest industry in the world and that's
something<00:00:42.059> I've<00:00:42.270> photographed<00:00:42.450> extensively

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
something I've photographed extensively

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.500 
something I've photographed extensively
I<00:00:43.650> think<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.730> very<00:00:44.760> important<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
I think it's very important to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.780 
I think it's very important to
understand<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.290> along<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.129> tourism<00:00:47.489> and

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
understand that along with tourism and

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.180 
understand that along with tourism and
all<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> growth<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.470> brings<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
all the growth that that brings and the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.290 
all the growth that that brings and the
wealth<00:00:50.400> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> economy<00:00:50.850> there<00:00:51.150> are<00:00:51.210> also

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
wealth of the economy there are also

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
wealth of the economy there are also
issues<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.900> problems<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.350> come<00:00:52.530> alongside

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
issues and problems that come alongside

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.030 
issues and problems that come alongside
it<00:00:53.220> so<00:00:53.450> part<00:00:54.450> of<00:00:54.510> my<00:00:54.690> job<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> like

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
demonstrate the difference between the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
mythology of a tourist location and the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.310 
mythology of a tourist location and the
actual<00:01:00.090> reality<00:01:00.660> when<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.110> there

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
actual reality when you get there

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.920 
actual reality when you get there
because<00:01:01.530> everyone's<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.309> got<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.570> phone<00:01:03.570> with

because everyone's now got a phone with

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.440 
because everyone's now got a phone with
a<00:01:03.960> camera<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.410> one<00:01:04.830> thing<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> happens<00:01:06.210> is

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
a camera in one thing that happens is

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.420 
a camera in one thing that happens is
that<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.840> go<00:01:07.050> for<00:01:07.530> example<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> tourist

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
that if you go for example to a tourist

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.639 
that if you go for example to a tourist
location<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.090> indeed<00:01:09.360> any<00:01:09.540> event<00:01:09.899> people

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
location or we indeed any event people

just<00:01:10.890> incessantly<00:01:11.490> photograph<00:01:11.970> sometimes<00:01:12.899> I

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
just incessantly photograph sometimes I

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.530 
just incessantly photograph sometimes I
wonder<00:01:13.259> when<00:01:13.830> people<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:14.550> whether

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
wonder when people are out there whether

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.820 
wonder when people are out there whether
they're<00:01:15.780> spending<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.170> time<00:01:16.229> actually

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
they're spending more time actually

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
they're spending more time actually
photographing<00:01:17.729> their<00:01:17.880> friends<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.390> front<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
photographing their friends in front of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260 
photographing their friends in front of
a<00:01:18.960> building<00:01:19.410> or<00:01:19.770> whatever<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> thing<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.970> then

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
a building or whatever the thing is then

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.609 
a building or whatever the thing is then
actually<00:01:21.600> looking<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.170> taking<00:01:22.410> it<00:01:22.440> in

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
actually looking at it and taking it in

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.520 
actually looking at it and taking it in
so<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.580> sense<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.240> could<00:01:24.869> argue<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.229> there

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
so in a sense I could argue that there

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.679 
so in a sense I could argue that there
is<00:01:25.619> too<00:01:25.830> much<00:01:25.950> photography

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.580 

where<00:01:33.689> we're<00:01:33.810> living<00:01:33.899> in<00:01:34.109> very<00:01:34.229> interesting

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
where we're living in very interesting

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.649 
where we're living in very interesting
times<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.609> I<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.939> fact<00:01:36.060> also<00:01:36.359> with<00:01:36.600> an

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
times and I like the fact also with an

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
times and I like the fact also with an
iPhone<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.649> modern<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
iPhone you can be a modern for the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.550 
iPhone you can be a modern for the
journalists<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.299> traditional<00:01:39.780> role<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
journalists the traditional role of the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.020 
journalists the traditional role of the
photo<00:01:40.770> journalist<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.369> terms<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
photo journalist in terms of the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.940 
photo journalist in terms of the
magazine<00:01:42.719> commission<00:01:43.319> that<00:01:43.439> that's<00:01:43.770> all

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
magazine commission that that's all

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.260 
magazine commission that that's all
finished<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.429> it's<00:01:44.610> probably<00:01:44.729> good<00:01:45.030> thing

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
finished and it's probably good thing

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.569 
finished and it's probably good thing
because<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.509> means<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.579> photographers

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
because it means that the photographers

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.490 
because it means that the photographers
like<00:01:48.060> myself<00:01:48.299> who<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.780> still<00:01:49.079> interested<00:01:49.259> in
