00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it out to people and I would take the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.130 
it out to people and I would take the
music<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.059> was<00:00:42.210> very<00:00:42.420> complicated

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
music that was very complicated

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.250 
music that was very complicated
choral<00:00:44.070> wise<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.149> put<00:00:45.390> very<00:00:45.570> simple<00:00:46.050> hooks

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
choral wise and I put very simple hooks

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.459 
choral wise and I put very simple hooks
on<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.820> withdraw<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.329> other<00:00:48.930> ear

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
on it and then withdraw that other ear

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.430 
on it and then withdraw that other ear
so<00:00:50.309> that's<00:00:51.239> that's<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.930> not<00:00:52.230> being

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so that's that's really what not being

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:12.010 
so that's that's really what not being
all<00:00:52.649> about<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:55.500> got<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.070> best<00:00:59.030> you<00:01:00.030> got<00:01:00.359> the

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
a great idea man so we can get more

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.200 
a great idea man so we can get more
traction<00:05:15.260> just<00:05:16.250> cover<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.580> whole<00:05:16.610> stage<00:05:17.000> with

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210
