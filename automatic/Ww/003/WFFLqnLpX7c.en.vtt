00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
and the turret is zero so that's our

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.540 
and the turret is zero so that's our
second<00:02:03.360> zero<00:02:03.740> we<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.890> zero<00:02:05.190> clearance

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
workpiece that's our second zero so for

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.860 
workpiece that's our second zero so for
our<00:02:19.470> third<00:02:19.800> zero<00:02:20.130> what<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.209> is

our third zero what we want to do is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.660 
our third zero what we want to do is
actually<00:02:22.170> take<00:02:22.620> our<00:02:22.800> indicator<00:02:23.310> that's

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
down to zero those are our three zeros

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.339 
down to zero those are our three zeros

zero zero zero our router is now
completely<00:02:40.590> zeroed<00:02:41.040> out<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:42.120> now<00:02:42.299> we<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:42.629> move

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
completely zeroed out so now we can move

completely zeroed out so now we can move
on<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.019> setting<00:02:43.260> depth<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.709> cut<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.299> the

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
on to setting depth of cut and the

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.970 
on to setting depth of cut and the
mortises<00:02:45.720> I'm<00:02:45.840> gonna<00:02:46.049> cut<00:02:46.319> are<00:02:46.560> actually

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
mortises I'm gonna cut are actually

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.140 
mortises I'm gonna cut are actually
going<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.129> be<00:02:47.190> three<00:02:47.580> quarters<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:48.000> an<00:02:48.090> inch

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
going to be three quarters of an inch

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.830 
going to be three quarters of an inch
deep<00:02:48.390> or<00:02:48.629> 19<00:02:49.260> millimeters<00:02:49.769> deep<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.879> here's

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
deep or 19 millimeters deep so here's

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.140 
deep or 19 millimeters deep so here's
the<00:02:52.080> biggest<00:02:52.500> mistake<00:02:53.159> that<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.549> see<00:02:53.670> folks

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the biggest mistake that I see folks

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.460 
the biggest mistake that I see folks
make<00:02:54.480> when<00:02:54.690> they're<00:02:54.840> adjusting<00:02:55.319> their

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
make when they're adjusting their

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.059 
make when they're adjusting their
routers<00:02:55.860> for<00:02:56.010> depth<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.400> cut<00:02:57.620> now<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:58.680> know<00:02:58.950> we

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
routers for depth of cut now we know we

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.430 
routers for depth of cut now we know we
need<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.310> go<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.489> 19<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.569> folks<00:03:00.870> will<00:03:01.049> often

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
need to go to 19 so folks will often

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.610 
need to go to 19 so folks will often
take<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.709> adjuster<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.870> move<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.170> 19

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
take the adjuster and move it to 19

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.880 
take the adjuster and move it to 19
millimeters<00:03:05.510> here's<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.660> problem<00:03:07.140> we

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
millimeters here's the problem we

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.190 
millimeters here's the problem we
haven't<00:03:08.250> created<00:03:08.459> any<00:03:08.819> clearance<00:03:09.329> here<00:03:09.750> for

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
haven't created any clearance here for

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.500 
haven't created any clearance here for
the<00:03:10.290> depth<00:03:10.500> rod<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:11.120> mentioned<00:03:12.120> earlier<00:03:12.420> that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
the depth rod I mentioned earlier that

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.270 
the depth rod I mentioned earlier that
the<00:03:12.840> depth<00:03:13.079> around<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.500> turret<00:03:13.799> system<00:03:13.980> is

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
the depth around the turret system is

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.880 
the depth around the turret system is
what<00:03:14.459> controls<00:03:14.849> depth<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.540> cut<00:03:15.780> now<00:03:16.650> if<00:03:16.769> I

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
what controls depth of cut now if I

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.699 
what controls depth of cut now if I
unlock<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.430> plunge<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.170> try<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.440> push

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
unlock this plunge and I try to push

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.280 
unlock this plunge and I try to push
down<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.489> not<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:21.090> anywhere<00:03:21.180> because<00:03:22.049> I

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
down it's not going anywhere because I

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.770 
down it's not going anywhere because I
don't<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:22.650> any<00:03:22.859> extra<00:03:23.250> clearance<00:03:23.549> here<00:03:23.879> so

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
don't have any extra clearance here so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.240 
don't have any extra clearance here so
the<00:03:25.530> proper<00:03:26.010> technique<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:27.019> actually<00:03:28.250> make

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
the proper technique is actually make

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.960 
the proper technique is actually make
sure<00:03:29.280> I've<00:03:29.549> got<00:03:29.579> my<00:03:29.879> zeros<00:03:30.319> zero<00:03:31.609> zero<00:03:32.609> and

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
sure I've got my zeros zero zero and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.670 
sure I've got my zeros zero zero and
zero<00:03:33.599> and<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.940> want<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.390> introduce<00:03:36.680> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
zero and now I want to introduce the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.809 
zero and now I want to introduce the
depth<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.760> I'm<00:03:38.879> going<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.209> cut<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.609> guide

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
depth that I'm going to cut to the guide

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.500 
depth that I'm going to cut to the guide
rod<00:03:42.120> as<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:43.470> move<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.950> up<00:03:44.190> in<00:03:44.370> turn<00:03:45.239> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
rod as I move that up in turn the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.129 
rod as I move that up in turn the
indicator<00:03:45.930> will<00:03:46.590> also<00:03:46.950> move<00:03:47.130> up<00:03:47.310> as<00:03:47.489> well<00:03:47.730> so

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
indicator will also move up as well so

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.720 
indicator will also move up as well so
I'm<00:03:49.139> going<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.380> actually<00:03:49.769> create<00:03:49.950> 19

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
I'm going to actually create 19

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.509 
I'm going to actually create 19
millimeters<00:03:51.389> of<00:03:51.599> clearance<00:03:52.139> between<00:03:52.519> the

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
millimeters of clearance between the

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.000 
millimeters of clearance between the
guide<00:03:53.819> rod<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:55.440> turret<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:58.560> check<00:03:58.799> my

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
guide rod and the turret and to check my

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.309 
guide rod and the turret and to check my
work<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.549> can<00:03:59.970> simply<00:04:00.359> plunge<00:04:00.690> down<00:04:00.930> all<00:04:01.200> the

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
work I can simply plunge down all the

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.159 
work I can simply plunge down all the
way<00:04:02.599> flip<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.780> router<00:04:03.959> over<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:06.169> then

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
way flip the router over and then

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.330 
way flip the router over and then
measure

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.580 

and<00:04:11.340> I'm<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:12.000> hair<00:04:12.240> beyond<00:04:12.599> 19<00:04:13.080> millimeters

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
and I'm a hair beyond 19 millimeters

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.280 
and I'm a hair beyond 19 millimeters
which<00:04:13.830> is<00:04:13.860> perfect<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.930> that's<00:04:15.930> how<00:04:16.230> simple

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
which is perfect and that's how simple

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.490 
which is perfect and that's how simple
it<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:16.980> to<00:04:17.549> zero<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.910> router<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.540> set<00:04:19.049> depth<00:04:19.350> of

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
it is to zero a router and set depth of

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.709 
it is to zero a router and set depth of
cut
