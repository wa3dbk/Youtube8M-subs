00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
speed and his is elusiveness on the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.630 
speed and his is elusiveness on the
kicking<00:03:30.140> game<00:03:30.170> sack<00:03:30.560> if<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.040> seen<00:03:31.430> having

yeah<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.780> think<00:03:35.870> we'll<00:03:36.140> what<00:03:36.940> they're<00:03:37.940> both

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
yeah I think we'll what they're both

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.300 
yeah I think we'll what they're both
going<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:38.630> know<00:03:38.750> platoon<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:40.220> know

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
going to you know platoon and you know

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.680 
going to you know platoon and you know
if<00:03:40.400> they<00:03:40.490> get<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.640> hot<00:03:40.820> hand<00:03:41.060> will<00:03:41.180> be<00:03:41.270> one<00:03:41.480> end

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
if they get a hot hand will be one end

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.350 
if they get a hot hand will be one end
you<00:03:42.200> know<00:03:43.100> they<00:03:43.310> kind<00:03:43.550> of<00:03:43.670> sub<00:03:43.880> each<00:03:44.000> other<00:03:44.210> you

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
you know they kind of sub each other you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.130 
you know they kind of sub each other you
know<00:03:44.420> so<00:03:44.750> if<00:03:44.840> someone<00:03:45.290> gets<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.820> long<00:03:46.820> run<00:03:47.240> or<00:03:47.450> as

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
a considerable amount of reps

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.870 
a considerable amount of reps
successively<00:03:50.660> then<00:03:50.900> they'll<00:03:51.050> rotate<00:03:51.880> Maurice

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
successively then they'll rotate Maurice

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.630 
successively then they'll rotate Maurice

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
it very well how do you aim lines with

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.339 
it very well how do you aim lines with
pots<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.330> wife<00:04:50.479> obviously<00:04:50.780> they<00:04:51.169> haven't

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
pots and wife obviously they haven't

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.930 
pots and wife obviously they haven't
played<00:04:51.919> under<00:04:52.069> the<00:04:52.159> lights<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.639> what<00:04:52.759> kind<00:04:52.909> of

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
played under the lights and what kind of

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.830 
played under the lights and what kind of
pressure<00:04:53.180> have<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.389> put<00:04:53.539> them<00:04:53.659> in<00:04:53.719> in

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
pressure have you put them in in

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.420 
pressure have you put them in in
practice<00:04:54.199> and<00:04:54.259> have<00:04:54.379> they<00:04:54.469> responded<00:04:54.590> again

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
practice and have they responded again

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.850 
practice and have they responded again
we've<00:04:55.629> extreme<00:04:56.629> pressure<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:57.409> know<00:04:57.500> not<00:04:57.680> just

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
we've extreme pressure you know not just

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.770 
we've extreme pressure you know not just
live<00:04:58.340> situations<00:04:59.030> but<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.449> know<00:04:59.539> the<00:04:59.629> whole

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
live situations but you know the whole

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.600 
live situations but you know the whole
team<00:04:59.990> stand<00:05:00.319> around<00:05:00.590> them<00:05:00.800> as<00:05:00.889> they<00:05:01.039> kept<00:05:01.250> on

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
team stand around them as they kept on

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.209 
team stand around them as they kept on
so<00:05:01.819> I<00:05:01.849> mean<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.389> we<00:05:02.740> we<00:05:03.740> get<00:05:03.889> after<00:05:04.099> in

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:04.219 
so I mean that it we we get after in

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:05.920 
so I mean that it we we get after in
pretty<00:05:04.400> good<00:05:04.550> so<00:05:04.789> again<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.150> think<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.780> idea

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
pretty good so again I think the idea

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.869 
pretty good so again I think the idea
there<00:05:06.319> is<00:05:06.349> to<00:05:06.469> make<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.830> game<00:05:07.009> easier<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.789> make

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
there is to make the game easier to make
