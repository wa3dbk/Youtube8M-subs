here's<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.390> real<00:00:19.779> reason<00:00:20.470> we're<00:00:21.130> here<00:00:21.369> on<00:00:21.489> the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
here's the real reason we're here on the

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.609 
here's the real reason we're here on the
salt<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.509> real<00:00:22.750> reason<00:00:23.140> we're<00:00:23.290> here<00:00:23.439> on<00:00:23.529> the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
salt the real reason we're here on the

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.200 
salt the real reason we're here on the
salt<00:00:23.860> is<00:00:24.070> because<00:00:24.430> we<00:00:24.640> came<00:00:24.820> out<00:00:25.000> with<00:00:25.149> a

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
salt is because we came out with a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.080 
salt is because we came out with a
filter<00:00:25.570> program<00:00:25.960> a<00:00:26.230> few<00:00:26.529> years<00:00:26.590> ago<00:00:26.919> and<00:00:27.369> some

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
filter program a few years ago and some

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.109 
filter program a few years ago and some
people<00:00:28.450> in<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.689> industry<00:00:28.960> said<00:00:29.439> well<00:00:30.119> you

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
people in the industry said well you

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.420 
people in the industry said well you
can't<00:00:31.450> really<00:00:31.630> flow<00:00:32.110> as<00:00:32.500> much<00:00:32.559> air<00:00:33.100> as<00:00:33.250> you're

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
can't really flow as much air as you're

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.890 
can't really flow as much air as you're
claiming<00:00:33.730> through<00:00:34.120> your<00:00:34.240> filter<00:00:34.480> they'll

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
claiming through your filter they'll

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.540 
claiming through your filter they'll
collapse<00:00:35.230> they'll<00:00:35.650> then<00:00:35.800> flow<00:00:36.040> they'll<00:00:36.310> fall

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
collapse they'll then flow they'll fall

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.400 
collapse they'll then flow they'll fall
apart<00:00:36.940> one<00:00:37.480> of<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.690> neat<00:00:37.870> things<00:00:37.900> about

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
coming here is we get to run a car with

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.480 
coming here is we get to run a car with
filters<00:00:41.110> over<00:00:41.380> four<00:00:41.770> hundred<00:00:41.800> miles<00:00:42.130> an<00:00:42.340> hour

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
filters over four hundred miles an hour

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.120 
filters over four hundred miles an hour
so<00:00:43.330> so<00:00:43.720> far<00:00:43.930> these<00:00:44.110> filters<00:00:44.560> have<00:00:44.710> gone<00:00:44.860> over

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
so so far these filters have gone over

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.940 
so so far these filters have gone over
four<00:00:45.310> hundred<00:00:45.340> miles<00:00:45.760> an<00:00:45.910> hour<00:00:46.030> three<00:00:46.450> times

made four passes last year I drove the
car<00:00:50.050> I<00:00:50.470> had<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:50.890> filters<00:00:51.250> in<00:00:51.400> there<00:00:51.610> they

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
car I had the filters in there they

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.760 
car I had the filters in there they
worked<00:00:52.090> extremely<00:00:52.510> well<00:00:52.780> in<00:00:53.140> fact<00:00:53.470> they

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
worked extremely well in fact they

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.160 
worked extremely well in fact they
worked<00:00:53.950> so<00:00:54.160> well<00:00:54.370> we're<00:00:55.180> still<00:00:55.450> using<00:00:55.720> them<00:00:56.020> on

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
worked so well we're still using them on

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.069 
worked so well we're still using them on
the<00:00:56.500> car<00:00:56.680> we<00:00:57.670> make<00:00:57.850> filters<00:00:58.239> in<00:00:58.390> four<00:00:58.660> colors

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
the car we make filters in four colors

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.340 
the car we make filters in four colors
red<00:00:59.560> blue<00:01:00.130> white<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.550> black<00:01:00.820> we<00:01:01.750> use<00:01:01.870> black<00:01:02.140> on

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
red blue white and black we use black on

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.979 
red blue white and black we use black on
the<00:01:02.440> race<00:01:02.620> car<00:01:02.860> because<00:01:03.280> I<00:01:03.550> like<00:01:04.390> black

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
the race car because I like black

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.340 
the race car because I like black
I<00:01:05.019> think<00:01:05.590> blacks<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:05.979> very<00:01:06.159> cool<00:01:06.340> color<00:01:07.350> black

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
I think blacks a very cool color black

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.350 
I think blacks a very cool color black
is<00:01:08.560> also<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.950> great<00:01:09.280> color<00:01:09.580> that<00:01:09.700> helps<00:01:10.240> explain

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
is also a great color that helps explain

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.840 
is also a great color that helps explain
why<00:01:10.750> filters<00:01:11.350> are<00:01:11.500> important<00:01:11.979> if<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:12.610> look<00:01:12.729> at

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
why filters are important if you look at

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.820 
why filters are important if you look at
our<00:01:12.970> car<00:01:13.240> you'll<00:01:13.840> see<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.170> we<00:01:14.290> have<00:01:14.409> scoops

car<00:01:34.900> they're<00:01:35.170> like<00:01:35.350> little<00:01:35.560> snorkel

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
car they're like little snorkel

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.000 
car they're like little snorkel
let's<00:01:36.729> stick<00:01:36.970> up<00:01:37.180> above<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:38.229> car<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.740> the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
let's stick up above the car in the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.340 
let's stick up above the car in the
clean<00:01:39.310> air<00:01:39.520> stream<00:01:39.880> it's<00:01:40.720> not<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.200> most

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
clean air stream it's not the most

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.190 
clean air stream it's not the most
aerodynamic<00:01:41.590> thing<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.520> do<00:01:42.700> but<00:01:43.630> they<00:01:43.810> do<00:01:43.869> that

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
aerodynamic thing to do but they do that

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.660 
aerodynamic thing to do but they do that
because<00:01:44.380> they<00:01:44.650> want<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:44.860> get<00:01:45.010> all<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.490> air

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
because they want to get all the air

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.490 
because they want to get all the air
they<00:01:45.850> can<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.390> they<00:01:46.570> think<00:01:46.930> that<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.200> filter

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
they can and they think that a filter

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.550 
they can and they think that a filter
will<00:01:48.369> restrict<00:01:49.150> air<00:01:49.420> flow<00:01:49.689> what<00:01:50.229> they<00:01:50.350> don't

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
will restrict air flow what they don't

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.109 
will restrict air flow what they don't
understand<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.250> if<00:01:51.430> you<00:01:51.549> make<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.760> filter

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
understand is that if you make a filter

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.179 
understand is that if you make a filter
correctly<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.080> you<00:01:53.350> shape<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.799> English

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
correctly and you shape the English

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.910 
correctly and you shape the English
correctly<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.960> don't<00:01:56.140> have<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.590> restrict

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
correctly you don't have to restrict

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.039 
correctly you don't have to restrict

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
airflow that much you can't still filter

because<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.530> can't<00:03:41.799> see<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.160> dirt<00:03:42.370> doesn't

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
because you can't see the dirt doesn't

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.920 
because you can't see the dirt doesn't
mean<00:03:43.090> it's<00:03:43.269> not<00:03:43.390> dirt

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930

here's<00:03:44.319> another<00:03:44.590> thing<00:03:44.799> people<00:03:44.980> don't<00:03:45.250> know

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
here's another thing people don't know

here's another thing people don't know
air<00:03:45.879> has<00:03:46.239> weight<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:47.099> cubic<00:03:48.099> foot<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.579> air

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760

weighs point zero six pounds point zero
six<00:03:53.260> pounds<00:03:53.709> is<00:03:53.829> one<00:03:54.099> cubic<00:03:54.430> foot<00:03:54.579> so<00:03:55.540> if<00:03:55.660> you

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
six pounds is one cubic foot so if you

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.229 
six pounds is one cubic foot so if you
multiply<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.319> by<00:03:56.530> two<00:03:56.760> thousand<00:03:57.760> cubic<00:03:58.060> feet

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
multiply that by two thousand cubic feet

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.650 
multiply that by two thousand cubic feet
