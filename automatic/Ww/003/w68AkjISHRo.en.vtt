simple little secret hidden door and

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.119 
simple little secret hidden door and
basically<00:00:07.210> it<00:00:07.540> works<00:00:07.720> by<00:00:08.050> using<00:00:08.080> bone<00:00:08.650> meal<00:00:08.919> as

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.129 
basically it works by using bone meal as

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.730 
basically it works by using bone meal as
the<00:00:09.280> key<00:00:09.459> and<00:00:09.759> as<00:00:10.419> you<00:00:10.660> can<00:00:10.780> see<00:00:10.809> here<00:00:11.200> when<00:00:11.709> I

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
the key and as you can see here when I

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.890 
the key and as you can see here when I
fine<00:00:12.339> meal<00:00:12.549> if<00:00:12.759> it<00:00:12.789> puts<00:00:13.389> piece<00:00:13.599> of<00:00:13.719> grass

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
fine meal if it puts piece of grass

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.830 
fine meal if it puts piece of grass
there<00:00:14.200> which<00:00:14.440> opens<00:00:14.889> the<00:00:15.039> door<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:15.339> then<00:00:16.299> you

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
there which opens the door and then you

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.600 
there which opens the door and then you
obviously<00:00:17.110> do<00:00:17.440> this<00:00:17.590> again<00:00:17.860> to<00:00:18.010> close<00:00:18.130> it<00:00:18.430> and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
obviously do this again to close it and

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.190 
obviously do this again to close it and
it<00:00:19.420> uses<00:00:19.570> a<00:00:19.870> 1<00:00:20.560> wide<00:00:20.770> there<00:00:21.700> bud<00:00:22.030> switch<00:00:22.200> to

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
it uses a 1 wide there bud switch to

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.350 
it uses a 1 wide there bud switch to
open<00:00:23.560> and<00:00:23.800> close<00:00:23.830> the<00:00:24.040> door<00:00:24.070> and<00:00:24.400> you<00:00:25.120> can't

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
open and close the door and you can't

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.090 
open and close the door and you can't
get<00:00:25.540> anything<00:00:25.900> else<00:00:26.170> there's<00:00:26.470> no<00:00:26.560> other<00:00:26.680> block

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
get anything else there's no other block

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.340 
get anything else there's no other block
you<00:00:27.250> can<00:00:27.400> put<00:00:27.550> there<00:00:27.760> so<00:00:28.510> if<00:00:28.660> I<00:00:28.720> try<00:00:29.110> and<00:00:29.200> put

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
you can put there so if I try and put

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.429 
you can put there so if I try and put
like<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.560> redstone<00:00:30.370> torch<00:00:30.960> or<00:00:31.960> anything<00:00:32.410> that

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
like a redstone torch or anything that

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.500 
like a redstone torch or anything that
it<00:00:32.800> won't<00:00:33.130> work<00:00:33.280> you<00:00:33.340> can't<00:00:33.760> get<00:00:34.000> anything<00:00:34.150> up

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
it won't work you can't get anything up

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.340 
it won't work you can't get anything up
there<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.050> less<00:00:35.680> use<00:00:35.890> by<00:00:36.130> mill<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:38.230> yeah

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
there and less use by mill and so yeah

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.229 
there and less use by mill and so yeah
it's<00:00:38.470> just<00:00:38.590> really<00:00:38.710> simple<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.250> here<00:00:39.940> is<00:00:40.090> how

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
it's just really simple and here is how

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.630 
it's just really simple and here is how
to<00:00:40.300> build<00:00:40.570> it<00:00:40.720> ok<00:00:41.590> so<00:00:41.650> to<00:00:41.920> start<00:00:42.220> we're<00:00:42.400> going

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
to build it ok so to start we're going

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.430 
to build it ok so to start we're going
to<00:00:42.700> build<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.120> block<00:00:43.420> updated<00:00:43.930> sector<00:00:44.230> and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
to build the block updated sector and

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.750 
to build the block updated sector and
that's<00:00:44.590> going<00:00:44.739> to<00:00:44.800> be<00:00:44.950> going<00:00:45.399> to<00:00:45.520> pull<00:00:45.610> up<00:00:45.670> that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
that's going to be going to pull up that

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.700 
that's going to be going to pull up that
a<00:00:45.820> few<00:00:46.000> in<00:00:46.060> the<00:00:46.149> air<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:47.260> put<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.440> piece<00:00:47.680> of

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
a few in the air and put a piece of

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.590 
a few in the air and put a piece of
glass<00:00:48.190> here<00:00:48.520> with<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:48.790> piece<00:00:48.940> of<00:00:48.970> sand<00:00:49.360> on<00:00:49.570> top

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
glass here with a piece of sand on top

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.460 
glass here with a piece of sand on top
of<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:49.989> or<00:00:50.770> gravel<00:00:51.190> up<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.940> put<00:00:52.899> their

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
of that or gravel up to you put their

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.650 
of that or gravel up to you put their
two<00:00:53.890> blocks<00:00:54.160> their<00:00:54.430> torch<00:00:55.180> on<00:00:55.360> top<00:00:55.480> of<00:00:55.570> that

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
two blocks their torch on top of that

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.720 
two blocks their torch on top of that
one<00:00:55.809> repeater<00:00:56.230> into<00:00:56.440> this<00:00:56.530> one<00:00:56.770> and<00:00:56.980> that<00:00:57.010> is

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
one repeater into this one and that is

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.400 
one repeater into this one and that is
your<00:00:57.850> block<00:00:58.059> updated<00:00:58.510> sector<00:00:58.809> as<00:00:59.050> you<00:00:59.170> can<00:00:59.290> see

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
your block updated sector as you can see

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.430 
your block updated sector as you can see
there<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:01.180> we're<00:01:01.450> going<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.630> put<00:01:01.780> this<00:01:01.960> into<00:01:02.290> a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
there now we're going to put this into a

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.420 
there now we're going to put this into a
tea<00:01:03.340> flip-flop<00:01:03.790> so<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.720> put<00:01:05.190> pieces<00:01:06.190> and

tea flip-flop so you put pieces and

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.340 
tea flip-flop so you put pieces and
britt<00:01:06.580> sent<00:01:06.729> us<00:01:06.909> their<00:01:07.120> block<00:01:07.840> on<00:01:07.990> top<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.260> this

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
britt sent us their block on top of this

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.730 
britt sent us their block on top of this
piston<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:10.060> their<00:01:10.270> rest<00:01:11.140> some<00:01:11.290> repair<00:01:11.590> out

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
when i update this will create a 1-1

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.969 
when i update this will create a 1-1
tick<00:01:34.270> pulse<00:01:34.860> which<00:01:35.860> lets<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.600> door<00:01:37.600> go<00:01:37.979> now

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
tick pulse which lets the door go now

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.630 
tick pulse which lets the door go now
because<00:01:39.280> we're<00:01:39.490> doing<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:41.280> grass<00:01:42.280> update

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
because we're doing a grass update

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.609 
because we're doing a grass update
detector<00:01:43.090> just<00:01:43.840> going<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.080> stick<00:01:44.259> in<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.409> piece

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
detector just going to stick in a piece

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.090 
detector just going to stick in a piece
of<00:01:44.650> grass<00:01:44.950> here

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
of grass here

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.830 
of grass here
and<00:01:46.580> then<00:01:46.850> fill<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.510> around<00:01:48.080> this<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.630> just

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
and then fill in around this so just

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.539 
and then fill in around this so just
block<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:51.890> all<00:01:52.130> we<00:01:52.220> want<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.430> be<00:01:52.490> able

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
block it and then all we want to be able

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.190 
block it and then all we want to be able
to<00:01:52.670> see<00:01:52.820> is<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:54.350> want<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.530> be<00:01:54.619> able<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.860> see<00:01:55.009> is

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
to see is we want to be able to see is

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.680 
to see is we want to be able to see is
the<00:01:57.200> side<00:01:57.440> of<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.680> grass<00:01:57.860> block<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.430> now<00:01:58.700> you

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
the side of the grass block and now you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.990 
the side of the grass block and now you
can<00:01:59.840> activate<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.470> door<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.979> just<00:02:01.549> put<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.820> piece

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
can activate the door I just put a piece

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.660 
can activate the door I just put a piece
of<00:02:02.030> by<00:02:02.210> mill<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.690> then<00:02:02.840> doing<00:02:03.049> that<00:02:03.200> as<00:02:04.190> you

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
of by mill and then doing that as you

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.770 
of by mill and then doing that as you
can<00:02:04.759> see<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:04.940> will<00:02:05.180> put<00:02:05.299> a<00:02:05.330> piece<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.509> grass

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
can see that will put a piece of grass

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.180 
can see that will put a piece of grass
here<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.920> all<00:02:07.070> up<00:02:07.850> they<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:09.130> but<00:02:10.130> you

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
here and that all up they it but you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.949 
here and that all up they it but you
want<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.550> be<00:02:10.640> by<00:02:11.000> default<00:02:11.270> open<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:11.900> you

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
want it to be by default open so you

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.140 
want it to be by default open so you
just<00:02:12.200> stick<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.010> block<00:02:13.250> there<00:02:13.430> make<00:02:13.910> sure<00:02:13.940> it's

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
just stick a block there make sure it's

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.750 
just stick a block there make sure it's
open<00:02:14.270> when<00:02:14.600> nothing's<00:02:14.959> on<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.520> mean<00:02:16.520> closed

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
open when nothing's on it I mean closed

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.880 
open when nothing's on it I mean closed
even<00:02:17.560> now<00:02:18.560> I'm<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.610> going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.819> play<00:02:20.060> little

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
even now I'm just going to play little

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.420 
even now I'm just going to play little
the<00:02:21.890> piston<00:02:22.220> here<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.610> they<00:02:23.680> walk<00:02:24.680> here<00:02:24.920> and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
the piston here and they walk here and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.280 
the piston here and they walk here and
this<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.030> just<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.420> can<00:02:26.720> make<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.200> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
this is just so you can make it the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.930 
this is just so you can make it the
safety<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.890> can't<00:02:28.100> see<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.430> grass<00:02:28.640> block

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
safety so you can't see the grass block

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.630 
safety so you can't see the grass block
and<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.209> not<00:02:29.360> completely<00:02:29.900> obvious<00:02:30.640> again

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
and it's not completely obvious again

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.580 
and it's not completely obvious again
you're<00:02:31.850> going<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.030> need<00:02:32.150> another<00:02:32.590> another

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
you're going to need another another

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.470 
you're going to need another another
mechanism<00:02:33.890> over<00:02:34.280> here<00:02:34.459> because<00:02:35.209> obviously

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
mechanism over here because obviously

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.229 
mechanism over here because obviously

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
the you need a way to reset and the

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.050 
the you need a way to reset and the
easiest<00:02:38.420> way<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.660> do<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.080> just<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:40.060> do

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
easiest way to do that is just to do

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.920 
easiest way to do that is just to do
this<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:42.400> button<00:02:45.220> here<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.630> now<00:02:47.630> when<00:02:47.840> you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
this a button here and now when you
