00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.110
 as we said all the files present in the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.000
 our computers are distributed 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.160
 within a folder structure 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.110
 and subfolders in this video 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.209
 let's start exploring this structure 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.110
 to understand how it is made and how to navigate 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.879
 inside 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.730
 a good starting point is the window 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.860
 computer or computer resources in others 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.660
 versions of windows to open the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.490
 computer window we click on 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.990
 start menu key located in 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.570
 lower left on the bar 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.340
 applications depending on the version of 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.630
 windows you're using this 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.670
 rate may appear differently 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.500
 could also carry the inscription 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.690
 start or start 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.300
 clicking on this button opens the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.250
 start menu this menu we will cover in 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.989
 detail in other videos for now there 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.410
 we only click the link that 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.820
 says computer or computer resources 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.800
 if in your start menu you don't find a 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.550
 link that says computers or resources 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.530
 Of computer 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.750
 try searching for an icon on the desktop that 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.280
 shows the name of the computer resources e 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.280
 double click on those with a 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.380
 in any case the window 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.030
 between videos shows us a series of 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.970
 integrated hardware components o 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.710
 connected in some way to the computer 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.840
 one of the most important of these 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.580
 components is the local disk that of 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.220
 usually reports a c 2 points between 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.110
 brackets 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.940
 now let's take a moment to this 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.130
 speech and let's jump back 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.049
 to explain what that local disk is 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.200
 in one of the first videos of the course we have 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.030
 talked about central computer unit 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.619
 we were talking about the central unit it houses 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.960
 some electronic components 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.600
 fundamental to the use of the computer 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.420
 among these components we find the disk 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.130
 hard drive in English hard disk or hd 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 the hard disk is the memory of the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.570
 computer mass memory for 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.400
 accuracy is the physical unit where I am 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.010
 stored all files and folders 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.870
 present in our computer 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.610
 we also said that these files and 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.700
 folders are organized in a kind 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.350
 of hierarchy of folders and subfolders 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.610
 but what we want to emphasize is 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.290
 that everything is stored on the hard disk 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.720
 every time we open a file in one 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.280
 folder for example the operating system 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.470
 locate that file or folder 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.970
 inside the disc and shows it 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.800
 video 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.720
 well the representation of the hard disk 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.900
 inside windows it is really the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.310
 local record we were talking about 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.170
 we can think of the local disk as 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.630
 to the parent folder where they are contained 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.130
 all other subfolder folders e 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.610
 all the files contained in our 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.610
 computer 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.239
 sometimes the hard drive 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.670
 partitioned into two or more local disks 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.739
 in that case for example besides the disk 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.450
 local you could also find us a 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.200
 other local disk identified by 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.200
 some other letter 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.150
 if we open the local disk with a double 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.190
 click we go down to the first level of the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.989
 hierarchy of folders and subfolders i 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.989
 which our computer is organized 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.800
 good with you 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.690
 we are exploring folders 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.409
 contained in our computer in the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.409
 next video
