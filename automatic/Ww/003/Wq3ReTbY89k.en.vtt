00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
there's actually a few different things

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.580 
there's actually a few different things
the<00:01:45.540> first<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.899> them<00:01:46.020> being<00:01:46.200> there<00:01:46.380> isn't

the first of them being there isn't

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
the first of them being there isn't
going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> huge<00:01:47.250> change<00:01:47.610> design<00:01:48.060> wise<00:01:48.270> or

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
going to be a huge change design wise or

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.969 
going to be a huge change design wise or
form<00:01:48.840> factor<00:01:49.200> compared<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> original

iPad<00:01:50.700> air<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.119> see<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.390> bezel<00:01:51.720> looks

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
iPad air you can see the bezel looks

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
iPad air you can see the bezel looks
very<00:01:52.110> similar<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.250> however<00:01:53.490> look<00:01:53.759> at

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
very similar if you do however look at

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.370 
very similar if you do however look at
them<00:01:53.970> side-by-side<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> this

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
them side-by-side you can see that this

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
them side-by-side you can see that this
model<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.520> bit<00:01:56.640> thinner<00:01:56.880> than<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
model is a little bit thinner than the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.090 
model is a little bit thinner than the
current<00:01:57.479> iPad<00:01:57.750> air<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.590> measures<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
current iPad air that measures in a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.160 
current iPad air that measures in a
thickness<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.700> 7.5<00:02:00.540> millimeters

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
thickness of 7.5 millimeters

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.280 
thickness of 7.5 millimeters
whereas<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.040> comes<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.610> about<00:02:02.700> 6<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.840> 6

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
whereas this comes in at about 6 to 6

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.139 
whereas this comes in at about 6 to 6
and<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> half<00:02:04.649> millimeters<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> little

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and a half millimeters so it is a little

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.880 
and a half millimeters so it is a little
bit<00:02:06.299> thinner<00:02:06.509> than<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.930> current<00:02:07.290> iPad<00:02:07.680> air

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
bit thinner than the current iPad air

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.109 
bit thinner than the current iPad air
here<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.489> see<00:02:08.640> there's<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.879> slight

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
here you can see there's a slight

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.609 
here you can see there's a slight
difference<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.959> model<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.470> these

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
downside of this though is that there

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.170 
downside of this though is that there
will<00:02:19.320> be<00:02:19.380> no<00:02:19.770> front<00:02:20.100> facing<00:02:20.160> speakers<00:02:20.820> on<00:02:21.000> the

will be no front facing speakers on the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.820 
will be no front facing speakers on the
next<00:02:21.510> generation<00:02:21.990> iPad<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.380> know<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.650> wasn't

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
next generation iPad I know it wasn't

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.770 
next generation iPad I know it wasn't
rumored<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.550> talked<00:02:23.790> about<00:02:24.090> but<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.630> you've

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
rumored or talked about but if you've

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.100

important<00:02:28.680> how<00:02:28.800> awesome<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.340> feature<00:02:29.580> could

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
important how awesome this feature could

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.060 
important how awesome this feature could
be<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.810> want<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.500> next<00:02:31.710> iPad

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
be and I just want it on the next iPad

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.800 
be and I just want it on the next iPad
now<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:32.670> next<00:02:32.850> thing<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.090> probably<00:02:33.570> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
now this next thing is probably the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.270 
now this next thing is probably the
single<00:02:34.200> thing<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.650> video<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.190> would

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
single thing in this video that I would

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.770 
single thing in this video that I would
take<00:02:35.520> with<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.760> grain<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.030> salt<00:02:36.150> not<00:02:36.510> really

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
take with a grain of salt not really

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.810 
take with a grain of salt not really
look<00:02:36.960> too<00:02:37.140> deeply<00:02:37.470> into<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.610> fact

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
look too deeply into that is the fact

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.550 
look too deeply into that is the fact
that<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.060> dummy<00:02:39.300> model<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.750> slightly<00:02:39.990> heavier

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
that the dummy model is slightly heavier

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.290 
that the dummy model is slightly heavier
than<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.010> current<00:02:41.340> iPad<00:02:41.640> air<00:02:41.820> but<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.060> course

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
than the current iPad air but of course

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.060 
than the current iPad air but of course
there<00:02:42.600> are<00:02:42.720> no<00:02:42.870> internal<00:02:43.170> parts<00:02:43.530> there<00:02:43.740> are<00:02:43.770> no

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
there are no internal parts there are no

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.950 
there are no internal parts there are no
physical<00:02:44.490> components<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.120> again<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.750> not

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
physical components so again this is not

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.570 
physical components so again this is not
a<00:02:46.230> big<00:02:46.500> thing<00:02:46.530> or<00:02:46.980> not<00:02:47.100> something<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.430> would

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
a big thing or not something I would

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.730 
a big thing or not something I would
look<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> compare<00:02:48.390> now<00:02:48.960> moving<00:02:49.260> up<00:02:49.380> towards

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
look to compare now moving up towards

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.710 
look to compare now moving up towards
the<00:02:49.860> top<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.460> dummy<00:02:50.760> model<00:02:50.940> iPad<00:02:51.360> air<00:02:51.510> to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the top of the dummy model iPad air to

the top of the dummy model iPad air to
the<00:02:51.960> volume<00:02:52.380> rockers<00:02:52.740> up<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.070> down<00:02:53.190> on<00:02:53.370> the

the volume rockers up and down on the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.220 
the volume rockers up and down on the
exact<00:02:53.850> same<00:02:54.000> spot<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.840> notice<00:02:55.110> and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
exact same spot but if you notice and

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.050 
exact same spot but if you notice and
you<00:02:55.290> really<00:02:55.560> look<00:02:55.710> closely<00:02:55.740> they're<00:02:56.700> actually

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
you really look closely they're actually

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.790 
you really look closely they're actually
a<00:02:57.090> little<00:02:57.360> more<00:02:57.540> recessed<00:02:57.990> as<00:02:58.200> opposed<00:02:58.650> to

a little more recessed as opposed to

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.830 
a little more recessed as opposed to
popping<00:02:59.340> out<00:02:59.460> like<00:02:59.490> on<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.940> current<00:03:00.270> iPad<00:03:00.570> air

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
popping out like on the current iPad air

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.660 
popping out like on the current iPad air
so<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.410> may<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.860> good<00:03:02.070> thing<00:03:02.130> depending<00:03:02.580> on

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
so that may be a good thing depending on

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.190 
so that may be a good thing depending on
how<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.910> look<00:03:03.210> at<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.750> those<00:03:03.900> are<00:03:04.020> some<00:03:04.110> of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
how you look at it so those are some of

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.390 
how you look at it so those are some of
the<00:03:04.320> smaller<00:03:04.620> differences<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.250> I've

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the smaller differences that I've

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.680 
the smaller differences that I've
noticed<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:05.940> think<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.210> biggest<00:03:06.450> thing

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
noticed but I think the biggest thing

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.090 
noticed but I think the biggest thing
and<00:03:06.930> if<00:03:07.020> you're<00:03:07.110> looking<00:03:07.410> at<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.010> it's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
and if you're looking at this and it's

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.920 
and if you're looking at this and it's
probably<00:03:08.340> screaming<00:03:08.940> at<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.240> is<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
probably screaming at you is the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.690 
probably screaming at you is the
difference<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.830> home<00:03:11.100> button<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.520> this

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
difference of the home button on this

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.760 
difference of the home button on this
model<00:03:11.970> compared<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.750> current<00:03:12.960> iPad<00:03:13.530> air
