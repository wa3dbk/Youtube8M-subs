probably not for dry skin people I mean

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.420

not dry skin people it's not for oily

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.130 
not dry skin people it's not for oily
skin<00:02:27.460> people<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.330> I'm<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.690> use<00:02:28.840> another

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
skin people and I'm going to use another

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.740 
skin people and I'm going to use another
pump<00:02:29.530> since<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.040> didn't<00:02:30.340> last<00:02:30.600> quite<00:02:31.600> as

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
pump since that didn't last quite as

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.200 
pump since that didn't last quite as
long<00:02:31.780> as<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> thought<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.440> would<00:02:33.000> yes<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
long as the thought it would yes the

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.850 
long as the thought it would yes the
spray<00:02:34.390> isn't<00:02:34.600> for<00:02:34.930> people<00:02:35.320> with<00:02:35.410> oily<00:02:35.830> skin

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
spray isn't for people with oily skin

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.980 
spray isn't for people with oily skin
since<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.520> does<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.030> dewy<00:02:37.300> finish<00:02:37.570> to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
since it does have that dewy finish to

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.800 
since it does have that dewy finish to
it<00:02:40.770> which<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.920> have<00:02:42.070> combination<00:02:42.340> skin<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.450> I

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
it which I have combination skin and I

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.920 
it which I have combination skin and I
think<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.620> works<00:02:44.800> out<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.250> me<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:46.570> just<00:02:46.600> kind

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
think it works out for me it just kind

00:02:46.930 --> 00:03:03.910 
think it works out for me it just kind
of<00:02:46.960> balances

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.530 

and<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.010> think<00:03:05.189> it<00:03:05.519> looks<00:03:05.609> really<00:03:06.000> nice<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.390> has

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
and I think it looks really nice it has

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.240 
and I think it looks really nice it has
as<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.140> can<00:03:07.260> see<00:03:07.409> it<00:03:07.500> does<00:03:07.620> have<00:03:07.799> like<00:03:07.920> some

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
as you can see it does have like some

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.580 
as you can see it does have like some
Dewey<00:03:08.579> mess<00:03:08.879> right<00:03:09.090> here<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.659> here<00:03:09.900> which<00:03:10.379> is

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
Dewey mess right here and here which is

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.069 
Dewey mess right here and here which is
great<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:11.099> it's<00:03:11.609> pretty<00:03:12.209> high<00:03:12.390> coverage<00:03:12.870> I

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
great and it's pretty high coverage I

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.349 
great and it's pretty high coverage I
think<00:03:13.319> if<00:03:13.859> I<00:03:14.069> put<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> concealer<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:14.879> underneath

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
think if I put a concealer on underneath

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.729 
think if I put a concealer on underneath
this<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.870> really<00:03:16.109> wouldn't<00:03:16.319> be<00:03:16.409> able<00:03:16.469> to<00:03:16.620> see
