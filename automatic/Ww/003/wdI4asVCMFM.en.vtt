 Let's take a look at that immediately because all means by saying yes 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:04.280
 I would like to introduce the card by saying yes 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:08.390
 First is the Romanov raw is the cat always looks strong this creature of this new card 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.220

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.899
 card 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:35.400
 And I play Jaguar as Romanoff I, a romantic style like Roman style . 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:40.200
 This is also quite compatible with this time 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.790
 From this creature continues to the battle zone and see your deck, 1 dark card 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:50.160
 To shuffle also good then deck Oite to select good his or her graveyard 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.230
 When this creature attacks, choose a spell with a dark cost of 6 or less in your graveyard. 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.390
 It is prepared to cast without paying the cost 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.230
 Then put that spell on the bottom of your deck 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.340
 I will send you 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.359
 White can also be various combo likely 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.950
 Here it is amazing contains a whopping 3 parts of 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:13.650
 It is the best to pile up three sheets at the romance office with this three-piece set 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.550
 And there is more than 60,000 creature cards on the right and on the crossfire here too 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.880
 If there is 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:22.450
 Nde Dekiru to go out in the middle completely by gravity zero 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:28.230
 But here I like the costumes in not a two 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.230
 And it is a card of the evolution of the star cemetery here Kuroiso 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.620
 And which one to take 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.470
 And here is one new card 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.210

 It is already mountained and I think it is a dark life this is a card that looks like a cat 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.819
 Though 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:05.310
 I see two from Yamaurakami and one of them is mana loss one of them is called a graveyard. 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:09.090
 City Imayama Mystery I think that one more card in the graveyard is quite strong, but two from the top of the deck 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.640
 The guy who woke up to see from among them 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.900
 This little harsh recommend in you divided the guy that happened to have 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.990
 This is how 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.620

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:51.110
 Destroy a creature 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:54.540
 If you put 1 card into your graveyard from your mana zone, then your opponent has 1 own creature. 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.380
