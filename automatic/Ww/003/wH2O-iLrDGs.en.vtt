cables I cut them up and kind of spliced
them<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> could<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:11.269> 3.5

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
them in so I could have the 3.5

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.839 
them in so I could have the 3.5

with that said I've got it all wired up
and<00:02:31.290> working<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.890> inside<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.489> keyboard

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
and working on the inside the keyboard

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.559 
and working on the inside the keyboard
plugged<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:34.049> LED<00:02:34.470> plugged<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.390> from<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
plugged in the LED plugged in from the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.259 
plugged in the LED plugged in from the
original<00:02:36.930> keyboard<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.910> beautiful

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
original keyboard and the beautiful

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.089 
original keyboard and the beautiful
thing<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.959> actually<00:02:40.140> let's<00:02:40.680> use<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
thing is is it actually let's use the

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.630 
thing is is it actually let's use the
keyboard<00:02:41.489> as<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:42.090> really<00:02:42.569> looks<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.260> not<00:02:43.640> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
keyboard as it really looks and not the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.100 
keyboard as it really looks and not the
tricky<00:02:45.030> emulation<00:02:45.450> stuff<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.750> got<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.989> do

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
tricky emulation stuff you got to do

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.130 
tricky emulation stuff you got to do
with<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.590> other<00:02:46.980> stuff<00:02:47.390> using<00:02:48.390> an<00:02:48.480> old<00:02:48.630> new<00:02:49.110> ER

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
with the other stuff using an old new ER

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.949 
with the other stuff using an old new ER
keyboard<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:49.829> anyway<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.660> wired

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
keyboard but anyway this is the I wired

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.170 
keyboard but anyway this is the I wired
up<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.530> menuing<00:02:53.099> system<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.819> vice<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
up the menuing system for a vice to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.110 
up the menuing system for a vice to
choose<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.049> roms<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.470> stuff<00:02:55.910> with<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
choose all the roms and stuff with the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.819 
choose all the roms and stuff with the
pound<00:02:57.360> key<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:58.140> doesn't<00:02:58.170> have<00:02:58.470> any<00:02:58.620> other

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
pound key that doesn't have any other

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.949 
pound key that doesn't have any other
uses<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.430> have<00:03:00.209> wired<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.230> back<00:03:01.379> key<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.840> get

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
uses I have wired up the back key to get

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.690 
uses I have wired up the back key to get
back<00:03:04.170> or<00:03:04.700> or<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.950> wired<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.250> run<00:03:08.430> stop

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
and all the other other things so the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.539 
and all the other other things so the
menuing<00:03:10.560> system<00:03:10.590> works<00:03:11.069> great<00:03:11.340> with<00:03:11.489> a

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
menuing system works great with a

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.390 
menuing system works great with a
joystick<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:12.989> explain<00:03:13.350> how<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.889> set<00:03:14.310> all

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
joystick and I explain how I set all

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.120 
joystick and I explain how I set all
those<00:03:14.579> up<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.569> pronounce<00:03:15.870> coms<00:03:16.590> website

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
those up on a to pronounce coms website

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.199 
those up on a to pronounce coms website
so<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.299> Raspberry<00:03:19.260> Pi<00:03:19.760> upgrade<00:03:20.760> for<00:03:21.060> an

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
so that is a Raspberry Pi upgrade for an

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.960 
so that is a Raspberry Pi upgrade for an
original<00:03:21.389> Commodore<00:03:22.019> 64<00:03:22.530> cabinet<00:03:23.100> if<00:03:23.850> you

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
original Commodore 64 cabinet if you

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.430 
original Commodore 64 cabinet if you
really<00:03:24.299> want<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.600> see<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.930> go<00:03:25.079> through<00:03:25.319> its

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
really want to see it go through its

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.819 
really want to see it go through its
paces<00:03:25.650> here<00:03:26.069> I'll<00:03:26.250> turn<00:03:26.519> off<00:03:26.760> turn<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.180> off<00:03:27.389> and

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
paces here I'll turn off turn it off and

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.819 
paces here I'll turn off turn it off and
turn<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:29.130> back<00:03:29.400> on

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
turn it back on

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.449 
turn it back on
and<00:03:31.829> you'll<00:03:32.310> see<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.849> boots<00:03:33.060> up<00:03:33.299> as<00:03:34.290> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
and you'll see that it boots up as a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.509 
and you'll see that it boots up as a
Raspberry<00:03:35.459> Pi<00:03:35.780> but<00:03:36.780> right<00:03:37.709> after<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.099> PI<00:03:38.280> boot

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
Raspberry Pi but right after the PI boot

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.849 
Raspberry Pi but right after the PI boot
sequence<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.239> goes<00:03:39.480> right<00:03:39.930> into<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
sequence it goes right into the

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.119 
sequence it goes right into the
commodore<00:03:41.549> 64

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.459 

default<00:03:46.129> screen<00:03:46.489> with<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.049> Commodore<00:03:48.049> basic

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:48.469 
default screen with the Commodore basic

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.789 
default screen with the Commodore basic
ready<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.829> go<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.719> it<00:03:50.719> feels<00:03:51.079> other<00:03:51.439> than<00:03:51.650> this

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
ready to go and it feels other than this

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.619 
ready to go and it feels other than this
particular<00:03:52.010> piece<00:03:52.609> here<00:03:52.909> it<00:03:53.060> feels<00:03:53.299> like<00:03:53.510> the

particular piece here it feels like the

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.039 
particular piece here it feels like the
original<00:03:54.019> Commodore<00:03:54.469> 64<00:03:55.099> and<00:03:55.840> without<00:03:56.840> all
