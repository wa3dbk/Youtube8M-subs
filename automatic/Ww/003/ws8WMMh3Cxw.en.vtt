00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
achievements load a new world or a game

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.060

whatever you want to call it we have a
save<00:03:05.459> game<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:05.880> we're<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.180> save<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.390> and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
save game so we're going to save it and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.760 
save game so we're going to save it and
this<00:03:06.720> will<00:03:06.870> probably<00:03:07.020> just<00:03:07.200> put<00:03:07.350> us<00:03:07.440> back<00:03:07.590> at

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
this will probably just put us back at

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.040 
this will probably just put us back at
the<00:03:07.800> main<00:03:08.040> minecraft<00:03:08.490> screen<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> new<00:03:09.870> one

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
probably give it a seven because it

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.949 
probably give it a seven because it
