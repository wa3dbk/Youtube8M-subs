iPhone iPad or iPod touch I have the
iphone<00:01:03.840> 5<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.280> go<00:01:05.430> down<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.970> i<00:01:06.119> have

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
iphone 5 and then you go down and i have

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
iphone 5 and then you go down and i have
iphone<00:01:06.900> 5<00:01:07.110> gsm<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.310> iOS

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
iphone 5 gsm and then right here is iOS

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.929 
iphone 5 gsm and then right here is iOS
7.0<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.619> i've<00:01:10.890> already<00:01:11.040> downloaded<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
7.0 so i've already downloaded that it

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.550 
7.0 so i've already downloaded that it
only<00:01:12.090> takes<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> couple<00:01:12.840> minutes<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
only takes just a couple minutes and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
only takes just a couple minutes and
then<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.340> minimize<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.060> once<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
then we can minimize that and once you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.420 
then we can minimize that and once you
it's<00:01:16.049> downloaded<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:16.890> ahead<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.159> put<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.340> on

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it's downloaded go ahead and put it on

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
it's downloaded go ahead and put it on
your<00:01:17.549> desktop<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.150> makes<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> easier<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> find

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
backup now now depending on you know how

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.270 
backup now now depending on you know how
much<00:01:57.810> data<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.530> your<00:01:58.770> device<00:01:59.009> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
much data you have on your device it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.039 
much data you have on your device it
varies<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.000> time<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.540> probably<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.990> be

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
varies in time it's probably going to be

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.109 
varies in time it's probably going to be
about<00:02:01.110> five<00:02:01.530> minutes<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.520> after<00:02:02.820> you've<00:02:02.939> done

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
about five minutes so after you've done

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.120 
about five minutes so after you've done
that<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.960> still<00:02:04.290> need<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.619> backup<00:02:04.890> your

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that you still need to backup your

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
that you still need to backup your
applications<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.479> said<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.869> only

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
applications like I said this is only

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
applications like I said this is only
for<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> data<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> actual<00:02:08.819> apps

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
for the data this is not the actual apps

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.479 
for the data this is not the actual apps
now<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.869> way<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.110> backup<00:02:10.470> your<00:02:10.619> applications

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
now the way you backup your applications

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.300 
now the way you backup your applications
and<00:02:11.730> all<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.000> data<00:02:12.180> within<00:02:12.450> your<00:02:12.989> app

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
and all the data within your app

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.490 
and all the data within your app
locations<00:02:13.730> as<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.000> go<00:02:14.090> up<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.390> file<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:15.290> go<00:02:15.440> to

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
locations as you go up to file you go to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.650 
locations as you go up to file you go to
devices<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:16.940> do<00:02:17.060> transfer

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
devices and then you do transfer

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.050 
devices and then you do transfer
purchases<00:02:17.900> from<00:02:18.470> your<00:02:18.980> device<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:19.880> go<00:02:20.000> ahead

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
purchases from your device so go ahead

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
and select on that again that will take

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.979 
and select on that again that will take
probably<00:02:21.980> five<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.150> ten<00:02:23.330> minutes<00:02:23.360> depending

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
probably five to ten minutes depending

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.780 
probably five to ten minutes depending
on<00:02:24.110> how<00:02:24.290> many<00:02:24.349> applications<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.340> have<00:02:25.370> on
