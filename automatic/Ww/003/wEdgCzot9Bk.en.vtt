00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.980 
let me show you how the cyclone slips in
so<00:02:29.910> Michael<00:02:30.240> other<00:02:30.360> cases<00:02:30.570> I've<00:02:30.750> used<00:02:30.870> before

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
so Michael other cases I've used before

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.540 
so Michael other cases I've used before
they<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.350> Annabelle<00:02:31.770> crow<00:02:31.950> strap<00:02:32.370> or

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
they have Annabelle crow strap or

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.830 
they have Annabelle crow strap or
something<00:02:32.790> like<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:32.940> well<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.660> actually

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
something like that well this actually

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.950 
something like that well this actually
sneaks<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> bottom<00:02:35.580> right<00:02:35.670> here<00:02:35.960> so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
sneaks in on the bottom right here so

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.180 
sneaks in on the bottom right here so
let<00:02:37.140> me<00:02:37.940> slip<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.860> it's<00:02:40.860> not<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> easiest

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
let me slip this in it's not the easiest

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.590 
let me slip this in it's not the easiest
to<00:02:41.550> get<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.000> probably<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.390> good<00:02:42.450> thing

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
to get in but it's probably a good thing

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.630 
to get in but it's probably a good thing
because<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.410> would<00:02:43.500> probably<00:02:43.740> slip<00:02:44.490> out

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
because and it would probably slip out

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.130 
because and it would probably slip out
all<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.910> time<00:02:45.500> when<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.590> don't<00:02:46.800> want<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.070> to

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
all the time when you don't want it to

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.230 
all the time when you don't want it to
so<00:02:49.140> bring<00:02:50.130> this<00:02:50.280> over<00:02:50.610> here<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.000> paid

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
so bring this over here so that paid

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.940 
so bring this over here so that paid
this<00:02:54.540> piece<00:02:54.750> right<00:02:54.840> here<00:02:54.960> basically<00:02:55.260> covers

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
this piece right here basically covers

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.880 
this piece right here basically covers
the<00:02:56.550> bottom<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.210> this<00:02:57.990> is<00:02:58.140> mesh<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.770> can

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
the bottom and this is mesh so you can

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.110 
the bottom and this is mesh so you can
obviously<00:02:59.100> you'll<00:02:59.310> still<00:02:59.490> be<00:02:59.580> able<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.760> hear

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
obviously you'll still be able to hear

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.120 
obviously you'll still be able to hear
your<00:03:00.690> ringer<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.290> your<00:03:01.440> phone<00:03:01.650> goes<00:03:01.830> off<00:03:01.920> at

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
your ringer if your phone goes off at

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.150 
your ringer if your phone goes off at
the<00:03:02.250> train<00:03:02.400> logs<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.940> case<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:05.010> there

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
the train logs in the case so there

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.940 
the train logs in the case so there
that's<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.520> thumb<00:03:05.940> wats<00:03:06.210> in<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.510> case<00:03:06.950> so

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
that's the thumb wats in the case so

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.920 
that's the thumb wats in the case so
you're<00:03:08.160> you're<00:03:08.490> different<00:03:09.330> sensors<00:03:09.720> and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
you're you're different sensors and

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.600 
you're you're different sensors and
stuff<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.230> being<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.560> are<00:03:10.770> open<00:03:11.220> here

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
stuff for being that are open here

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.430 
stuff for being that are open here
through<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.910> cutouts<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:13.050> headphone<00:03:13.410> jack

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
through the cutouts the headphone jack

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.960 
through the cutouts the headphone jack
lines<00:03:13.860> up<00:03:14.010> really<00:03:14.190> well<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.490> standby<00:03:14.850> switch

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
lines up really well in standby switch

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.730 
lines up really well in standby switch
is<00:03:15.180> right<00:03:15.210> there<00:03:15.570> even<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.020> camera<00:03:16.380> lines<00:03:16.560> up

pretty well on the back and on the sides

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.890 
pretty well on the back and on the sides
you<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.730> places<00:03:21.270> where<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.570> switches

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
you have the places where the switches

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.540 
you have the places where the switches
are<00:03:22.050> switches<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.860> little<00:03:23.070> awkward<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.400> use

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
are switches a little awkward to use

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.780 
are switches a little awkward to use
through<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.180> case<00:03:24.420> but<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.800> think<00:03:26.370> nine<00:03:26.550> times

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
through the case but I think nine times

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.620 
through the case but I think nine times
out<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:26.970> ten<00:03:27.060> you'll<00:03:27.239> be<00:03:27.330> using<00:03:27.480> your

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
out of ten you'll be using your

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.690 
out of ten you'll be using your
headphones<00:03:27.989> anyway<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.530> that's<00:03:29.130> probably<00:03:29.520> not

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
headphones anyway so that's probably not

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.750 
headphones anyway so that's probably not
even<00:03:29.910> an<00:03:30.000> issue<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:31.500> volume<00:03:31.890> isn't<00:03:32.100> but

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
even an issue the volume isn't but

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.580 
even an issue the volume isn't but
that's<00:03:33.270> not<00:03:33.360> an<00:03:33.660> issue<00:03:33.900> at<00:03:34.050> all<00:03:34.140> either<00:03:34.320> you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
that's not an issue at all either you

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.380 
that's not an issue at all either you
can<00:03:34.709> push<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.100> up<00:03:35.280> or<00:03:35.400> down<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.180> still

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
can push it up or down and you can still

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.820 
can push it up or down and you can still
control<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.720> volume<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.170> then<00:03:37.739> you

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
control the volume and then you

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.170 
control the volume and then you
speakerphone<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.400> microphone<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.060> right

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
speakerphone the microphone and right

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.870 
speakerphone the microphone and right
there<00:03:39.390> on<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.900> bottom<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.380> if<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.190> do<00:03:41.370> like
