those<00:00:00.120> gaps<00:00:00.299> he's<00:00:00.570> talking<00:00:00.930> about<00:00:01.110> are<00:00:01.350> the

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
those gaps he's talking about are the

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.619 
those gaps he's talking about are the
ones<00:00:01.620> from<00:00:02.010> each<00:00:02.190> lane<00:00:02.490> as<00:00:02.730> as<00:00:02.970> he's<00:00:03.179> in<00:00:03.330> front

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
ones from each lane as as he's in front

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:13.260 
ones from each lane as as he's in front
so<00:00:03.810> we'll<00:00:03.929> see<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.200> happens

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.860 

five<00:00:14.270> to<00:00:14.570> go<00:00:14.720> at<00:00:14.900> Daytona

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
look at David Starr up in that lead mix

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.359 
look at David Starr up in that lead mix
Ross<00:00:22.870> Chastain<00:00:23.230> there<00:00:23.800> on<00:00:23.920> the<00:00:24.010> bottom

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
Ross Chastain there on the bottom

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.490 
Ross Chastain there on the bottom
there's<00:00:24.970> Eric<00:00:25.240> Amaro<00:00:25.570> has<00:00:25.750> been<00:00:25.960> enough<00:00:26.200> he

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
there's Eric Amaro has been enough he

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.230 
there's Eric Amaro has been enough he
was<00:00:26.590> in<00:00:26.740> that<00:00:26.890> wreck<00:00:27.130> but<00:00:27.340> he's<00:00:27.430> squeezed

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
was in that wreck but he's squeezed

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.840 
was in that wreck but he's squeezed
through<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.830> as<00:00:30.010> the<00:00:30.130> field<00:00:30.369> gets<00:00:30.430> smaller

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
through and as the field gets smaller

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.030 
through and as the field gets smaller
like<00:00:31.090> this<00:00:31.330> things<00:00:32.020> happen<00:00:32.470> slower<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:32.950> it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
like this things happen slower and it

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.850 
like this things happen slower and it
takes<00:00:33.340> longer<00:00:33.640> for<00:00:33.820> them<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:35.410> make<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.590> move

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
takes longer for them to to make a move

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.100 
takes longer for them to to make a move
so<00:00:36.220> they're<00:00:37.090> Brad<00:00:37.330> goes<00:00:37.540> trying<00:00:37.900> to<00:00:37.960> make<00:00:38.080> a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
so they're Brad goes trying to make a

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.170 
so they're Brad goes trying to make a
block<00:00:38.379> and<00:00:38.620> here<00:00:38.949> comes<00:00:39.160> that<00:00:39.280> inside<00:00:39.670> lane<00:00:39.879> so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
block and here comes that inside lane so

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.970 
block and here comes that inside lane so
he<00:00:40.570> had<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.750> make<00:00:40.900> a<00:00:40.930> decision<00:00:41.440> and<00:00:41.590> in<00:00:41.830> the

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
he had to make a decision and in the

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.230 
he had to make a decision and in the
inside<00:00:42.309> you<00:00:42.340> had<00:00:42.580> the<00:00:42.699> momentum

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
inside you had the momentum

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.060 
inside you had the momentum

watched him make that move up the
outside<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.810> grab<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.170> lead<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.680> now<00:00:57.830> he's

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
outside to grab the lead and now he's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.290 
outside to grab the lead and now he's
gonna<00:00:58.070> try<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:58.430> block<00:00:58.700> but<00:00:58.940> he's<00:00:59.030> gonna<00:00:59.150> get

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.710 

that's<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.489> huge<00:01:03.820> mistake<00:01:04.030> but<00:01:04.420> that's<00:01:04.570> the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
that's a huge mistake but that's the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.420 
that's a huge mistake but that's the
chance<00:01:05.019> you<00:01:05.170> take<00:01:05.199> he<00:01:05.590> tried<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:05.920> block<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.130> lane

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
chance you take he tried to block a lane

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.160 
chance you take he tried to block a lane
couldn't<00:01:06.850> get<00:01:06.970> there<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.390> now<00:01:07.690> he's<00:01:07.720> stuck<00:01:08.140> in

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
couldn't get there and now he's stuck in

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.600 
couldn't get there and now he's stuck in
the<00:01:08.320> middle<00:01:08.440> yeah<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.010> he<00:01:09.100> was<00:01:09.220> just<00:01:09.400> hoping

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
the middle yeah and he was just hoping

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.850 
the middle yeah and he was just hoping
that<00:01:09.880> Brad<00:01:10.060> was<00:01:10.090> gonna<00:01:10.420> push<00:01:10.690> him<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.170> Brad

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
that Brad was gonna push him and Brad

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.230 
that Brad was gonna push him and Brad
had<00:01:12.070> enough<00:01:12.310> momentum<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.790> where<00:01:12.940> he<00:01:13.090> could

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
had enough momentum to where he could

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.850 
had enough momentum to where he could
carry<00:01:13.510> that<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:13.960> then<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.260> inside<00:01:14.650> had

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
carry that and then the inside had

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.920 
carry that and then the inside had
already<00:01:15.130> made<00:01:15.280> up<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.550> ground<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.630> 42

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
already made up the ground and the 42

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.330 
already made up the ground and the 42
was<00:01:17.200> stuck<00:01:17.409> in<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.619> middle<00:01:17.860> so<00:01:18.010> it<00:01:18.070> didn't

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
was stuck in the middle so it didn't

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.560 
was stuck in the middle so it didn't
hurt<00:01:18.430> him<00:01:18.580> near<00:01:18.760> as<00:01:18.850> bad<00:01:19.000> as<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.360> could<00:01:19.540> have

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
hurt him near as bad as it could have

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.330 
hurt him near as bad as it could have
yeah<00:01:20.170> because<00:01:20.320> there's<00:01:20.560> not<00:01:20.650> that<00:01:20.830> many<00:01:20.979> cars

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
and somebody had to get behind him

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.170 
and somebody had to get behind him
pushing<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.740> push<00:01:24.070> him<00:01:24.280> he<00:01:24.700> made<00:01:24.850> his<00:01:25.000> way

the last two times as they entered the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
tri-oval I thought Larson was gonna make

it<00:02:48.190> thin<00:02:48.580> but<00:02:48.730> each<00:02:48.940> time<00:02:49.270> at<00:02:49.870> the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
it thin but each time at the

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.720 
it thin but each time at the
start/finish<00:02:50.680> line<00:02:50.710> it<00:02:51.100> was<00:02:51.220> Brad<00:02:51.460> Keselowski

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
start/finish line it was Brad Keselowski

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.880 
start/finish line it was Brad Keselowski
leading<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.660> now<00:02:52.750> Larson<00:02:53.230> dropping<00:02:53.590> off<00:02:53.740> in

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
leading and now Larson dropping off in

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.890

that<00:02:54.010> outside<00:02:54.370> lane<00:02:54.400> Marella<00:02:55.150> decided<00:02:55.690> he<00:02:55.780> was

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
that outside lane Marella decided he was

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.420

going<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.050> make<00:02:56.260> his<00:02:56.440> way<00:02:56.590> around<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.220> star

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
going to make his way around a that star

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.400 
going to make his way around a that star
think<00:02:57.730> he's<00:02:57.850> figured<00:02:58.150> star<00:02:58.420> was<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.960> weakly

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
think he's figured star was that weakly

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.050 
think he's figured star was that weakly
if<00:02:59.800> he<00:02:59.950> could<00:03:00.100> get<00:03:00.160> around<00:03:00.310> him<00:03:00.580> get<00:03:00.760> up<00:03:00.880> to
