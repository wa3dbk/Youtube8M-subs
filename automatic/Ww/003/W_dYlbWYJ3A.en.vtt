00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.330 
over and I noticed the top of the
battery<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:19.020> pretty<00:00:19.890> wet

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.349 

the<00:00:23.340> battery<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:24.560> manufacturer<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.769> purchase

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
the battery was manufacturer to purchase

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
the battery was manufacturer to purchase
December<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:28.220> 2010<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.760> right<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:31.369> June

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
December of 2010 and right now it's June

December of 2010 and right now it's June
of<00:00:32.730> 2013<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.030> old<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> battery

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
of 2013 so it's not that old the battery

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.380 
of 2013 so it's not that old the battery
it's<00:00:37.440> not<00:00:37.649> three<00:00:37.950> years<00:00:37.980> old<00:00:38.460> yet<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it's not three years old yet it's got a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.750 
it's not three years old yet it's got a
three<00:00:39.989> year<00:00:40.020> full<00:00:40.500> replacement<00:00:41.129> warranty<00:00:41.309> on

three year full replacement warranty on

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.540 
three year full replacement warranty on
it<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:43.879> I'm<00:00:44.879> wondering<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.370> last<00:00:47.370> time

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it so I'm wondering if the last time

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.360 
it so I'm wondering if the last time
this<00:00:48.000> truck<00:00:48.840> got<00:00:49.140> an<00:00:49.260> oil<00:00:49.440> change<00:00:49.559> she<00:00:50.160> brought

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
this truck got an oil change she brought

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.470 
this truck got an oil change she brought
it<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:51.739> an<00:00:52.739> oil<00:00:53.039> change<00:00:53.309> place<00:00:53.430> because<00:00:54.090> I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
it to a an oil change place because I

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.529 
it to a an oil change place because I
didn't<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.410> time<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.280> she<00:00:57.270> brought

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
didn't have time to do it so she brought

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
didn't have time to do it so she brought
it<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> place<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.350> Orange<00:00:58.590> County<00:00:58.800> anyway

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it to a place up in Orange County anyway

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.889 
it to a place up in Orange County anyway
I<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.760> wondering<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.239> overfill<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
I was wondering if they overfill the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.290 
I was wondering if they overfill the
battery<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.680> never<00:01:02.100> noticed<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.670> being<00:01:03.059> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
battery I never noticed it being that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.679 
battery I never noticed it being that
wet<00:01:03.570> before<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> pulled<00:01:05.640> off<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
wet before so I pulled off the the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.520 
wet before so I pulled off the the
covers<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.409> checked<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:09.600> wasn't<00:01:09.780> overfilled

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
covers and checked it wasn't overfilled

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.010 
covers and checked it wasn't overfilled
actually<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.670> -<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:13.610> cells<00:01:14.610> were<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
actually the - and cells were just a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.840 
actually the - and cells were just a
little<00:01:16.290> bit<00:01:16.409> under<00:01:16.619> filled<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.340> topped<00:01:17.610> them

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
little bit under filled so I topped them

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.080 
little bit under filled so I topped them
off<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.450> wiped<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.650> whole<00:01:19.799> battery<00:01:20.280> there

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
off I wiped down the whole battery there

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.620 
off I wiped down the whole battery there
was<00:01:21.299> corrosion<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.439> both<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.630> positive

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
was corrosion on both of the positive

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.370 
was corrosion on both of the positive
and<00:01:24.720> negative<00:01:25.080> posts<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.400> took<00:01:26.670> them<00:01:26.909> off

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
and negative posts so I took them off

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.080 
and negative posts so I took them off
clean<00:01:28.380> them<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> wire<00:01:29.280> brush<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
clean them all up with a wire brush I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.719 
clean them all up with a wire brush I
put<00:01:30.420> some<00:01:30.600> grease<00:01:30.930> down<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.549> should

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
put some grease down I really should

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.350 
put some grease down I really should
have<00:01:32.759> done<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.030> video<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.049> guys<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
have done a video for you guys but I

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.480 
have done a video for you guys but I
slipped<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.420> mind<00:01:36.659> until<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.079> got<00:01:37.290> into<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> so

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
slipped my mind until I got into it so

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.149 
slipped my mind until I got into it so
I'm<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.850> talking<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> through<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.009> if<00:01:41.009> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I'm just talking you through it if you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.490 
I'm just talking you through it if you
have<00:01:41.310> corrosion<00:01:41.720> take<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> positive<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
have corrosion take the positive and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.139 
have corrosion take the positive and
negative<00:01:43.890> off<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:45.470> make<00:01:46.470> sure<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:48.619> always

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
negative off and make sure that I always

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.160 
negative off and make sure that I always
well

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.310 

if<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:53.950> take<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.250> positive<00:01:54.430> off<00:01:54.910> first

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
if you take the positive off first

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.100 
if you take the positive off first
you're<00:01:56.320> safe<00:01:56.620> because<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:58.000> could<00:01:58.210> touch<00:01:59.080> it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
you're safe because you could touch it

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.010 
you're safe because you could touch it
anywhere<00:01:59.710> and<00:01:59.950> nothing<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:00.730> going<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.880> happen

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
anywhere and nothing is going to happen

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.750 
anywhere and nothing is going to happen
don't<00:02:02.410> take<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.740> negative<00:02:03.130> off<00:02:03.280> first

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
don't take the negative off first

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.390 
don't take the negative off first
because<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.350> if<00:02:05.410> you<00:02:05.530> touch<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:06.070> to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
because then you if you touch that to

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.520 
because then you if you touch that to
something<00:02:06.700> else<00:02:07.000> metal<00:02:07.540> that's<00:02:07.780> grounded<00:02:08.410> you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
something else metal that's grounded you

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.940 
something else metal that's grounded you
could<00:02:08.740> get<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.950> spark<00:02:10.380> anyway<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.410> have<00:02:11.770> done

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
could get a spark anyway I have done

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.830 
could get a spark anyway I have done
another<00:02:12.190> video<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.060> can<00:02:13.240> search<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
another video on that you can search the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.060 
another video on that you can search the
channel<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.470> want<00:02:14.650> to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
channel if you want to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.450 
channel if you want to
so<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.820> clean<00:02:16.120> them<00:02:16.270> up<00:02:16.500> with<00:02:17.500> wire<00:02:17.740> brush<00:02:18.100> I

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
so I clean them up with wire brush I

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.410 
so I clean them up with wire brush I
grease<00:02:19.180> them<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.930> grease<00:02:20.200> helps<00:02:20.530> prevent<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
grease them the grease helps prevent the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.180 
grease them the grease helps prevent the
corrosion<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:24.959> electrical<00:02:25.980> corrosion<00:02:26.980> it's

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
corrosion the electrical corrosion it's

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.820 
corrosion the electrical corrosion it's
not<00:02:27.630> rust<00:02:28.630> corrosion<00:02:28.990> it's<00:02:29.320> electrical

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
not rust corrosion it's electrical

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.070 
not rust corrosion it's electrical
corrosion<00:02:30.370> they're<00:02:31.330> little<00:02:31.570> fuzzy<00:02:31.900> white

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
corrosion they're little fuzzy white

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080 
corrosion they're little fuzzy white
stuff<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.680> see

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
stuff that you see

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.150 
stuff that you see
anyway<00:02:34.090> I'm<00:02:34.410> checking<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.590> battery<00:02:35.980> right

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
anyway I'm checking the battery right

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.479 
anyway I'm checking the battery right
now<00:02:36.340> I've<00:02:36.489> got<00:02:36.670> 12.2<00:02:37.390> which<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.810> good<00:02:38.489> voltage

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
now I've got 12.2 which is good voltage

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.910 
now I've got 12.2 which is good voltage
for<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.510> know<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.750> car's<00:02:41.170> not<00:02:41.500> running<00:02:41.890> right

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
for you know the car's not running right

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.130 
for you know the car's not running right
now<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.850> probably<00:02:43.360> does<00:02:43.750> have<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.459> some<00:02:46.140> current

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
now it probably does have a some current

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.460 
now it probably does have a some current
draw<00:02:47.380> from<00:02:47.950> oh<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:49.090> don't<00:02:49.420> know<00:02:49.630> an<00:02:49.750> alarm<00:02:50.080> or<00:02:50.440> a

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
draw from oh I don't know an alarm or a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.880 
draw from oh I don't know an alarm or a
light<00:02:50.709> that's<00:02:50.920> on<00:02:51.100> somewhere<00:02:51.640> or<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:53.350> brain

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
light that's on somewhere or the brain

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.449 
light that's on somewhere or the brain
of<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.420> car<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.620> I'm<00:02:56.950> going<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.130> start

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
of the of the car and I'm going to start

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.420 
of the of the car and I'm going to start
it<00:02:57.580> up<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:58.330> I'm<00:02:58.450> going<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.660> see<00:02:58.959> what<00:02:59.430> the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
it up then I'm going to see what the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.280 
it up then I'm going to see what the
alternator<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.330> doing<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.840> charge<00:03:02.110> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
alternator is doing to charge the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.440 
alternator is doing to charge the
battery<00:03:02.680> hold<00:03:03.549> on<00:03:05.549> now<00:03:06.549> it's<00:03:06.820> being<00:03:07.030> charged

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
battery hold on now it's being charged

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.750 
battery hold on now it's being charged
by<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.810> alternators<00:03:08.709> 14<00:03:09.400> points

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.759 

that's<00:03:13.330> pretty<00:03:13.690> good<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:14.019> mean<00:03:14.349> that's<00:03:14.530> about

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
that's pretty good I mean that's about

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.420 
that's pretty good I mean that's about
what<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.129> should<00:03:15.159> be

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
what it should be

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.830 
what it should be
so<00:03:16.849> that's<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.420> simple<00:03:18.110> task

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.570 

was<00:03:21.989> charging<00:03:22.730> 15<00:03:23.840> or<00:03:24.840> even<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.319> higher<00:03:25.709> 14<00:03:26.550> I

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
was charging 15 or even a higher 14 I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.770 
was charging 15 or even a higher 14 I
might<00:03:26.910> be<00:03:27.090> concerned

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.920 

but<00:03:30.200> 14.2<00:03:31.129> seems<00:03:31.519> okay<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.090> me

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
but 14.2 seems okay to me

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.960 
but 14.2 seems okay to me
let's<00:03:33.439> see<00:03:33.590> if<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:33.769> can

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
let's see if I can

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.890 
let's see if I can
speed<00:03:35.300> up<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.810> article<00:03:37.180> that's<00:03:38.860> 2500<00:03:39.860> rpm<00:03:40.490> and

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
speed up the article that's 2500 rpm and

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.800 
speed up the article that's 2500 rpm and
it's<00:03:41.900> still

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.420 

I<00:03:44.870> think<00:03:45.170> it's<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.470> same<00:03:45.709> number<00:03:46.040> once<00:03:46.250> before

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
I think it's the same number once before

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.020 
I think it's the same number once before
so

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
so

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.130 
so
my<00:03:48.890> initial<00:03:50.390> diagnosis<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.570> that<00:03:51.780> it's<00:03:51.930> not

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
my initial diagnosis is that it's not

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.600 
my initial diagnosis is that it's not
getting<00:03:52.380> overcharged

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
getting overcharged

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.670 
getting overcharged
maybe<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.270> did<00:03:55.510> get<00:03:55.690> overfilled<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:57.070> was

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
maybe it did get overfilled and that was

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.040 
maybe it did get overfilled and that was
the<00:03:58.040> excess<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.610> came<00:03:58.849> out<00:03:59.409> what<00:04:00.409> I'm

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
the excess that came out what I'm

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
the excess that came out what I'm
is<00:04:04.120> just<00:04:05.120> people<00:04:05.300> watching<00:04:05.630> watchful<00:04:06.620> eye<00:04:06.740> on

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
is just people watching watchful eye on

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.270 
is just people watching watchful eye on
it<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.520> next<00:04:07.640> time<00:04:07.820> she<00:04:08.090> comes<00:04:08.270> down

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
it the next time she comes down

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.330 
it the next time she comes down
now<00:04:09.490> let's<00:04:09.790> all<00:04:10.000> clean<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:10.540> dry

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
now let's all clean and dry

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.460 
now let's all clean and dry
No

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
No

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.560 
No
see<00:04:14.950> if<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.130> looks<00:04:15.340> wet<00:04:15.640> next<00:04:16.060> time<00:04:16.209> she<00:04:16.390> comes

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
see if it looks wet next time she comes

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.960 
see if it looks wet next time she comes
down

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
down

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.360 
down
anyway<00:04:18.540> that's<00:04:18.840> just<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.549> quick<00:04:20.549> way<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.150> test

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
anyway that's just a quick way to test

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.440 
anyway that's just a quick way to test
if<00:04:23.370> your<00:04:23.610> batteries<00:04:24.060> being<00:04:24.380> overcharged<00:04:25.380> if

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
if your batteries being overcharged if

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.530 
if your batteries being overcharged if
the<00:04:27.450> top<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.020> battery<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.530> wet<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:30.510> I

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
the top of the battery is wet so I

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.180 
the top of the battery is wet so I
thought<00:04:30.840> I'd<00:04:30.990> pass<00:04:31.230> that<00:04:31.560> around<00:04:31.680> for<00:04:32.130> you

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
thought I'd pass that around for you

there's<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.080> little<00:05:04.290> rubber<00:05:04.410> cover<00:05:04.830> there<00:05:05.130> I

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
there's a little rubber cover there I

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.730 
there's a little rubber cover there I
don't<00:05:07.080> know<00:05:07.170> if<00:05:07.230> you<00:05:07.350> can<00:05:07.500> see<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:09.020> right<00:05:10.020> where

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
don't know if you can see it right where

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.680 
don't know if you can see it right where
the<00:05:10.920> light<00:05:11.160> is<00:05:11.400> there<00:05:11.700> I<00:05:11.730> pushed<00:05:12.210> it<00:05:12.360> up<00:05:12.480> out<00:05:12.660> of

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
the light is there I pushed it up out of

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.180 
the light is there I pushed it up out of
the<00:05:12.870> way<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.350> I've<00:05:13.800> got<00:05:13.980> my<00:05:14.130> meter<00:05:14.430> on<00:05:14.760> that

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
the way and I've got my meter on that

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.260 
the way and I've got my meter on that
hot<00:05:17.190> terminal<00:05:17.930> now<00:05:18.930> I've<00:05:19.380> got<00:05:19.640> 12.4<00:05:20.640> I<00:05:20.670> just

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
hot terminal now I've got 12.4 I just

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.600 
hot terminal now I've got 12.4 I just
raced<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.990> engine<00:05:22.380> so<00:05:22.620> it<00:05:22.800> did<00:05:23.010> charge<00:05:23.310> up<00:05:23.490> the

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
raced the engine so it did charge up the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.730 
raced the engine so it did charge up the
battery<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.000> little<00:05:24.210> bit<00:05:24.330> probably<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:25.530> I'm

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
battery a little bit probably and I'm

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.760 
battery a little bit probably and I'm
going<00:05:25.980> to<00:05:26.130> start<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.300> engine<00:05:27.630> up<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:28.110> I'll

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
going to start the engine up and I'll

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.220 
going to start the engine up and I'll
just<00:05:28.950> let<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.220> idle<00:05:29.370> I<00:05:29.700> can<00:05:29.880> erase<00:05:30.120> it<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:30.540> I'm

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
just let it idle I can erase it and I'm

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.390 
just let it idle I can erase it and I'm
going<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.470> see<00:05:31.770> what<00:05:32.990> voltage<00:05:33.990> I'm<00:05:34.620> getting<00:05:35.160> at

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
going to see what voltage I'm getting at

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.060 
going to see what voltage I'm getting at
the<00:05:35.610> alternator<00:05:36.180> alternator<00:05:36.919> charges<00:05:37.919> the

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
the alternator alternator charges the

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.420 
the alternator alternator charges the
battery<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:40.610> when<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:43.620> know<00:05:43.740> once<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.070> once

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
battery and when you know once the once

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.520 
battery and when you know once the once
the<00:05:44.610> truck<00:05:44.910> is<00:05:44.940> started<00:05:45.570> the<00:05:45.960> alternator

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
the truck is started the alternator

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.159 
the truck is started the alternator
basically<00:05:47.250> sends<00:05:48.240> power<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.630> the<00:05:48.720> whole<00:05:48.870> car

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
basically sends power to the whole car

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.430 
basically sends power to the whole car
and<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:50.310> batteries<00:05:50.730> in<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:50.910> loop<00:05:51.150> -<00:05:51.419> but<00:05:52.320> let

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
and the batteries in the loop - but let

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.580 
and the batteries in the loop - but let
me<00:05:52.470> start<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:52.860> up

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
me start it up

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.409 
me start it up
okay<00:05:55.590> now<00:05:55.860> we're<00:05:56.130> get<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.550> truck<00:05:57.360> running

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
okay now we're get the truck running

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.350 
okay now we're get the truck running
alternator<00:05:59.419> is<00:05:59.720> putting<00:06:00.290> out<00:06:02.050> some<00:06:03.050> you<00:06:03.620> know

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
alternator is putting out some you know

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.900 
alternator is putting out some you know
14.3<00:06:05.560> which<00:06:06.560> is<00:06:06.770> pretty<00:06:07.370> much<00:06:07.490> right<00:06:07.729> in<00:06:07.759> the

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
14.3 which is pretty much right in the

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.150 
14.3 which is pretty much right in the
ballpark<00:06:08.120> what<00:06:08.630> it<00:06:08.720> should<00:06:08.960> be<00:06:09.110> doing<00:06:09.530> to

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
ballpark what it should be doing to

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.719 
ballpark what it should be doing to
charge<00:06:10.460> up<00:06:10.759> a<00:06:10.880> 12-volt<00:06:11.300> battery<00:06:12.160> so<00:06:13.160> it<00:06:13.580> looks

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
charge up a 12-volt battery so it looks

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.469 
charge up a 12-volt battery so it looks
okay<00:06:14.090> on<00:06:14.120> this<00:06:14.389> end<00:06:14.630> too<00:06:15.340> like<00:06:16.340> I<00:06:16.490> said<00:06:16.789> I<00:06:17.030> just

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
okay on this end too like I said I just

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.420 
okay on this end too like I said I just
cleaned<00:06:18.139> up<00:06:18.289> the<00:06:18.440> battery<00:06:18.800> really<00:06:18.979> good<00:06:19.280> at

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
cleaned up the battery really good at

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.920 
cleaned up the battery really good at
I'm<00:06:19.550> going<00:06:19.699> to<00:06:19.759> keep<00:06:19.910> an<00:06:20.060> eye<00:06:20.210> on<00:06:20.389> the<00:06:20.509> battery

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
I'm going to keep an eye on the battery

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.600 
I'm going to keep an eye on the battery
and<00:06:22.120> although<00:06:23.259> water<00:06:24.259> levels<00:06:24.770> are<00:06:25.039> good<00:06:25.370> in

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
and although water levels are good in

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.830 
and although water levels are good in
the<00:06:25.729> battery<00:06:26.120> now<00:06:26.360> so<00:06:27.940> it<00:06:28.940> shouldn't<00:06:29.360> really

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
the battery now so it shouldn't really

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.080 
the battery now so it shouldn't really
get<00:06:30.080> very<00:06:30.350> wet<00:06:30.560> on<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:30.860> top<00:06:31.100> sometimes<00:06:31.940> it

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
get very wet on the top sometimes it

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.750 
get very wet on the top sometimes it
gets<00:06:32.270> a<00:06:32.389> little<00:06:32.630> bit<00:06:32.930> but<00:06:33.680> it<00:06:34.070> was<00:06:34.160> really<00:06:34.580> wet

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
gets a little bit but it was really wet

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.240 
gets a little bit but it was really wet
before<00:06:34.940> wish<00:06:35.389> I<00:06:35.539> had<00:06:35.660> taken<00:06:35.810> a<00:06:36.080> picture<00:06:36.800> of<00:06:37.100> it
