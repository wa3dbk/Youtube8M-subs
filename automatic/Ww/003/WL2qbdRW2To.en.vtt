Bears<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:37.020> because

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
Bears on this one and not just because

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.910 
Bears on this one and not just because
I'm<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.680> Bears<00:01:37.950> fan<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.530> Bears

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
I'm a Bears fan but actually the Bears

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.710 
I'm a Bears fan but actually the Bears
defense<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:43.020> second<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> league<00:01:43.890> for

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
defense is in second in the league for

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.690 
defense is in second in the league for
rushing<00:01:45.720> defense<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.430> means<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
rushing defense so that means the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
rushing defense so that means the
Packers<00:01:48.030> can't<00:01:48.270> run<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> Packers

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
Packers can't run and if the Packers

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.020 
Packers can't run and if the Packers
can't<00:01:49.740> run<00:01:49.979> they're<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> try<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.610> throw

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
can't run they're going to try and throw

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.710 
can't run they're going to try and throw
and<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.380> Bears<00:01:52.560> defense<00:01:52.920> specializes<00:01:53.670> in

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
and the Bears defense specializes in

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.389 
and the Bears defense specializes in
stopping<00:01:54.720> throws<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.350> big<00:01:55.950> plays<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.560> i<00:01:58.560> don't

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
stopping throws and big plays so i don't

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.499 
stopping throws and big plays so i don't
know<00:01:59.460> i<00:01:59.490> think<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.759> Bears<00:01:59.939> defense<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> going

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
know i think the Bears defense is going

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.300 
know i think the Bears defense is going
