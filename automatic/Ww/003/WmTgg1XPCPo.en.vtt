00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 innovation decision makers are asking their 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.730
 camera today at butagaz and yes 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.980
 the world of energy also lives 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.990
 revolutions we have an appointment all from 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.880
 continued with sylvie Welsh the director 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.880
 commercial and marketing of butagaz 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.580
 Sylvie Wales 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
 hello hello you are the director 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.170
 marketing and commercial of butagaz 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.369
 we'll go back to your main jobs 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.290
 remember that you are a subsidiary of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.970
 shell absolutely the big group 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.640
 oil tanker and that's good because this 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.100
 gas one comes from oil in large 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.330
 part the liquefied petroleum gas as 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.400
 it's called butane is 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.140
 prÃ©gnante that we market it 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.600
 is in fact derived from the systems of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.910
 refining either from so-called 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.589
 gas fields a little bit across the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.920
 world that are very often tied to 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:54.420
 same geo natural gas deposits I 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.879
 see what what you bring in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.379
 more before consumers the world of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.690
 the German of the city is first he has 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.190
 evolved there at the very beginning these were 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.780
 big can in the garden today 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.580
 tanks we do not see them anymore 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.570
 are buried so they are invisible 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.799
 it's a technical evolution 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.790
 today is so much in the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.320
 morals that we even realize 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.330
 nevertheless it remains something of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.670
 master very technologically speaking 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.260
 the other thing behind is that gas 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.450
 remains the same but we need to 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.990
 adapt to today's needs of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.990
 consumer 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.930
 managing the establishment of such a 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.540
 terms of the technical regulations 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.380
 tied to this cistern there and that's it it's 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.330
 things today includes 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.010
 completely in charge for example one 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.520
 is suppliers and advisors 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.680
 in energy 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.870
 so we're going today with contracts 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.600
 which encompasses an enormous number of 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.770
 energy consulting services 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.060
 very concrete things like 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.230
 payment spreads because he does not 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.610
 was not yet a few years 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.110
 the energy is expensive unfortunately 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.970
 whatever energy help the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.380
 customer to smooth these factors over the year 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.090
 this is the first of our requests 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.060
 clients and she is more than legitimate I 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.740
 would say and then behind we have all 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.680
 new needs related to evolutions 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.580
 technology but also linked to 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.080
 new regulations 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.100
 what we want is that our customers 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.420
 he stays customers at us the most 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.580
 long time I prefer to have them 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.560
 in the long term a customer who is going 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.030
 overconsumption will have anyway a 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.620
 real energy problem is going to be 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.720
 ask the question at some point and 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.920
 will decide that maybe the core of 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.510
 cherry burned in the boiler will be 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.740
 more effective or cheaper you go 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.050
 catch cold in a house like this 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.950
 you know that butagaz helps you renovate the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.610
 house to save money 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.160
 energy 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.350
 because between us is not fallen who is going 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.330
 tell you the bonus goals start at gas 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.709
 it's also up to 500 euros debt for 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.610
 replace your boiler appointment 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.610
 on butagaz point fr 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.770
 that's the innovation of the end of 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.750
 90s is the famous cube its target 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.550
 gas barbecues plancha 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.370
 we have that behind it is for the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.270
 fishermen Sunday 16 years old even though that 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.340
 it's not a pew 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.980
 that's itinerant barbecue camping 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.959
 cars but also indeed the fisherman the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.209
 hunter we still want to eat hot 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.670
 and eat well ben this little tool there he 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.350
 is great is the 3 in a stove and 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.310
 barbecue at the same time and then after 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.600
 you have the great revolution 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.280
 technological in fact that 's the art 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.050
 this one it's 2000s and 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.400
 this one there is more metal at all 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.660
 share a tiny bit there at the tap 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.610
 to make the connection 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.690
 there you have no more metal from where 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.600
 this lightness 1 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.030
 this bottle there with his kitchen with 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.989
 its design that's the result of five 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.459
 years of research 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.019
 first because it's revolutionary 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.340
 because the French market had 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.930
 still never willing a bottle in 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.760
 these materials there and then after all is 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.140
 complicated suppliers capable of 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.150
 we make an egg in composites like 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.280
 that ensures the translucent side 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.110
 transparent of this egg that allows the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.209
 customer to see the level of gas and 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.680
 see where it is in utah 16 degrees 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.569
 at night it's a real innovation and 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.660
 especially this is the first request of our 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.660
 customers 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.940
 this box she wants to count both 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.300
 energies that will equip a house 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.459
 new propane heater namely the 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.670
 gas on one side and the electricity of 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.670
 the other 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.010
 thank you very much if the Welsh in all 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.080
 case for these explanations then we see 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.570
 that in such a traditional craft 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.670
 than the gas we do not 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.150
 necessarily attention we can thanks to the 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.550
 digital 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.060
 innovate among others absolutely thank you 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.060
 see you soon 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.960
 to summarize you please to people of 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.120
 switch 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.920
 it was rather short in addition to 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.390
 will find no it's sure people they 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.130
 were used to it but it starts to 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.560
 to be a little old-fashioned but a guy who 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.060
 talk about me yes suddenly we see summer 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.590
 refined for color 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.090
 the more we do not touch it is part of 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.290
 identity butagaz must all 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.530
 customers find themselves in the bottle 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:03.020
 as to quote an annoyed goal the mark of the 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.910
 comfort has happened comfort and not 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.700
 of the round but I'm really strong 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.320
 the new month and much less and 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.600
 pedestrians starting to do a little bit of 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.160
 too the absolute priority 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.900
 more modern than when we see it 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.700
 think immediately innovation aimo 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.870
 more print all novelties that 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.870
 blida gaz is growing right now 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.110
 no but it's not going to work together 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.690
 since 69 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.150
 it was not even roofs 69 and you 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.880
 replace like that to give me one 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.990
 talk about the new logo the the new the 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:46.040
 taste ah well yes yes the new 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:49.370
 logo and I knew jobs in a beautiful 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.800
 loose t-shirt or a new one for you 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.190
 you know it since not looking for them 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.190
 buy everything
