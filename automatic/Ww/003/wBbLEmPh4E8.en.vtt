00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.840
 I greet the flag of sopa in the Tyrion guide 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.520
 still we have invoker y not with 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.880
 that you play a lot of man saying 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.520
 truth so i 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.980
 and I give up that I don't like him but not yet 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.680
 I know how little I know about him if you 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.630
 understand what I mean 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.000
 invoker change me he reminds 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.890
 Some German I suspect that he was 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.689
 among the founders of the kraftwerk group are ani and 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.400
 vova extend the line because he was 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.190
 asshole not dressed like them 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.600
 I am sure that he released this one by no one 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.370
 appreciated the album of his quotes where he is 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.230
 compared himself to modern likeness 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.960
 Hitler and appropriated his achievement 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.450
 not really worked in germany they are there to 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.460
 this is so-so and certainly not 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.460
 worked abroad so before invoker in 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.000
 basically screwed up he lost faith in 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.830
 yourself turned into a home hermit 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.960
 but he's an invoker and because he is full 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.580
 asshole found his strength and regained everything 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.530

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.690

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.260
 by the way hate invoker but if you haven't 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.780
 noticed 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.700

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.799
 wizard, you would not look so well 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.450
 would be like this 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.220
 fucking wizard because he needs 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.780
 spend up to the dick of time exploring 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.630
 sorts through all sorts of books with plans 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.609
 studying all these fucking time and so why 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.039

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:23.289

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.770
 pointless just take a look at it 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.359
 floor inadequate poser he poser he of those 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.880

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.060

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.159
 curb possible together precipitation 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.020
 it's disgusting so that he froze 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.990
 and here above mentioned giant 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.549
 meatball type fire still had time 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 one 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.049
 type like a lady on line or something like 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.569
 I think he still has it 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.299
 big ice ball like a frost new but 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.829
 i may be wrong there is another one like 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.229
 on an artillery shell which in 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.899
 light it completely useless horseradish 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.639
 Prince I am pretty sure that there should be 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.610
 something like invisibility which he 

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:11.950
 constantly uses and I know for sure that 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.870
 this he calls a huge fiery 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.849
 bastard can't remember 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.140
 if you are going to play for the invoker 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.090
 you need 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.860
 It seems to me that everyone who plays Invoker 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.319
 am like aliens for hefty 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.319
 brains and they have the type there all stored 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.110

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.300
 yourself a guy who is like himself 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.550
 block diagram and knows that this spell 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.990
 make it it ctr only depends on 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.560
 your level depending on the level 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.930
 exort and you can fuck huam invoker 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.819
