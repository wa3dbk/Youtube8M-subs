and out animation and also a corner
radius<00:00:48.640> animation<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.480> we<00:00:50.320> can<00:00:50.440> hop<00:00:50.680> into<00:00:50.920> the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
radius animation and we can hop into the

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.330 
radius animation and we can hop into the
settings<00:00:51.699> for<00:00:51.940> Anna<00:00:52.840> banner<00:00:53.140> here<00:00:53.410> pretty

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
settings for Anna banner here pretty

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.280 
settings for Anna banner here pretty
straightforward<00:00:54.640> pretty<00:00:55.180> simple<00:00:55.600> first<00:00:56.080> off

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
straightforward pretty simple first off

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.619 
straightforward pretty simple first off
we<00:00:56.470> have<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.739> on-off<00:00:57.190> enabled<00:00:57.850> toggle<00:00:58.269> as<00:00:58.420> you

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
we have the on-off enabled toggle as you

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.000 
we have the on-off enabled toggle as you
guys<00:00:58.750> can<00:00:58.870> see<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:59.019> love<00:00:59.260> tweaks<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.589> to<00:00:59.830> that

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
guys can see I love tweaks that to that

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.829 
guys can see I love tweaks that to that
and<00:01:00.370> then<00:01:00.729> we<00:01:00.820> do<00:01:00.909> have<00:01:01.120> an<00:01:01.269> animated

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
and then we do have an animated

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.680 
and then we do have an animated
transparency<00:01:02.739> option<00:01:03.300> animated<00:01:04.300> corner

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
transparency option animated corner

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.800 
transparency option animated corner
radius<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.350> then<00:01:05.590> also<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:06.010> banner<00:01:06.550> tint<00:01:07.090> so

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
radius and then also a banner tint so

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.290 
radius and then also a banner tint so
the<00:01:08.229> animated<00:01:08.770> transparency<00:01:09.580> obviously<00:01:10.060> it

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
the animated transparency obviously it

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.480 
the animated transparency obviously it
kind<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.600> fades<00:01:10.810> in<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.290> out<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:11.680> then<00:01:11.740> the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
kind of fades in and out and then the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.880 
kind of fades in and out and then the
corner<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.600> coroner's<00:01:14.049> kind<00:01:14.290> of<00:01:14.409> pop<00:01:14.710> in

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
corner is the coroner's kind of pop in

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.380 
corner is the coroner's kind of pop in
and<00:01:15.010> out<00:01:15.100> as<00:01:15.280> well<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.670> it's<00:01:16.090> cool<00:01:16.270> because

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
and out as well and it's cool because

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.240 
and out as well and it's cool because
you<00:01:16.570> can<00:01:16.600> actually<00:01:16.720> test<00:01:17.170> out<00:01:17.409> all<00:01:17.650> your

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
you can actually test out all your

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.070 
you can actually test out all your
banners<00:01:18.640> right<00:01:19.030> from<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.240> settings<00:01:19.659> so<00:01:20.020> you

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
banners right from the settings so you

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.649 
banners right from the settings so you
can<00:01:20.229> like<00:01:20.409> basically<00:01:20.950> fine-tune<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.540> be

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
can like basically fine-tune this to be

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.830 
can like basically fine-tune this to be
exactly<00:01:23.049> how<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:23.290> want<00:01:23.620> before<00:01:24.010> you<00:01:24.520> know

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
exactly how you want before you know

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.749 
exactly how you want before you know
exiting<00:01:25.840> out<00:01:25.990> of<00:01:26.140> settings<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:27.579> just

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
exiting out of settings and it just

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.969 
exiting out of settings and it just
makes<00:01:27.939> it<00:01:28.060> much<00:01:28.270> more<00:01:28.479> convenient<00:01:28.899> so<00:01:29.289> we<00:01:29.829> can

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
makes it much more convenient so we can

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.740 
makes it much more convenient so we can
change<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.369> animation<00:01:30.549> speed<00:01:31.060> by<00:01:31.329> turning<00:01:31.600> it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
change the animation speed by turning it

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.330 
change the animation speed by turning it
down<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.560> as<00:01:32.680> you<00:01:32.770> guys<00:01:32.860> can<00:01:33.039> see<00:01:33.100> the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
down so as you guys can see the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.330 
down so as you guys can see the
animation<00:01:33.640> speed<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.270> much<00:01:34.899> slower<00:01:35.200> now<00:01:35.590> so

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
animation speed is much slower now so

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.249 
animation speed is much slower now so
that's<00:01:36.490> what<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.939> animation<00:01:37.899> speed<00:01:38.079> looks

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
that's what the animation speed looks

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.380 
that's what the animation speed looks
like<00:01:38.380> when<00:01:38.590> it's<00:01:38.710> real<00:01:38.829> slow<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.909> also<00:01:40.060> can

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
like when it's real slow you also can

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.240 
like when it's real slow you also can
change<00:01:40.719> the<00:01:40.990> corner<00:01:41.439> radius<00:01:41.680> let's<00:01:41.950> turn<00:01:42.130> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
change the corner radius let's turn the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.920 
change the corner radius let's turn the
animation<00:01:42.640> back<00:01:42.880> up<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.240> it's<00:01:43.359> easier<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.750> see

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
animation back up so it's easier to see

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.469 
animation back up so it's easier to see
so<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.740> corner<00:01:45.009> radius<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.640> much<00:01:45.939> smaller<00:01:46.210> now

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
so the corner radius is much smaller now

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.149 
so the corner radius is much smaller now
you<00:01:47.049> can<00:01:47.200> make<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.409> even<00:01:47.530> smaller<00:01:47.770> than<00:01:48.009> that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
you can make it even smaller than that

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.709 
you can make it even smaller than that
and<00:01:48.520> once<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.789> stops<00:01:49.060> we'll<00:01:49.270> test<00:01:49.509> it<00:01:49.630> out

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
and once it stops we'll test it out

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.450 
and once it stops we'll test it out
again<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:53.170> ahead<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.320> click<00:01:53.979> on<00:01:54.100> tests

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
again so go ahead and click on tests

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.160 
again so go ahead and click on tests
they're<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:54.789> as<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.000> can<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.450> corner

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
they're so as you can see the corner

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.080 
they're so as you can see the corner
radius<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.619> even<00:01:57.039> smaller<00:01:57.159> now<00:01:57.490> let's<00:01:57.850> just

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
radius is even smaller now let's just

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.419 
radius is even smaller now let's just
dismiss<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:58.719> we<00:01:59.289> can<00:01:59.439> turn<00:01:59.619> that<00:01:59.799> all<00:02:00.009> the

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
dismiss that we can turn that all the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.459 
dismiss that we can turn that all the
way<00:02:00.579> up<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.000> test<00:02:01.479> that<00:02:01.659> out<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:02.200> there<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.439> go

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
way up and test that out so there you go

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.160 
way up and test that out so there you go
get<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.740> really<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:04.210> noticeable<00:02:04.689> effect

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
get a really really noticeable effect

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.620 
get a really really noticeable effect
there<00:02:05.499> and<00:02:06.340> then<00:02:06.490> obviously<00:02:06.700> if<00:02:07.240> we<00:02:07.390> were<00:02:07.509> to

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
there and then obviously if we were to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.410 
there and then obviously if we were to
turn<00:02:07.840> off<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.399> transparency<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:10.119> can<00:02:10.270> test

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
turn off the transparency we can test

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.450 
turn off the transparency we can test
out<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:11.290> just<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.680> corner<00:02:12.220> radius

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
out that so it's just the corner radius

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.790 
out that so it's just the corner radius
animation<00:02:13.120> we<00:02:13.960> can<00:02:14.110> go<00:02:14.200> ahead<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.380> swipe<00:02:14.650> that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
animation we can go ahead and swipe that

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.300 
animation we can go ahead and swipe that
off<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.250> then<00:02:15.340> let's<00:02:15.490> just<00:02:15.700> turn<00:02:16.270> off<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
off and then let's just turn off the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.440 
off and then let's just turn off the
animated<00:02:18.310> corner<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.910> we<00:02:19.030> can<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.180> do<00:02:19.420> a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
animated corner and we can just do a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.450 
animated corner and we can just do a
test<00:02:20.350> for<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.620> fade<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.130> can<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:21.370> it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
test for the fade so you can have it

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.309 
test for the fade so you can have it
just<00:02:21.580> kind<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.850> like<00:02:22.030> almost<00:02:22.630> like<00:02:22.750> flashing

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
just kind of like almost like flashing

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.720 
just kind of like almost like flashing
looking<00:02:23.650> obviously<00:02:24.100> if<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.250> were<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.400> turn<00:02:24.550> it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
looking obviously if you were to turn it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.820 
looking obviously if you were to turn it
down<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.120> little<00:02:25.510> bit<00:02:25.660> here<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.380> would<00:02:26.530> have<00:02:26.650> an

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
down a little bit here it would have an

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.550 
down a little bit here it would have an
even<00:02:27.190> different<00:02:27.610> effect<00:02:27.940> it'd<00:02:28.120> be<00:02:28.300> very

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
even different effect it'd be very

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.990 
even different effect it'd be very
subtle<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:29.890> its<00:02:29.980> fading<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:30.520> out<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
subtle for its fading in and out and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.330 
subtle for its fading in and out and
then<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.780> do<00:02:32.020> like<00:02:32.320> i<00:02:32.500> said<00:02:32.710> i<00:02:32.740> have<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.920> tint

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
then you do like i said i have a tint

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.730 
then you do like i said i have a tint
option<00:02:33.820> where<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.030> can<00:02:34.090> add<00:02:34.630> your<00:02:35.080> own<00:02:35.140> tint

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
option where you can add your own tint

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.240 
option where you can add your own tint
to

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.250 
to
notification<00:02:36.910> banner<00:02:37.180> let's<00:02:38.020> go<00:02:38.110> ahead<00:02:38.140> and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
notification banner let's go ahead and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.780 
notification banner let's go ahead and
let's<00:02:38.380> just<00:02:38.500> do<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.770> don't<00:02:39.070> know<00:02:39.130> green<00:02:39.460> I<00:02:39.610> guess

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
let's just do I don't know green I guess

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.850 
let's just do I don't know green I guess
would<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:39.970> cool<00:02:40.210> I<00:02:40.480> let's<00:02:41.050> test<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.380> out<00:02:41.500> so

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
would be cool I let's test that out so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.620 
would be cool I let's test that out so
as<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.130> can<00:02:42.220> see<00:02:42.400> there's<00:02:42.610> kind<00:02:43.210> of<00:02:43.240> a<00:02:43.360> green

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
as you can see there's kind of a green

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.720 
as you can see there's kind of a green
tint<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.370> pretty<00:02:45.370> straightforward
