00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
organic yellow split peas this is an

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.680 
organic yellow split peas this is an
organic<00:00:39.050> barley<00:00:39.410> feed<00:00:39.940> it's<00:00:40.940> an<00:00:41.149> animal<00:00:41.449> feed

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
organic barley feed it's an animal feed

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.150 
organic barley feed it's an animal feed
the<00:00:41.870> only<00:00:42.019> difference<00:00:42.350> with<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.679> animal<00:00:42.949> feed

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
the only difference with the animal feed

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.979 
the only difference with the animal feed
that<00:00:43.309> I've<00:00:43.460> noticed<00:00:43.850> is<00:00:43.969> it's<00:00:44.120> not<00:00:44.539> as<00:00:44.719> clean

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
that I've noticed is it's not as clean

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.479 
that I've noticed is it's not as clean
sometimes<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:45.559> find<00:00:45.739> little<00:00:45.980> pieces<00:00:46.160> of

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
sometimes you find little pieces of

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.270 
sometimes you find little pieces of
debris<00:00:46.789> in<00:00:47.149> there<00:00:47.350> so<00:00:48.350> these<00:00:48.710> are<00:00:48.829> my<00:00:48.920> organic

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
debris in there so these are my organic

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.610 
debris in there so these are my organic
rolled<00:00:49.670> oats<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:50.120> usually<00:00:50.510> actually<00:00:50.960> feed<00:00:51.440> them

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
rolled oats I usually actually feed them

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.610 
rolled oats I usually actually feed them
the<00:00:51.800> whole<00:00:51.949> old<00:00:52.309> spit<00:00:52.850> we<00:00:53.690> have<00:00:53.809> old<00:00:54.019> rolled

and then next to it is chia seed and
then<00:01:08.050> I<00:01:08.380> have<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:10.150> kelp<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:11.710> animals<00:01:12.159> which<00:01:12.369> is

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
then I have my kelp for animals which is

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.790 
then I have my kelp for animals which is
also<00:01:12.700> organic<00:01:13.270> see<00:01:13.840> if<00:01:13.900> I<00:01:13.990> can<00:01:14.170> be<00:01:14.260> shadows

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
put four cups of each thing in the bin

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.140 
put four cups of each thing in the bin
and<00:01:25.440> what<00:01:26.440> I<00:01:26.470> have<00:01:26.650> is<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.830> bucket<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:27.490> has<00:01:28.090> a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
gamal lid so we can seal it so no bugs

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.420 
gamal lid so we can seal it so no bugs
ever<00:01:32.170> can<00:01:32.440> get<00:01:32.590> into<00:01:32.830> there<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.040> we<00:01:33.130> can<00:01:33.280> keep

cups of the P and you don't have to be

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.600 
cups of the P and you don't have to be
perfect

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:58.810

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.710 

I'm<00:01:59.820> only<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> put

so

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.080 

a<00:02:19.470> cup<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.400> my<00:02:21.110> flaxseed

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.640 

and<00:02:26.870> also<00:02:27.290> my<00:02:27.709> cheese<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.340> like<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.790> mix<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.120> up

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
and also my cheese I like to mix it up

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.710 
and also my cheese I like to mix it up
give<00:02:30.650> them<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.950> variety<00:02:31.459> every<00:02:32.300> time<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.510> make

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
give them a variety every time I make

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.350 
give them a variety every time I make
the<00:02:32.840> feed<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.110> make<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:34.280> their<00:02:34.730> nutrition<00:02:35.209> is

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
the feed I make it so their nutrition is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.809 
the feed I make it so their nutrition is
obviously<00:02:35.810> extremely<00:02:36.080> important<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.890> me<00:02:37.040> so

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
obviously extremely important to me so

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.690 
obviously extremely important to me so
um<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.870> don't<00:02:39.650> think<00:02:39.860> they<00:02:39.950> should<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.160> get

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
um I don't think they should just get

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.160 
um I don't think they should just get
their<00:02:40.910> diet<00:02:41.090> entirely<00:02:41.480> from<00:02:41.900> grains

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
their diet entirely from grains

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.350 
their diet entirely from grains
obviously<00:02:42.739> we<00:02:43.040> free-range<00:02:43.550> every<00:02:43.880> day<00:02:44.060> and

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
obviously we free-range every day and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.540 
obviously we free-range every day and
let<00:02:45.050> them<00:02:45.200> out<00:02:45.319> into<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> garden<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:46.250> do<00:02:46.370> their

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
let them out into the garden to do their

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.839 
let them out into the garden to do their
thing<00:02:46.790> they<00:02:47.720> do<00:02:48.019> destroy<00:02:48.500> some<00:02:48.739> things<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.250> lot

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
thing they do destroy some things a lot

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.479 
thing they do destroy some things a lot
of<00:02:49.970> my<00:02:50.150> starter<00:02:50.569> plants<00:02:50.920> they<00:02:51.920> took<00:02:52.099> out<00:02:52.280> my

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
of my starter plants they took out my

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.430 
of my starter plants they took out my
watermelons<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.209> stuff<00:02:53.390> but<00:02:53.569> I<00:02:53.959> figured<00:02:54.349> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
watermelons and stuff but I figured the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.580 
watermelons and stuff but I figured the
trade-off<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.800> worth<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:56.500> think<00:02:57.500> they

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
trade-off is worth it I think they

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.170 
trade-off is worth it I think they
should<00:02:57.769> be<00:02:57.920> getting<00:02:58.100> plenty<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.610> bugs<00:02:58.850> and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
should be getting plenty of bugs and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.400 
should be getting plenty of bugs and
access<00:02:59.720> to<00:03:01.510> greens<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.780> stuff<00:03:02.989> in<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.200> garden

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
access to greens and stuff in the garden

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.820 
access to greens and stuff in the garden
so<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:04.069> so<00:03:04.910> what<00:03:05.090> we've<00:03:05.239> done<00:03:05.420> here<00:03:05.530> we<00:03:06.530> wanted

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
so and so what we've done here we wanted

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.830 
so and so what we've done here we wanted
to<00:03:06.890> plant<00:03:07.100> something<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:08.090> they<00:03:08.450> could<00:03:08.660> have

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
to plant something that they could have

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.539 
to plant something that they could have
access<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.470> where<00:03:09.769> they<00:03:09.890> could<00:03:10.040> get<00:03:10.130> greens<00:03:10.370> on

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
access to where they could get greens on

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.180 
access to where they could get greens on
a<00:03:10.580> daily<00:03:10.910> basis<00:03:11.410> as<00:03:12.410> well<00:03:12.799> as<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
a daily basis as well as the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.089 
a daily basis as well as the
free-ranging<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.930> we<00:03:15.080> built<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:15.739> frame

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
free-ranging but so we built this frame

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.460 
free-ranging but so we built this frame
out<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:16.640> hardware<00:03:17.090> cloth<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.660> then<00:03:18.380> we

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
out of hardware cloth and then we

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.050 
out of hardware cloth and then we
planted<00:03:18.799> some<00:03:19.040> seeds<00:03:19.099> in<00:03:19.459> there<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:19.849> have

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
planted some seeds in there and I have

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.099 
also plan to plant some comfrey in the
future<00:03:36.320> it's<00:03:37.280> really<00:03:37.519> high<00:03:37.730> in<00:03:37.760> b12<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:39.049> it

future it's really high in b12 and it

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.840 
future it's really high in b12 and it
boosts<00:03:39.350> immunity<00:03:39.829> so<00:03:40.220> somewhere<00:03:40.609> that<00:03:40.730> can

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
boosts immunity so somewhere that can

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.460 
boosts immunity so somewhere that can
get<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.000> little<00:03:41.209> bit<00:03:41.450> every<00:03:41.660> day<00:03:41.690> not<00:03:42.109> too<00:03:42.290> much
