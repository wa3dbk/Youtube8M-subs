00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
is the CEO and co-founder of tactus and

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.820 
is the CEO and co-founder of tactus and
what<00:00:16.270> Texas's<00:00:16.750> is<00:00:16.960> a<00:00:16.990> technology<00:00:17.560> that

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
what Texas's is a technology that

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.640 
what Texas's is a technology that
actually<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.760> physical<00:00:19.750> keyboard<00:00:20.050> kind<00:00:20.560> of

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
actually a physical keyboard kind of

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.859 
actually a physical keyboard kind of
morphs<00:00:21.250> out<00:00:21.519> of<00:00:21.760> a<00:00:21.939> touchscreen<00:00:22.599> to<00:00:22.750> give

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
morphs out of a touchscreen to give

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.480 
morphs out of a touchscreen to give
people<00:00:23.050> that<00:00:23.349> physical<00:00:23.679> keyboard<00:00:24.009> experience

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
people that physical keyboard experience

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.150 
people that physical keyboard experience
while<00:00:25.179> also<00:00:25.420> using<00:00:25.570> a<00:00:26.109> touchscreen<00:00:26.320> device<00:00:26.589> so

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
while also using a touchscreen device so

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.220 
while also using a touchscreen device so
if<00:00:27.820> you<00:00:28.000> could<00:00:28.210> you<00:00:28.240> know<00:00:28.359> just<00:00:28.449> explain<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.080> us

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
if you could you know just explain to us

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.870 
if you could you know just explain to us
how<00:00:29.410> this<00:00:29.710> works<00:00:29.769> it's<00:00:30.250> very<00:00:30.310> interesting

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
how this works it's very interesting

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.730 
how this works it's very interesting
it's<00:00:31.000> kind<00:00:31.150> of<00:00:31.179> hard<00:00:31.359> to<00:00:31.419> imagine<00:00:32.169> if<00:00:32.650> you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:32.740 
it's kind of hard to imagine if you

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.110 
it's kind of hard to imagine if you
wouldn't<00:00:32.980> use<00:00:33.100> it<00:00:33.250> yourself<00:00:33.310> how<00:00:33.910> does<00:00:34.030> this

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
wouldn't use it yourself how does this

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.650 
wouldn't use it yourself how does this
actually<00:00:34.300> work

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
actually work

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.660 
actually work
sure<00:00:35.350> so<00:00:35.650> what<00:00:35.800> we<00:00:35.950> have<00:00:36.070> here<00:00:36.309> is<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.399> world's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
sure so what we have here is a world's

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.069 
sure so what we have here is a world's
first<00:00:36.760> tactile<00:00:37.210> touchscreen<00:00:37.629> what<00:00:37.930> we're

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
first tactile touchscreen what we're

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.690 
first tactile touchscreen what we're
creating<00:00:38.230> with<00:00:38.590> our<00:00:38.680> tactile<00:00:39.039> touchscreen<00:00:39.520> is

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
creating with our tactile touchscreen is

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.670 
creating with our tactile touchscreen is
real<00:00:40.210> physical<00:00:40.719> buttons<00:00:40.989> that<00:00:41.140> dynamically

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
real physical buttons that dynamically

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.590 
real physical buttons that dynamically
come<00:00:42.280> in<00:00:42.520> and<00:00:42.640> out<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.329> screen

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
come in and out of the screen

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600 
come in and out of the screen
so<00:00:43.930> it's<00:00:44.410> controlled<00:00:44.860> by<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:44.980> applications

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
so it's controlled by the applications

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.670 
so it's controlled by the applications
you're<00:00:45.730> using<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.840> we<00:00:46.930> do<00:00:47.050> attacked<00:00:47.350> us<00:00:47.500> we

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
you're using what we do attacked us we

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.139 
you're using what we do attacked us we
replace<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.010> normal<00:00:48.370> window<00:00:48.640> with<00:00:48.820> what<00:00:49.090> we

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
replace a normal window with what we

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.880 
replace a normal window with what we
call<00:00:49.270> our<00:00:49.359> tactile<00:00:49.780> layer<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.680> that's<00:00:50.800> a

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
call our tactile layer and that's a

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.290 
call our tactile layer and that's a
window<00:00:51.100> that's<00:00:51.340> filled<00:00:51.550> full<00:00:51.730> of<00:00:51.760> micro

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
window that's filled full of micro

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.549 
window that's filled full of micro
channels<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:52.840> are<00:00:52.899> filled<00:00:53.170> with<00:00:53.260> a<00:00:53.350> liquid

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
channels that are filled with a liquid

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.439 
channels that are filled with a liquid
and<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.370> underlying<00:00:54.550> technology<00:00:55.120> is<00:00:55.180> micro

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
and the underlying technology is micro

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.599 
and the underlying technology is micro
fluidics<00:00:55.809> what<00:00:56.590> we<00:00:56.710> do<00:00:56.859> is<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.280> create<00:00:57.430> the

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
fluidics what we do is to create the

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.520 
fluidics what we do is to create the
physical<00:00:57.760> buttons<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:58.539> we<00:00:58.809> change<00:00:59.260> the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
physical buttons is we change the

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.349 
physical buttons is we change the
pressure<00:00:59.859> of<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.129> fluid<00:01:00.519> and<00:01:00.879> when<00:01:01.239> we

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
pressure of that fluid and when we

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.759 
pressure of that fluid and when we
pressurize<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:01.809> fluid<00:01:02.109> the<00:01:02.199> buttons<00:01:02.410> pop<00:01:02.620> out

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
pressurize it fluid the buttons pop out

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.740 
pressurize it fluid the buttons pop out
of<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.980> screen<00:01:03.039> and<00:01:03.460> this<00:01:04.000> for<00:01:04.360> example<00:01:04.570> in

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
of the screen and this for example in

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.210 
of the screen and this for example in
this<00:01:04.840> case<00:01:05.019> we<00:01:05.080> have<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.379> QWERTY<00:01:05.710> keyboard<00:01:06.070> so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
this case we have a QWERTY keyboard so

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.190 
this case we have a QWERTY keyboard so
we<00:01:06.250> get<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.120> physical<00:01:07.360> QWERTY<00:01:07.780> keyboard

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
we get the physical QWERTY keyboard

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.420 
we get the physical QWERTY keyboard
coming<00:01:08.439> out<00:01:08.560> of<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.710> screen<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:09.040> this<00:01:09.159> device

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
coming out of the screen of this device

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.550 
coming out of the screen of this device
yeah<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:09.880> have<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.240> admit<00:01:10.479> it<00:01:11.140> feels<00:01:11.350> really

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
yeah I have to admit it feels really

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.980 
yeah I have to admit it feels really
cool<00:01:11.650> I<00:01:12.070> mean<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.670> just<00:01:12.780> watching<00:01:13.780> them<00:01:13.900> and

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
cool I mean and just watching them and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.539 
cool I mean and just watching them and
feeling<00:01:14.229> them<00:01:14.380> kind<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.590> recede<00:01:14.979> back<00:01:15.189> into

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
feeling them kind of recede back into

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.929 
feeling them kind of recede back into
yeah<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.600> display<00:01:17.290> is<00:01:17.470> very<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:18.549> it's

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
yeah the display is very it's it's

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.850 
yeah the display is very it's it's
interesting<00:01:19.150> yeah<00:01:19.900> I<00:01:19.930> have<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.530> say<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:20.710> has<00:01:20.770> to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
interesting yeah I have to say it has to

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.859 
interesting yeah I have to say it has to
really<00:01:21.159> be<00:01:21.250> experience<00:01:21.939> to<00:01:22.090> really<00:01:22.689> believe

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
really be experience to really believe

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.179 
really be experience to really believe
that<00:01:22.990> yeah<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.650> can<00:01:23.680> create<00:01:24.009> something

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
that yeah you can create something

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.499 
that yeah you can create something
physical<00:01:24.640> eiders<00:01:24.909> green<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.180> it's<00:01:25.299> not<00:01:25.479> a

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
physical eiders green and it's not a

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.149 
physical eiders green and it's not a
sort<00:01:25.750> trickier<00:01:26.110> senses<00:01:26.530> these<00:01:26.680> buttons<00:01:27.009> are

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
sort trickier senses these buttons are

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.740 
sort trickier senses these buttons are
about<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.790> millimeter<00:01:28.000> tall<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.659> it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
about a millimeter tall and it's

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.149 
about a millimeter tall and it's
something<00:01:28.930> really<00:01:29.170> physical<00:01:29.619> so<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.860> it

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
something really physical so you it

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.530 
something really physical so you it
starts<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.610> feel<00:01:30.729> like<00:01:30.759> a<00:01:30.880> real<00:01:31.090> keyboard<00:01:31.299> now

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
starts to feel like a real keyboard now

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.539 
starts to feel like a real keyboard now
this<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.780> still<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:31.960> prototype<00:01:32.200> but<00:01:33.009> it<00:01:33.130> shows

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
this is still a prototype but it shows

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.850 
this is still a prototype but it shows
you<00:01:33.729> what<00:01:34.390> we<00:01:34.659> can<00:01:34.780> do<00:01:34.899> in<00:01:35.020> TAC<00:01:35.409> just<00:01:35.649> in<00:01:35.740> terms

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
you what we can do in TAC just in terms

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.440 
you what we can do in TAC just in terms
of<00:01:36.040> creating<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.399> next-generation<00:01:36.759> user

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
of creating this next-generation user

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.499 
of creating this next-generation user
interface<00:01:37.869> right<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:40.000> technology

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
interface right so so the technology

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.719 
interface right so so the technology
itself<00:01:40.869> is<00:01:41.020> called<00:01:41.229> micro<00:01:41.680> fluidics<00:01:42.430> that's

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
itself is called micro fluidics that's

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.310 
itself is called micro fluidics that's
right<00:01:42.909> where<00:01:43.329> else<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.840> mean<00:01:43.960> to<00:01:44.079> give<00:01:44.200> people

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
right where else I mean to give people

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.350 
right where else I mean to give people
an<00:01:44.470> idea<00:01:44.680> where<00:01:44.979> else<00:01:45.220> this<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.549> applied<00:01:45.970> like

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
an idea where else this is applied like

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.209 
an idea where else this is applied like
I'm<00:01:46.509> sure<00:01:46.659> where<00:01:47.140> else<00:01:47.290> could<00:01:47.469> we<00:01:47.649> could<00:01:48.159> we

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
I'm sure where else could we could we

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.740 
I'm sure where else could we could we
find<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.000> kind<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.270> thing<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:49.509> micro

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
find this kind of thing so micro

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.050 
find this kind of thing so micro
fluidics<00:01:50.409> itself<00:01:50.740> has<00:01:50.860> been<00:01:50.979> around<00:01:51.250> for<00:01:51.610> 20

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
fluidics itself has been around for 20

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.539 
fluidics itself has been around for 20
plus<00:01:52.149> years<00:01:52.270> at<00:01:52.899> rigidly<00:01:53.549> became

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
plus years at rigidly became

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.859 
plus years at rigidly became
commercialized<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.270> inkjet<00:01:55.420> printers<00:01:55.780> so

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
commercialized and inkjet printers so

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.569 
commercialized and inkjet printers so
probably<00:01:56.229> most<00:01:56.350> people<00:01:56.619> have<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> microfluidic

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
probably most people have a microfluidic

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.300 
probably most people have a microfluidic

how do you make touchscreens more usable
particularly<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.080> tactile<00:02:20.410> part<00:02:20.680> because<00:02:20.830> we

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
particularly the tactile part because we

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.050 
particularly the tactile part because we

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
to feel the screen and that's what we've

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.090 
to feel the screen and that's what we've
done<00:02:25.210> at<00:02:25.390> tactics<00:02:25.720> right<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:26.470> I'm<00:02:26.590> curious<00:02:26.740> as

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
done at tactics right so I'm curious as

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.460 
done at tactics right so I'm curious as

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
the co-founder of this company what was

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.680 
the co-founder of this company what was
the<00:02:29.620> aha<00:02:29.860> moment<00:02:30.490> for<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.850> just<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.330> was<00:02:31.570> an

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
the aha moment for you of just it was an

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.350 
the aha moment for you of just it was an
annoyance<00:02:32.320> at<00:02:32.560> using<00:02:32.740> an<00:02:32.920> iPhone<00:02:33.280> or<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:34.210> was

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
annoyance at using an iPhone or it was

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.880 
annoyance at using an iPhone or it was
just<00:02:34.570> desire<00:02:35.050> for<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.350> better<00:02:35.500> keyboard

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
just desire for a better keyboard

just desire for a better keyboard
experience<00:02:36.310> on<00:02:36.430> touch<00:02:36.610> screen<00:02:37.230> exactly<00:02:38.230> just

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
experience on touch screen exactly just

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.530 
experience on touch screen exactly just
go<00:02:38.740> back<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.040> back<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.610> iPhone<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.150> when

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
go back to back to the iPhone so when

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.270 
go back to back to the iPhone so when
the<00:02:40.600> first<00:02:40.810> iPhone<00:02:40.930> came<00:02:41.350> out<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.920> was<00:02:42.220> a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
the first iPhone came out I was a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.560 
the first iPhone came out I was a
blackberry<00:02:42.610> user<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.030> saw<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.270> iPhone

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
blackberry user and I saw the iPhone

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.870 
blackberry user and I saw the iPhone
like<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.960> looks<00:02:44.170> great<00:02:44.440> i<00:02:44.760> touchscreen<00:02:45.760> is

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
like that looks great i touchscreen is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.970 
like that looks great i touchscreen is
wonderful<00:02:46.270> but<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.870> can't<00:02:47.440> do<00:02:47.590> without<00:02:47.830> my

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
wonderful but I can't do without my

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.110 
wonderful but I can't do without my
blackberry<00:02:48.160> buttons<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.760> want<00:02:48.970> something

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
blackberry buttons I want something

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.850 
blackberry buttons I want something
physical<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.810> was<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.050> aha<00:02:50.230> moment<00:02:50.410> oh

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
physical and it was that aha moment oh

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.280 
physical and it was that aha moment oh
well<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.730> solve<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.030> problem<00:02:52.570> by

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
well I can solve that problem by

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.230 
well I can solve that problem by
applying<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.830> microfluidic<00:02:54.400> technology<00:02:54.610> to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
applying this microfluidic technology to

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.600 
applying this microfluidic technology to
to<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.900> issue<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.320> over<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.280> last<00:02:57.400> few

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
to to that issue and over the last few

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.040 
to to that issue and over the last few
years<00:02:57.700> attacked<00:02:58.180> us<00:02:58.330> what<00:02:58.480> we've<00:02:58.630> been

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
years attacked us what we've been

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.140 
years attacked us what we've been
working<00:02:59.380> on<00:02:59.530> both<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.310> IP<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.820> also<00:03:01.060> the

technology to enable that and that's

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.380 
technology to enable that and that's
what's<00:03:03.130> led<00:03:03.280> us<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.550> today<00:03:03.760> darvis<00:03:04.150> this
