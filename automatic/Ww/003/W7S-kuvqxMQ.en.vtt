00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello how about this time I'm going 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.150
 to be able to help in this song that is 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.880
 I give glory to a song performed by 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.040
 frames barrientos and in which we go 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.640
 to see four chords nothing more only 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.210
 there are four the chord of two the chord of 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.820
 Sun the lesser and two the same ones are used 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.710
 for the verse, the chorus and the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.200
 bridge is almost the same only that the 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.349
 position is different I mean that the 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.230
 first it is fa after the sun the smallest and 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.200
 do and in copper is two or the lowest and fa 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 well let's see this this little 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.670
 course with the guitar 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.500
 very well let's start with the song the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.990
 chord that I was telling you for the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.040
 stanza is 2 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.040
 after sun 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:01.120
 the least fan 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.120
 the choir is also the same 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.890
 the least 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.310
 for the bridge then as a crown 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:20.790
 of speed 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.790
 for the sun ego the minor and then 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.340
 okay 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:33.610
 then let's see the strumming heroes 3 2 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:39.490
 down 2 up one down and one up 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 that has to be repeated twice and another 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.610
 time 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:52.490
 the chord change through the lower 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.810
 again 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.810
 but I'm doing separated 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.380
 again but I'm not going to hit all and 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.380
 will have to leave like this 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.310
 what 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.450
 what I'm doing is 2 down points 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.319
 up 1 down and up is for you 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:33.459
 and for you 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:36.510
 back to Tati and down and when 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.510
 I say you are up 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.370
 and that's it 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:50.230
 with the same accord is down to 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.230
 up and down up 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:01.230
 and repeat twice for each run what 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.230
 I'm going to do if I'm going to do two rounds 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:16.520
 of quality of life of so so so and so 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.520
 so 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.120
 like a crown 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.319
 now 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.319
 Yes Yes 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.620
 and of course it's a little faster 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.810
 are going a little slow so that what 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.810
 can understand but it's really like 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.560
 from my 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.380
 Y 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.440
 32 below 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.890
 from there 2 up down and up 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.990
 then it would be all about the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.280
 song I give you glory I hope to have them 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.540
 helped 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.540
 and it will be until next time
