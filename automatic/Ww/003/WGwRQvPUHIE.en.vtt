bunch of new stuff in the game a lot of

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.990 
bunch of new stuff in the game a lot of
tricks<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.949> did<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.160> before<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.910> we

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
tricks that we did not before that we

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300 
tricks that we did not before that we
knew<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.240> wanted<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:19.220> there's<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.279> lot

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
knew we wanted to get to there's a lot

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.740 
knew we wanted to get to there's a lot
of<00:00:20.460> other<00:00:20.699> stuff<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.000> talk<00:00:21.210> about<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:21.570> right

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
of other stuff to talk about but right

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.230 
of other stuff to talk about but right
now<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:21.990> really<00:00:22.109> want<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.529> focus<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.210> how<00:00:24.210> we

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
now we really want to focus on how we

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.790 
now we really want to focus on how we
doubled<00:00:24.689> our<00:00:24.720> bag<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.960> tricks<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.439> let's<00:00:25.650> take

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
doubled our bag of tricks so let's take

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220 
doubled our bag of tricks so let's take
a<00:00:25.859> look<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.220> what<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.760> test<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.119> doing<00:00:27.420> big

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
a look at what the test is doing big

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.439 
a look at what the test is doing big
thing<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.740> wanted<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.550> allow<00:00:30.390> you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
thing that we wanted to do is allow you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.900 
thing that we wanted to do is allow you
when<00:00:30.750> by<00:00:31.109> pushing<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.250> stuff<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.700> if

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
when by pushing to do stuff like that if

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.630 
when by pushing to do stuff like that if
I'm<00:00:33.030> pushing<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> air<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.170> one-foot<00:00:34.710> if<00:00:35.460> i

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
I'm pushing the air I do a one-foot if i

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.930 
I'm pushing the air I do a one-foot if i
push<00:00:35.910> when<00:00:36.899> i'm<00:00:37.020> doing<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.410> invert<00:00:37.800> i'm<00:00:38.520> doing

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
push when i'm doing an invert i'm doing

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.150 
push when i'm doing an invert i'm doing
one<00:00:39.090> footed<00:00:39.360> invert<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.469> bonuses<00:00:41.040> by

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
one footed invert I can do bonuses by

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.779 
one footed invert I can do bonuses by
pushing<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> take<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> look<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.860> let's<00:00:44.579> see<00:00:44.700> what

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
pushing so take a look in let's see what

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.170 
pushing so take a look in let's see what
you<00:00:44.940> got<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.390> got<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> one-foot<00:00:47.149> got<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
you got here you got a one-foot got a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
you got here you got a one-foot got a
foot<00:00:48.480> plant<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.559> he<00:00:49.680> jumped<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.430> he's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
foot plant so he jumped off there he's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.069 
foot plant so he jumped off there he's
got<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> foot<00:00:51.149> plan<00:00:53.270> another<00:00:54.270> foot<00:00:54.629> plant<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
got a foot plan another foot plant to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
got a foot plan another foot plant to
bail<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.190> that's<00:00:56.370> really<00:00:56.579> what<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.879> wanted<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
bail so that's really what we wanted to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.549 
bail so that's really what we wanted to
do<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> make<00:00:57.539> sure<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.989> had<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> variety

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
do is make sure that you had a variety

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.470 
do is make sure that you had a variety
of<00:00:58.590> things<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> air<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.699> push<00:01:00.239> my

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of things if I'm in the air I push my

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.110 
of things if I'm in the air I push my
one<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.719> my<00:01:00.809> push<00:01:01.440> buttons<00:01:01.829> I'm<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> get

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
one of my push buttons I'm going to get

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.969 
one of my push buttons I'm going to get
a<00:01:03.149> new<00:01:03.300> trick<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:04.199> got<00:01:04.350> an<00:01:04.470> invert<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
a new trick we got an invert a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.740 
a new trick we got an invert a
one-footed<00:01:05.610> invert<00:01:07.460> yeah<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.299> once<00:01:09.510> you're<00:01:09.659> in

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
one-footed invert yeah so once you're in

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
one-footed invert yeah so once you're in
you're<00:01:09.930> embar<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> same<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.220> last<00:01:11.369> time

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you're embar it's the same as last time

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
you're embar it's the same as last time
with<00:01:11.820> skate<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:12.840> stick<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:13.439> board

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
with skate the right stick is your board

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.109 
with skate the right stick is your board
control<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.340> move<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> around<00:01:14.790> you'll

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
control so if you move it around you'll

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.969 
control so if you move it around you'll
be<00:01:15.270> able<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> tweak<00:01:15.780> tweak<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.560> invert

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
be able to tweak tweak your invert

be able to tweak tweak your invert
left-right<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> whole<00:01:18.509> bunch<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
left-right get a whole bunch of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
left-right get a whole bunch of
different<00:01:19.049> kinds<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.860> based

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
different kinds in but it's just based

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.880 
different kinds in but it's just based
on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.580> thing<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.420> skate<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.799> we

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
on the one thing in skate one because we

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.920 
on the one thing in skate one because we
got<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.159> amazing<00:01:23.340> physics<00:01:24.030> system<00:01:24.390> we

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
got this amazing physics system we

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
got this amazing physics system we
wanted<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> make<00:01:25.470> sure<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.490> use<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.939> we

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
have some good down hills but we said

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.950 
have some good down hills but we said
forget<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.030> want<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.299> make<00:01:30.420> bigger<00:01:30.720> down

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
forget it we want to make bigger down

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.069
