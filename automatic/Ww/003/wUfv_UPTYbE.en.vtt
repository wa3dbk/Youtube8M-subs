00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.800
 all right 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.000
 and this time I will show you the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.160
 four ways to capture the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.070
 screens in your hand let's see it 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.290
 technique number 1 is to maintain 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.079
 pressed at the same time the key 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.460
 capital letter command and the 3 with this 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.040
 key combination we will get 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.290
 automatically a seam of all 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.070
 our screen and the file will be created 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.070
 on the desk 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.440
 with this combination of keys 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.440
 capital letters + command and + 3 if in addition 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.909
 we have pressed the control key the photo 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.790
 instead of being saved on the desk 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.350
 will be saved to the clipboard so that 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.590
 we stick it where we want 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.659
 technique number 2 consisting of the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.869
 pushbutton at the same time the keys 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.729
 capital letters + command and + 4 is already 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.650
 another way the cursor changed a point 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.360
 of sight that we can drag to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 select by hand what part of the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.930
 screen we want to capture also it 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.810
 create a file on the desktop 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.810
 with this combination of uppercase keys 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.970
 command and 4 and also keep pressed 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.640
 the control key the photo instead of 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.550
 save on the desktop will be saved 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.479
 in the clipboard spokesman so that the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.479
 stick where we want 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.000
 with this combination of keys 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.340
 capital letters command and + 4 if after 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.890
 we press the spacebar the cursor 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.500
 will change to a camera of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.329
 so we can choose which window in 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.450
 concrete in concrete we want to capture 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.050
 the photo will not be captured in 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.050
 our desk 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.320
 finally we have the technique number 4 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.560
 which is through the instant program 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.500
 within our applications in the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.720
 utility folder we can find 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.180
 the instant program with the we can 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.880
 do the same thing that we have done with the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.980
 keyboard shortcut keys but at 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.530
 capture the image opens in a 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.260
 window and we can print it or save it 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.480
 where we want there is also a way 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.300
 additional that is to capture the screen 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.520
 with timer that is to say it works the same 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.830
 that the photo cameras there is an account 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.830
 back 1 second and take the photo 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.040
