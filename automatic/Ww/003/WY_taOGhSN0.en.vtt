00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.219 
so I'm gonna try to pour it all around
the<00:01:55.350> radiation<00:01:55.979> symbol<00:01:56.479> each<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> paddles

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the radiation symbol each of the paddles

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.649 
the radiation symbol each of the paddles
in<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.950> circle<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.700> type<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> thing<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
in the circle that type of thing and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.870 
in the circle that type of thing and
just<00:02:00.750> drip<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> down<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> face<00:02:01.799> maybe<00:02:02.670> I'll

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
just drip it down the face maybe I'll

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.450 
just drip it down the face maybe I'll
put<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.479> his<00:02:03.600> nostril<00:02:04.259> down<00:02:05.250> his

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
pumpkin and sort of see where maybe I

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.819 
pumpkin and sort of see where maybe I
could<00:02:21.480> add<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> little<00:02:21.840> more<00:02:22.110> goo<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.530> add<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
could add a little more goo to add the

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.650 
could add a little more goo to add the
most<00:02:23.040> realism<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:24.150> when<00:02:24.329> you're<00:02:24.450> done<00:02:24.600> I
