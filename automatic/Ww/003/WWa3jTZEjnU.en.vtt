problem<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.480> i<00:00:27.539> when<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.720> put<00:00:27.930> these

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
problem you have is i when you put these

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.120 
problem you have is i when you put these
onto<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:30.330> push<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.920> see

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
onto here and you push it in you see

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.470 
onto here and you push it in you see
it's<00:00:32.309> too<00:00:32.489> thick<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.420> fit<00:00:33.660> into<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.050> there

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
it's too thick to fit into that there

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.330 
it's too thick to fit into that there
and<00:00:36.480> I've<00:00:36.630> tried<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.050> metal<00:00:37.380> tool<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.100> tried

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and I've tried the metal tool I tried

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160 
and I've tried the metal tool I tried
the<00:00:38.489> plastic<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.030> tried<00:00:39.270> everything

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the plastic I tried everything

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.709 
the plastic I tried everything
none<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.010> them<00:00:41.160> will<00:00:42.120> fit<00:00:42.739> inside<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
none of them will fit inside to get that

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
none of them will fit inside to get that
out<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.710> doesn't<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.850> not

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
out of that it just doesn't it's not

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.069 
out of that it just doesn't it's not
thin<00:00:48.450> enough<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.989> fit<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
thin enough to fit in to the to the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.029 
thin enough to fit in to the to the
spots<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> remove<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:58.039> this

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
spots you have to remove it but this

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.369 
spots you have to remove it but this
tool<00:01:00.289> works<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.590> well<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.110> put<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
tool works really well you just put it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.789 
tool works really well you just put it
around<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> line<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:07.880> snap<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.799> and

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
around the line like this snap it on and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.080 
around the line like this snap it on and
as<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:12.020> it's<00:01:13.020> much<00:01:13.350> thinner<00:01:14.090> where

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
as you can see it's much thinner where

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.490 
as you can see it's much thinner where
it<00:01:15.210> goes<00:01:15.360> into<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.750> fitting<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.229> there

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it goes into that fitting right there

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
it goes into that fitting right there
it's<00:01:17.280> much<00:01:17.520> thinner<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.540> push

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it's much thinner so you can just push

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
it's much thinner so you can just push
it<00:01:19.369> into<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:22.670> I'm<00:01:23.670> gonna<00:01:23.820> put<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.090> down<00:01:24.270> for

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it into that I'm gonna put this down for

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:35.120 
it into that I'm gonna put this down for
one<00:01:24.630> second<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:27.229> need<00:01:28.229> two<00:01:28.439> hands<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.040> this

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.200 

basically<00:01:36.130> what<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.400> do<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.610> just<00:01:36.850> take<00:01:37.030> that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
basically what you do is just take that

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.100 
basically what you do is just take that
time<00:01:37.660> and<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.680> push<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:38.950> in<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.780> can<00:01:40.930> see

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
time and you push it in and you can see

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.450 
time and you push it in and you can see
a<00:01:41.140> snap<00:01:41.470> ring<00:01:41.910> pulls<00:01:42.910> out<00:01:43.890> hold<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.040> tool<00:01:45.220> in

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
a snap ring pulls out hold the tool in

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.500 
a snap ring pulls out hold the tool in
place<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:46.930> pulls<00:01:47.140> right<00:01:47.380> out<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:52.390> how

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
place and it pulls right out see how

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.290 
place and it pulls right out see how
that<00:01:52.690> fits<00:01:52.870> on<00:01:53.080> there<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.680> same

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
that fits on there it's the same

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.890 
that fits on there it's the same
diameter<00:01:58.300> as<00:01:59.130> that<00:02:00.130> collar<00:02:00.700> on<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.450> top<00:02:01.660> right

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
diameter as that collar on the top right

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.830 
diameter as that collar on the top right
there<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.380> get<00:02:03.100> this<00:02:03.280> tool<00:02:03.460> from<00:02:03.790> OTC<00:02:04.630> and
