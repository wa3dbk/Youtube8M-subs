00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.070
 with the launch of the pokémon games 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.830
 mega ruby ​​and alpha sapphire approaching 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.530
 rumors is what is missing on the internet 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.800
 but one of those who have been calling a lot 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.210
 attention in recent days the post of the m 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.570
 new game 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.839
 Good, I do not even need to ask, right? 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.649
 I need to yes, who found the post game? 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.640
 of very bad xy pokémon that raise the 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.540
 hand 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.469
 is the post game of pokémon xy left a lot 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.809
 to wish 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.940
 we have had few new Pokémon and yet 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.760
 we had few adventures 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.010
 after finishing the original story but 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.890
 meet in the game freak she does not 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.199
 disappoints in the shots and this is the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.469
 subject of today's video I'm going to quote 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.679
 here some rumors about the post game and 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.079
 I hope some actually happen and 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.969
 Do you think mega ruby pokémon ? 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.890
 Our daughter is going to have a good time. 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.250
 I got myself what you would like to do. 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.580
 after finishing the original story 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.520
 leave your comment down there good one 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.510
 of the rumors that most popcorn out there is the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.190
 possibility to visit a new region 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.870
 specifically singing since the story 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.720
 from corner to bad 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.140
 at exactly the same time because 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.230
 may not really happen since the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.370
 game freak worked to recreate bad and 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.200
 I do not sing 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.200
 although it sings a region that until 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.470
 small but I really find it difficult 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.290
 or something like that. 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.870
 we can see maybe it 's something like cev 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.860
 island that appeared in the remakes fire red 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:51.070
 herring without the home of several pokémons 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.150
 legendary montreux lúbia hol and up 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.160
 of oxime 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.900
 who knows, we can even see the 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.570
 Return safari zone 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.690
 do not be attached to this idea, I 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.080
 I find it very difficult for this to happen 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.420
 It's hard to dream, it's not one of the things. 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.340
 that I really believe we'll see 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.620
 in the new game is exactly what 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.890
 happened at the end of pokémon emeraude 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.470
 when we get a yen pokemon 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.660
 ciao joined and now who they know 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.970
 will not be accompanied by their 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.069
 respective negue stones 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.050
 I even made a video about this 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.569
 matter anyway, this is one of the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.630
 rumors and the possibilities that I 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.720
 I really believe it's going to happen in 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.520
 pokémon the mega rubi and alfas the daughter 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.170
 If you want to watch the video I 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.620
 I'm talking click the link in the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.260
 description of the video talking about videos that 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.230
 I already did but maybe I already changed the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.110
 My opinion on this is the island that 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.720
 found at the top of the bad map 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.090
 however after reading several comments 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.360
 I 'm convinced that it's not 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.570
 in fact an island but a black cloud 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.330
 it might perhaps be a kind of 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.000
 portal to the reverse world where we can 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.610
 to capture perhaps algae palc or even 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.700
 even spinning china or maybe she's 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.610
 covering an island is in total chaos 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.180
 maybe primeval king almost 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.180
 over there 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.150
 Well, who knows now, something that I 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.120
 I really enjoyed it on Black Night 2 was the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.820
 Pokémon World Championship where not only 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.280
 gathered all the leaders of gymnasium of 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.440
 all regions but also brought together 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.630
 all the champions 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.360
 particularly it would be awesome to battle 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.730
 with them again with the new graphics and 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.829
 It sure was one of the post- war missions. 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.320
 most fun in the game 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.060
 although black in Haiti has two 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.760
 thing to do and after the game that is 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.340
 hard to tell if the tournament actually 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.620
 world was the most fun 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.350
 finally one of the rumors that comes next 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.500
 been commented lately on some 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.140
 forums is about the rocket that 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.140
 meets at the space station in the city 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.140
 of grinding wheels turning a little in the past 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.120
 at the launch of sapphire ruby ​​pokémon 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.239
 many dreams have been destroyed because 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.760
 There was theory that when you interact 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.959
 with that rocket and take you is the 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.260
 space to capture and oxy irati 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.560
 But it never happened that generated 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.530
 revolt of many 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.930
 and now it has come back with everything and comes 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.480
 generating rumors that we can finally 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.610
 to venture a little bit in space 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.230
 even if it is to capture a pokémon 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.350
 that we already know 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.620
 So what do you think about it? 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.500
 in fact there are n possibilities for 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.690
 post game after three regions were 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.870
 released after im 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.880
 not to mention the two previous ones 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.970
 thing could happen that actually stays 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.400
 hard to imagine what the post game will be like 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.500
 But do not forget to leave us there. 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.990
 comments what you would like to see 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.810
 in the post game of pokémon the mega rubi and 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.870
 alpha sapphire and clear lilic 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.540
 because it helps me a lot 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.479
 Ok , it's only a few months before the release. 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.340
 of the Pokémon the Mega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.919
 until then you can check all the 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.620
 about the game here at 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.240
 channel chameleon an embrace chameleon friends 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.380
 A great week is going to stay here. 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.979
