no<00:02:00.329> no<00:02:00.390> no<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> can't<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.159> mean<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:03.600> are

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
no no no I can't and I mean these are

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.380 
no no no I can't and I mean these are
some<00:02:04.280> examples<00:02:05.280> sometimes<00:02:05.549> perhaps<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.210> take

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
some examples sometimes perhaps I take

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.270 
some examples sometimes perhaps I take
another<00:02:06.630> tent<00:02:06.990> when<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.320> go<00:02:07.469> out<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> don't

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
another tent when I go out so I don't

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.619 
another tent when I go out so I don't
have<00:02:08.520> any<00:02:09.440> any<00:02:10.440> special<00:02:10.890> tie<00:02:11.129> ok<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.150> don't

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
have any any special tie ok with I don't

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.550 
have any any special tie ok with I don't
tell<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
tell that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.280 
tell that
so<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.709> really<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:15.000> three<00:02:15.870> or<00:02:16.020> four

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
so you really have to have three or four

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.920 
so you really have to have three or four
yeah<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.770> think<00:02:17.069> minimum<00:02:17.970> minimum<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.660> four

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
yeah I think minimum minimum is four

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
yeah I think minimum minimum is four
five<00:02:19.230> times<00:02:19.500> something<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.459> perfect

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
five times something like that perfect

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.809 
five times something like that perfect
is<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> sensitive<00:02:22.860> backpacker<00:02:23.490> that

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
is that for a sensitive backpacker that

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.569 
is that for a sensitive backpacker that
would<00:02:24.060> be<00:02:24.209> demeaning
