the biggest stumbling blocks the gospel

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.660 
the biggest stumbling blocks the gospel
for<00:03:02.720> them<00:03:02.870> is<00:03:03.020> that<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:03.680> Jesus<00:03:04.130> died<00:03:04.340> upon<00:03:04.370> a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
cross and he died as a blasphemer and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.440 
cross and he died as a blasphemer and
Allah<00:03:07.040> would<00:03:07.280> never<00:03:07.519> allow<00:03:07.910> one<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.300> his

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
Allah would never allow one of his

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.210 
Allah would never allow one of his
beloved<00:03:08.810> prophets<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.470> die<00:03:09.620> in<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:09.950> fashion

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
beloved prophets to die in that fashion

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.100 
beloved prophets to die in that fashion
because<00:03:10.850> they<00:03:11.060> don't<00:03:11.239> see<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.690> Jesus<00:03:11.959> is

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
because they don't see that Jesus is

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.780 
because they don't see that Jesus is
doing<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:12.470> voluntarily<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:13.250> he's<00:03:13.489> doing

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
doing this voluntarily that he's doing

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.289 
doing this voluntarily that he's doing
this<00:03:13.910> as<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.150> sacrifice<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.380> so<00:03:15.800> Sura<00:03:16.070> 4:157

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
this as a sacrifice and so Sura 4:157

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.229 
this as a sacrifice and so Sura 4:157
in<00:03:17.500> essence<00:03:18.500> says<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.430> was<00:03:19.580> made<00:03:19.970> to

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
in essence says that it was made to

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.590 
in essence says that it was made to
appear<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:21.410> Jesus<00:03:21.860> died<00:03:22.130> upon<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.760> cross<00:03:23.030> but

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
appear that Jesus died upon a cross but

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.080 
appear that Jesus died upon a cross but
instead<00:03:23.900> God<00:03:24.140> raised<00:03:24.709> him<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:24.920> himself<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.489> so

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
instead God raised him to himself and so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.570 
instead God raised him to himself and so
the<00:03:26.180> Muslim<00:03:26.540> doesn't<00:03:26.750> understand<00:03:27.410> why<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:28.549> are

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
the Muslim doesn't understand why we are

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.600 
the Muslim doesn't understand why we are
so<00:03:28.700> focused<00:03:28.880> upon<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.750> cross<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:31.100> Muslim<00:03:31.489> is

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
so focused upon the cross the Muslim is

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.570 
so focused upon the cross the Muslim is
very<00:03:31.880> much<00:03:32.060> like<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.750> Jew<00:03:32.989> of<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:34.310> day<00:03:34.430> of

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
very much like the Jew of the day of

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.759 
very much like the Jew of the day of
Paul<00:03:34.840> because<00:03:35.840> remember<00:03:36.200> Paul<00:03:36.500> when<00:03:36.739> he

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
Paul because remember Paul when he

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.130 
Paul because remember Paul when he
describes<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.370> cross<00:03:37.640> what<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.930> is<00:03:38.989> a

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
describes the cross what is it it is a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.009 
describes the cross what is it it is a
scandal<00:03:39.739> on<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.610> stumbling<00:03:41.450> block<00:03:41.480> to

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
scandal on it is a stumbling block to
