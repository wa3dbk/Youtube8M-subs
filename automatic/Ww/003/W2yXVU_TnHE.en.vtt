00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
charge controller and from the charge

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.190 
charge controller and from the charge
controller<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.729> have<00:02:03.850> plus<00:02:04.180> one<00:02:04.420> doing<00:02:05.050> it

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
controller you have plus one doing it

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.450 
controller you have plus one doing it
Plus<00:02:05.470> why<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.740> goes<00:02:05.920> around<00:02:06.190> 14<00:02:07.180> for<00:02:07.390> them<00:02:08.850> here

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
Plus why it goes around 14 for them here

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.540 
Plus why it goes around 14 for them here
