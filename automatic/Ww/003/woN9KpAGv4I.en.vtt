have<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.849> ever<00:00:09.030> wondered<00:00:09.510> what<00:00:09.929> color<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.650> a

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
have you ever wondered what color is a

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.610 
have you ever wondered what color is a
mirror<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:12.269> at<00:00:12.389> first<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.929> might<00:00:13.049> say<00:00:13.259> silver

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
mirror now at first you might say silver

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.260 
mirror now at first you might say silver
but<00:00:14.309> what<00:00:14.670> about<00:00:14.880> now<00:00:15.360> or<00:00:15.870> now<00:00:17.150> objects<00:00:18.150> are

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
but what about now or now objects are

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.210 
but what about now or now objects are
whatever<00:00:18.630> color<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.289> light<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:19.830> don't

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
whatever color of light they don't

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.400 
whatever color of light they don't
absorb<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.300> example<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.810> piece<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.170> green

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
absorb for example this piece of green

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.470 
absorb for example this piece of green
paper<00:00:22.710> appears<00:00:23.550> green<00:00:23.910> because<00:00:24.359> it's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
paper appears green because it's

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.269 
paper appears green because it's
absorbing<00:00:25.109> every<00:00:25.590> single<00:00:25.920> color<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
absorbing every single color of the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.720 
absorbing every single color of the
rainbow

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
rainbow

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.120 
rainbow
except<00:00:27.570> green<00:00:27.990> which<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> then<00:00:28.800> reflected

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
except green which is then reflected

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.690 
except green which is then reflected
back<00:00:29.789> into<00:00:30.150> your<00:00:30.630> eyes<00:00:30.810> if<00:00:31.199> an<00:00:31.710> object<00:00:31.830> absorbs

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
back into your eyes if an object absorbs

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.490 
back into your eyes if an object absorbs
every<00:00:33.059> single<00:00:33.360> color<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.719> light<00:00:33.930> than<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
every single color of light than it

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.860 
every single color of light than it
appears<00:00:34.829> black<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> reflects<00:00:36.480> every

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
appears black and if it reflects every

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
appears black and if it reflects every
color<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.260> rainbow<00:00:37.380> then<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.520> appears

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
color of the rainbow then it appears

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569 
color of the rainbow then it appears
white<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:40.050> mirrors<00:00:40.469> are<00:00:40.680> whatever<00:00:41.280> color

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
white but mirrors are whatever color

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
white but mirrors are whatever color
they<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.030> exposed<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:43.710> that's<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
they are exposed to but if that's the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.610 
they are exposed to but if that's the
case<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.910> why<00:00:45.210> aren't<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.840> mirrors<00:00:46.230> white

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
case then why aren't all mirrors white

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.250 
case then why aren't all mirrors white
this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:48.000> white<00:00:48.300> objects<00:00:48.840> reflect

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this is because white objects reflect

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.069 
this is because white objects reflect
the<00:00:49.440> colors<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> light<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.670> directions

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
the colors of light in all directions

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
the colors of light in all directions
whereas<00:00:52.079> mirrors<00:00:52.440> reflect<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.039> uniformly

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
whereas mirrors reflect it uniformly

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.240 
whereas mirrors reflect it uniformly
with<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> angle<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.750> incidence<00:00:55.260> being<00:00:55.800> equal

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
with the angle of incidence being equal

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760 
with the angle of incidence being equal
to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.579> angle<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> reflection<00:00:57.770> communicating

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to the angle of reflection communicating

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.189 
to the angle of reflection communicating
with<00:00:58.920> light<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.449> extremely<00:01:00.449> efficient<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
with light is extremely efficient and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.349 
with light is extremely efficient and
nothing<00:01:01.859> else<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> universe<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.120> travel

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
nothing else now a universe can travel

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.140 
nothing else now a universe can travel
faster<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.680> why<00:01:04.860> fiber<00:01:05.280> optic<00:01:05.729> cables

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
faster this is why fiber optic cables

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.990 
faster this is why fiber optic cables
have<00:01:06.420> become<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.140> widespread<00:01:07.640> but<00:01:08.640> how<00:01:08.850> does

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
have become so widespread but how does

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.630 
have become so widespread but how does
an<00:01:09.090> optic<00:01:09.450> fiber<00:01:09.780> work<00:01:10.229> how<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> possible

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
an optic fiber work how is it possible

an optic fiber work how is it possible
to<00:01:11.909> bend<00:01:12.479> light<00:01:12.750> around<00:01:13.080> corners<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.770> even<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to bend light around corners or even to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.789 
to bend light around corners or even to
tie<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.090> knots<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.900> show<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> how<00:01:16.350> here's

tie it in knots to show you how here's
an<00:01:16.950> experiment<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.640> try<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.030> home

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
an experiment that you can try at home

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
an experiment that you can try at home
all<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.810> need<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> bottle<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.470> water<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
all you need is a bottle of water with a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.830 
all you need is a bottle of water with a
hole<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> side<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.150> laser<00:01:21.360> pointer

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
hole in the side and the laser pointer

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
hole in the side and the laser pointer
so<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.650> line<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.220> laser<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.850> our<00:01:24.119> hole

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
so if we line up the laser with our hole

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179 
so if we line up the laser with our hole
and<00:01:24.630> remove<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> tape<00:01:25.530> holding<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.009> water

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and remove the tape holding in the water

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.609 
and remove the tape holding in the water
we<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> light<00:01:28.080> from<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.409> laser

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
we can see that the light from the laser

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.580 
we can see that the light from the laser
follows<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.549> path<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> water<00:01:30.390> down<00:01:30.659> by

follows the path of the water down by
looking<00:01:31.950> closely<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.820> may<00:01:33.060> even<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.420> the
