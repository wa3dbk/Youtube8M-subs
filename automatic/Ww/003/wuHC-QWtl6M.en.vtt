00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.970 
salt so we're just going to get that in
there<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.410> time<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.710> basically

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
there and now it's time to basically

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.710 
there and now it's time to basically
just<00:02:35.250> get<00:02:35.430> down<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.640> business<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:36.630> have

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
just get down to business and we have

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.980 
just get down to business and we have
this<00:02:36.840> big<00:02:37.050> pile<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.650> by<00:02:38.130> time<00:02:38.370> I'm<00:02:38.520> done

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
this big pile and by time I'm done

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.780 
this big pile and by time I'm done
massaging<00:02:39.990> this<00:02:40.170> will<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:40.980> almost<00:02:41.280> half<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
massaging this will have almost half the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.910 
massaging this will have almost half the
size<00:02:41.970> less<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.720> there<00:02:43.260> should<00:02:43.470> be<00:02:43.560> juice

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
size less and there should be juice

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.470 
size less and there should be juice
coming<00:02:44.430> out<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.610> there<00:02:44.790> every<00:02:45.150> time<00:02:45.300> we

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
coming out of there every time we

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.080 
coming out of there every time we
squeeze<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.040> going<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.250> just

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
squeeze so I'm just going to just

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.700 
squeeze so I'm just going to just
basically<00:02:48.240> start<00:02:48.660> working<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.080> cabbage<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
basically start working the cabbage and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
get enough salt to kind of help break

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.230 
get enough salt to kind of help break
down<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.980> cell<00:02:53.220> walls<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> cabbage<00:02:54.210> and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
down the cell walls of the cabbage and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.000 
down the cell walls of the cabbage and
to<00:02:54.420> help<00:02:54.600> release<00:02:54.900> its<00:02:55.140> juices<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.830> that's

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
to help release its juices and that's

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.280 
to help release its juices and that's
what<00:02:56.400> we're<00:02:56.550> looking<00:02:56.820> for<00:02:56.850> before<00:02:57.660> we<00:02:57.900> go<00:02:58.020> into

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.820 
just kind of flatten that out and just
continue<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.520> do<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:34.910> until<00:04:35.229> all<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.440> cabbage

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
continue to do so until all the cabbage

00:04:36.830 --> 00:05:02.230 
continue to do so until all the cabbage
is<00:04:37.820> in<00:04:38.390> your<00:04:38.570> crack<00:05:01.060> pushing<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.180> down

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
is in your crack pushing this down

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.029 
is in your crack pushing this down
you're<00:05:03.229> going<00:05:03.350> to<00:05:03.410> draw<00:05:03.650> out<00:05:03.680> some<00:05:03.890> more

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
you're going to draw out some more

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.700 
you're going to draw out some more
liquid<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:05.169> we're<00:05:06.169> going<00:05:06.260> to<00:05:06.350> take<00:05:06.500> this

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
liquid so we're going to take this

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.080 
liquid so we're going to take this
liquid<00:05:07.130> pour<00:05:07.910> it<00:05:08.000> over<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.180> top<00:05:08.770> get<00:05:09.770> all<00:05:09.919> the

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
liquid pour it over the top get all the

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:17.320 
liquid pour it over the top get all the
stragglers<00:05:11.090> back<00:05:11.600> in<00:05:11.780> there<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:16.150> this<00:05:17.150> is

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
stragglers back in there and this is

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.840 
stragglers back in there and this is
where<00:05:17.479> we<00:05:17.600> take<00:05:17.840> our<00:05:18.140> cabbage<00:05:18.890> leaves<00:05:19.479> and<00:05:20.680> we

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
where we take our cabbage leaves and we

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:34.930 
where we take our cabbage leaves and we
going<00:05:22.850> to<00:05:22.910> create<00:05:23.240> kind<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:23.990> base

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.230 

and<00:05:35.940> now<00:05:36.210> because<00:05:36.600> I<00:05:36.690> don't<00:05:36.960> have<00:05:37.730> the<00:05:38.730> exact

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
and now because I don't have the exact

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.240 
and now because I don't have the exact
equipment<00:05:39.840> like<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.260> ceramic<00:05:40.770> pots<00:05:41.010> that's

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
equipment like the ceramic pots that's

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.410 
equipment like the ceramic pots that's
where<00:05:41.370> we<00:05:41.460> have<00:05:41.550> to<00:05:41.580> get<00:05:41.730> a<00:05:41.790> little<00:05:41.940> thrifty

where we have to get a little thrifty
and<00:05:42.630> we<00:05:43.320> need<00:05:43.440> some<00:05:43.620> type<00:05:43.800> of<00:05:43.830> weight<00:05:44.190> because

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
and we need some type of weight because

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.980 
and we need some type of weight because
we<00:05:44.760> want<00:05:44.910> to<00:05:44.940> make<00:05:45.060> sure<00:05:45.090> this<00:05:45.330> cabbage<00:05:45.750> stays

put a cover over it cheesecloth would

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.610 
put a cover over it cheesecloth would
work<00:06:14.130> fine<00:06:14.430> just<00:06:14.820> something<00:06:15.090> that<00:06:15.620> doesn't

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
work fine just something that doesn't

degrees Fahrenheit a kitchen cabinet
would<00:06:27.300> work<00:06:27.510> great<00:06:27.840> just<00:06:28.140> somewhere<00:06:28.380> where

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
would work great just somewhere where

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.350 
would work great just somewhere where
it's<00:06:28.650> kind<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:28.890> dark<00:06:29.130> and<00:06:29.400> we're<00:06:30.030> going<00:06:30.150> to<00:06:30.180> let

your intention on the card and just let

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.710 
your intention on the card and just let
just<00:06:38.310> so<00:06:38.400> you<00:06:38.460> know<00:06:38.640> exactly<00:06:38.910> when<00:06:39.330> you<00:06:39.450> start

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
just so you know exactly when you start

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.100 
just so you know exactly when you start
it<00:06:40.310> let<00:06:41.310> it<00:06:41.400> go<00:06:41.550> about<00:06:41.880> 10<00:06:42.180> days<00:06:42.360> then<00:06:43.020> you

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
it let it go about 10 days then you

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.560 
it let it go about 10 days then you
could<00:06:43.230> taste<00:06:43.500> it<00:06:43.740> see<00:06:44.310> the<00:06:44.820> flavor<00:06:45.120> if<00:06:45.419> it's

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
could taste it see the flavor if it's

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.890 
could taste it see the flavor if it's
where<00:06:45.780> your<00:06:45.930> if<00:06:46.230> you<00:06:46.440> like<00:06:46.830> it<00:06:47.070> I<00:06:47.790> notice<00:06:48.600> over

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
where your if you like it I notice over

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.140 
where your if you like it I notice over
the<00:06:49.140> longer<00:06:49.530> it<00:06:49.650> goes<00:06:49.860> the<00:06:49.919> softer<00:06:50.700> gift<00:06:50.970> and

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
the longer it goes the softer gift and

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.930 
the longer it goes the softer gift and
the<00:06:51.210> more<00:06:51.360> fermented<00:06:51.930> flavor<00:06:52.290> it<00:06:52.620> has<00:06:52.940> that

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
the more fermented flavor it has that

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.520 
the more fermented flavor it has that
means<00:06:54.150> the<00:06:54.270> more<00:06:54.390> bacteria<00:06:55.140> that's<00:06:55.260> in<00:06:56.090> there

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
means the more bacteria that's in there

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.050 
means the more bacteria that's in there
so<00:06:58.530> really<00:06:58.710> it's<00:06:58.919> up<00:06:59.040> to<00:06:59.190> you<00:06:59.370> your<00:06:59.610> taste<00:06:59.880> and

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
so really it's up to you your taste and

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.220 
so really it's up to you your taste and
your<00:07:00.150> preference<00:07:00.660> and<00:07:01.560> that's<00:07:02.190> it<00:07:02.430> once<00:07:02.790> you

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.230 
your preference and that's it once you
