00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello everyone, Anton and today I 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.349
 show you how to make a portal to hell or 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.570
 what's called passenger road so 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.480
 pankov generator so for us 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.210
 you will need four gold blocks and and 15 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.730
 plain cobblestones well or 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.890
 which can be crafted workbenches from whether 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.810
 what else will you need three 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.390
 diamond and 6 iron bars 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.240
 since tax fly is the basis of this 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.120
 portal so in the center we put in the 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.930
 actor and in the corners above the golden hands 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.010
 we put the cobblestone now over the reactor 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.910
 set were also so after that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:54.390
 we put a plus sign on a cobblestone in a row and 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.000
 all here and so will be the portal portal to hell 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.630
 in order to capture you can simply 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.720
 cool 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.350
 all over the reactor 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.910
 asset was written karpenko times such 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.510
 approach is not worth it and should soon 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.860
 manifest things different things and behind them and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.860
 backs will spoil moisture 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.540
 he stopped 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:01.759
 stay only from you and if u would 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.759
 stupidly inside will be the reactor itself 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:25.260
 meeting in the usual graphite icons ok 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.580
 that 's what I have collected 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.870
 trash clutch frame is understandable so it falls out 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.420
