million<00:00:38.039> dollar<00:00:38.430> project<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:46.320> terms<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.650> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
million dollar project in terms of the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.740 
million dollar project in terms of the
visuals<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.340> they're<00:00:47.579> applying<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.360> scream

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.910 
visuals that they're applying to scream
what<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.350> about<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.650> combination

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
what do you think about the combination

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
what do you think about the combination
does<00:00:50.310> it<00:00:50.400> work<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.610> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
does it work for you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
does it work for you
yeah<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> combination<00:00:52.470> is<00:00:52.560> really

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
yeah I think the combination is really

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.819 
yeah I think the combination is really
cool<00:00:53.040> because<00:00:53.220> it<00:00:53.430> kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.970> taking<00:00:54.180> place

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
cool because it kind of is taking place

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.770 
cool because it kind of is taking place
in<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.980> spaceship<00:00:56.460> or<00:00:56.730> kind<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.060> in<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> vacuum<00:00:57.480> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
in a spaceship or kind of in a vacuum I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.910 
in a spaceship or kind of in a vacuum I
think<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.110> spaceship<00:00:58.470> is<00:00:58.620> kind<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
think the spaceship is kind of a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.130 
think the spaceship is kind of a
metaphor<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> vacuum<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.210> their<00:01:00.870> lives

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
metaphor of the vacuum that their lives

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:10.270 
metaphor of the vacuum that their lives
sort<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.649> are

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.830 

sometimes<00:01:11.280> they're<00:01:11.490> looked<00:01:11.670> upon<00:01:11.969> as<00:01:12.240> not

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
sometimes they're looked upon as not

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.899 
sometimes they're looked upon as not
human<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.350> course<00:01:13.530> they<00:01:13.649> are<00:01:13.799> human<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.340> but

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
human of course they are human but but

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
human of course they are human but but
maybe<00:01:15.090> that's<00:01:15.359> kind<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.719> a<00:01:15.810> surrealistic<00:01:16.170> way

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
maybe that's kind of a surrealistic way

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380 
maybe that's kind of a surrealistic way
to<00:01:16.799> say<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.399> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.609> here<00:01:17.819> we<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.270> in
