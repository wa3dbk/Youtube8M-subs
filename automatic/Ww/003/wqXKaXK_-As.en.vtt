00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
why I like anime because they think it's

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.930 
why I like anime because they think it's
just<00:00:15.900> cartoons<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.859> kids<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.340> today<00:00:17.460> I've

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
just cartoons for kids and today I've

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.300 
just cartoons for kids and today I've
got<00:00:18.000> six<00:00:18.750> titles<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.320> I've<00:00:19.529> separated<00:00:19.800> at

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
got six titles here I've separated at

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.429 
got six titles here I've separated at
three<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.789> Mom<00:00:20.939> three<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.810> dad<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.260> pretty

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
three for Mom three for dad it's pretty

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.050 
three for Mom three for dad it's pretty
much<00:00:22.619> interchangeable<00:00:22.980> depending<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:23.939> their

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
much interchangeable depending on their

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060 
much interchangeable depending on their
taste<00:00:24.300> but<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.539> think<00:00:25.170> I've<00:00:25.350> separated<00:00:25.980> it

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
taste but I think I've separated it

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.769 
taste but I think I've separated it
properly<00:00:26.400> depending<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> typical<00:00:27.570> mom

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
properly depending on the typical mom

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.900

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
think of a Disney movie because there

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
really see much of the differences

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.090 
really see much of the differences
because<00:01:07.170> they<00:01:07.320> don't<00:01:07.530> really<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.860> anything

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
because they don't really know anything

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340 
because they don't really know anything
about<00:01:08.280> anime<00:01:08.820> now<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.570> these<00:01:09.750> six<00:01:10.020> movies

like<00:01:17.880> drama<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.140> romance<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.799> than<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.130> men

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
like drama and romance more than the men

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
like drama and romance more than the men
would<00:01:20.580> than<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> average<00:01:21.360> stereotypical<00:01:22.290> guy

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
would than the average stereotypical guy

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.890 
would than the average stereotypical guy
and<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.159> average<00:01:23.700> guy<00:01:23.939> would<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.360> action

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and the average guy would like action

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.570 
and the average guy would like action
and<00:01:25.080> science<00:01:25.439> fiction<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.040> than<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> woman

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
and science fiction more than the woman

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
and science fiction more than the woman
would<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.689> isn't<00:01:28.049> always<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> case

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
would and this isn't always the case

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.350 
would and this isn't always the case
obviously<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.909> drama<00:01:30.180> and
