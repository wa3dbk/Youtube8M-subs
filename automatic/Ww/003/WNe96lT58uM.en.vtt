00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
are struggling a little bit with that

you<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.090> need<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.870> careful<00:01:03.899> where

you do need to really be careful where
you<00:01:04.739> wildcraft<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.519> because<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:07.320> be

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you wildcraft it because it can be

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.609 
you wildcraft it because it can be
sprayed<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.479> normally<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.409> use

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
sprayed a lot so normally what they use

sprayed a lot so normally what they use
as<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> Klamath<00:01:11.310> Beetle<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.330> eat<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.950> plant<00:01:13.950> but

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
as a Klamath Beetle to eat the plant but

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.539 
as a Klamath Beetle to eat the plant but
they<00:01:15.000> also<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.450> spray<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.590> watch<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.340> for

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

botanical<00:01:56.610> name<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.909> perfer<00:01:57.270> adam<00:01:57.719> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
botanical name and perfer adam is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.840 
botanical name and perfer adam is
because<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.009> leaves<00:01:59.189> look<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.670> they've

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
because the leaves look like they've

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.510 
because the leaves look like they've
been<00:01:59.930> perforated<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
been perforated like that so that's a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700 
been perforated like that so that's a
good<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.790> tell<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> one<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
good way to tell it one of the one of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.319 
good way to tell it one of the one of
the<00:02:04.829> other<00:02:05.009> distinct<00:02:05.490> things<00:02:05.729> about<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the other distinct things about it it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.719 
the other distinct things about it it
has<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> component<00:02:07.290> called<00:02:07.619> hypericin<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
has a component called hypericin and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.960 
has a component called hypericin and
hypericin<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> color<00:02:10.910> it's<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.260> plant

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
hypericin is a color it's a in the plant

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.240 
hypericin is a color it's a in the plant
and<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.270> creates<00:02:14.690> this<00:02:15.050> kind<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.470> purple<00:02:15.950> color

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
and it creates this kind of purple color

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.770 
and it creates this kind of purple color
which<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.670> interesting<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.300> even<00:02:17.570> though<00:02:17.660> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
which is interesting so even though the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.380 
which is interesting so even though the
flower<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.530> yellow<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:22.430> hypericin<00:02:23.090> in

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
flower is yellow the the hypericin in

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.390 
flower is yellow the the hypericin in
the<00:02:23.480> plant<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.050> deep<00:02:24.380> rich<00:02:24.680> purple<00:02:25.160> color

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
the plant is this deep rich purple color

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.130 
the plant is this deep rich purple color
so<00:02:25.670> if<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.790> make<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.090> tincture<00:02:26.510> out<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
so if you make a tincture out of the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.650 
so if you make a tincture out of the
plant<00:02:27.380> or<00:02:27.740> an<00:02:28.190> oil<00:02:28.550> you'll<00:02:29.270> get<00:02:29.450> this

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
plant or an oil you'll get this

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.270 
plant or an oil you'll get this
beautiful<00:02:30.230> rich<00:02:30.410> color<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.860> almost<00:02:31.070> looks

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
internally the plant is an Irving which

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.990 
internally the plant is an Irving which
means<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:15.650> works<00:03:15.920> on<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.250> nervous<00:03:16.490> system

most famous for is its antidepressant

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.790 
most famous for is its antidepressant
properties<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.900> there's<00:03:27.140> been<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.350> lot<00:03:27.739> of

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
properties so there's been a lot of

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.340 
properties so there's been a lot of
studies<00:03:28.580> using<00:03:28.940> Saint<00:03:29.360> John's<00:03:29.600> wort<00:03:29.780> both<00:03:30.140> as

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
studies using Saint John's wort both as

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.100 
studies using Saint John's wort both as
a<00:03:30.380> mild<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> moderate<00:03:31.790> or<00:03:32.239> even<00:03:32.840> sometimes

a mild to a moderate or even sometimes

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.640 
a mild to a moderate or even sometimes
for<00:03:33.560> severe<00:03:33.980> depression<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:35.140> we've<00:03:36.140> seen

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
for severe depression and we've seen

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.550 
for severe depression and we've seen
great<00:03:37.040> great<00:03:37.370> results<00:03:37.910> with<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.870> that's

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
great great results with that so that's

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.610 
great great results with that so that's
kind<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:40.040> how<00:03:40.940> it's<00:03:41.150> how<00:03:41.570> it's<00:03:41.750> mostly<00:03:42.380> known

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
kind of how it's how it's mostly known

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.160 
kind of how it's how it's mostly known
and<00:03:42.950> talked<00:03:43.220> about<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:44.030> one<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.959> things

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
and talked about and one of the things

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.020 
and talked about and one of the things
that<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:45.350> really<00:03:45.830> like<00:03:45.980> about<00:03:46.010> using<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:46.850> for

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
that I really like about using it for

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.420 
that I really like about using it for
depression<00:03:47.600> is<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.620> also<00:03:48.860> strengthens

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
depression is that it also strengthens

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.030 
depression is that it also strengthens
and<00:03:49.880> tones<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.480> nervous<00:03:50.810> system<00:03:51.200> so<00:03:51.920> it

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
and tones the nervous system so it

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.120 
and tones the nervous system so it
doesn't<00:03:52.370> just<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:54.080> know<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.950> they're<00:03:55.100> not

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
doesn't just you know and they're not
