00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello to all guys if not just the trans 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.940
 90 and here I am guys today with this 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.790
 new video 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.019
 I am here today to bring you a comment 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.280
 that I hadn't been carrying for a long time 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.030
 because it was the last period I had 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.529
 brought videos as listening as 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 also brought to the series where I spoke to you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.060
 of pro players and competitive news 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.560
 and other videos 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.070
 and today I'm here to bring you like the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.769
 teacher or a rather personal video 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.320
 where I explain to you he spoke of a new one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.180
 that is the road I am taking, that is 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 game bottles but before starting the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.430
 real commentaries and I wanted to do 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.960
 a small premise is that at least on 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.820
 colored ghost then the last call of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.559
 duty 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 I find it 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.870
 go well I also think of many of you very much 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.149
 boring now I'll explain why 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.750
 because there are now goals 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.550
 really very very few and for example 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.989
 send one that is no longer interesting 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.840
 to the most beautiful to see 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.370
 I for example as you know is alone but 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.250
 at least a month and a half that I don't bring you 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 a hacker because at least in my opinion but 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.850
 I think you are also a little tired of 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:16.110
 see 25 in a row fairies with different weapons 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.530
 or in different ways but in the end the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.450
 broth is always the same is another thing 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.939
 very important is that for example there 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.470
 league there are no more sincere there is not 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.659
 plus the positioning so it's gone 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.600
 a ranking and this is the eye a 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.759
 quite negative factor because it binds 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.540
 has become a public and where 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.750
 people play yes to win but not 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.340
 how maybe it happened on black ops 2 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.170
 so i 'm doing i'm playing in 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 the latter period indeed from one 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.020
 week I'm playing game battle skate 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 battle scose is a portal where you can 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.930
 play to the finished one but to many 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.810
 other games on all consoles 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.850
 you can play 15 call of duty 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.720
 I repeat on all colored in many 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.640
 modality 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.840
 and therefore an important thing for example 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.330
 which makes him replay the game I love 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.100
 very much like you know black ops 2 where 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.310
 you can play one on one two 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.170
 against two up to 8 against 8 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.550
 it is so present that I personally 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.800
 when playing in battle, I play for 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.570
 just to win the commitment a lot e 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.980
 so who puts a lot of pressure 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:36.490
 play the games and I think that indeed 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.650
 play these games that bring you to 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.250
 mestre 80 tension then that help 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.070
 when you have to go to lan because in lan 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.510
 as you all know it is the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.910
 connection factor what matters 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.560
 more because the house is collected 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.170
 but he goes to the LAN and did nothing more 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.540
 but in my opinion this is not the case 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:02.110
 person plays well in lan only if he has a 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.209
 character that resists the most 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.100
 tension because if a guy enough 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.600
 let's say fragile that you don't give up 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.130
 tension that in lan and much I assure you 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.260
 that doesn't play well at all 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.620
 so I think that playing that battle if 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.820
 you have a very good workout anyway 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.040
 guys talking a moment about the gameplay 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.970
 that we have put in the background is one 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.040
 against one 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.880
 the game battle game player a 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.519
 boy who had missed him very well 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.380
 hunted is going to positioned very well 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:37.239
 on beer among the top 5,500 in the world e 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.910
 it is not easy to the various three rivers 5,000 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:44.650
 because we say that every time you win 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.070
 against against a person who gives gods 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.130
 points 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.140
 these points that are given based on 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.840
 against what you played then if you play 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.930
 against one that was also for example between 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.070
 the first thousand chi from 40 points while if 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.780
 games with one that just started 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.799
 play there for five for example 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.860
 and then obviously these points vary 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:09.930
 Also based on what went on gb 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.360
 so there are several factors giotto e 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.720
 now i'm still winning 4 to 0 but 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.730
 I do not tell you the ending 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.090
 for a really beautiful game it is 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.739
 that makes me learn so many things 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.290
 one thing involves for example in the one 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.570
 against one and always change tactics and 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.460
 because obviously he when he sees that 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.370
 go to that side once 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.080
 the second time he looks at us better from 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.300
 that part 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.110
 so davis open the handle well the 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.740
 map is something that makes me very happy 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.030
 when the game what button you give 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.360
 tactics of the mythical tactics 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.120
 best friends then do them in practice 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.770
 my mick tactics and then the 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.430
 better then use them in games 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.160
 successive 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.710
 then on six defenses on six defenses 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.660
 precisely I used different tactics and a lot 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.180
 very effective and therefore it is one thing 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.710
 quite positive so better 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.440
 more and more to play one on one but 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.370
 you can do this even with a 4 against 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.110
 4 against the cones your team precisely 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.430
 however guys he defined I hope 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.669
 you enjoyed it 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.860
 tell me in the comments guys if you want 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:23.650
 streaming done on second child 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.390
 I'm really very very very beautiful 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:32.060
 fun to see and where you'll see 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.979
 surely knows how to play more games 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.510
 better because the streaming he had 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.330
 brought up to the true certain player is 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:42.890
 however tie where good or bad does not 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:46.070
 I played right up to my top we say 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.060
 so then guys you define yourself if you video 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.010
 you liked it left as i like 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.419
 if you want pass by game bottles there is 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.370
 also my profile in description 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.630
 left in me I like it and we get caught at
