the<00:00:27.210> review<00:00:27.480> by<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.869> over<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> stats<00:00:28.680> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the review by going over the stats of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.970 
the review by going over the stats of
this<00:00:29.340> machine<00:00:29.849> gun<00:00:30.090> rate<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.869> fire<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.260> lower

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
this machine gun rate of fire is lower

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.850 
this machine gun rate of fire is lower
among<00:00:32.669> machine<00:00:33.149> guns<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.440> rate<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.770> fire

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
among machine guns and this rate of fire

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.799 
among machine guns and this rate of fire
is<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.370> lowest<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.030> again<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
is not the lowest but again is on the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020 
is not the lowest but again is on the
lower<00:00:37.050> end<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.890> compensate<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.579> impact

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
lower end to compensate for this impact

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.500 
lower end to compensate for this impact
is<00:00:39.210> very<00:00:39.660> very<00:00:39.960> high<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.860> compare<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:42.000> Thunder

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
is very very high to compare the Thunder

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.569 
is very very high to compare the Thunder
load<00:00:42.660> actually<00:00:43.050> has<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> exact<00:00:43.829> same<00:00:43.860> damage

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
load actually has the exact same damage

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
load actually has the exact same damage
profile<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.510> gun<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.079> rate<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> fire<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
profile as this gun so rate of fire and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.010 
profile as this gun so rate of fire and
impact<00:00:46.890> are<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> same<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.420> thunderlord

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
impact are the same as the thunderlord

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.260 
impact are the same as the thunderlord
which<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> an<00:00:49.590> excellent<00:00:50.039> excellent<00:00:50.820> gun

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
which is an excellent excellent gun

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.860 
which is an excellent excellent gun
range<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.500> pretty<00:00:53.280> decent<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> machine<00:00:54.539> gun

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
range is pretty decent for a machine gun

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.569 
range is pretty decent for a machine gun
but<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.309> stability

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
but it's really all about the stability

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
but it's really all about the stability
I'm<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.270> gonna<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.570> over<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.199> different

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
I'm really gonna go over the different

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.439 
I'm really gonna go over the different
perks<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.980> affect<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> stability<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
perks that affect the stability in the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
perks that affect the stability in the
perk<00:01:00.780> section<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.680> stability<00:01:02.309> starting

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
perk section but stability starting

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.270 
perk section but stability starting
stability<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.300> gun<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.660> very<00:01:04.280> very

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
stability with this gun is very very

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.969 
stability with this gun is very very
high<00:01:05.610> reload<00:01:06.479> definitely<00:01:06.900> isn't<00:01:07.260> great<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
high reload definitely isn't great but a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.310 
high reload definitely isn't great but a
magazine<00:01:08.400> size<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.970> 46<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:10.140> obviously

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
magazine size of 46 now obviously

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
magazine size of 46 now obviously
machine<00:01:10.830> guns<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.220> come<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.549> much<00:01:12.030> higher

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
machine guns can come with much higher

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.340 
machine guns can come with much higher
than<00:01:12.510> 46<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.740> 46<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.400> pretty<00:01:14.729> good<00:01:15.000> especially

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
than 46 but 46 is pretty good especially

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
than 46 but 46 is pretty good especially
for<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.439> higher<00:01:17.009> impact<00:01:17.700> machine<00:01:18.150> guns<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
for these higher impact machine guns a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.210 
for these higher impact machine guns a
lot<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> higher<00:01:19.350> impact<00:01:19.560> machine<00:01:20.040> guns

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
lot of the higher impact machine guns

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.880 
lot of the higher impact machine guns
only<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.670> around<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.240> 30<00:01:21.930> round<00:01:22.170> magazine

only have around a 30 round magazine
these<00:01:23.070> days<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.610> 46<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.390> very<00:01:24.990> very<00:01:25.770> powerful

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430

now let's move on to the perks of this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.170 
now let's move on to the perks of this
gun<00:01:29.930> now<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> ballistics<00:01:31.650> affect<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.579> quite

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
gun now the ballistics affect it quite

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.719 
gun now the ballistics affect it quite
differently<00:01:33.479> you'll<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.470> press<00:01:34.729> CQB

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
differently you'll see if I press CQB

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.850 
differently you'll see if I press CQB
ballistics<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.689> starting<00:01:37.200> stability<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
ballistics the starting stability is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.149 
ballistics the starting stability is
almost<00:01:38.390> completely<00:01:39.390> maxed<00:01:40.079> out<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
almost completely maxed out that is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460 
almost completely maxed out that is
insane<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:41.909> means<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:42.930> CQB

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
insane and that means if you get CQB

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
insane and that means if you get CQB
ballistics<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:45.060> need<00:01:45.240> any

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
ballistics you really don't need any

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
ballistics you really don't need any
other<00:01:45.899> perks<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.439> increase<00:01:46.860> stability<00:01:47.070> it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
other perks to increase stability it

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.120 
other perks to increase stability it
really<00:01:47.970> frees<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.720> your<00:01:49.320> options<00:01:49.890> when<00:01:50.100> it

stability<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.619> already<00:01:56.250> covered<00:01:56.729> because

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
stability is already covered because

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.670 
stability is already covered because
it's<00:01:57.299> starting<00:01:57.540> stability<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.380> good

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it's starting stability is so good

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
it's starting stability is so good
however<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.390> run<00:02:00.540> something<00:02:00.869> like

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
however I do like to run something like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.560 
however I do like to run something like
field<00:02:01.530> choke<00:02:01.829> or<00:02:02.040> linear<00:02:02.700> compensator<00:02:03.090> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
field choke or linear compensator it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.560 
field choke or linear compensator it
does<00:02:03.719> lower<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:05.070> starting<00:02:05.490> stability<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.540> I

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
does lower this starting stability but I

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.979 
does lower this starting stability but I
do<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:07.129> injection<00:02:08.129> mold<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.270> increase

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
do have injection mold here to increase

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.009 
do have injection mold here to increase
it<00:02:10.140> back<00:02:10.319> up<00:02:10.560> at<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> expense<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.430> some<00:02:12.090> rain

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
it back up at the expense to some rain

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.350 
it back up at the expense to some rain
now<00:02:13.530> moving<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:14.010> counterbalance<00:02:14.849> does<00:02:15.120> help

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
now moving on counterbalance does help

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.150 
now moving on counterbalance does help
again<00:02:15.750> with<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.019> recoil<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.650> that's<00:02:16.860> really

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
again with the recoil and that's really

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.680 
again with the recoil and that's really
gonna<00:02:17.280> reduce<00:02:17.700> some<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.090> horizontal

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
gonna reduce some of the horizontal

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.199 
gonna reduce some of the horizontal
recoil<00:02:18.840> especially<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.910> Grenadier<00:02:20.910> there's

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
recoil especially and Grenadier there's

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.030 
recoil especially and Grenadier there's
certainly<00:02:21.450> better<00:02:21.690> perks<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:22.319> getting<00:02:22.709> kills

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
certainly better perks but getting kills

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.410 
certainly better perks but getting kills
this<00:02:23.190> weapon<00:02:23.519> increase<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:23.970> cooldown<00:02:24.269> of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
this weapon increase the cooldown of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.930 
this weapon increase the cooldown of
your<00:02:24.599> grenade<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.709> pretty<00:02:26.129> useful<00:02:26.370> now

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
your grenade that is pretty useful now

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.880 
your grenade that is pretty useful now
this<00:02:27.180> gun<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.510> reforged<00:02:27.959> also<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.650> get<00:02:28.800> it

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
this gun is reforged also you can get it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.800 
this gun is reforged also you can get it
with<00:02:29.040> whatever<00:02:29.310> perks<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.150> feel<00:02:30.540> are

with whatever perks you feel are

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.559 
with whatever perks you feel are
superior<00:02:31.799> but<00:02:32.220> again<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.790> best<00:02:33.209> thing<00:02:33.540> about

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
superior but again the best thing about

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.380 
superior but again the best thing about
this<00:02:33.930> gun<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.709> again<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.910> basically

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
this gun is that again you can basically

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.289 
this gun is that again you can basically
completely<00:02:37.260> max<00:02:37.799> out<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.790> stat<00:02:39.090> of

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
completely max out this the stat of

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:39.979 
completely max out this the stat of
stability

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
stability

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.619

just<00:02:40.500> from<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.980> ballistics<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.090> insane

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
just from the ballistics that is insane

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.990 
just from the ballistics that is insane
even<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.080> worst<00:02:43.440> ballistic<00:02:44.099> field<00:02:44.370> choke<00:02:44.580> has

even the worst ballistic field choke has

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.440 
even the worst ballistic field choke has
a<00:02:45.269> very<00:02:45.750> good<00:02:46.170> starting<00:02:46.650> stability<00:02:47.269> now<00:02:48.269> how

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
a very good starting stability now how

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.830 
a very good starting stability now how
does<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.780> BTR<00:02:49.230> D<00:02:49.440> perform<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.510> PvP

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
does the BTR D perform in PvP

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.130 
does the BTR D perform in PvP
now<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.590> weapon<00:02:52.950> does<00:02:53.390> 64<00:02:54.390> damage<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.110> a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
now this weapon does 64 damage for a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.339 
now this weapon does 64 damage for a
headshot<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.090> 51<00:02:57.090> damage<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> body<00:02:58.079> shot

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
headshot and 51 damage for a body shot

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.710 
headshot and 51 damage for a body shot
so<00:02:58.769> it's<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.010> consistent<00:02:59.370> 4<00:03:00.000> shot<00:03:00.269> kill<00:03:00.299> no

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
so it's a consistent 4 shot kill no

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.780 
so it's a consistent 4 shot kill no

the thing about that though is when you

the thing about that though is when you
pick<00:03:20.400> up<00:03:20.459> ammunition<00:03:21.329> like<00:03:21.900> heavy<00:03:22.170> ammunition
