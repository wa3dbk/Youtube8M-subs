00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.910 

this<00:00:06.419> is<00:00:06.660> about<00:00:06.899> 10<00:00:07.229> seconds<00:00:07.680> worth<00:00:07.889> of

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
this is about 10 seconds worth of

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.490 
this is about 10 seconds worth of
animation<00:00:08.879> it<00:00:09.719> would<00:00:09.900> take<00:00:10.049> a<00:00:10.080> couple<00:00:10.200> of

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
animation it would take a couple of

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.570 
animation it would take a couple of
hours<00:00:10.680> to<00:00:11.039> do<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.730> old<00:00:11.940> way<00:00:13.100> but<00:00:14.100> now<00:00:14.340> that

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
hours to do in the old way but now that

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.390 
hours to do in the old way but now that
our<00:00:14.730> tunics<00:00:15.359> has<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.689> new<00:00:16.080> device<00:00:16.439> called

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
our tunics has a new device called

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.599 
our tunics has a new device called
tweening<00:00:18.050> it<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.920> done<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.519> a<00:00:20.699> few<00:00:20.730> minutes

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
tweening it can be done in a few minutes

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.480 
tweening it can be done in a few minutes
now<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.669> will<00:00:23.939> move<00:00:24.089> the<00:00:24.689> ghost<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:26.369> an

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
now we will move the ghost to an

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.479 
now we will move the ghost to an
exposition<00:00:27.140> and<00:00:28.849> save<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.089> page<00:00:34.430> now<00:00:35.430> we

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
exposition and save that page now we

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.950 
exposition and save that page now we
will<00:00:35.790> start<00:00:36.060> off<00:00:36.239> fairs<00:00:36.540> turn<00:00:38.450> as<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.720> move

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
will start off fairs turn as you move

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
will start off fairs turn as you move
the<00:00:40.110> cursor<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.890> corner<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the cursor to the corner of the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.100 
the cursor to the corner of the
selection<00:00:42.770> it<00:00:43.770> turns<00:00:44.070> into<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.880> curved<00:00:45.660> arrow

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
selection it turns into a curved arrow

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.050 
selection it turns into a curved arrow
this<00:00:46.890> enables<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:47.490> to<00:00:47.520> rotate<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:49.170> object

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
this enables you to rotate the object

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.690 
this enables you to rotate the object
the<00:00:51.060> turning<00:00:51.540> revolves<00:00:52.020> around<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:53.160> circle

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
the turning revolves around the circle

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.810 
the turning revolves around the circle
with<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.470> crosshairs<00:00:56.000> we<00:00:57.000> say<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.450> frame

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
with the crosshairs we say that frame

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.850 
with the crosshairs we say that frame
now<00:00:59.820> we<00:00:59.880> will<00:01:00.330> go<00:01:00.780> back<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> editor<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
now we will go back to the editor and

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:13.200 
now we will go back to the editor and
move<00:01:02.100> him<00:01:02.220> again<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:06.799> will<00:01:07.799> save<00:01:08.009> that<00:01:08.040> frame

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.810 

I<00:01:13.240> came<00:01:14.110> back<00:01:14.260> to<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.500> editor<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.130> given<00:01:15.730> to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
I came back to the editor and given to

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.990 
I came back to the editor and given to
the<00:01:15.850> turn<00:01:17.160> save<00:01:18.160> that<00:01:18.400> frame<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.950> may<00:01:21.160> seem<00:01:21.940> a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
the turn save that frame this may seem a

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.310 
the turn save that frame this may seem a
bit<00:01:22.150> tedious<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:24.040> in<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.820> old<00:01:24.970> way<00:01:25.300> we<00:01:26.050> save

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
bit tedious but in the old way we save

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.260 
bit tedious but in the old way we save
every<00:01:26.560> frame<00:01:27.010> you<00:01:27.310> moved<00:01:27.550> in<00:01:27.729> ever<00:01:28.060> so

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
every frame you moved in ever so

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.770 
every frame you moved in ever so
slightly<00:01:29.370> but<00:01:30.370> this<00:01:30.610> way<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.360> computers

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
slightly but this way the computers

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.620 
slightly but this way the computers
gonna<00:01:31.960> fill<00:01:32.290> in<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:33.400> movements<00:01:33.850> for<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:36.630> turn

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
gonna fill in the movements for you turn

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:47.490 
gonna fill in the movements for you turn
them<00:01:37.750> again

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.740 

you

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.300 

the<00:01:54.750> whole<00:01:54.960> movement<00:01:55.909> consists<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.060> 88<00:01:57.659> frames

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
the whole movement consists of 88 frames

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.219 
the whole movement consists of 88 frames
but<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.460> actually<00:01:59.640> only<00:02:00.120> made<00:02:01.040> 14<00:02:02.040> frames<00:02:03.229> so

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
but we actually only made 14 frames so

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.530 
but we actually only made 14 frames so
you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.800> was<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> time-saving<00:02:05.820> function

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
you can see was a time-saving function

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.960 
you can see was a time-saving function
this<00:02:06.750> is
