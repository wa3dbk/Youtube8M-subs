maybe<00:02:59.830> Seth<00:03:00.130> Rollins<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.640> thought<00:03:00.820> he<00:03:00.970> could<00:03:01.120> be

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
maybe Seth Rollins I thought he could be

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.860 
maybe Seth Rollins I thought he could be
on<00:03:01.330> there<00:03:01.480> too

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870

however they threw in the the curveball

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.090 
however they threw in the the curveball
the<00:03:04.600> third<00:03:04.870> party<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.410> Stone<00:03:05.650> Cold<00:03:05.680> Steve
