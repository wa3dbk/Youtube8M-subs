00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
reviewing it this morning I was thinking

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.300 
reviewing it this morning I was thinking
about<00:00:21.109> okay<00:00:21.500> there<00:00:21.679> are<00:00:21.740> two<00:00:21.830> ways<00:00:22.010> of

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
about okay there are two ways of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.450 
about okay there are two ways of
reviewing<00:00:22.759> this<00:00:22.939> one<00:00:23.269> is<00:00:24.009> only<00:00:25.009> technically

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
reviewing this one is only technically

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.480 
reviewing this one is only technically
what<00:00:26.330> moves<00:00:26.599> were<00:00:27.470> good<00:00:27.740> what<00:00:28.009> moves<00:00:28.250> were

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
what moves were good what moves were

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.090 
what moves were good what moves were
wrong<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:29.000> why<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.480> another<00:00:30.320> way<00:00:31.310> is<00:00:31.669> to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
wrong and why and another way is to

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.860 
wrong and why and another way is to
remember<00:00:34.100> how<00:00:34.250> I<00:00:34.280> was<00:00:34.670> thinking<00:00:35.360> during<00:00:35.570> the

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
remember how I was thinking during the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.979 
remember how I was thinking during the
game<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.860> examine<00:00:37.039> my<00:00:37.579> own<00:00:37.989> thought

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
game so to examine my own thought

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.459 
game so to examine my own thought
process<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:39.969> what<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.000> mistakes<00:00:41.750> were<00:00:42.020> in

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
process and what the mistakes were in

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.459 
process and what the mistakes were in
that<00:00:42.620> process<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:44.300> remember<00:00:44.719> that<00:00:44.870> here

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
that process and I remember that here

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.350 
that process and I remember that here
when<00:00:45.980> my<00:00:46.129> opponent<00:00:46.520> played<00:00:46.730> here<00:00:46.910> with<00:00:47.090> White

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
when my opponent played here with White

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.090 
when my opponent played here with White
Queen<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.809> a4<00:00:48.170> that<00:00:48.800> was<00:00:48.949> his<00:00:49.070> move<00:00:49.309> I<00:00:51.100> realized

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
Queen to a4 that was his move I realized

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.770 
Queen to a4 that was his move I realized
in<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:52.910> first<00:00:53.180> place<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:53.449> he<00:00:53.660> was

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
in the first place that he was

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.150 
in the first place that he was
threatening<00:00:54.199> to<00:00:54.559> have<00:00:54.620> seven<00:00:54.949> Czech

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
threatening to have seven Czech

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.009 
threatening to have seven Czech
attacking<00:00:55.969> my<00:00:56.120> king<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.570> my<00:00:56.660> pawn<00:00:57.620> on<00:00:57.800> e6<00:00:57.949> and

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
attacking my king and my pawn on e6 and

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.420 
attacking my king and my pawn on e6 and
I<00:01:00.160> started<00:01:01.160> looking<00:01:01.460> for<00:01:01.489> possible<00:01:02.329> defenses

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
I started looking for possible defenses

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.550 
I started looking for possible defenses
my<00:01:04.430> next<00:01:04.730> step<00:01:04.940> was<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.150> think<00:01:05.480> can<00:01:05.840> I<00:01:05.960> cover

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
my next step was to think can I cover

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.310 
my next step was to think can I cover
this<00:01:06.860> f7<00:01:07.610> square<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.270> prevent<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:08.960> check

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
this f7 square to prevent this check

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.200 
this f7 square to prevent this check
well<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.009> only<00:01:10.159> way<00:01:10.490> would<00:01:10.729> be<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:10.939> play

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
well the only way would be to play

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.840 
well the only way would be to play
Knight<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:11.900> d8<00:01:12.409> but<00:01:12.890> in<00:01:13.009> that<00:01:13.159> case<00:01:13.750> f8<00:01:14.750> is

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
Knight to d8 but in that case f8 is

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.940 
Knight to d8 but in that case f8 is
undefended<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.210> Queen<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.570> f8<00:01:17.930> check<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.530> then

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
undefended so Queen to f8 check and then

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.990 
undefended so Queen to f8 check and then
Quint<00:01:19.280> xe7

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
Quint xe7

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.429 
Quint xe7
so<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:21.350> doesn't<00:01:21.590> work<00:01:22.720> also<00:01:23.720> rook<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:24.079> FA

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
so that doesn't work also rook to FA

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.440 
so that doesn't work also rook to FA
doesn't<00:01:24.799> work<00:01:24.950> forth<00:01:25.369> because<00:01:25.549> wind<00:01:26.270> takes

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
doesn't work forth because wind takes

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.200 
doesn't work forth because wind takes
effect<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:26.930> there<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.259> no<00:01:27.439> way<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.979> defend<00:01:28.939> the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
effect so there is no way to defend the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.630 
effect so there is no way to defend the
f7<00:01:29.479> square<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.619> means<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.280> will<00:01:31.340> have

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
f7 square so that means that I will have

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.539 
f7 square so that means that I will have
to<00:01:31.670> allow<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:32.329> check<00:01:32.659> on<00:01:32.780> f7<00:01:33.079> on<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.399> other

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
to allow this check on f7 on the other

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.429 
to allow this check on f7 on the other
hand<00:01:34.790> how<00:01:35.329> dangerous<00:01:35.899> is<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.820> he<00:01:37.820> will<00:01:38.380> gain<00:01:39.380> a

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
hand how dangerous is it he will gain a

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.450 
hand how dangerous is it he will gain a
boom<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:40.070> only<00:01:40.399> six<00:01:40.790> of<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.299> check

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
boom on only six of this check

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.030 
boom on only six of this check
another<00:01:43.180> possibility<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.050> do<00:01:44.710> would<00:01:44.860> be<00:01:45.010> to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
another possibility to do would be to

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.790 
another possibility to do would be to
good<00:01:45.970> be<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.450> move<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.380> night<00:01:47.560> at<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
good be to to move the the night at the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.250 
good be to to move the the night at the
King<00:01:47.920> away<00:01:48.190> right<00:01:48.760> now<00:01:48.790> hoping<00:01:49.480> to<00:01:49.540> h8

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
King away right now hoping to h8

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.940 
King away right now hoping to h8
immediately<00:01:51.130> for<00:01:51.640> example<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.950> third

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
immediately for example and a third

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.230 
immediately for example and a third
option<00:01:57.930> where<00:01:58.930> another<00:01:59.200> option<00:01:59.590> is<00:02:00.030> simply<00:02:01.030> to

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
option where another option is simply to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.110 
option where another option is simply to
allow<00:02:01.420> win<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.530> f7<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.160> see<00:02:03.400> how<00:02:03.550> dangerous<00:02:03.940> it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
allow win to f7 and see how dangerous it

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.840 
allow win to f7 and see how dangerous it
is<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.500> started<00:02:05.980> thinking<00:02:06.130> what<00:02:06.400> if<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.610> take

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
is so I started thinking what if I take

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.320 
is so I started thinking what if I take
simp<00:02:07.090> UMD<00:02:07.420> for<00:02:07.690> win<00:02:08.050> takes<00:02:08.260> before<00:02:09.330> because

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
simp UMD for win takes before because

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.040 
simp UMD for win takes before because
after<00:02:10.660> Queen<00:02:10.930> to<00:02:11.530> f7<00:02:11.830> check<00:02:12.160> King<00:02:12.370> h8<00:02:12.810> then<00:02:13.810> his

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
after Queen to f7 check King h8 then his

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.770 
after Queen to f7 check King h8 then his
knight<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.680> h4<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.310> hanging<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:16.450> means<00:02:16.660> that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
knight on h4 is hanging that means that

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.690 
knight on h4 is hanging that means that
he<00:02:16.900> cannot<00:02:17.410> take<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.310> e6<00:02:18.730> at<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.090> moment<00:02:20.700> well

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
he cannot take on e6 at the moment well

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.860 
he cannot take on e6 at the moment well
I<00:02:21.730> did<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.860> took<00:02:24.550> some<00:02:24.700> time<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.300> make

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
I did I took some time to to make

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.490 
I did I took some time to to make
calculations<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.740> are<00:02:27.250> needed<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:29.350> make

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
calculations that are needed to to make

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.160 
calculations that are needed to to make
this<00:02:29.620> decision<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.460> decided<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.600> twin<00:02:31.990> to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
this decision and I decided that twin to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.170 
this decision and I decided that twin to
d4<00:02:32.650> was<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.950> safe<00:02:33.250> move<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:34.810> play

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
d4 was a safe move to play

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.730 
d4 was a safe move to play
he<00:02:37.180> played<00:02:37.450> Queen<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.820> f7<00:02:39.820> check<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.470> again<00:02:41.470> I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
he played Queen to f7 check and again I

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.150 
he played Queen to f7 check and again I
thought<00:02:42.100> for<00:02:42.520> some<00:02:43.030> time<00:02:43.330> about<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:44.320> there

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
thought for some time about if there

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.580 
thought for some time about if there
would<00:02:45.280> be<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.460> difference<00:02:45.880> between<00:02:45.940> King<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.020> h7

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
would be a difference between King to h7

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.310 
would be a difference between King to h7
0.088<00:02:50.790> calculating<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.720> two<00:02:52.930> moves<00:02:53.140> I

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
0.088 calculating this two moves I

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.430 
0.088 calculating this two moves I
didn't<00:02:54.209> find<00:02:55.209> anything<00:02:55.540> special<00:02:55.750> but<00:02:56.140> in

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
didn't find anything special but in

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.820 
didn't find anything special but in
general<00:02:57.430> terms<00:02:58.270> I<00:02:58.600> thought<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.680> would<00:02:59.800> be

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
general terms I thought that it would be

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.070 
general terms I thought that it would be
better<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.190> have<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.340> King<00:03:00.550> on<00:03:00.700> h8<00:03:01.090> cousin<00:03:01.630> 87

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
better to have the King on h8 cousin 87

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.130 
better to have the King on h8 cousin 87
it's<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.830> an<00:03:03.220> open<00:03:03.520> diagonal<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.989> light

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
it's in an open diagonal of the light

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.990 
it's in an open diagonal of the light
square<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:06.480> decided<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.570> break<00:03:07.780> into<00:03:07.989> h8

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
square so I decided to break into h8

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.220 
square so I decided to break into h8
nothing<00:03:10.000> wrong<00:03:10.150> with<00:03:10.330> this<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:12.660> now<00:03:13.660> my

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
nothing wrong with this and now my

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.449 
nothing wrong with this and now my
opponent<00:03:15.120> saved<00:03:16.120> his<00:03:16.480> knight<00:03:17.190> by<00:03:18.190> playing

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
opponent saved his knight by playing

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.990 
opponent saved his knight by playing
Knight<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.030> f3<00:03:19.470> attacking<00:03:20.470> my<00:03:20.560> queen<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.010> this

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
Knight to f3 attacking my queen and this

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.240 
Knight to f3 attacking my queen and this
is<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.209> moment<00:03:22.470> when<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:26.040> didn't<00:03:27.040> think

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
is the moment when I didn't think

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.750 
is the moment when I didn't think
correctly<00:03:28.290> my<00:03:29.290> thought<00:03:29.530> process<00:03:29.890> was<00:03:30.070> okay

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
correctly my thought process was okay

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.850 
correctly my thought process was okay
now<00:03:30.970> he's<00:03:31.150> attacking<00:03:31.300> my<00:03:31.630> queen<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:32.680> means

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
now he's attacking my queen that means

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.670 
now he's attacking my queen that means
that<00:03:33.070> in<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.430> Knights<00:03:33.700> now<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.180> not<00:03:34.680> hanging

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
that in this Knights now is not hanging

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.570 
that in this Knights now is not hanging
in<00:03:35.800> longer<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:37.440> means<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:39.100> threat

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
in longer and that means that the threat

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.140 
in longer and that means that the threat
Queen<00:03:39.880> takes<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.360> six<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:41.230> now<00:03:41.769> real<00:03:42.150> he

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
Queen takes in six is now real he

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.020 
Queen takes in six is now real he
threatens<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.810> take<00:03:44.019> my<00:03:44.290> pawn<00:03:44.530> on<00:03:44.620> e6

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.070 

and<00:03:47.500> that's<00:03:48.500> why<00:03:48.770> I<00:03:49.810> started<00:03:50.810> looking<00:03:51.050> for

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
and that's why I started looking for

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.040 
and that's why I started looking for
ways<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.380> defend<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.190> pawn<00:03:52.400> mystics<00:03:52.900> with<00:03:53.900> my

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
ways to defend this pawn mystics with my

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.000 
ways to defend this pawn mystics with my
queen<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.530> there<00:03:54.680> is<00:03:54.770> only<00:03:54.890> one<00:03:55.010> Queen<00:03:55.430> 24<00:03:57.010> now

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
queen and there is only one Queen 24 now

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.260 
queen and there is only one Queen 24 now
because<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.490> this<00:03:59.120> idea<00:03:59.390> I<00:04:00.100> didn't<00:04:01.100> think<00:04:01.270> any

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
because of this idea I didn't think any

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.880 
because of this idea I didn't think any
longer<00:04:02.660> about<00:04:03.620> other<00:04:03.980> threads<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:06.620> was

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
longer about other threads and that was

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.690 
longer about other threads and that was
effect

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
effect

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.340 
effect
my<00:04:08.690> mistake<00:04:09.110> at<00:04:09.290> this<00:04:09.440> moment<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:10.540> played<00:04:11.540> quite

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
my mistake at this moment I played quite

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.949 
my mistake at this moment I played quite
fast<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:14.150> move<00:04:15.489> went<00:04:16.489> 34<00:04:17.060> without<00:04:17.480> thinking

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
fast the move went 34 without thinking

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.170 
fast the move went 34 without thinking
longer<00:04:18.290> and<00:04:18.579> in<00:04:19.579> one<00:04:20.419> way<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.380> can<00:04:22.250> explain<00:04:22.910> this

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
longer and in one way I can explain this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.040 
longer and in one way I can explain this
because<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.980> few<00:04:25.760> moves<00:04:26.000> before<00:04:26.210> I<00:04:26.510> have<00:04:26.780> I

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
because the few moves before I have I

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.690 
because the few moves before I have I
had<00:04:27.350> done<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:27.860> many<00:04:28.300> calculation<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.750> I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
had done so many calculation that I

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.140 
had done so many calculation that I
probably<00:04:31.700> I<00:04:32.410> wanted<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.730> do<00:04:34.730> play<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:34.970> bit

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
probably I wanted to do play a bit

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.600 
probably I wanted to do play a bit
faster<00:04:35.540> now<00:04:35.660> on<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.260> other<00:04:36.350> hand<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.890> looks<00:04:37.160> so

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
faster now on the other hand it looks so

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.100 
faster now on the other hand it looks so
logical<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:40.060> thoughts<00:04:41.060> he<00:04:41.510> said<00:04:41.720> I<00:04:41.810> did<00:04:41.960> my

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
logical the thoughts he said I did my

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.380 
logical the thoughts he said I did my
queen<00:04:42.590> he's<00:04:42.890> attacking<00:04:43.190> my<00:04:43.400> pawn<00:04:43.610> on<00:04:43.729> e6<00:04:43.880> why

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
queen he's attacking my pawn on e6 why

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.409 
queen he's attacking my pawn on e6 why
they<00:04:44.780> use<00:04:44.990> both<00:04:45.229> pieces<00:04:45.470> now<00:04:45.800> driven<00:04:46.100> to<00:04:46.580> save

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
they use both pieces now driven to save

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.440 
they use both pieces now driven to save
the<00:04:47.540> Queen<00:04:47.720> in<00:04:47.870> different<00:04:48.110> e6<00:04:49.090> what<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.120> didn't

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
the Queen in different e6 what I didn't

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.620 
the Queen in different e6 what I didn't
the<00:04:51.440> question<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:51.979> didn't<00:04:52.250> ask<00:04:52.430> is<00:04:52.850> what

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
the question that I didn't ask is what

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.960 
the question that I didn't ask is what
will<00:04:53.780> happen<00:04:54.080> happen<00:04:54.710> after<00:04:55.010> that<00:04:55.040> and<00:04:56.350> that's

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
will happen happen after that and that's

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.360 
will happen happen after that and that's
the<00:04:58.970> main<00:04:59.500> mistake<00:05:00.500> in<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.830> way<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.160> I<00:05:01.190> was

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
the main mistake in the way that I was

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.610 
the main mistake in the way that I was
thinking<00:05:02.890> when<00:05:03.890> we<00:05:04.100> make<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.580> move<00:05:05.470> like<00:05:06.470> with

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
thinking when we make a move like with

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.330 
thinking when we make a move like with
the<00:05:06.740> g4<00:05:07.130> here<00:05:07.340> before<00:05:07.820> make<00:05:08.090> that<00:05:08.270> move<00:05:08.510> I

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
the g4 here before make that move I

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.680 
the g4 here before make that move I
should<00:05:10.340> have<00:05:10.490> asked<00:05:10.789> myself<00:05:10.910> okay<00:05:11.450> what

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
should have asked myself okay what

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.110 
should have asked myself okay what
happens<00:05:11.960> next

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
happens next

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.390 
happens next
then<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.390> would<00:05:14.990> probably<00:05:17.590> have<00:05:18.590> seen<00:05:18.830> the

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
then I would probably have seen the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.850 
then I would probably have seen the
threat<00:05:19.669> which<00:05:20.510> affects<00:05:20.840> his<00:05:20.990> x-wing<00:05:21.470> piece

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
threat which affects his x-wing piece

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.029 
threat which affects his x-wing piece
and<00:05:22.270> when<00:05:23.270> he<00:05:23.360> played<00:05:23.600> this<00:05:23.840> Bishop<00:05:24.650> takes<00:05:24.830> c6

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
and when he played this Bishop takes c6

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.390 
and when he played this Bishop takes c6
I<00:05:25.580> realized<00:05:26.330> my<00:05:26.570> god<00:05:26.810> I'm<00:05:27.050> losing<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.860> piece<00:05:28.070> now

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
I realized my god I'm losing a piece now

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.570 
I realized my god I'm losing a piece now
this<00:05:28.729> is<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:29.330> big<00:05:29.900> mistake<00:05:30.020> because<00:05:30.580> after

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
this is a big mistake because after

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.290 
this is a big mistake because after
Knight<00:05:31.820> takes<00:05:31.850> c6<00:05:32.300> Queen<00:05:33.080> takes<00:05:33.289> b7<00:05:33.830> follows

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
Knight takes c6 Queen takes b7 follows

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
Knight takes c6 Queen takes b7 follows
attacking<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.390> rook<00:05:35.570> and<00:05:35.720> attack<00:05:35.960> my<00:05:36.140> knight

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
attacking the rook and attack my knight

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.560 
attacking the rook and attack my knight
on<00:05:36.470> c6

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
on c6

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.310 
on c6
if<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:40.340> had<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.520> ask<00:05:41.700> myself<00:05:42.090> what<00:05:42.780> will<00:05:42.960> happen

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
if I had to ask myself what will happen

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.380 
if I had to ask myself what will happen
after<00:05:43.560> 24<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:45.320> I<00:05:46.320> would<00:05:46.560> have<00:05:46.680> seen<00:05:46.890> this

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
after 24 and I would have seen this

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.330 
after 24 and I would have seen this
Bishop<00:05:48.390> takes<00:05:48.600> c6<00:05:48.780> idea<00:05:49.440> then<00:05:50.040> a<00:05:50.360> new<00:05:52.310> line<00:05:53.310> of

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
Bishop takes c6 idea then a new line of

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.060 
Bishop takes c6 idea then a new line of
thoughts<00:05:53.880> would<00:05:54.480> have<00:05:54.630> developed<00:05:55.070> probably

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
thoughts would have developed probably

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.510 
thoughts would have developed probably
thinking<00:05:56.610> about<00:05:56.910> how<00:05:57.480> to<00:05:57.540> defend<00:05:57.960> c6<00:05:58.740> or<00:05:58.950> b7

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
thinking about how to defend c6 or b7

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.200 
thinking about how to defend c6 or b7
for<00:06:00.270> example<00:06:00.720> by<00:06:01.230> playing<00:06:01.500> Queen<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.040> c5<00:06:02.430> or

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
for example by playing Queen to c5 or

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.770 
for example by playing Queen to c5 or
what<00:06:03.510> playing<00:06:03.780> Queen<00:06:04.050> takes<00:06:04.290> B<00:06:05.070> to<00:06:05.480> both<00:06:06.480> moves

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
what playing Queen takes B to both moves

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.260 
what playing Queen takes B to both moves
are<00:06:06.990> are<00:06:07.320> good<00:06:07.860> I<00:06:07.950> think<00:06:08.010> quintics<00:06:08.640> b2<00:06:08.910> anyway

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
are are good I think quintics b2 anyway

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.710 
are are good I think quintics b2 anyway
is<00:06:11.060> according<00:06:12.060> to<00:06:13.220> my<00:06:14.220> chess<00:06:15.000> engine<00:06:15.360> this<00:06:15.570> is

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
is according to my chess engine this is

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.110 
is according to my chess engine this is
a<00:06:15.800> completely<00:06:16.800> equal<00:06:17.280> position<00:06:17.700> of<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:17.940> Queen

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
a completely equal position of the Queen

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.550 
a completely equal position of the Queen
takes<00:06:18.360> c6<00:06:18.860> then<00:06:19.860> the<00:06:20.720> the<00:06:21.720> evaluation<00:06:22.320> is<00:06:22.530> a

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
takes c6 then the the evaluation is a

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.040 
takes c6 then the the evaluation is a
total<00:06:25.560> equality<00:06:26.090> we<00:06:27.090> both<00:06:27.300> have<00:06:27.540> a<00:06:27.570> past<00:06:27.840> form

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
total equality we both have a past form

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.350 
total equality we both have a past form
and<00:06:30.980> this<00:06:31.980> is<00:06:32.250> actually<00:06:32.700> what<00:06:32.820> would<00:06:33.240> have

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
and this is actually what would have

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.190 
and this is actually what would have
been<00:06:33.540> correct<00:06:33.900> to<00:06:34.530> do<00:06:34.790> but<00:06:35.790> well<00:06:35.990> the<00:06:36.990> main

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
been correct to do but well the main

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.120 
been correct to do but well the main
thing<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.980> main<00:06:38.010> lesson<00:06:38.580> for<00:06:38.820> me<00:06:38.970> is<00:06:40.130> to

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
thing the main lesson for me is to

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.060 
thing the main lesson for me is to
always<00:06:41.160> always<00:06:42.000> help<00:06:42.450> even<00:06:43.050> how<00:06:43.140> logical<00:06:43.860> and

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
always always help even how logical and

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.160 
always always help even how logical and
how<00:06:44.190> simple<00:06:44.670> a<00:06:44.850> position<00:06:45.360> may<00:06:45.540> look<00:06:45.810> always

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
how simple a position may look always

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.250 
how simple a position may look always
ask<00:06:46.950> myself<00:06:47.280> the<00:06:47.730> question<00:06:47.760> if<00:06:48.690> I<00:06:48.960> do<00:06:49.020> this

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
ask myself the question if I do this

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.860 
ask myself the question if I do this
what<00:06:49.800> will<00:06:49.950> happen<00:06:50.010> next<00:06:50.490> and<00:06:53.000> not<00:06:54.000> to<00:06:54.300> to<00:06:54.720> be

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
what will happen next and not to to be

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.160 
what will happen next and not to to be
so<00:06:55.380> naive<00:06:56.040> in<00:06:56.370> the<00:06:56.520> sense<00:06:56.760> of<00:06:57.000> just<00:06:57.450> making<00:06:57.990> a

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
so naive in the sense of just making a

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:03.320 
so naive in the sense of just making a
move<00:06:58.380> and<00:06:58.650> trusting<00:06:59.130> the<00:07:00.170> future<00:07:01.880> okay<00:07:02.880> so<00:07:03.300> I

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
move and trusting the future okay so I

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.260 
move and trusting the future okay so I
hope<00:07:03.630> this<00:07:03.900> will<00:07:04.260> be<00:07:04.290> a<00:07:04.590> an<00:07:05.130> interesting<00:07:05.790> idea

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
hope this will be a an interesting idea
