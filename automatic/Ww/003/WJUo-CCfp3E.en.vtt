the<00:00:50.000> vehicle<00:00:50.360> is<00:00:50.420> up<00:00:50.540> on<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.750> lift<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.079> first

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
the vehicle is up on the lift the first

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.650 
the vehicle is up on the lift the first
thing<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.500> do<00:00:51.620> is<00:00:51.680> buzz<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:51.980> wheels<00:00:52.160> off<00:00:55.660> none

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
thing to do is buzz the wheels off none

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.180 
thing to do is buzz the wheels off none
of<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.840> wheel<00:00:57.020> is<00:00:57.170> off<00:00:57.320> I<00:00:57.470> can<00:00:57.620> actually<00:00:57.739> see

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
of the wheel is off I can actually see

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.830 
of the wheel is off I can actually see
that<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:58.520> got<00:00:58.670> an<00:00:58.760> electronic<00:00:59.120> caliper<00:00:59.630> I

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
that it's got an electronic caliper I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.690 
that it's got an electronic caliper I
can<00:01:00.410> see<00:01:00.559> that<00:01:00.739> by<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:00.980> motor<00:01:01.220> plug<00:01:01.520> on<00:01:01.610> the

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
can see that by the motor plug on the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.580 
can see that by the motor plug on the
back<00:01:01.850> of<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.030> caliper<00:01:02.270> this<00:01:03.079> means<00:01:03.320> I'm<00:01:03.470> going

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
back of the caliper this means I'm going

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.139 
back of the caliper this means I'm going
to<00:01:03.649> have<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.920> electronically<00:01:04.489> whine<00:01:04.789> back<00:01:04.999> the

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
to have to electronically whine back the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.450 
to have to electronically whine back the
Pistons<00:01:05.569> in<00:01:05.689> order<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.960> change<00:01:06.139> the<00:01:06.380> pads<00:01:06.619> the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
Pistons in order to change the pads the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.489 
Pistons in order to change the pads the
reason<00:01:07.759> for<00:01:07.909> this<00:01:08.030> is<00:01:08.569> the<00:01:08.749> piston<00:01:09.200> actually

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:09.499 
reason for this is the piston actually

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.469 
reason for this is the piston actually
positions<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.130> pads<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:10.999> make<00:01:11.149> sure<00:01:11.299> they're

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
positions the pads to make sure they're

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.629 
positions the pads to make sure they're
clamping<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:11.960> disk<00:01:12.200> if<00:01:12.889> I<00:01:13.009> was<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.219> whine<00:01:13.429> this

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:13.639 
clamping the disk if I was to whine this

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.160 
clamping the disk if I was to whine this
back<00:01:13.819> and<00:01:13.969> manually<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:14.569> would<00:01:14.689> damage<00:01:14.899> the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
back and manually you would damage the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.260 
back and manually you would damage the
motor<00:01:15.350> inside<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.100> caliper<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.729> I'll<00:01:17.090> have

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
motor inside the caliper and I'll have

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.489 
motor inside the caliper and I'll have
to<00:01:17.389> put<00:01:17.539> a<00:01:17.569> whole<00:01:17.780> new<00:01:17.929> caliper<00:01:18.319> on<00:01:18.409> the

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:18.499 
to put a whole new caliper on the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.390 

so<00:03:14.240> what<00:03:14.360> I've<00:03:14.480> observed<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
so what I've observed is that the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.980 
so what I've observed is that the
stepper<00:03:16.790> motors<00:03:17.120> had<00:03:17.270> some<00:03:17.420> current<00:03:17.780> going

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
stepper motors had some current going

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.480 
stepper motors had some current going
through<00:03:18.110> them<00:03:18.440> as<00:03:18.530> they're<00:03:18.680> winding<00:03:18.920> back<00:03:19.250> and

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
through them as they're winding back and

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.090 
through them as they're winding back and
they've<00:03:19.940> reset<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.569> bits<00:03:20.780> from<00:03:20.840> 14<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.830> way<00:03:22.069> I

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
they've reset to bits from 14 that way I

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.380 
they've reset to bits from 14 that way I
know<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.400> they've<00:03:22.640> whelmed<00:03:23.000> back<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.270> their

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
know that they've whelmed back to their

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.150 
know that they've whelmed back to their
original<00:03:23.540> position<00:03:24.110> so<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.680> now<00:03:24.920> remove

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
original position so I can now remove

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.020 
original position so I can now remove
the<00:03:25.220> caliper<00:03:27.400> I've<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.550> got<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.760> take<00:03:28.850> off

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
the caliper I've just got to take off

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.800 
the caliper I've just got to take off
the<00:03:29.150> caliper<00:03:29.450> bolts<00:03:31.540> now<00:03:32.540> I've<00:03:32.630> got<00:03:32.750> the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
the caliper bolts now I've got the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.300 
the caliper bolts now I've got the
caliper<00:03:33.080> bolts<00:03:33.410> off<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.800> caliper<00:03:34.160> should

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
caliper bolts off the caliper should

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.280 
caliper bolts off the caliper should
lift<00:03:34.490> off<00:03:34.640> easily<00:03:34.820> if<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.630> hadn't<00:03:35.990> have<00:03:36.080> wound

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
lift off easily if I hadn't have wound

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.080 
lift off easily if I hadn't have wound
back<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.650> Pistons<00:03:37.130> there's<00:03:37.459> no<00:03:37.670> way<00:03:37.820> we'll<00:03:38.000> be

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
back the Pistons there's no way we'll be

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.090 
back the Pistons there's no way we'll be
able<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.270> lift<00:03:38.390> off<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.570> caliper<00:03:39.020> now<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.920> if<00:03:39.980> I

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
able to lift off the caliper now so if I

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.479 
able to lift off the caliper now so if I
just<00:03:40.220> pull<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.489> caliper<00:03:40.820> towards<00:03:41.120> me<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:43.280> just

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
just pull the caliper towards me it just

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.370 
just pull the caliper towards me it just
lifts<00:03:43.730> off<00:03:43.850> I've<00:03:44.420> got<00:03:44.450> two<00:03:44.720> new<00:03:44.870> brake<00:03:45.050> pads<00:03:45.080> to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
lifts off I've got two new brake pads to

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.710 
lifts off I've got two new brake pads to
put<00:03:45.500> on<00:03:45.650> what<00:03:46.340> I've<00:03:46.459> also<00:03:46.610> done<00:03:46.790> is<00:03:47.180> fitted<00:03:47.570> new

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
put on what I've also done is fitted new

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.930 
put on what I've also done is fitted new
shim<00:03:47.959> kits<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.500> fitting<00:03:49.160> new<00:03:49.280> bolts<00:03:49.610> also<00:03:49.880> to

the<00:03:50.090> caliper<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:55.519> pads<00:03:55.760> should<00:03:55.970> fit<00:03:56.180> easily

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
the caliper the pads should fit easily

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.390 
the caliper the pads should fit easily
if<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:56.959> have<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.230> force<00:03:57.470> them<00:03:57.650> in<00:03:57.800> then<00:03:58.160> there's

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
if I have to force them in then there's

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.890 
if I have to force them in then there's
an<00:03:58.489> issue<00:03:58.550> they're<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.060> wrong<00:03:59.180> pads<00:03:59.480> or<00:03:59.720> as<00:03:59.870> I

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
an issue they're the wrong pads or as I

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.930 
an issue they're the wrong pads or as I
haven't<00:04:00.110> cleaned<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:00.470> up<00:04:00.530> correctly

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.280 

now<00:04:07.940> I've<00:04:08.060> completed<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.690> job<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.020> replacing

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
now I've completed the job of replacing

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.680 
now I've completed the job of replacing
the<00:04:09.650> brake<00:04:09.800> pads<00:04:10.130> what<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:10.790> need<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.150> do<00:04:11.300> is<00:04:11.420> wind

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
the brake pads what I need to do is wind

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.570 
the brake pads what I need to do is wind
the<00:04:11.840> pistons<00:04:12.230> forwards<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.130> that<00:04:13.220> they<00:04:13.280> clamp

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
the pistons forwards so that they clamp

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.490 
the pistons forwards so that they clamp
on<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:13.970> brake<00:04:14.150> pads<00:04:14.450> it's<00:04:15.080> very<00:04:15.319> very

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
on to the brake pads it's very very

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.830 
on to the brake pads it's very very
important<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:16.010> do<00:04:16.070> this<00:04:16.400> resetting<00:04:17.060> otherwise

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
important I do this resetting otherwise

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.720 
important I do this resetting otherwise
the<00:04:18.109> handbrake<00:04:18.590> won't<00:04:18.980> be<00:04:19.130> applied<00:04:19.430> properly

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
the handbrake won't be applied properly

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.090 
the handbrake won't be applied properly
the<00:04:20.510> reason<00:04:20.840> for<00:04:20.959> this<00:04:21.079> is<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.290> step<00:04:21.560> emotion<00:04:21.980> is

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
the reason for this is a step emotion is

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.310 
the reason for this is a step emotion is
exactly<00:04:22.640> where<00:04:22.880> to<00:04:22.910> clamp<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.390> pads<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:24.260> I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
exactly where to clamp the pads and I

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.720 
exactly where to clamp the pads and I
need<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.620> reset<00:04:25.100> that<00:04:25.130> inside<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.210> car's<00:04:26.450> ECU

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
need to reset that inside the car's ECU

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.210 
need to reset that inside the car's ECU
from<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.850> menu<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.120> now<00:04:29.300> select<00:04:29.800> move<00:04:30.800> Pistons

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
from the menu I now select move Pistons

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.080 
from the menu I now select move Pistons
forwards<00:04:31.610> after<00:04:32.030> service<00:04:33.280> if<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.400> hit<00:04:34.520> OK<00:04:34.820> again

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
forwards after service if I hit OK again

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.940 
forwards after service if I hit OK again
it<00:04:35.330> will<00:04:35.390> give<00:04:35.540> me<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.750> help<00:04:35.930> menu<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.410> it'll

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
it will give me the help menu and it'll

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.260 
it will give me the help menu and it'll
ask<00:04:37.160> me<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:39.280> run<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.430> Pistons<00:04:40.790> forward<00:04:41.090> again

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
ask me to run the Pistons forward again

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.320 
ask me to run the Pistons forward again
I<00:04:42.220> can<00:04:43.220> see<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.460> current<00:04:43.610> going<00:04:43.910> through<00:04:44.000> the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
I can see the current going through the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.909 
I can see the current going through the
Pistons<00:04:44.510> through<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.110> stepper<00:04:45.320> motors<00:04:45.740> to

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
Pistons through the stepper motors to

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.320 
Pistons through the stepper motors to
make<00:04:46.040> sure<00:04:46.220> they're<00:04:46.430> regaining<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.940> original

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
make sure they're regaining the original

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.990 
make sure they're regaining the original
position<00:04:47.720> which<00:04:48.440> as<00:04:48.740> we<00:04:48.919> can<00:04:49.070> see<00:04:49.280> is<00:04:49.730> step

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
position which as we can see is step

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.380 
position which as we can see is step
number<00:04:50.030> two<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:52.580> finally<00:04:52.880> once<00:04:53.240> this

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
number two and finally once this

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.140 
number two and finally once this
operation<00:04:53.540> is<00:04:54.020> complete<00:04:54.410> I<00:04:54.650> just<00:04:55.490> need<00:04:55.669> to<00:04:55.910> go

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
operation is complete I just need to go

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.490 
operation is complete I just need to go
through<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.450> basic<00:04:56.840> setting<00:04:57.169> of<00:04:57.290> brake

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
through the basic setting of brake

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.190 
through the basic setting of brake
systems<00:04:57.980> this<00:04:58.940> is<00:04:59.090> like<00:04:59.330> resetting<00:04:59.960> the

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
systems this is like resetting the

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:10.800 
systems this is like resetting the
adaptive<00:05:00.620> values<00:05:01.010> after<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.370> job

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.820 

but<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:11.900> will<00:05:12.020> now<00:05:12.139> do<00:05:12.199> is<00:05:12.350> wine<00:05:12.650> them

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
but it will now do is wine them

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.830 
but it will now do is wine them
backwards<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.370> forwards<00:05:13.729> three<00:05:13.970> times<00:05:14.240> to

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
backwards and forwards three times to

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.080 
backwards and forwards three times to
identify<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.380> exact<00:05:15.830> position<00:05:16.100> that<00:05:16.550> we<00:05:16.940> need

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
identify the exact position that we need

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:26.499 
identify the exact position that we need
to<00:05:17.210> be<00:05:17.360> in<00:05:17.479> I<00:05:24.759> know<00:05:25.759> the<00:05:25.880> job<00:05:26.060> is<00:05:26.150> complete

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
to be in I know the job is complete

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.240 
to be in I know the job is complete
because<00:05:26.870> the<00:05:27.020> stepper<00:05:27.350> motor<00:05:27.380> have<00:05:27.830> both<00:05:28.009> gone

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
because the stepper motor have both gone

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.120 
because the stepper motor have both gone
back<00:05:28.460> to<00:05:28.639> 0<00:05:28.880> steps<00:05:29.590> now<00:05:30.590> just<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.889> quick<00:05:31.100> check

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
back to 0 steps now just a quick check

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.980 
back to 0 steps now just a quick check
to<00:05:31.520> make<00:05:31.639> sure<00:05:31.699> there's<00:05:32.210> no<00:05:32.330> fall<00:05:32.600> codes<00:05:32.840> in

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
to make sure there's no fall codes in

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.840 
to make sure there's no fall codes in
