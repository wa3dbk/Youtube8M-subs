00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello welcome to disabled 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 barrier-free DE we are in heidelberg 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.049
 and the twelve of the wheelchair marathon 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.010
 will start soon 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.230
 Hello hello first until now evasive 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.849
 Best mood in the camp is mood 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.990
 Great I mean what else do you want 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.670
 The weather is different 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.340
 wrought the street swept 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.570
 the competition is there strong all 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.070
 happy to show you what you can 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.199
 have on it and we have a lot today 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.220
 on it so ideal conditions from the weather 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.619
 definitely 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 It is the year so times the hours 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.780
 breaking a record which managed the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.210
 Teams orders it gets tight so it is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 no fun to crack the hour and if 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.989
 because you seriously think about it then 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.170
 you know that for an hour more 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.789
 is called 42 km h and even if the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.960
 athletes with a lot of euphoria that always 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.610
 We'll say that again 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.340
 just fast and so yes so I'm here 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.660
 rather for humility responsible in the team and 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.809
 I would be happy if it works and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.920
 I also believe that we can but 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.870
 I can not promise as that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.969
 or sometimes a lot here very much success 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 we accompany that, of course, comes 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.880
 exciting race stays up 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.880
 like olli and williams and tomorrow 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.700
 I'm fit but will not take place today 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.560
 static but not resolved dear 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:37.390
 watch 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:38.829
 complete yes that's really warm 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.229
 as I think on my watch without 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.030
 We already have 30 degrees in the shade 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.890
 appropriate keep out a bit so 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.420
 cool temperature because otherwise you are with 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.909
 the hot engine already at the start line 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.179
 and then we're off until now 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.920
 I 'll crack the hour record 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.880
 because crack is the other question but me 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.200
 I already have five people 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.959
 agreed that we definitely 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.369
 work i hope for each one individually 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.450
 he does as much as me and then 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.250
 It will work out in any case 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.140
 So we push your thumb but 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.160
 only one question you may ask 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.720
 if the material changes something opera yes 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.030
 So I have my london forest 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.920
 brought along yes and we already have 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.170
 a few items stop all this 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.610
 weight optimizes a rocket so on 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.680
 the runs so well over so 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.450
 bike my my workout, which is 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.950
 simply that is depending on what you are for 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.389
 a helmet puts on a lot of time before 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.889
 on it and then knows exactly what to do 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.900
 have 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:31.600
 who wishes you all the best he could 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.299
 Gas gives everything for real 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.130

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.130
