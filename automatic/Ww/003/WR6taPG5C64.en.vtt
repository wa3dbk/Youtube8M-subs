00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.939 

at<00:00:28.699> the<00:00:28.880> future<00:00:29.150> of<00:00:29.240> HTMI<00:00:29.720> at<00:00:30.019> this<00:00:30.289> point<00:00:30.619> it's

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
at the future of HTMI at this point it's

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.759 
at the future of HTMI at this point it's
focusing<00:00:31.939> on<00:00:32.119> students<00:00:32.629> it's<00:00:32.960> focusing<00:00:33.559> on

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
focusing on students it's focusing on

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.150 
focusing on students it's focusing on
the<00:00:33.920> core<00:00:34.160> values<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:34.850> I<00:00:35.750> think<00:00:36.170> bringing

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
the core values and I think bringing

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.819 
the core values and I think bringing
HTMI<00:00:37.790> forward<00:00:38.270> is<00:00:38.450> is<00:00:38.840> really<00:00:39.170> supporting

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
HTMI forward is is really supporting

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.069 
HTMI forward is is really supporting
that<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.309> see<00:00:40.520> where<00:00:40.700> we<00:00:40.850> go<00:00:41.000> we<00:00:41.629> have<00:00:41.660> a<00:00:41.840> big

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
that and see where we go we have a big

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:52.869 
that and see where we go we have a big
future<00:00:50.230> million<00:00:51.230> HTM<00:00:51.680> is<00:00:52.100> that<00:00:52.430> I<00:00:52.460> have<00:00:52.760> the

future million HTM is that I have the

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.150 
future million HTM is that I have the
opportunity<00:00:53.059> to<00:00:53.690> meet<00:00:53.899> a<00:00:54.170> lot<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.500> people<00:00:54.770> from

we run conferences here at HTMI twice a

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.580 
we run conferences here at HTMI twice a
year<00:02:11.590> one<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.730> house<00:02:13.420> with<00:02:13.989> our<00:02:14.170> students

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
presenting papers the second one tends

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.180 
presenting papers the second one tends
to<00:02:17.019> be<00:02:17.079> a<00:02:17.109> rather<00:02:17.319> bigger<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.010> more

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
to be a rather bigger and more

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.460 
to be a rather bigger and more
international<00:02:18.459> event<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.389> that<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.319> have

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
international event and that we have

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.780 
international event and that we have
guest<00:02:20.709> speakers<00:02:21.100> as<00:02:21.310> well<00:02:21.549> as<00:02:21.639> our<00:02:21.760> own

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
guest speakers as well as our own

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:31.260 
guest speakers as well as our own
students<00:02:22.209> presenting<00:02:22.600> material

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.580 

using<00:02:32.270> of<00:02:32.330> technology<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:32.900> very<00:02:33.050> effective

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
using of technology is very effective

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.040 
using of technology is very effective
like<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> teaching<00:02:34.550> methods<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.150> most<00:02:35.900> of

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
like the teaching methods and most of

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.140 
like the teaching methods and most of
all<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.680> efficient<00:02:37.400> combination<00:02:37.970> of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
all I like the efficient combination of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:49.390 
all I like the efficient combination of
theory<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.570> practice

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.820 

it<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.610> extremely<00:02:51.569> important<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.470> listen<00:02:52.620> to

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
it is extremely important to listen to

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.880 
it is extremely important to listen to
the<00:02:53.010> industry<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:54.030> find<00:02:54.270> out<00:02:54.660> what<00:02:55.500> are<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the industry to find out what are the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.699 
the industry to find out what are the
exact<00:02:56.459> needs<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:57.870> are<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.200> challenges

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
exact needs what are the challenges

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.949 
exact needs what are the challenges
which<00:02:58.860> they<00:02:59.069> face<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.270> could<00:03:00.480> train<00:03:00.750> our

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
which they face so we could train our

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.370 
which they face so we could train our
students<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:02.220> fill<00:03:02.459> up<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.880> gap<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.810> make

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
students to fill up that gap and make

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.699 
students to fill up that gap and make
sure<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:05.340> they<00:03:06.120> would<00:03:06.300> be<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.510> best<00:03:06.709> which

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
sure that they would be the best which

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.880 
sure that they would be the best which
the<00:03:07.830> hotel<00:03:08.070> company<00:03:08.430> could<00:03:08.580> ask<00:03:08.730> for

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.140 

with<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.130> vision<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.580> can<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:14.940> see<00:03:15.120> that

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
with the vision I can really see that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.780 
with the vision I can really see that
HDMI<00:03:15.750> has<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.020> really<00:03:16.830> strong<00:03:17.099> vision<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.610> see

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
HDMI has a really strong vision to see

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.460 
HDMI has a really strong vision to see
where<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.750> love<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.319> part

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
where it's going and I love to be part

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.410 

I<00:03:28.049> think<00:03:29.049> we<00:03:29.109> do<00:03:29.260> stand<00:03:29.590> by<00:03:29.829> what<00:03:30.760> we<00:03:30.909> say<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:31.239> do

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
I think we do stand by what we say we do

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.500 
I think we do stand by what we say we do
we<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.439> listen<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.890> students<00:03:33.459> we<00:03:33.790> do<00:03:34.030> listen<00:03:34.359> to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
we do listen to students we do listen to

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.300 
we do listen to students we do listen to
students<00:03:34.900> feedback<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.709> think<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.159> is

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
students feedback and I think that is

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.789 
students feedback and I think that is
very<00:03:36.730> encouraging<00:03:36.909> for<00:03:37.629> parents<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.769> know

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
very encouraging for parents to know

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.559 
very encouraging for parents to know
that<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.370> value<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.760> their<00:03:40.000> money<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.420> their
