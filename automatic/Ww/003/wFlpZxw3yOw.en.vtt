00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.000
 they gave us time finally there 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.310
 has some who was still 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.500
 a little to your kim son but otherwise 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.940
 that's positive and they're the elite the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.990
 Croisette is really open I could 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.970

 cross and pat not the box ifans 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.250
 term we want not really cool and and 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.340
 otherwise I was able to interview a few 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.080
 feathers that was really cool too 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.090
 I was able to continue doing everything 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.040
 is at the gaming level to record 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.480
 some peas etc 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.709
 by cons what is a pity that's 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.920
 he does not know if you want we do not have 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.030
 really access to everything I want 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.680
 to say to be a little boosted must 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.480
 start talking from a cetera 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.570
 because otherwise she does not leave 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.790
 pass and I understood why there is 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.050
 people who are accredited youtuber or 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.800
 bloggers but have nothing to do 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.470
 here who have not 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.560
 no case really when that's maybe 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.070
 a person really we see the head of 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.790
 the person 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.220
 the guy he comes in tag mode 30 blaye 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.390
 no gear one comes with a bag the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.390
 only thing that gets into the 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.550
 stand old bloggers blowjob and go home 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.240
 he takes our fridges from cans of coke 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.040
 free of charge and he does it he puts himself all 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.010
 in the bag ir barthle expert was in 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.110
 the bag with their band of ten door to 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.300
 far I always look very much at all 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.590
 nike I say what are they doing here and 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.840
 in fact I understand why she and 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.910
 not on youtube hours either of 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.410
 great value in the eyes of our eyes 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.370
 exhibitors and I understand them all to 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.750
 compared against me whoever 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.930
 wants to make the right videos that have 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.450
 all provide a fucking content that's 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.830
 was hard but when they saw 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.450
 so that we start going out 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.980
 stuff and so on there sometimes they are 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.549
 maybe a little more indulgent than if 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.570
 some bumps 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:28.350
 arrived in rising mode always to 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.490
 botanists and teachers otherwise I 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.910
 think the videos will arrive in the 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.890
 week 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.760
 after the paris games week I tried to 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.260
 do you do that at home make videos 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.520
 quality anyway because there is 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.980
 a lot of sequences so 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.810
 a lot of time to do the 10th all 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.770
 everything but otherwise I know that one of 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.720
 you do a good thing 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.490
 and then that's it so I think I 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.380
 did everything is ready for this for the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.890
 days 3 and 4 it was still a little 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.960
 quick 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.960
 ahmed yes here 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.509
 we're going to get into the vip square the ex boss 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.830
 well that screen assistant when we 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:07.009
 threat and a society with a vix 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.349
 starter to be able to settle in the 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.270
 medium gaming and so he creates some 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.659
 accessories in this form 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.439
 they are joystick adapters 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.819
 xbox one 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:22.009

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:24.909

 just clip is actually very much at 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.949
 do pgm weddings but the trick 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.899
 in the story is that it costs 70 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:46.159
 euros and the guy spun me for free 

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:47.330
