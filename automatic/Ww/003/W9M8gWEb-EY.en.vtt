sounds<00:03:51.760> very<00:03:52.150> unlock<00:03:52.480> cool<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.840> happen

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
sounds very unlock cool to happen

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.140 
sounds very unlock cool to happen
because<00:03:53.320> even<00:03:54.160> though<00:03:54.280> if<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.520> movie<00:03:54.730> had

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
because even though if the movie had

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.020 
because even though if the movie had
like<00:03:55.300> an<00:03:55.420> extra<00:03:55.960> hour<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.650> scenes<00:03:57.310> more<00:03:57.640> likely

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
like an extra hour of scenes more likely

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.670 
like an extra hour of scenes more likely
that<00:03:58.060> extra<00:03:58.540> hours<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.080> gonna<00:03:59.260> be<00:03:59.410> assured

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
that extra hours is gonna be assured

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.410 
that extra hours is gonna be assured
blu-ray<00:04:00.040> scenes<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.910> know<00:04:01.030> deleted

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
blu-ray scenes and you know deleted

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.490 
blu-ray scenes and you know deleted
scenes<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.750> we<00:04:01.870> probably<00:04:02.050> didn't<00:04:02.350> see<00:04:02.440> in

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
scenes that we probably didn't see in

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.750 
scenes that we probably didn't see in
the<00:04:02.560> movie<00:04:02.770> so<00:04:02.920> more<00:04:03.070> likely<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.520> trailer

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
the movie so more likely the trailer

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.120
