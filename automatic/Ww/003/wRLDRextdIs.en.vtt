because it's an improvement or member
jmos<00:00:48.700> industrial<00:00:49.660> smelter<00:00:50.140> it's<00:00:50.860> designed

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
jmos industrial smelter it's designed

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.570 
jmos industrial smelter it's designed
used<00:00:51.820> up<00:00:52.059> a<00:00:52.210> lot<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.720> iron<00:00:53.080> so<00:00:53.650> I<00:00:53.680> thought<00:00:54.040> I<00:00:54.250> can

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
used up a lot of iron so I thought I can

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.970 
used up a lot of iron so I thought I can
improve<00:00:54.850> it<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.270> also<00:00:55.720> this<00:00:56.170> design<00:00:56.500> is<00:00:56.710> just

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
improve it and also this design is just

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.800 
improve it and also this design is just
slightly<00:00:57.970> more<00:00:58.300> efficient<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:01.149> just<00:01:01.600> like

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
slightly more efficient so just like

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.170 
slightly more efficient so just like
memo<00:01:02.140> chambers<00:01:02.470> design<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:03.430> can<00:01:03.640> expense

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
memo chambers design you can expense

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.389 
memo chambers design you can expense
this<00:01:04.479> design<00:01:04.839> as<00:01:05.050> far<00:01:05.290> as<00:01:05.380> you<00:01:05.500> want<00:01:05.530> there's

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
this design as far as you want there's

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.180 
this design as far as you want there's
no<00:01:06.640> limit<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.030> it<00:01:07.240> but<00:01:08.050> it<00:01:08.259> will<00:01:08.470> cost<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.950> a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
no limit to it but it will cost you a

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.260 
no limit to it but it will cost you a
lot<00:01:09.340> more<00:01:10.030> resources<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.250> guess<00:01:12.610> we<00:01:13.000> reach

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
lot more resources so I guess we reach

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.120 
lot more resources so I guess we reach
the<00:01:13.540> point<00:01:13.690> where<00:01:14.259> I<00:01:14.290> have<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.680> stop<00:01:14.920> talking

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
the point where I have to stop talking

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.290 
the point where I have to stop talking
and<00:01:15.520> begin<00:01:16.000> with<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.300> tutorial<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.610> here<00:01:22.180> we

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
and begin with the tutorial so here we

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.120 
and begin with the tutorial so here we
are<00:01:22.330> once<00:01:22.869> again<00:01:22.930> ready<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.680> start<00:01:23.920> building

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
are once again ready to start building

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.430 
are once again ready to start building
so<00:01:25.000> first<00:01:25.300> of<00:01:25.450> all<00:01:25.600> we<00:01:25.810> are<00:01:25.869> going<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.200> start

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
so first of all we are going to start

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.529 
so first of all we are going to start
with<00:01:26.649> a<00:01:26.680> lime<00:01:26.979> rule<00:01:27.280> circuit<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:27.970> all<00:01:28.420> the

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
with a lime rule circuit and all the

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:29.999 
with a lime rule circuit and all the
items<00:01:28.930> for<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.200> language<00:01:29.530> circuit<00:01:29.890> are

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
items for the language circuit are

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.850 
items for the language circuit are
inside<00:01:30.820> my<00:01:31.060> inventory<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:31.810> first<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.619> all<00:01:32.710> we

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
inside my inventory so first of all we

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.590 
inside my inventory so first of all we
place<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.130> block<00:01:33.340> up<00:01:33.490> there<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:34.330> row<00:01:34.479> of

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
place a block up there and a row of

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.899 
place a block up there and a row of
blocks<00:01:34.810> all<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.170> way<00:01:35.380> like<00:01:35.590> this<00:01:35.890> then<00:01:36.760> we

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
blocks all the way like this then we

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.520 
blocks all the way like this then we
take<00:01:37.240> out<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:37.420> block<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.930> replace<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:38.500> with

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
take out that block and replace it with

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.070 
take out that block and replace it with
a<00:01:38.680> block<00:01:39.040> of<00:01:39.070> redstone<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.820> place<00:01:40.510> or<00:01:40.720> power

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
a block of redstone and place or power

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.920 
a block of redstone and place or power
drill<00:01:41.409> on<00:01:41.530> top<00:01:41.770> until<00:01:42.640> we<00:01:43.090> reach<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.630> account

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
drill on top until we reach the account

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.390 
drill on top until we reach the account
number<00:01:44.350> seven<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:46.840> we<00:01:47.710> just<00:01:47.920> want<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.220> pick

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
number seven then we just want to pick

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.120 
number seven then we just want to pick
out<00:01:48.549> our<00:01:48.610> hoppers<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.330> place<00:01:50.080> two<00:01:50.380> facing

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
out our hoppers and place two facing

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.670 
out our hoppers and place two facing
into<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.490> table<00:01:52.180> chest<00:01:52.450> all<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.930> way<00:01:53.290> like<00:01:53.530> that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
into a table chest all the way like that

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.960 
into a table chest all the way like that
and<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:55.659> place<00:01:55.900> another<00:01:56.229> powered<00:01:56.680> rail<00:01:57.280> on<00:01:57.520> top

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
and we place another powered rail on top

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.690 
and we place another powered rail on top
also<00:01:58.810> we<00:01:59.350> want<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.710> put<00:01:59.860> down<00:02:00.040> a<00:02:00.220> block<00:02:00.520> right

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
also we want to put down a block right

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.270 
also we want to put down a block right
there<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:01.659> or<00:02:01.869> minecart<00:02:02.409> will<00:02:02.619> not<00:02:02.830> run<00:02:03.100> off

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
there so or minecart will not run off

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.710 
there so or minecart will not run off
the<00:02:03.610> track<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:05.830> nowhere<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:07.210> then<00:02:07.420> it's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
the track in to nowhere so then it's

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.410 
the track in to nowhere so then it's
time<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.649> start<00:02:08.799> with<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.250> furnitures<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.269> we

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
time to start with the furnitures so we

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.509 
time to start with the furnitures so we
are<00:02:10.600> going<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.019> place<00:02:11.260> eight<00:02:11.530> furnitures<00:02:12.310> all

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
are going to place eight furnitures all

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.539 
are going to place eight furnitures all
the<00:02:12.910> way<00:02:13.060> like<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.900> course<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:15.190> can

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
the way like this of course you can

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.150 
the way like this of course you can
expand<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.120> as<00:02:16.360> far<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:17.019> you<00:02:17.170> want<00:02:17.380> there<00:02:18.130> is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
expand this as far as you want there is

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.910 
expand this as far as you want there is
no<00:02:18.549> limitation<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.500> except<00:02:20.500> your<00:02:20.650> render

no limitation to it except your render

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.270 
no limitation to it except your render
distance<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.970> now<00:02:22.150> let's<00:02:22.840> place<00:02:23.140> down<00:02:23.350> another

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
distance so now let's place down another

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.440 
distance so now let's place down another
row<00:02:24.519> of<00:02:24.700> hoppers<00:02:26.220> all<00:02:27.220> facing<00:02:28.000> into<00:02:28.420> the

row of hoppers all facing into the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.300 
row of hoppers all facing into the
furnitures<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.829> course

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
furnitures and of course

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.020

power<00:02:30.489> drill<00:02:30.820> on<00:02:31.030> top<00:02:31.269> then<00:02:32.140> once<00:02:32.680> again

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
power drill on top then once again

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.270 
power drill on top then once again
hoppers<00:02:34.030> facing<00:02:34.570> into<00:02:35.320> furnitures<00:02:35.950> all<00:02:36.130> the

hoppers facing into furnitures all the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.270 
hoppers facing into furnitures all the
way<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:36.579> this<00:02:36.840> with<00:02:37.840> once<00:02:38.350> again<00:02:38.650> power

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
way like this with once again power

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.460 
way like this with once again power
drill<00:02:39.579> on<00:02:39.700> top<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.150> sometimes<00:02:40.959> they<00:02:41.410> do

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
drill on top and sometimes they do

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.000 
drill on top and sometimes they do
interfere

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
interfere

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.170 
interfere
but<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.580> solve<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:42.909> easily<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.220> it

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
but you can solve that easily so and it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.869 
but you can solve that easily so and it
starts<00:02:46.569> raining<00:02:46.720> well<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:48.159> seems<00:02:48.489> like<00:02:48.640> I've

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
starts raining well it seems like I've

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.729 
starts raining well it seems like I've
got<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.329> very<00:02:49.390> often<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.140> my<00:02:50.290> world<00:02:50.470> but

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
got this very often in my world but

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.479 
got this very often in my world but
never<00:02:50.950> mind<00:02:51.159> we<00:02:51.310> keep<00:02:51.670> going<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.860> are

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
never mind we keep going so we are

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.270 
never mind we keep going so we are
nearly<00:02:54.790> finished<00:02:55.299> with<00:02:55.720> lime<00:02:56.620> rule<00:02:56.860> circuit

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
nearly finished with lime rule circuit

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.890 
nearly finished with lime rule circuit
we<00:02:57.489> just<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:57.849> to<00:02:57.939> place<00:02:58.180> three<00:02:58.450> more<00:02:58.629> blocks

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
we just have to place three more blocks

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.069 
we just have to place three more blocks
and<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.950> redstone<00:03:00.190> torch<00:03:00.329> so<00:03:01.329> everything<00:03:01.900> is

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
and a redstone torch so everything is

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.530 
and a redstone torch so everything is
powered<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:03.220> that's<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.640> for<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.090> lime<00:03:04.329> wheel

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
powered so that's it for the lime wheel

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.199 
powered so that's it for the lime wheel
circuit<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.560> now<00:03:08.859> it's<00:03:09.069> time<00:03:09.310> for<00:03:09.549> us<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.819> start

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
circuit so now it's time for us to start

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.509 
circuit so now it's time for us to start
with<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> light<00:03:10.810> blue<00:03:11.230> circuit<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.340> is

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
with a light blue circuit and this is

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.770 
with a light blue circuit and this is
going<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.879> be<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.209> very<00:03:13.870> easy<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.890> small<00:03:15.250> circus

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
going to be a very easy and small circus

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.690 
going to be a very easy and small circus
people<00:03:16.780> just<00:03:17.049> have<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.349> place<00:03:17.670> three<00:03:18.670> blocks

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
people just have to place three blocks

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.140 
people just have to place three blocks
like<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.659> three<00:03:20.170> more<00:03:20.409> like<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:21.150> and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
like this and three more like that and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.420 
like this and three more like that and
we<00:03:22.329> just<00:03:22.359> want<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.959> take<00:03:23.109> or<00:03:23.319> reel<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.829> place

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
we just want to take or reel and place

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.080 
we just want to take or reel and place
it<00:03:24.579> right<00:03:24.609> there

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
it right there

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.839 
it right there
and<00:03:25.299> sometimes<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.500> interferes<00:03:27.040> but<00:03:27.489> we<00:03:27.670> can

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
and sometimes it interferes but we can

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.180 
and sometimes it interferes but we can
solve<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.329> by<00:03:28.629> taking<00:03:28.989> them<00:03:29.139> out<00:03:29.290> place<00:03:29.920> one

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
solve that by taking them out place one

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.430 
solve that by taking them out place one
and<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.609> power<00:03:30.790> drill<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.329> do<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.810> same<00:03:32.049> on<00:03:32.260> the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
and a power drill and do the same on the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.990 
and a power drill and do the same on the
other<00:03:32.470> side<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:34.450> should<00:03:34.720> define<00:03:35.349> then<00:03:36.069> we

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
other side and it should define then we

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.699 
other side and it should define then we
just<00:03:37.209> want<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.510> take<00:03:37.629> our<00:03:37.810> hoppers<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.349> place

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
just want to take our hoppers and place

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.550 
just want to take our hoppers and place
one<00:03:38.920> right<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:40.000> top<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.569> one<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.019> one

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
one right on top of that one and one

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.830 
one right on top of that one and one
facing<00:03:41.980> into<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.579> power<00:03:42.760> drill<00:03:43.090> then<00:03:43.720> we

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
facing into that power drill then we

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.099 
facing into that power drill then we
just<00:03:44.049> place<00:03:44.349> or<00:03:44.620> chest<00:03:44.920> right<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.609> top<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.109> it

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
just place or chest right on top and it

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.069 
just place or chest right on top and it
should<00:03:47.169> look<00:03:47.620> fine<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:49.090> now<00:03:49.359> it's<00:03:49.569> time<00:03:49.750> for<00:03:49.780> us

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
should look fine so now it's time for us

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.080 
should look fine so now it's time for us
to<00:03:50.470> start<00:03:50.769> with<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.069> most<00:03:51.310> important<00:03:51.879> circuit

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
to start with the most important circuit

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.770 
to start with the most important circuit
of<00:03:52.359> all<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:53.049> orange<00:03:53.650> circuit<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:55.359> first<00:03:55.629> of

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
of all the orange circuit so first of

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.240 
of all the orange circuit so first of
all<00:03:55.900> we<00:03:56.109> are<00:03:56.139> going<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.500> place<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.739> block<00:03:56.829> right

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
all we are going to place a block right

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.430 
all we are going to place a block right
there<00:03:57.519> within<00:03:58.180> compared<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.810> running<00:03:59.169> out<00:03:59.290> of

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
there within compared to running out of

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.319 
there within compared to running out of
it<00:03:59.590> so<00:03:59.829> it<00:03:59.980> can<00:04:00.250> check<00:04:00.849> if<00:04:01.030> there<00:04:01.209> are<00:04:01.239> any

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
it so it can check if there are any

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.930 
it so it can check if there are any
items<00:04:01.750> inside<00:04:02.379> that<00:04:02.530> hopper<00:04:02.829> waiting<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.790> be

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
items inside that hopper waiting to be

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.300 
items inside that hopper waiting to be
burned<00:04:04.209> then<00:04:05.169> we<00:04:05.290> place<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.560> sled<00:04:05.889> with<00:04:06.160> some

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
burned then we place a sled with some

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.430 
burned then we place a sled with some
redstone<00:04:06.519> dust<00:04:06.790> on<00:04:06.940> top<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:07.660> will<00:04:07.959> keep<00:04:08.230> the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
redstone dust on top this will keep the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.080 
redstone dust on top this will keep the
redstone<00:04:08.859> from<00:04:09.280> interfering<00:04:09.849> with<00:04:09.970> your

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
redstone from interfering with your

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.270 
redstone from interfering with your
hopper<00:04:10.449> then<00:04:11.169> we<00:04:11.349> just<00:04:11.590> place<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.829> block<00:04:12.069> right

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
hopper then we just place a block right

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.360 
hopper then we just place a block right
there<00:04:12.489> with<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.819> repeater<00:04:13.209> on<00:04:13.449> top<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:14.370> one

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
there with the repeater on top and one

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.729 
there with the repeater on top and one
more<00:04:15.579> block<00:04:15.790> up<00:04:16.449> there<00:04:16.780> with<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.349> redstone

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
more block up there with the redstone

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.479 
more block up there with the redstone
torch<00:04:17.769> on<00:04:18.310> its<00:04:18.940> side<00:04:19.410> then<00:04:20.410> we<00:04:20.620> go<00:04:20.799> down<00:04:21.160> two

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
torch on its side then we go down two

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.029 
torch on its side then we go down two
blocks<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:21.970> place<00:04:22.510> down<00:04:22.840> or<00:04:23.139> two<00:04:23.590> hoppers

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
blocks and place down or two hoppers

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.370 
blocks and place down or two hoppers
facing<00:04:24.370> into<00:04:24.820> each<00:04:24.940> other<00:04:25.180> with<00:04:25.750> one<00:04:26.020> with

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
facing into each other with one with

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.250 
facing into each other with one with
redstone<00:04:26.740> dust<00:04:26.860> on<00:04:27.070> top<00:04:27.419> this<00:04:28.419> will<00:04:28.690> create<00:04:28.900> an

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
redstone dust on top this will create an

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.310 
redstone dust on top this will create an
hopper<00:04:30.070> clock<00:04:30.240> then<00:04:31.240> we<00:04:31.419> just<00:04:31.599> go<00:04:31.870> down<00:04:32.110> two

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
hopper clock then we just go down two

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.279 
hopper clock then we just go down two
more<00:04:32.470> blocks<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:33.690> place<00:04:34.690> down<00:04:35.080> or

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
more blocks and place down or

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.310 
more blocks and place down or
comparators<00:04:36.130> they<00:04:37.060> will<00:04:37.240> check<00:04:37.449> for<00:04:37.960> if<00:04:38.110> there

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
comparators they will check for if there

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.580 
comparators they will check for if there
are<00:04:38.530> any<00:04:38.800> items<00:04:39.400> inside<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:39.970> hopper<00:04:40.199> then<00:04:41.199> we

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
are any items inside the hopper then we

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.649 
are any items inside the hopper then we
count<00:04:41.860> all<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.490> way<00:04:42.580> like<00:04:42.789> this<00:04:42.820> on<00:04:43.240> both

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
count all the way like this on both

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.800 
count all the way like this on both
sides<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.349> then<00:04:45.310> we<00:04:45.340> place<00:04:45.760> down<00:04:46.030> or<00:04:46.210> redstone

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
sides and then we place down or redstone

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.320 
sides and then we place down or redstone
dust<00:04:47.020> this<00:04:47.770> will<00:04:48.010> activate<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.729> two<00:04:48.909> sticky

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
dust this will activate the two sticky

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.500 
dust this will activate the two sticky
pistons<00:04:49.750> on<00:04:49.930> each<00:04:50.229> side<00:04:51.000> then<00:04:52.000> we<00:04:52.180> just<00:04:52.360> have

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
pistons on each side then we just have

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.930 
pistons on each side then we just have
to<00:04:52.599> place<00:04:52.810> down<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.050> block<00:04:53.469> of<00:04:53.620> redstone<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.280> we

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
to place down a block of redstone and we

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.920 
to place down a block of redstone and we
go<00:04:55.120> down<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.659> both

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
go down to the both

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.040 
go down to the both
and<00:04:56.080> placed<00:04:56.320> through<00:04:56.530> my<00:04:56.650> blocks<00:04:56.889> with<00:04:57.639> some

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
and placed through my blocks with some

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.439 
and placed through my blocks with some
repeaters<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.470> some<00:04:59.979> redstone<00:05:00.220> dust<00:05:00.610> so<00:05:01.300> then

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
repeaters and some redstone dust so then

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:02.730 
repeaters and some redstone dust so then
we<00:05:01.539> go<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.930> outside<00:05:02.229> and<00:05:02.470> play<00:05:02.710> some

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
we go to the outside and play some

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.279 
we go to the outside and play some
written<00:05:03.190> test<00:05:03.400> place<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.270> block<00:05:04.509> on<00:05:04.630> top<00:05:04.900> to

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
written test place a block on top to

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.890 
written test place a block on top to
keep<00:05:05.440> them<00:05:05.680> from<00:05:05.830> interfering<00:05:06.490> and<00:05:07.449> we<00:05:07.660> just

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
keep them from interfering and we just

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.560 
keep them from interfering and we just
want<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.139> go<00:05:08.259> to<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.500> side<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:08.979> place<00:05:09.970> two

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
want to go to the side and place two

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.379 
want to go to the side and place two
blocks<00:05:10.750> along<00:05:11.169> like<00:05:11.350> this<00:05:11.530> also<00:05:12.280> two<00:05:13.180> more

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
blocks along like this also two more

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.560 
blocks along like this also two more
redstone<00:05:13.660> torches<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:14.910> that's<00:05:15.910> it<00:05:16.180> for<00:05:16.449> the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
redstone torches and that's it for the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.360 
redstone torches and that's it for the
orange<00:05:16.990> circuits<00:05:19.169> so<00:05:20.169> just<00:05:20.620> before<00:05:20.770> we<00:05:20.979> can

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
orange circuits so just before we can

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.240 
orange circuits so just before we can
put<00:05:21.610> in<00:05:21.759> awl<00:05:21.940> or<00:05:22.449> cobblestone<00:05:23.380> and<00:05:23.650> all<00:05:24.070> the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
put in awl or cobblestone and all the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.100 
put in awl or cobblestone and all the
other<00:05:24.370> kind<00:05:24.759> of<00:05:24.850> items<00:05:25.240> we<00:05:25.419> have<00:05:25.600> to<00:05:25.720> put<00:05:25.960> down

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
other kind of items we have to put down

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.430 
other kind of items we have to put down
to<00:05:26.919> minecarts<00:05:27.759> with<00:05:28.090> just<00:05:28.449> right<00:05:28.930> there<00:05:29.229> and

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
to minecarts with just right there and

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.040 
to minecarts with just right there and
also<00:05:30.039> we<00:05:30.280> need<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:30.820> place<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.330> minecart<00:05:31.780> with<00:05:32.020> a

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
also we need to place a minecart with a

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.320 
also we need to place a minecart with a
hopper<00:05:32.470> right<00:05:32.650> underneath<00:05:33.490> and<00:05:33.729> this<00:05:34.120> one

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
hopper right underneath and this one

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.080 
hopper right underneath and this one
will<00:05:34.690> collect<00:05:35.050> all<00:05:35.199> the<00:05:35.560> loot<00:05:35.740> coming<00:05:36.729> out<00:05:36.910> of

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
will collect all the loot coming out of

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.930 
will collect all the loot coming out of
the<00:05:37.210> furnaces<00:05:37.720> so<00:05:38.590> then<00:05:38.770> we<00:05:39.130> head<00:05:39.370> over<00:05:39.669> to<00:05:39.820> the

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
the furnaces so then we head over to the

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.779 
the furnaces so then we head over to the
other<00:05:40.060> side<00:05:40.380> down<00:05:41.380> to<00:05:41.440> or<00:05:41.860> hopper<00:05:42.340> clock<00:05:42.460> and

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
other side down to or hopper clock and

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.370 
other side down to or hopper clock and
we<00:05:42.970> have<00:05:43.120> to<00:05:43.270> put<00:05:43.509> in<00:05:44.430> seven<00:05:45.430> blocks<00:05:45.669> in<00:05:46.380> the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
we have to put in seven blocks in the

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.760 
we have to put in seven blocks in the
first<00:05:47.590> hopper<00:05:47.979> then<00:05:48.430> you<00:05:48.759> will<00:05:48.910> see<00:05:49.120> it<00:05:49.780> starts

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
first hopper then you will see it starts

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.939 
first hopper then you will see it starts
working<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.460> mine<00:05:51.610> carts<00:05:51.970> start<00:05:52.419> moving

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
working and the mine carts start moving

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.610 
working and the mine carts start moving
then<00:05:53.949> we<00:05:54.580> just<00:05:54.820> have<00:05:55.000> to<00:05:55.320> take<00:05:56.320> some

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
then we just have to take some

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.600 
then we just have to take some
cobblestone<00:05:57.990> not<00:05:58.990> bad<00:05:59.229> Rock<00:05:59.500> cobblestone<00:06:00.370> and

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
cobblestone not bad Rock cobblestone and

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.899 
cobblestone not bad Rock cobblestone and
also<00:06:01.479> we<00:06:01.840> have<00:06:01.990> to<00:06:02.139> take<00:06:02.169> some<00:06:02.680> coal<00:06:03.340> as<00:06:03.580> well

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
also we have to take some coal as well

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.659 
also we have to take some coal as well
so<00:06:04.570> then<00:06:04.750> we<00:06:05.020> put<00:06:05.050> down<00:06:05.470> or<00:06:05.949> cobblestone<00:06:06.550> in

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
so then we put down or cobblestone in

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.370 
so then we put down or cobblestone in
this<00:06:06.820> chest<00:06:07.150> and<00:06:07.360> or<00:06:07.539> fuel<00:06:07.870> in<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.020> other<00:06:08.169> one

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
this chest and or fuel in the other one

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.469 
this chest and or fuel in the other one
and<00:06:08.560> your<00:06:09.280> design<00:06:09.699> starts<00:06:10.150> working<00:06:11.639> so<00:06:12.639> this

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
and your design starts working so this

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.170 
and your design starts working so this
was<00:06:13.750> it<00:06:13.930> for<00:06:14.500> today's<00:06:14.800> tutorial<00:06:15.130> you<00:06:15.760> have
