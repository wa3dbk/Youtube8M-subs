00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.279
 It means that I can not deny the feeling of a little bit of material, but it is already around 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.120
 They fear that the play-by-play might also result in disappearance longer or a little of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.720
 Please 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.730

 Then I think I want to do a million-year-old baby 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.910
 At the end of the show, I made a sound and put it down. 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.489
 Nea- 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.109
 How is this 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.870
 I want to end with the introduction by now 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.870
 That's about it 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.950
 Dangerous mind to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:07.950
 I wonder if this should be done 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.430
 If I do it while doing behind the scenes, it will feel like a 1 million-year-old Babaa live-action play every month 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.040
 It looks scary and scary 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.020
 I will definitely race if I do it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.280
 I wonder if the week Well 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.470
 Even if it is a week, the pace is in time- 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.920

 It is sujiji 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.340
 Are a little broken over began about there the way of the play-by-play 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.060
 It is a game where you can think of such a miracle that iron 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 100 packed barlows 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.119
 I do vertical music on this little bit 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.900
 Or doing any stay specific for along 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.620
 Please try it by all means a couple who can be tempted to charm something there 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.040

 It's this is at all previously invisible 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.340
 It would be interesting if there was something else if there was a trick, though 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.599
 The delusion is great 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.599
 There is a system inspiration 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.850
 Is there no place to secure ocarina 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.120
 Absent 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.190
 Wonder was waiting for 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.240
 I already went to the room last time 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.930
 So that stretched use to not only show the grandma of the rear Jetta jfa say 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.930
 This grandma 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.380
 It is good to have a sense of company or something 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.280
 I have never done a black match 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.280

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.019
 Who 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.710
 Unexpected, such just like a dude Ya Te

 Round and round phosphorus Pan cycle limp crew 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.250

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.250
 This I was doing what now 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.260
 Below is certain 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.260
 right 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.110
 What would you do with this? 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.230
 Let's try high speed 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.739
 Yup 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.739
 Different 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.010
 You can do many things here too 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.500
 no good 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.500
 I was in the direction of 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.970
 I'm not stupid 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.800
 Is this or this or this? 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.880
 I 'm about to succeed now 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.120
 I've been head- to- head with temperature success cases and sensuality corners but maybe 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.590
 Say if you try 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.800
 Just try to 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.800
 Could have been something screen Sri Sri next to the grandmother 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.420
 You're doing this in various ways you 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.420
 so 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.059
 To softening unless attributed Nunn or the other it a little 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.059
 from now on 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.790
 Or Te e-money 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.680
 Hey, I have to feel that there is something 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.919
 Guidance 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.919
 It is only one time that the touch car failure is continuous one time only 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:50.220
 Just a moment ahead of time 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.129
 What 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.879
 long 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.879
 I wonder if I patch 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.540
 I see 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.480
 I'm Allais not not mean I which success or what the success of something 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.480
 in short 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.030
 Simply on the way in I I just had grabbed 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.530
 Likely to say that 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.780
 The appearance is 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.949
 I was sorry 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.480
 This is good 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.010
 The speed is fine 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.010
 The reason for rotation from burns or 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.169
 I passed through here- possible 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:07:01.710
 Since its around here is also in the fact that the Royal was run out of this story so far 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:09.110
 In or whether really to sprint 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:09.110
 Do not let deer feel galloping or dry but good-bye than please go to all means also watch
