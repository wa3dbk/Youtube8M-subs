00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
off you just take a 1 by 2 tile just

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.830 
off you just take a 1 by 2 tile just
place<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.660> just

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
place it on that and then you can just

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.600 
place it on that and then you can just
place<00:02:31.080> your<00:02:31.860> vise<00:02:32.100> parts<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:33.080> each<00:02:34.080> side<00:02:34.610> these

can be any color but blue goes well

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.360 
can be any color but blue goes well
since<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.490> contrasts<00:02:39.240> with<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.890> part<00:02:40.890> boxes

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
since it contrasts with the part boxes

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.500 
since it contrasts with the part boxes
which<00:02:41.670> are<00:02:41.790> built<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.810> second<00:02:43.170> half<00:02:44.510> now
