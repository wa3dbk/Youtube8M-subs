00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
that as our guides so this is gonna be

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.210 
that as our guides so this is gonna be
the<00:00:40.710> first<00:00:40.920> set<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.220> plots<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:44.100> gonna

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
the first set of plots so it's gonna

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.819 
the first set of plots so it's gonna
take<00:00:44.519> that<00:00:44.729> up<00:00:44.960> maybe<00:00:45.960> even<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.409> little<00:00:46.589> bit

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
take that up maybe even a little bit

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.660 
take that up maybe even a little bit
higher<00:00:48.170> just<00:00:49.170> about<00:00:49.409> there<00:00:51.979> in<00:00:52.979> section<00:00:53.489> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
higher just about there in section that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.229 
higher just about there in section that
off<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.860> then<00:00:55.860> section<00:00:56.339> off<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.549> bottom<00:00:57.059> half

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
off and then section off the bottom half

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.579 
off and then section off the bottom half
of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.540> hair<00:00:57.689> as<00:00:57.809> well<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.259> is<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
of the hair as well this is going to

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.009 
of the hair as well this is going to
make<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.799> by<00:00:58.920> second<00:00:59.339> flash<00:01:02.659> for<00:01:03.659> this<00:01:03.780> platter

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
make it by second flash for this platter

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.170 
make it by second flash for this platter
we're<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.680> waterfall<00:01:05.280> braids<00:01:05.610> which

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
we're going to do waterfall braids which

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.670 
we're going to do waterfall braids which
means<00:01:06.390> they'll<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.900> level<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.439> plat

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
means they'll have one level of plat

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.130 
means they'll have one level of plat
that<00:01:08.369> still<00:01:08.670> let<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> hair<00:01:09.270> fall<00:01:09.299> down<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.049> we

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that still let the hair fall down so we

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.810 
that still let the hair fall down so we
can<00:01:10.259> join<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.619> into<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> second<00:01:11.460> level<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
can join that into the second level of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
can join that into the second level of
class<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> lot<00:01:13.020> easier<00:01:13.290> than<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
class so it's a lot easier than it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.399 
class so it's a lot easier than it
sounds<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.579> looks<00:01:14.759> really<00:01:15.000> cool

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
sounds and it really looks really cool

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.899 
sounds and it really looks really cool
start<00:01:16.409> off<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:16.920> platting<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.430> normal

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
start off as if your platting is normal

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.270 
start off as if your platting is normal
it's<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.329> separating<00:01:19.140> first<00:01:19.860> bit<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.159> hair

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it's just separating first bit of hair

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.480 
it's just separating first bit of hair
into<00:01:20.400> three<00:01:20.610> pieces<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.350> work<00:01:22.590> towards

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
into three pieces and then work towards

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.459 
into three pieces and then work towards
the<00:01:23.670> back<00:01:25.039> but<00:01:26.039> now<00:01:26.249> instead<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.479> pulling<00:01:28.170> this

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
the back but now instead of pulling this

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.669 
the back but now instead of pulling this
bit<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.920> we're<00:01:29.340> gonna<00:01:29.429> drop<00:01:29.789> this<00:01:29.969> and<00:01:30.560> pick<00:01:31.560> up
