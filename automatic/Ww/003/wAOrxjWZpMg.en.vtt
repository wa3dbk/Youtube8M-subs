then receiving such a wonderful room and

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.770 
then receiving such a wonderful room and
before<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.579> features<00:00:39.090> i<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.570> i

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
before we go to the features i think i

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.190 
before we go to the features i think i
should<00:00:40.770> let<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.420> view<00:00:42.780> speak<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.469> itself

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
should let the view speak for itself

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.479 
should let the view speak for itself
because<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.680> only<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
because this is not only one of the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.240 
because this is not only one of the
large<00:00:47.760> suites<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.840> park<00:00:49.110> hyatt<00:00:49.440> would<00:00:50.039> just

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
large suites in a park hyatt would just

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.040 
large suites in a park hyatt would just
standard<00:00:51.120> park<00:00:51.420> suite<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.920> basically<00:00:54.050> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
standard park suite this is basically so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.830 
standard park suite this is basically so
much<00:00:55.230> space<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.890> can't<00:00:56.219> even<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.879> utilize

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
much space you can't even like utilize

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.009 
much space you can't even like utilize
it<00:00:58.079> by<00:00:58.230> yourself<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.010> look<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:03.019> think

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it by yourself but look at this I think

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.760 
it by yourself but look at this I think
there<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.229> nothing<00:01:04.559> else<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.390> add<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.900> this

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
there is nothing else to add to this

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.960
