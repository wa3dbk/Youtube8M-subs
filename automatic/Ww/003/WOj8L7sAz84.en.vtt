 to see what is once is the first 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.829
 remark because this video we're going 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.620
 to do since we have received by many 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.390
 comments many questions about what 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.460
 is one of this watching our videos and 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.280
 so good first to say it's a 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.839
 free tournament payment environment because 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.250
 many channel users are not 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.350
 asking that if you have to pay that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.390
 you have to pay you do not have to pay it is a 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.940
 game is a tournament to entertain you 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.730
 and to train a little and good to see 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.820
 one says that it is one 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.590
 means that it is an abbreviation of the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.080
 English of one day card that in Spanish 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.670
 means a day's cup that good as 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.250
 well it says the name is a tournament that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.730
 begins and ends the same day 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.690
 simply currently it is a 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.820
 competition that is getting very 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.580
 fashion since you do not pull so much of rne 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.200
 that a lot of work is done to train 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.780
 to see the aspirations of the team 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.140
 feelings and put a little on your 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.700
 site when it comes to competing more official 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.260
 to see what it consists of in what 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.780
 it consists then is a tournament of 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.060
 direct elimination that if you lose a 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.450
 challenge that is eliminated although to see there is 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.369
 two types of bracket one is a bracket 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.040
 simple that is a direct elimination 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.780
 to insist you are eliminated after 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.050
 and also when there are many plans do 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.180
 a double bracket consisting of two 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.450
 brackets like I told you that is the win 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.550
 the bracket is the main branch where yes 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.709
 You are winning as you progress rounds 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.130
 until you reach the final after 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.380
 and you lose the the bracket that is 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.780
 for all the clans eliminated from the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.330
 winner bracket then it is another bracket 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.010
 different where they have the opportunity if 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.230
 you reach the final and want to 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.900
 reengage with the winner bracket of 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.870
 up and to play the final and wins 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.110
 what would be the cup 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.489
 and good for you and explain a little 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.980
 where to find it from spanish cesc 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.860
 European forms a little in situation 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.840
 as good at sometimes also 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.209
 it can depends on the extent of 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.430
 normally those of europe that are the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.909
 that exposes webs in eurosport 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.170
 I started three and certain and other pages 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:59.099
 of different clubs are played in xbox and 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.930
 good the sometimes European ones that usually 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.579
 start at 7 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.890
 because since we have different 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.000
 schedules that 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.610
 england france all these countries of 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.230
 Europe as a start time 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:18.709
 late that in Spain and well I have to 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.320
 add that in europe those that normally 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.060
 have usually have more level since 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.400
 most of the great teams of 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.510
 Europe compete in this venue 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.100
 Europe 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.650
 and well then I started 3 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.260
 in Spain we have a page that 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.870
 flame competitive space in which it is 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.330
 the few Spanish that organize one 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.360
 day caps and good is not bad and 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.760
 they usually make different draws so much 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.450
 double elimination as elimination 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.560
 simple and good, not much more than 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.750
 add about the times 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.030
 nothing you can find most of the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.660
 now they impose sports and the rest of 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.599
 Spain are competitive space and good 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.880
 that they won once when you compete 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.250
 I'll appreciate what you usually earn a lot 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.970
 experience since you compete against 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.239
 the big clans big clubs and you 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.419
 you train mostly and well you know 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.020
 what aspirations can you have in both 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.250
 team like 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.770
 in Spain in Europe 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.830
 and good if the desire not win anything but 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.600
 You can earn a lot of respect and things from 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.940
 those 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.130
 so these two kids I leave with 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.470
 the last 30 seconds of video I hope 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.450
 that you enjoy it, forget to give us 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.870
 like and favorites and greetings to all and 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.870
 until next time
