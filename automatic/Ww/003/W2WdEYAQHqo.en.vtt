right with Kansas hydrographics we are
doing<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.030> test<00:00:03.330> today<00:00:03.620> on<00:00:04.620> our<00:00:05.190> black<00:00:05.490> carbon

hard time with it wrapping around the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.080 
hard time with it wrapping around the
backside<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.490> we're<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.670> going<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> do<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
test today the tank is 90 degrees and we

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.880 
test today the tank is 90 degrees and we
are<00:00:32.460> using<00:00:32.940> typical<00:00:33.739> 60<00:00:34.739> second<00:00:35.219> sub<00:00:35.579> time

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
are using typical 60 second sub time

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.690 
are using typical 60 second sub time
sticky<00:00:37.890> side<00:00:38.129> down<00:00:38.160> make<00:00:38.879> sure<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:40.489> that<00:00:41.489> is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
sticky side down make sure that that is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.139 
sticky side down make sure that that is
correct<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.420> film

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
correct in your film

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.430

you'll<00:00:45.149> never<00:00:45.300> get<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> film<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.020> work<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
you'll never get a film to work if you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.840 
you'll never get a film to work if you
put<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> wrong<00:00:47.160> way

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.140 

little<00:00:51.150> cumin<00:00:51.540> today<00:00:52.700> so<00:00:53.700> we're<00:00:53.880> getting<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
little cumin today so we're getting a

coded a hard hat in a paint that we've

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.450 
coded a hard hat in a paint that we've
just<00:01:11.700> made<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.930> our<00:01:13.440> silver<00:01:13.830> base<00:01:14.009> coat<00:01:14.310> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
just made out of our silver base coat in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:24.750 
just made out of our silver base coat in
black<00:01:19.009> tons<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.250> bubble<00:01:20.580> okay

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.000

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
alright there's the black carbon fiber

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.360 
alright there's the black carbon fiber
you<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:35.450> see<00:02:35.660> we<00:02:35.870> didn't<00:02:36.230> we<00:02:36.740> didn't<00:02:36.950> void<00:02:37.160> out

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
you can see we didn't we didn't void out

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.330 
you can see we didn't we didn't void out
anywhere<00:02:37.790> back<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.210> here

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
but that was the black carbon fiber test

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.040 
but that was the black carbon fiber test
I<00:03:02.220> hope<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.850> helps<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.240> out<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.690> might<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:04.020> a
