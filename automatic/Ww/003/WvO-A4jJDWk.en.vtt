 I'm here inviting you to participate 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.800
 in this collective construction is that we 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.400
 Let's start this project with a house. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.030
 and we will use a technique 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.090
 who saw construction called emperor and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.410
 we need cooperation we need 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.810

 joao paulo ii chapter of the mandala has 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.810
 this mission this mission of disseminating 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.670
 new knowledge of people showing 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.680
 that it is impossible to live 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.800
 to live differently not only 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.870
 sustainable but regenerative 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.870
 that is, we can use the resources 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.260
 that nature gives us will always dedicate 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.140
 may then return back to a 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.390
 earth that she gave us very serious 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.610
 so this is the mission of ifal you 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.950
 I want to send it there and we'll start 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.290
 construction of the mud house and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.680
 We hope everyone can laugh. 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.380
 it is the first step in 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.340
 that the city ​​can be realized 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.500
 in that sense is and would be very much 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.260
 interesting to see this dream come true 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.439
 not only for me not only for them but 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.850
 sure for you eventually 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.159
 To feel that in Sao Paulo it is no longer 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.530
 that he can and must seek some 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.200
 something different a place to be 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.400
 reconnect and learn is now the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.360
 opportunity 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.819
 and the donation of 10 15 20 reais it ends 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.439
 being very derisory for everything from close up 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.349
 all the possibilities of knowledge 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.840
 that city ​​can lift you shop 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.730
 responsible material issues 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.959
 like this 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.599
 the land is to keep the most abundant is 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:37.879
 very little used under conditions 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:40.180
 a speed then you have to see the 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.450
 their potentialities 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.140
 the technology in this will be the basis of 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.489
 everything is something that makes some sense 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.980
 law is there today it is very common 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.170
 people to hire a manpower. 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.519
 specialized to make a construction 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.510
 conventional is then if you spend movement 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.819
 if you spend a lot of sand and buy a lot 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.620
 many more external materials 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.799
 often material it comes from a 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.799
 some distance it spends a lot of time 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.879
 very combustible energy to build 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.579
 a house 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.769
 then it is the proposal to build with a 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.959
 technique saw construction is a 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.439
 living construction a building that 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.650
 you breathe then a more 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:33.010
 cleaner and more sustainable 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.840
 minimize facts and construction 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:41.620
 conventional generates I continue and that 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.799
 He met Bamboo and sealed the family will 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.040
 align and imply knowledge of 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:52.060
 wood hardwood house because I 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.799
 I want to pay tribute to him and that I 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:00.180
 offer decoration that has gone to do 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.400
 do a job in the capital service 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.260
 in communion with friends because I 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:13.720
 I invite the interested persons to 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:16.209
 participate with child participate with us 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.880

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.890
 many good things and their heads 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:28.900
