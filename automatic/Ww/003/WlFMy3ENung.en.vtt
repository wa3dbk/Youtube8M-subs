00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.480
 and shrimp tails 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.970
 that we have always left to give the last stitch 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.939
 because it will not be much more beautiful 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.880
 we have a bottle of cava 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.330
 i a sauce from the uterus that we made 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.280
 as if it were one of san the perennial of adding milk we add fish broth 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.780
 and potatoes lizana orias bayly we have caught throwing the train 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.790

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.940
 we roll and puncture with a toothpick so that it does not escape 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.510
 we had bouquets it has sounded previously we have thrown salt we passed through flour 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.940
 and we take it to the frying pan 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.530
 we will put a good oil 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 of extra virgin olive 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.020

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.020
 once they are ready we will preserve them 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.550
 in another clean pan and we measured the cava we were going to let it reduce so the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.900
 lic alcohol 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.780
 it will evaporate 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.040
 and we add that we incorporate that lute sauce 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.350
 I repeat we have done it with the sofrito flour and we have incorporated the broth of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.260

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:42.299
 as we have already cooked the potatoes and the carrots live simply 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.769

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.429
 so that they take a little temperature 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:54.729
 and with that 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.729
