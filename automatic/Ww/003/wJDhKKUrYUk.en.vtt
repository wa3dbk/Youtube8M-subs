00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:13.599
 Hi, I'm Daisy and welcome to my channel 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.849
 of col·legis and today I 'm going to talk 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:21.099
 about salt see in this photo and 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.609
 Well I'm going to translate it because it's 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.609
 in French 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:39.920
 have seen that it says iodized salt and with 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.680
 fluorine as it turns out that when they remove the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.200
 salt from the sea takes her to a process 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.540
 quite aggressive to deprove the 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.040
 all its nutrients because the 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.160
 food manufacturers by adding the 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.400
 pure sodium because it is much easier for 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.180
 process it when we use sea salt or 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.699
 be the salt so to speak integral 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.390
 is a salt that has trace elements 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.630
 has minerals have iodine and these things 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.090
 They are very good for our body 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.880
 instead the processed salt that 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.759
 we consume in addition to the problem that 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.940
 they have to add the fluoride that has 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.170
 investigated that fluorine gives a series of 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.300
 health problems 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.850
 in the long run when we consume it a lot 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.860
 neither the problem is fluorine because 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.220
 yes 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.150
 the body needs to ingest fluoride to 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.770
 keep your bones for many things in 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.980
 our body so that they work 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.640
 well what happens is that when I 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.830
 we ingest everything in the water in the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.800
 mouthwash in toothpaste 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.940
 in salt and in other products that neither 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.630
 we even know that we are 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.460
 ingesting an excess comes to be harmful 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.880
 It can cause even problems 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.470
 neurological so nowadays 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.100
 we must take care of our 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.009
 feeding even though it's pretty 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.780
 expensive and sometimes in many countries do not 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.180
 You can find good products 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.489
 food, as far as possible 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.930
 I recommend that they do it because if 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.930
 your 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.130
 They feed well because they will not have 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.410
 to spend neither medical medicines 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.140
 and they are going to feel good they are going to feel 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.930
 happy strong with wishes to do 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.920
 many things now I want to show you the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.220
 difference between the salt they sell us 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.230
 commonly it's so cheap and the salt 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.920
 marine salt 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.050
 without any process 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.300
 so you can see what the 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.030
 difference even in color 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.000
 well I think I always show you 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.310
 with the strangest things that can 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.250
 you imagine had shown them 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.470
 before this is the coarse salt salt that I 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.810
 he used to put it in the washing machine 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.110
 for cleaning things but not for 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:16.700
 consume it even for 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.980
 nothing that is food I use salt 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.730
 white they sell cheap in the 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.580
 supermarket this is called flower of 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.880
 salt see the difference of colors 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.460
 this one has a darker color this is 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.520
 the salt that after they put when 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.220
 they put the water in the salinas to dry 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.220
 sea ​​to get the salt this is the salt that 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.310
 it is totally on the surface this 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.030
 it is the salt of the purest ones that exist 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.010
 level of sea salt and we have the salt 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.110
 gray that is that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.349
 this is more darkness because it's the one 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.210
 it is at the bottom this has another kind of 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:04.950
 minerals that is also very good 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.080
 and I have the gray salt is fine also 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.940
 coarse salt I use a lot of coarse salt to 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.490
 cook and this is where I put in the 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:17.739
 salt shaker can see a difference of 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:22.240
 color between the salt gray the flower of salt and 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.370
 the cheap salt of the supermarket also 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.889
 there are other types of salts what am I 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:32.740
 knowing and that I'm buying 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:35.410
 look at this this does not look like salt this is 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.710
 what could you believe is some 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.710
 seasoning 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.449
 or red clay as you see this is 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.659
 red salt 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.779
 from hawaii this is a salt that actually 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:55.409
 is mixed with red clay because 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:05:01.229
 when the area of Hawaii is an area 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:05.309
 volcanic when he is what is called the 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:08.789
 the lava of the volcanoes and all this goes down 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:10.020
 drags many minerals including the 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.610
 clay 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.839
 there is also one called black salt 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.150
 of hawaii and coal disappears I have not 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:20.819
 bought yet because these jars 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.389
 they are very expensive this has cost me nine 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:27.689
 euros and the black salt is worth twelve euros 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:31.379
 but with this I do not need to buy 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:35.430
 vitamins I do not need to buy anything else 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:37.639
 because here is giving me magnesium 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.650
 and other minerals my body needs 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:45.419
 and they are of natural origin 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:48.570
 is for example says natural sea salt 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.580
 and purified clay because the salt 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.669
 has absorbed all the clay and the 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.820
 clay also has many minerals and 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.160
 trace elements that when they are natural 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.740
 they are more easily absorbed by the 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.960
 body 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:08.240
 and we also have the pink salt of 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.009
 himalayas as you can see the granites 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.300
 they are pink 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:16.460
 I always try to buy things like that 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.199
 thick I do not like things very much 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.259
 refined but there is the grandfather for 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:24.470
 also throw this comes from my salero 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.669
 the mountains of the caves this is not 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:31.300
 find in the sea but they are 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:31.300
 salt sediments that are in mines 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.100
 in the himalayas area this salt is very 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.320
 pure also because it is not contaminated 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.570
 by like in the sea that good in certain 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.180
 way yes there is some contamination with 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:50.140
 all the products that we throw to the sea 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:53.050
 then this salt is also very good and 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:56.950
 these are the salts that I use to 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.710
 my food and if you want more 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:03.880
 detailed information about the process 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:07.260
 so harmful and so aggressive that they give 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:11.040
 the salt write me 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.560
 to this address up here and I'm going to 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.800
 send a document insert document 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:21.020
 for the documents of the salt and with pleasure 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.020
 I sent them to your email
