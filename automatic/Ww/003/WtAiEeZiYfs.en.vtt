are familiar with it as far as Google

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
are familiar with it as far as Google
using<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.580> photosphere<00:00:30.269> option<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.779> your

camera and then when you post a Google+

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.610 
camera and then when you post a Google+
you<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.270> click<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> picture<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.530> then

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
you can see the whole surrounding area

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.590 
you can see the whole surrounding area
well<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.200> 360<00:00:37.590> imagery<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> nutshell

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
well that's 360 imagery in a nutshell

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.970 
well that's 360 imagery in a nutshell
basically<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.690> take<00:00:39.870> several<00:00:40.200> pictures<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
basically you take several pictures and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
basically you take several pictures and
stitch<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.520> together<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.969> then<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.840> makes

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
stitch them together and then it makes

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.680 
stitch them together and then it makes
one<00:00:43.379> large<00:00:43.890> picture<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:45.090> technology's<00:00:45.570> been

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
one large picture this technology's been

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.360 
one large picture this technology's been
around<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.140> many<00:00:46.320> years<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:46.980> pretty<00:00:47.219> much

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
around for many years and it pretty much

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.479 
around for many years and it pretty much
stays<00:00:47.670> stagnant<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.570> whole<00:00:48.840> time<00:00:49.489> until

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
stays stagnant this whole time until

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
stays stagnant this whole time until
recently<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.719> how<00:00:51.840> Google

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
recently now you all know how Google

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.660 
recently now you all know how Google
Maps<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> street<00:00:53.250> view<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
Maps when you go to a street view you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.310 
Maps when you go to a street view you
can<00:00:53.850> actually<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> road<00:00:54.719> you're<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:54.960> you

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
can actually see the road you're on you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
can actually see the road you're on you
can<00:00:55.469> spin<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> camera<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.309> way<00:00:56.399> around

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
can spin the camera all the way around

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.150 
can spin the camera all the way around
in<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> full<00:00:57.329> 360<00:00:57.989> view<00:00:58.230> well<00:00:58.859> that's<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.100> I'm

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
in a full 360 view well that's what I'm

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
in a full 360 view well that's what I'm
talking<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.520> today<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.629> actually<00:01:00.809> make

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
talking about today they actually make

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.229 
talking about today they actually make
consumer<00:01:01.800> products<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> same

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
consumer products that can do the same

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.109 
consumer products that can do the same
thing<00:01:03.660> now<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:04.920> Google<00:01:05.250> let's<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:05.909> back

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
thing now just like Google let's go back

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.820 
thing now just like Google let's go back
to<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> beginning<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.290> landed

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
to the beginning and see how we landed

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.340 
to the beginning and see how we landed
here<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.700> very<00:01:08.970> first<00:01:09.140> interpretation<00:01:10.140> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
here the very first interpretation of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.609 
here the very first interpretation of
that<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> 1700s<00:01:13.110> these

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that was actually in the 1700s these

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.289 
that was actually in the 1700s these
were<00:01:13.740> actually<00:01:14.040> done<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.490> paintings<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
actually a 2d plane now in the 1800s
photographers<00:01:51.659> would<00:01:51.840> pretty<00:01:52.079> much<00:01:52.259> do<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
photographers would pretty much do the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.929 
photographers would pretty much do the
same<00:01:52.530> thing<00:01:52.979> except<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.460> they<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:53.880> at

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
same thing except for they actually at

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.730 
same thing except for they actually at
the<00:01:54.000> cameras<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.540> they'll<00:01:55.020> take<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> picture

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the cameras now they'll take a picture

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
the cameras now they'll take a picture
move<00:01:56.310> over<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> little<00:01:56.759> bit<00:01:56.909> take<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> picture

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
move over a little bit take a picture

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.660 
move over a little bit take a picture
move<00:01:57.990> over<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.799> bit<00:01:58.920> take<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> picture

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
move over a little bit take a picture

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.130 
move over a little bit take a picture
and<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.210> they'll<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.630> get<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
and then they'll actually get the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080 
and then they'll actually get the
pictures<00:02:01.469> developed<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:02.520> stitch<00:02:02.850> them

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
pictures developed and then stitch them

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.209 
pictures developed and then stitch them
together<00:02:03.320> manually<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:04.890> once<00:02:05.100> again

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
together manually and then once again

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.529 
together manually and then once again
you<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.479> somewhat<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.200> 360<00:02:07.890> view

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
you have you know somewhat of a 360 view

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.330 
you have you know somewhat of a 360 view
actually<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.690> front<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:11.039> one

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
actually in front of you and in just one

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.550 
actually in front of you and in just one
picture<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.660> know<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.840> can<00:02:13.080> sort<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.410> see

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
picture so you know you can sort of see

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.880 
picture so you know you can sort of see
the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.560 
the
people<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:14.760> wanted<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.120> figure<00:02:15.300> out<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.510> way

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
people really wanted to figure out a way

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.140 
people really wanted to figure out a way
to<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.500> know<00:02:16.620> put<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> person<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.910> scene

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
to you know put a person in the scene

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.640 
to you know put a person in the scene
basically<00:02:18.600> have<00:02:18.780> someone<00:02:19.110> stand<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.470> your

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
basically have someone stand in your

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.580 
basically have someone stand in your
shoes<00:02:19.980> at<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.430> time<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.570> place<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.140> about<00:02:22.350> 50

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
shoes at that time in place in about 50

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.260 
shoes at that time in place in about 50
years<00:02:22.710> later<00:02:22.830> there<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.640> new<00:02:23.820> technology

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
years later there was a new technology

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.990 
years later there was a new technology
they<00:02:24.870> use<00:02:25.020> panoramic<00:02:25.740> cameras<00:02:26.220> using<00:02:26.460> curved

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
they use panoramic cameras using curved

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.900 
they use panoramic cameras using curved
film<00:02:27.510> holders<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.590> employ<00:02:28.890> clockwork<00:02:29.490> drives

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
film holders to employ clockwork drives

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.140 
film holders to employ clockwork drives
to<00:02:30.180> scan<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> line<00:02:30.960> image<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.470> an<00:02:31.590> arc<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.220> this

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
to scan a line image in an arc and this

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.460 
to scan a line image in an arc and this
actually<00:02:33.510> created<00:02:33.810> an<00:02:33.900> image<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.290> was<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
actually created an image that was a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.960 
actually created an image that was a
hundred<00:02:34.740> eighty<00:02:35.040> degrees<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.700> was<00:02:35.880> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
hundred eighty degrees and this was the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.940 
hundred eighty degrees and this was the
very<00:02:36.150> first<00:02:36.450> time<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.780> history<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.770> was

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
very first time in history that this was

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.100 
very first time in history that this was
an<00:02:38.160> automatic<00:02:38.550> process<00:02:38.850> now<00:02:39.690> at<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.930> know<00:02:40.020> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
an automatic process now at you know the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.590 
an automatic process now at you know the
history<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.950> where<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.209> what

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
history of it where is it going what

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.510 
history of it where is it going what
we're<00:02:42.720> starting<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.959> see<00:02:43.050> 360<00:02:43.440> cameras<00:02:44.250> hit

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
we're starting to see 360 cameras hit

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.910 
we're starting to see 360 cameras hit
the<00:02:44.670> scene<00:02:44.940> now<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.180> actually<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:46.650> I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
the scene now and actually I have one I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.520 
the scene now and actually I have one I
have<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.190> V<00:02:47.340> 360<00:02:48.000> camera<00:02:48.360> now<00:02:48.810> these<00:02:48.990> cameras

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
have the V 360 camera now these cameras

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.440 
have the V 360 camera now these cameras
actually<00:02:49.890> use<00:02:50.520> different<00:02:51.000> types<00:02:51.270> of

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
actually use different types of

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.740 
actually use different types of
technology<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.320> get<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.920> image<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.940> video

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
technology to get you a image and video

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.080 
technology to get you a image and video
so<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.440> 360<00:02:55.920> camera<00:02:56.160> what<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.550> does<00:02:56.760> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
so the 360 camera what it does it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.720 
so the 360 camera what it does it
actually<00:02:57.120> has<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.930> lens<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:59.160> uses<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.520> series

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
actually has a lens and it uses a series

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.090 
actually has a lens and it uses a series
of<00:03:00.000> mirrors<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.540> bounce<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.989> image<00:03:01.260> off<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.739> I

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
of mirrors to bounce the image off and I

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.880 
of mirrors to bounce the image off and I
can<00:03:02.310> actually<00:03:02.489> shoot<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.970> video<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.600> then<00:03:04.290> move

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
can actually shoot a video and then move

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.160 
can actually shoot a video and then move
the<00:03:05.100> camera<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.670> post<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.239> actually<00:03:06.690> show<00:03:06.959> a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
the camera and post to actually show a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.050 
the camera and post to actually show a
different<00:03:07.680> part<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.670> video<00:03:08.940> I'm

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
different part of the video I'm

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.000 
different part of the video I'm
recording<00:03:09.570> now<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.840> V<00:03:10.020> 360<00:03:10.560> isn't<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.830> only

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
recording now the V 360 isn't the only

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.560 
recording now the V 360 isn't the only
camera<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.489> block<00:03:11.700> there<00:03:11.970> are<00:03:12.120> actually

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
camera on the block there are actually

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.050 
camera on the block there are actually
360<00:03:13.200> flies<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.860> bubble<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.610> lot<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.910> other

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
360 flies and bubble and a lot of other

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.820 
360 flies and bubble and a lot of other
companies<00:03:15.600> out<00:03:15.750> there<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.959> are<00:03:16.080> making<00:03:16.290> 360

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
companies out there that are making 360

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.830 
companies out there that are making 360
cameras<00:03:17.220> now<00:03:17.550> each<00:03:17.790> camera<00:03:18.150> has<00:03:18.269> its<00:03:18.690> own

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
cameras now each camera has its own

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.170 
cameras now each camera has its own
downfall<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.560> example<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.160> V<00:03:20.310> 360<00:03:20.820> camera

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
downfall for example the V 360 camera

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.970 
downfall for example the V 360 camera
well<00:03:21.630> if<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.780> send<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.080> video<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.739> it

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
well if I send this video to you it

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.289 
well if I send this video to you it
you're<00:03:23.370> gonna<00:03:23.459> have<00:03:23.549> two<00:03:23.760> options<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
you're gonna have two options for the

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.000 
you're gonna have two options for the
video<00:03:24.480> you're<00:03:24.930> gonna<00:03:25.019> have<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.350> video<00:03:25.620> in

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
video you're gonna have the video in

technology is pretty new so my question
to<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.550> are<00:04:38.759> you<00:04:38.849> gonna<00:04:38.969> get<00:04:39.150> on<00:04:39.210> the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
to you are you gonna get on the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.029 
to you are you gonna get on the
