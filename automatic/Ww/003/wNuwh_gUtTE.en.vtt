happens is you turn the crank and that
causes<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.570> booth<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.109> kick<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.590> bucket<00:00:23.100> which

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
causes this booth to kick a bucket which

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400 
causes this booth to kick a bucket which
has<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> marble<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.119> right<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.840> then<00:00:25.289> the

which lands on the diving play flips a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.010 
which lands on the diving play flips a
diver<00:00:35.250> into<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> bucket<00:00:36.000> causes<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> bucket

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
diver into the bucket causes the bucket

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.500

to<00:00:37.050> fall<00:00:37.380> down<00:00:37.410> onto<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> mouse<00:00:38.390> what<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.480> you

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
to fall down onto the mouse what do you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.160 
to fall down onto the mouse what do you
think<00:00:40.309> right<00:00:41.309> well<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.629> sounds<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
think right well it just it sounds a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.680 
think right well it just it sounds a
little<00:00:43.590> bit<00:00:43.649> complicated<00:00:44.450> well<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.600> don't

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
little bit complicated well I don't

suppose<00:00:46.020> you've<00:00:46.379> got<00:00:46.410> any<00:00:46.559> better<00:00:46.829> ideas

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
suppose you've got any better ideas

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.490 
suppose you've got any better ideas
actually<00:00:48.860> I've<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.899> well<00:00:51.899> does<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.289> work

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
actually I've this well does that work

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.430

which lures are the mouse then when it
gets<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> cheese<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.680> triggers<00:00:59.280> this

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
gets to the cheese it triggers this
