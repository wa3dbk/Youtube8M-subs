00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
this adjustable feature I can even use

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.110 
this adjustable feature I can even use
it<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:29.970> instance<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:31.170> tune<00:00:32.070> my<00:00:32.250> fiddle<00:00:32.640> yes

and just put that on the fiddle bridge
and<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:36.000> there

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and it's right there

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.819 
and it's right there
mm-hmm<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.140> because<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.739> adjustability

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
mm-hmm and because of the adjustability

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.979 
mm-hmm and because of the adjustability
of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.670> sideways<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.840> back<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.230> forth<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.989> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
of the sideways or back and forth so the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.020

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
for me seem to maybe work better on

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.270 
for me seem to maybe work better on
guitars<00:00:56.820> than<00:00:57.239> anything<00:00:57.480> else<00:00:57.829> whereas<00:00:58.829> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and trying to learn where you compensate

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.579 
and trying to learn where you compensate
for<00:01:03.660> where<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.049> at

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
