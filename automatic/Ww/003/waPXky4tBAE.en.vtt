00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
other side front of the hair to the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.210 
other side front of the hair to the
other<00:01:51.390> side<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> makes<00:01:52.140> any<00:01:52.350> sense<00:01:52.679> so

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
other side if it makes any sense so

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.859 
other side if it makes any sense so
basically<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:53.880> pulling<00:01:54.299> sections

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
basically you're just pulling sections

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.440 
basically you're just pulling sections
from<00:01:55.049> each<00:01:55.319> side<00:01:55.709> to<00:01:56.039> make<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.940> fishtail

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
from each side to make the fishtail

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.529 
from each side to make the fishtail
braid<00:01:57.959> and<00:01:58.350> obviously<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.459> cannot<00:01:59.880> fishtail

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
braid and obviously I cannot fishtail

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.630 
braid and obviously I cannot fishtail
very<00:02:00.869> well<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.500> once<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.340> hang<00:02:02.369> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
very well but once you get the hang of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.040 
very well but once you get the hang of
it<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.909> really<00:02:03.119> easy

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.830 

and<00:02:07.680> once<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> bottom<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.540> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and once I get to the bottom of the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.720 
and once I get to the bottom of the
fishtail<00:02:10.320> I'm<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.740> to<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.040> securing<00:02:11.610> it

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
middle it's like a French braid but

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.430 
middle it's like a French braid but
you're<00:04:17.310> going<00:04:17.430> under<00:04:18.150> instead<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.750> over<00:04:19.200> and
