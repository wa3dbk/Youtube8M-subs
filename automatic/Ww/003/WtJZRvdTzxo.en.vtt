and I try to line it up right with that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.090 
and I try to line it up right with that
loop<00:01:02.010> there<00:01:03.769> take<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.979> glue<00:01:05.129> gun<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> just

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
loop there take your glue gun and just

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850 
loop there take your glue gun and just
put<00:01:08.369> glue<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> down<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> clip

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
put glue all up and down to the clip

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.539 
put glue all up and down to the clip
here<00:01:11.220> including<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.850> inside<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.540> ribbon

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
here including on inside of that ribbon

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.080 
here including on inside of that ribbon
and<00:01:14.549> then<00:01:14.760> fold<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.450> over<00:01:19.430> then<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and then fold it over then I like to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.690 
and then fold it over then I like to
pinch<00:01:21.390> my<00:01:21.840> ends<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.430> let<00:01:23.610> them

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
pinch my ends in and not just let them

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.749 
pinch my ends in and not just let them
open<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.450> looks<00:01:24.600> neater<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.170> way<00:01:25.759> so

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
open I think it looks neater that way so

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.609 
open I think it looks neater that way so
then<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.000> take<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> put<00:01:27.750> glue<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.560> over

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
pinch it in there and fold it right over

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.219 
pinch it in there and fold it right over

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.090 
and then you have a nice neat blind

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.240 
and then for the back this part will be
glued<00:02:22.080> because<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:22.620> where<00:02:22.800> your<00:02:22.920> finger

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
glued because that's where your finger

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.460 
glued because that's where your finger
was<00:02:23.400> holding<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> clip<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:25.020> you'll<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.260> want

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
was holding the clip so you'll just want

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.260 
was holding the clip so you'll just want
to<00:02:25.500> take<00:02:25.650> your<00:02:25.830> glue<00:02:26.070> gun<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.820> get<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> little

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
to take your glue gun and get a little

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.750 
to take your glue gun and get a little
bit<00:02:27.360> under<00:02:27.600> there<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.920> smooth<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.520> over

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
bit under there and smooth that over

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.810 
bit under there and smooth that over
there<00:02:33.120> too

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
there too

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.840 
there too
then<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> nice<00:02:36.470> line<00:02:37.470> snap<00:02:37.800> clip<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
then you have a nice line snap clip and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.450 
then you have a nice line snap clip and
that's<00:02:39.000> all<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.300> takes
