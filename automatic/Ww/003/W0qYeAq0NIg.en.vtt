00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
operators certain machines and that and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.569 
operators certain machines and that and
we've<00:01:46.259> sort<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> ran<00:01:46.770> three<00:01:47.040> months<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.399> had

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
we've sort of ran three months and had

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.859 
we've sort of ran three months and had
look<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.119> started<00:01:48.509> taking<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
look at then we started taking the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
look at then we started taking the
results<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> operators<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:50.820> we

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
results out to the operators I think we

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.730 
results out to the operators I think we
reduced<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> older<00:01:51.689> times<00:01:51.869> down<00:01:52.350> by<00:01:52.500> 10%

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
reduced all the older times down by 10%

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.069 
reduced all the older times down by 10%
to<00:01:53.280> operate<00:01:53.610> education<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.450> by<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to operate education and by that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.200 
to operate education and by that
education<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.520> know<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> said<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:56.909> reduced

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
education you know I said we reduced

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.690 
education you know I said we reduced
them<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.540> no<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.829> 9.3<00:01:59.340> percent<00:01:59.369> on

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
them but no I think it's 9.3 percent on

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.490 
them but no I think it's 9.3 percent on
the<00:01:59.790> loaders<00:02:00.119> which<00:02:00.750> were<00:02:00.899> below<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.170> state

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the loaders which were below the state

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.160 
the loaders which were below the state
average<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:02.009> idle<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.689> grade<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.049> up

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
average of idle and and the grade is up

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.760 
average of idle and and the grade is up
to<00:02:04.259> 20<00:02:04.439> percent<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.729> that's<00:02:05.969> significant

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
to 20 percent so that's significant

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.290 
to 20 percent so that's significant
we're<00:02:07.770> ensuring<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.160> everything<00:02:08.970> we've<00:02:09.179> got

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
we're ensuring that everything we've got

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
running efficiently we can dial in each

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.020 
running efficiently we can dial in each
