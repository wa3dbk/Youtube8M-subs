00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.160 
the knob the VR knob to turn the camera
down<00:00:16.590> as<00:00:16.890> well<00:00:17.730> as<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> use<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> switch<00:00:21.020> when<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
down as well as to use a switch when I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.630 
down as well as to use a switch when I
figured<00:00:22.500> heck<00:00:22.740> I've<00:00:23.070> got<00:00:23.279> all<00:00:23.369> these<00:00:23.430> other

figured heck I've got all these other

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.120 
figured heck I've got all these other
switches<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.449> all<00:00:24.570> these<00:00:24.689> other<00:00:24.810> p<00:00:25.170> mixes<00:00:25.619> so

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
switches and all these other p mixes so

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.910 
switches and all these other p mixes so
let's<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.430> some<00:00:26.640> fun<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.810> check<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.109> out

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.700 

I'll<00:00:31.920> go<00:00:32.160> over<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> pee<00:00:32.759> mixes<00:00:33.260> 1<00:00:34.260> through<00:00:34.469> 6

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
I'll go over to pee mixes 1 through 6

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.810 
I'll go over to pee mixes 1 through 6
i'll<00:00:35.520> go<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> number<00:00:35.910> 2<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.770> what<00:00:38.610> i<00:00:38.640> did

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
i'll go to number 2 here and what i did

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.150 
i'll go to number 2 here and what i did
is<00:00:38.910> i<00:00:39.000> set<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.239> up<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:39.930> switch<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.559> switch<00:00:40.829> b

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
is i set it up so that switch a switch b

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.150 
is i set it up so that switch a switch b
position<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> down<00:00:43.219> the<00:00:44.219> Masters<00:00:44.700> aileron<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
position is down the Masters aileron and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.860 
position is down the Masters aileron and
the<00:00:47.160> slave<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.820> v2<00:00:48.180> which<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> 8th

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the slave is a v2 which is the 8th

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.310 
the slave is a v2 which is the 8th
channel<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.039> receiver<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.170> then<00:00:52.170> when<00:00:52.289> I

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
channel on the receiver and then when I

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.279 
channel on the receiver and then when I
do<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.649> set<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> rate<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.489> top<00:00:53.670> rate<00:00:54.289> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
do is I set the rate the top rate to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.770 
do is I set the rate the top rate to
negative<00:00:55.739> 50<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.329> actually<00:00:57.420> select

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
negative 50 and then to actually select

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.619 
negative 50 and then to actually select
the<00:00:58.050> lower<00:00:58.260> rate<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.100> rate<00:00:59.309> actually

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
the lower rate the right rate actually

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
the lower rate the right rate actually
turn<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.859> change<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
turn it right and I change that to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.310 
turn it right and I change that to
negative<00:01:02.670> 50<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> check<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.449> out<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
negative 50 and check this out when I

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.899 
negative 50 and check this out when I
move<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> stick<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.159> aileron<00:01:05.519> left<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
move the stick the aileron left and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.550 
move the stick the aileron left and
right<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.630> actually<00:01:06.840> tilts<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> camera<00:01:09.560> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
right it actually tilts the camera and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.840 
right it actually tilts the camera and
which<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.799> pretty<00:01:10.950> cool<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.400> say<00:01:11.700> you're

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
which is pretty cool so say you're

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
which is pretty cool so say you're
flying<00:01:12.119> fpv<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.110> actually<00:01:13.260> want<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
flying fpv and you actually want the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.340 
flying fpv and you actually want the
camera<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.310> turn<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:15.540> flip<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> B<00:01:16.080> switch

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
camera to turn just flip the B switch

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
camera to turn just flip the B switch
and<00:01:16.590> turn<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:18.060> aileron<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> right<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.420> i

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and turn the aileron to the right and i

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
and turn the aileron to the right and i
figured<00:01:21.750> i<00:01:21.869> could<00:01:21.900> go<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.380> bit<00:01:22.560> step

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
figured i could go a little bit step

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.820 
figured i could go a little bit step
another<00:01:23.400> step<00:01:23.640> further<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.409> i<00:01:25.409> checked<00:01:25.680> up

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
another step further and i checked up

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.210 
another step further and i checked up
channel<00:01:26.100> 3<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:27.420> node<00:01:27.960> 3<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.470> i<00:01:29.040> did<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
channel 3 here or node 3 and i did the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.010 
channel 3 here or node 3 and i did the
exact<00:01:29.579> same<00:01:29.610> thing<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> rudder<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.990> i

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
exact same thing with the rudder so i

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.170 
exact same thing with the rudder so i
actually<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> rudder<00:01:31.920> being<00:01:32.850> pumped

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
actually have the rudder being pumped

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.350 
actually have the rudder being pumped
into<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> slave<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.950> v2<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
into the slave a to a v2 and I you

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.100 
into the slave a to a v2 and I you
switch<00:01:36.750> F<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:39.110> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
switch F which is this one down here so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.980 
switch F which is this one down here so
check<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.470> out<00:01:41.329> so<00:01:42.329> now<00:01:42.479> when<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> move<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
check this out so now when I move the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.319 
check this out so now when I move the
rudder<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:45.149> actually<00:01:45.390> tilts<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.869> camera<00:01:47.329> but

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
rudder it actually tilts the camera but

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.139 
rudder it actually tilts the camera but
if<00:01:48.659> i<00:01:48.869> use<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> rudder<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.040> aileron<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
if i use the rudder and the aileron it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.969 
if i use the rudder and the aileron it
actually<00:01:51.509> does<00:01:51.689> both<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:52.710> makes

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
actually does both and it actually makes

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.469 
actually does both and it actually makes
it<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> hundred<00:01:53.369> percent<00:01:53.579> because<00:01:54.030> i<00:01:54.210> had<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it a hundred percent because i had the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
it a hundred percent because i had the
other<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.780> set<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> negative<00:01:55.439> 50<00:01:55.710> tonight<00:01:56.100> XX

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
other one set to negative 50 tonight XX

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
other one set to negative 50 tonight XX
use<00:01:56.700> both<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> want<00:01:57.780> more<00:01:57.990> extreme

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
use both so if you want more extreme

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.260 
use both so if you want more extreme
camera<00:01:58.649> more<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.430> switch<00:01:59.579> things<00:01:59.790> like

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
camera more you just switch things like

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.429 
camera more you just switch things like
that<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> they're<00:02:00.810> both<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:03.409> then<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
that and they're both going and then I

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.959 
that and they're both going and then I
figured<00:02:04.799> what<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> heck<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.369> go<00:02:05.579> one<00:02:05.790> more

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
figured what the heck I can go one more

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.609 
figured what the heck I can go one more
step<00:02:06.030> further<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> little

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
step further and this is a little

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.430 
step further and this is a little
different<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:08.360> said<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> sometimes<00:02:10.289> when

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
different I said it sometimes when

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.900 
different I said it sometimes when
you're<00:02:10.560> weary<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.250> forward<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.790> don't

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you're weary going forward you don't

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.860 
you're weary going forward you don't
want<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> camera<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.450> tilt<00:02:12.750> down<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.170> want<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
want the camera to tilt down you want to

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.240 
want the camera to tilt down you want to
to<00:02:13.989> stay<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.680> know<00:02:14.739> go<00:02:14.950> up<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.159> little

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
to stay up you know go up a little

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.039 
to stay up you know go up a little
higher<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.610> actually<00:02:15.849> have<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.659> one<00:02:16.870> with

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
higher so actually have this one with

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.820 
higher so actually have this one with
the<00:02:17.370> elevator<00:02:18.370> being<00:02:19.269> pumped<00:02:19.690> into<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.110> ger

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
the elevator being pumped into the ger

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.059 
the elevator being pumped into the ger
which<00:02:21.099> is<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:22.180> pitch<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:23.769> have<00:02:23.890> that

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
which is the the pitch and I have that

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.670 
which is the the pitch and I have that
set<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.459> switch<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.940> position<00:02:25.599> down<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.080> this

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
set to switch a position down and this

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
set to switch a position down and this
one<00:02:26.799> was<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.920> little<00:02:27.010> different<00:02:27.400> i<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.549> it<00:02:27.670> set

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
one was a little different i have it set

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.160 
one was a little different i have it set
to<00:02:27.900> negative<00:02:28.900> 50<00:02:29.379> on<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:30.370> lower<00:02:30.549> and<00:02:30.849> 0<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.930> now

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
to negative 50 on the lower and 0 so now

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.410 
to negative 50 on the lower and 0 so now
let<00:02:32.950> me<00:02:32.980> see<00:02:33.370> if<00:02:33.459> i<00:02:33.519> could<00:02:33.579> turn<00:02:33.819> that<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.030> it's

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
let me see if i could turn that on it's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.869 
let me see if i could turn that on it's
the<00:02:34.599> switch<00:02:34.840> right<00:02:35.049> here<00:02:35.260> switch<00:02:35.829> a<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.730> now

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
the switch right here switch a so now

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.240 
the switch right here switch a so now
when<00:02:37.060> i<00:02:37.090> pull<00:02:37.299> back<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:38.530> camera<00:02:38.829> tilts<00:02:39.099> up

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
when i pull back the camera tilts up

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.240 
when i pull back the camera tilts up
just<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.879> little<00:02:40.060> bit<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.590> still<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.739> soap

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
just a little bit and still just soap

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.640 
just a little bit and still just soap
behaves<00:02:42.519> normally<00:02:42.730> but<00:02:43.390> pulling<00:02:43.900> back<00:02:44.049> tilts

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
behaves normally but pulling back tilts

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.080 
behaves normally but pulling back tilts
up<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.220> could<00:02:45.400> be<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.790> know<00:02:45.879> it's<00:02:46.000> only

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
up and this could be you know it's only

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.940 
up and this could be you know it's only
set<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:46.420> negative<00:02:46.720> fifty<00:02:46.959> percent<00:02:47.260> could<00:02:47.859> be

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
set to negative fifty percent could be

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.410 
set to negative fifty percent could be
make<00:02:48.099> it<00:02:48.220> 100<00:02:48.549> negative<00:02:49.090> one<00:02:49.180> hundred<00:02:49.390> percent

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
make it 100 negative one hundred percent

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.300 
make it 100 negative one hundred percent
or<00:02:49.810> forward<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.440> there's<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> whole<00:02:51.129> lot<00:02:51.280> of
