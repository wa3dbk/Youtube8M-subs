00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
did he now he still has the ball we're

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.170 
did he now he still has the ball we're
just<00:00:37.950> looking<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.579> he's<00:00:38.910> running<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
just looking to like he's running the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.280 
just looking to like he's running the
ball<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.660> we're<00:00:39.750> looking<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> lock<00:00:40.110> up

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
ball a lot so we're looking to lock up

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.650 
ball a lot so we're looking to lock up
the<00:00:40.410> run<00:00:40.559> early<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> force<00:00:41.910> him<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> pass<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the run early and force him the pass and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180 
the run early and force him the pass and
hopefully<00:00:43.110> he's<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.469> really<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.739> great<00:00:43.950> passer

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
hopefully he's not really a great passer

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.560 
hopefully he's not really a great passer
because<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> seems<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:44.940> he<00:00:45.059> wants<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> run

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
because it seems like he wants to run

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
because it seems like he wants to run
the<00:00:45.600> ball<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:46.020> early<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:47.070> looks<00:00:47.250> like

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the ball here early and it looks like

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.590 
the ball here early and it looks like
he's<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> great<00:00:47.760> passers<00:00:48.149> thinking<00:00:48.450> about

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
he's not a great passers thinking about

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
he's not a great passers thinking about
9<00:00:48.870> he<00:00:49.260> throws<00:00:49.530> an<00:00:49.710> interception<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.430> Fletcher

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
ton third down like that was just the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.670 
ton third down like that was just the
most<00:01:27.869> random<00:01:28.110> thing<00:01:28.290> ever

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
most random thing ever

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.170 
most random thing ever
and<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.250> tried<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> run<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> spring<00:01:29.970> pass

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
but I was just like 4 to 9 at the 43 I

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.750 
but I was just like 4 to 9 at the 43 I
didn't<00:04:04.859> feel<00:04:04.950> like<00:04:05.070> punting<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.459> ball<00:04:05.549> I

put him to 20 yard line so there only be

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.949 
put him to 20 yard line so there only be
like<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.900> net<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.380> 20<00:04:10.799> yards<00:04:10.980> difference<00:04:11.579> rim

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
like a net of 20 yards difference rim

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.030 
like a net of 20 yards difference rim
from<00:04:12.959> punting<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.440> not<00:04:13.590> pointing<00:04:13.890> and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
from punting it to not pointing and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.039 
from punting it to not pointing and
since<00:04:14.220> we<00:04:14.310> threw<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.549> interception<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:15.900> know

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
since we threw the interception you know

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.090 
since we threw the interception you know
you<00:04:16.169> didn't<00:04:16.380> get<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> ball<00:04:16.709> great<00:04:16.890> field

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
you didn't get the ball great field

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.830 
you didn't get the ball great field
position<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.850> worked<00:04:18.030> out<00:04:18.150> alright<00:04:18.479> for<00:04:18.720> us

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
position so it worked out alright for us

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.479 
position so it worked out alright for us
even<00:04:19.260> though<00:04:19.530> we<00:04:19.650> didn't<00:04:19.919> get<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.340> could

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
even though we didn't get it it could

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.000 
even though we didn't get it it could
have<00:04:20.519> been<00:04:20.640> worse<00:04:20.850> so<00:04:21.750> now<00:04:22.079> we<00:04:22.530> have<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.830> rely

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
have been worse so now we have to rely

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.710 
have been worse so now we have to rely
on<00:04:23.039> our<00:04:23.250> defense<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.940> our<00:04:24.060> defense<00:04:24.510> is

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
on our defense and our defense is

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.740 
on our defense and our defense is
playing<00:04:25.050> great

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
playing great

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.080 
playing great
and<00:04:26.110> this<00:04:26.260> time<00:04:26.560> he<00:04:27.010> comes<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.520> tries<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.730> test

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
and this time he comes and tries to test

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.660 
and this time he comes and tries to test
the<00:04:28.330> user<00:04:28.570> doesn't<00:04:29.410> work<00:04:29.560> man<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:30.040> we<00:04:30.430> get<00:04:30.580> the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
the user doesn't work man and we get the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.190 
the user doesn't work man and we get the
interception<00:04:31.090> there<00:04:31.390> don't<00:04:31.660> get<00:04:31.900> much<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.080> a

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
interception there don't get much of a

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.600 
interception there don't get much of a
return<00:04:32.500> but<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.890> interceptions<00:04:33.370> all<00:04:33.460> that

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610

didn't press bake the press that

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.940 
didn't press bake the press that
probably<00:05:53.050> would've<00:05:53.229> been<00:05:53.260> a<00:05:53.350> completion<00:05:53.800> for

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
probably would've been a completion for

a<00:05:53.979> first<00:05:54.220> down<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:54.640> could've<00:05:55.210> been<00:05:55.300> a<00:05:55.360> few

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
a first down and could've been a few

a first down and could've been a few
goal<00:05:55.660> for<00:05:55.840> us<00:05:55.870> but<00:05:56.200> um<00:05:56.440> it's<00:05:57.010> all<00:05:57.160> good<00:05:57.310> since

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
goal for us but um it's all good since

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.400

only up by seven we probably should be

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.580

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
running flea flickers here didn't work

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.990 
running flea flickers here didn't work
the<00:06:45.740> first<00:06:45.770> time<00:06:46.040> I<00:06:46.280> was<00:06:46.400> like<00:06:46.490> all<00:06:46.669> right<00:06:46.699> let

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
the first time I was like all right let

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.850 
the first time I was like all right let
me<00:06:47.090> run<00:06:47.270> it<00:06:47.419> again<00:06:47.660> because<00:06:47.930> if<00:06:48.169> we<00:06:48.560> could<00:06:48.680> get

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
me run it again because if we could get

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.230 
me run it again because if we could get
it<00:06:48.949> off<00:06:49.100> I<00:06:49.310> think<00:06:49.340> we<00:06:49.610> have<00:06:49.699> a<00:06:49.760> good<00:06:49.880> chance<00:06:49.940> of

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.939 
it off I think we have a good chance of
getting<00:06:50.389> it<00:06:50.660> and<00:06:50.840> we<00:06:51.110> get<00:06:51.350> it<00:06:51.470> here<00:06:51.620> don't<00:06:51.770> get
