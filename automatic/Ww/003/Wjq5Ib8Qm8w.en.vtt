00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.190
 take it easy 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.190
 to hope 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.329
 although 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.329
 this one 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.560
 how can you this is part 2 of the difficulty roots the boss is infected 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.770
 we will now look at where the attention is all the buttons 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.300
 and the best place to start is of course 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.229
 at the beginning 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.060
 so how can we start the program 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.230
 That can be done in different ways 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.410
 a test on icon via you 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 if it is already at your best just click 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.680
 and your start menu must also have an icon 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 if you tweet that year it should also open 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.080
 maybe it's also in your taskbar at the bottom 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.190
 the council already 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 just put it on then it opens 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.510
 it may also be that I can also find nowhere 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.910
 then I have to search with 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640
 I go to computer 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.030
 I then go to your hard drive 7 that got you open 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.490
 it is very program files 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.850
 so these are your program files 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.960
 so you can't change anything or leave 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
 because then you have the chance that your computer no longer works as it should 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.220
 but I can borrow something 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.780
 click on program files 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.930
 here you see the moby meeke folder you click it open 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.670
 then we have it here should not come 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.979
 via a right mouse click we get a window with the option then copy 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.040
 desktop 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.900
 if you click on this, the ico will be copied to a test that you can 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 do not click then the meter must be opened 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.860
 also you can what we have here 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.820
 just like with the ex pvc of bookmaker you are in the news 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.290
 with buttons that also occur in other places 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.280
 under file we have options for the new project 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.200
 open project save save as 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.470
 some weird knots 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.769
 and your last opened projects 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.969
 among the works we have options for editing your file so cut it 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.119
 copy and paste and so on 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.649
 to that image we have options for changing the display of it 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:21.939
 program 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.029
 these buttons appear again in other useful places 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.819
 to have the extra of knot is to make your effects and your transitions visible 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.279
 to make 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.430
 but you have important issues 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.439
 options 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.800
 this we can check our project settings 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.229
 especially every time 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:39.789
 advanced 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.789
 it is important to set the correct video format 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.900
 in our case pole 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.629
 because we are in europe 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.719
 and therefore no ntsc 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.649
 and choose the correct aspect ratio 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.849
 standard fourth 3 on pre counts sixteen the 9 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.200
 this must therefore correspond to the image format on which your camera is 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.479
 set if this is not correct you will get in your image for training 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.420
 the stable 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.739
 and in my case sixteenth 9 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.249
 To make the clip its a handsome match with limitations that especially 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.089
 smallness in the garden 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:18.319
 under playback you have extra playbackend as for your playback screen 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.170
 but again you will not use this much 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.170
 the buttons themselves can be found in many other useful places 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.860
 and for help you can hopefully find an answer 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.860
 to your questions about the functioning of the program 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.819
 this is then your playback screen 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.109
 make the second large or small 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.249
 if you go over the edge, a bowl appears 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:45.279
 with the left mouse button pressed you can drag to the size of the finest 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.519
 to fit 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.519
 with this button you can scroll back and forth through the clip 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.519
 here again playback has no chance 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.549
 and a button to point the club at the indicated location 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.059
 this is the project window where your imported media will be visible 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.389
 with these important nodes you can switch back and forth between tasks and 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.009
 collections 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.259
 and here is the timeline c cure storyboard 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.259
 hey you drag your media to it for editing 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.410
 if you stew me the top edge here you can hold it with the left mouse button 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.669
 adjust the size of the Rhine square 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.669
 this is useful if you have to be very precise 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.610
 you can zoom in on the Zuidplein again if you want to be busy 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.230
 by clicking on these job tuning buttons 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.420
 and with this button you can switch from timeline astori board mode and back 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.090
 we will return to these functions extensively later in other tutorials 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 buttons and how to use them on the cancer 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.419
 you can also understand the intention we now have our project 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.580
 institutions checked 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.580
 and we have a reasonable idea we are everything and what it is for 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.900
 in the next club part 3 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.510
 i have you and import we are going to implement the new project kojima and 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:10.180
 see how wide make with beautiful game hardenberg suddenly not exciting salland
