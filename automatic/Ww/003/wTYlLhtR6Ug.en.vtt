was<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.340> like<00:00:14.490> four<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.000> seven<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.599> he

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
was going like four and seven and he

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.570 
was going like four and seven and he
comes<00:00:15.960> back<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.410> gets<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.650> MOAB<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.340> game

which<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.330> really<00:00:18.600> nice<00:00:18.840> comeback

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
which is a really nice comeback

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.429 
which is a really nice comeback
especially<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> free-for-all<00:00:20.490> and

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
especially for a free-for-all and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.630 
especially for a free-for-all and
nothing<00:00:22.439> better<00:00:22.590> than<00:00:22.800> getting<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.279> moab

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640
