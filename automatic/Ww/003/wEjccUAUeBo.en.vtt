demonstrated this on the eyes to show

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.440 
demonstrated this on the eyes to show
you<00:02:06.680> just<00:02:06.860> how<00:02:06.950> comparable<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.330> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
you just how comparable this is to the

Urban Decay one you can't even tell the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.120 
Urban Decay one you can't even tell the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
difference right well the last time that

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.430 
difference right well the last time that
you<00:02:13.670> set<00:02:13.910> your<00:02:14.000> mind<00:02:14.060> on<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.569> goal<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.140> really

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
you set your mind on a goal and really

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.920 
you set your mind on a goal and really
dedicate<00:02:16.010> yourself<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.610> achieving<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.600> know

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
dedicate yourself to achieving it I know

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.440 
dedicate yourself to achieving it I know
I'm<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.080> mad<00:02:18.290> person<00:02:18.500> who<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.550> know<00:02:19.700> feel<00:02:20.180> that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
I'm a mad person who you know feel that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.390 
I'm a mad person who you know feel that
I<00:02:20.660> can<00:02:20.930> achieve<00:02:21.140> anything<00:02:21.500> last<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.100> my<00:02:22.190> mind

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
I can achieve anything last in my mind

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.010 
I can achieve anything last in my mind
too<00:02:22.610> but<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.120> tend<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.450> go<00:02:23.600> through<00:02:23.630> phases

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
too but I tend to go through phases

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.650 
too but I tend to go through phases
where<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.680> become<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> little<00:02:25.220> stressed<00:02:25.640> or<00:02:26.120> just

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
where I become a little stressed or just

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.720 
where I become a little stressed or just
a<00:02:26.690> little<00:02:26.870> bit<00:02:26.989> less<00:02:27.170> motivated<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.489> think

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
a little bit less motivated and I think

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.280 
a little bit less motivated and I think
it's<00:02:28.850> really<00:02:29.090> important<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.600> when<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
it's really important that when that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.380 
it's really important that when that
happens<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.700> add<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:31.910> little<00:02:32.239> bit<00:02:32.360> more

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
happens that you add a little bit more

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.479 
happens that you add a little bit more
order<00:02:32.870> in<00:02:33.050> your<00:02:33.200> life<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.770> help<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.070> stay
