 public to companies what is known 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.049
 like the merchandising that they make 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.190
 merchandise you read facilitates all 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.410
 the necessary machinery 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.940
 it's seems the technology that I understand that 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.730
 it's technology and point to classify that 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.400
 this is through the printers that 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.710
 they inject a special ink so that they 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.230
 print on the paper and then this the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.810
 paper is stuck in the cup in such a way 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.360
 that the image moves to the cup but 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.490
 for this the tapas is very important 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.770
 they are special is not any rate nor 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.020
 this is not a stamp is not a 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.810
 stamping is called sublimation do that 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.850
 the ink sublime on the cup and that 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.160
 like a photograph in which you are going to 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.110
 be totally smooth and if any 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.270
