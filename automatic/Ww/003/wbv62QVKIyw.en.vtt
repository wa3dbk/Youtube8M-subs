00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
and so yeah you get the idea but this is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.990 
and so yeah you get the idea but this is
Seneca<00:00:43.140> Crane<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.620> I'll<00:00:44.190> turn<00:00:44.789> them<00:00:44.910> around

this isn't a me figure but I thought it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.279 
this isn't a me figure but I thought it
might<00:00:50.370> consider<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.050> dummy

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
this works is that you jump from here to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.670 
this works is that you jump from here to
here<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> middle<00:01:36.900> part<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.500> can

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
here and then at the middle part you can

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.230 
here and then at the middle part you can
kind<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> adjust<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.700> height<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.030> want

just<00:01:44.189> pull<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.490> down<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:45.570> you're

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
just pull it down right and then you're

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080 
just pull it down right and then you're
finished<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.229> jump<00:01:46.470> over<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> other<00:01:47.700> side

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
finished the jump over to the other side

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.990 
finished the jump over to the other side
so<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.380> parkour<00:01:49.860> station<00:01:50.430> next

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so this is the parkour station next

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.820 
so this is the parkour station next
is<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.330> heavy<00:01:51.540> ball<00:01:51.780> station<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.620> saw<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
is the heavy ball station if you saw the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.980 
is the heavy ball station if you saw the
first<00:01:53.250> movie<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.940> The<00:01:54.120> Hunger<00:01:54.240> Games<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.720> know

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
first movie of The Hunger Games you know

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.890 
first movie of The Hunger Games you know
that<00:01:55.290> Peeta<00:01:55.760> went<00:01:56.760> in<00:01:57.000> while<00:01:57.270> training<00:01:57.600> he

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
that Peeta went in while training he

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.580 
that Peeta went in while training he
threw<00:01:58.230> a<00:01:58.260> giant<00:01:58.980> ball<00:01:59.330> towards<00:02:00.330> an<00:02:00.600> object

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
threw a giant ball towards an object

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.040 
threw a giant ball towards an object
with<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.310> large<00:02:02.970> metal<00:02:03.240> ball<00:02:03.390> because<00:02:03.720> if<00:02:03.900> you

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
with a large metal ball because if you

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.990 
with a large metal ball because if you
know<00:02:04.260> hunger<00:02:04.710> games<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.160> know<00:02:05.280> pitas<00:02:05.670> strong

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
know hunger games you know pitas strong

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.930 
know hunger games you know pitas strong
so<00:02:06.720> he<00:02:06.780> throws<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.130> problem<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
so he throws it and the problem I

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.790 
so he throws it and the problem I
thought<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.509> myself<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:10.080> know<00:02:10.140> well<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
thought to myself you know well is that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.590 
thought to myself you know well is that
ball<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.250> originally<00:02:11.700> far<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.450> thought

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
ball you originally far and I thought

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.480 
ball you originally far and I thought
maybe<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.110> was<00:02:13.260> four<00:02:13.500> crates<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.370> you

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
maybe that it was four crates so you

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.970 
maybe that it was four crates so you
could<00:02:14.640> practice<00:02:14.880> shooting<00:02:15.720> throwing<00:02:16.560> really

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
could practice shooting throwing really

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.500 
could practice shooting throwing really
anything<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:17.970> one<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> most

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
anything and this is one of the most

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.760 
anything and this is one of the most
iconic<00:02:20.150> places<00:02:21.150> where<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.230> tributes

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
iconic places where that the tributes

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.979 
iconic places where that the tributes
train<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.030> fire<00:02:24.360> starting

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
train and this is the fire starting

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.290 
train and this is the fire starting
practice<00:02:25.380> station<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.489> don't<00:02:26.940> really<00:02:27.060> know

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
practice station I don't really know

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.729 
practice station I don't really know
that's<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.690> real<00:02:27.840> name<00:02:28.080> but<00:02:28.380> I'm<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:28.590> gonna

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
that's the real name but I'm just gonna

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.650 
that's the real name but I'm just gonna
call<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.180> tree<00:02:30.480> right

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
call it that and you have a tree right

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.890 
call it that and you have a tree right
here<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.260> an<00:02:31.680> indoor<00:02:32.130> fire<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.330> if<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.660> turn

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
here and an indoor fire and if you turn

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.840 
here and an indoor fire and if you turn
this<00:02:33.989> around<00:02:34.050> it's<00:02:34.980> kind<00:02:35.220> enough<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.700> a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
this around it's kind enough just a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.699 
this around it's kind enough just a
regular<00:02:36.510> wall<00:02:36.720> made<00:02:36.930> out<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.200> regular<00:02:37.560> little

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
regular wall made out of regular little

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.370 
regular wall made out of regular little
Lego<00:02:38.160> bricks<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:38.970> got<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.480> call

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
Lego bricks and then you got that call

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.470 
Lego bricks and then you got that call
of<00:02:40.530> nature<00:02:40.560> sitting<00:02:41.280> now<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.060> part

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
of nature sitting now this part

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.229 
of nature sitting now this part
basically<00:02:42.950> fits<00:02:43.950> into<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.640> second<00:02:45.000> part<00:02:45.120> that

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
basically fits into the second part that

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.880 
basically fits into the second part that
I'm<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.600> show<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.780> later<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.830> is

Spears<00:02:49.590> while<00:02:50.160> you're<00:02:50.459> practicing<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
Spears while you're practicing in the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.300 
Spears while you're practicing in the
train<00:02:53.180> station<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.560> we'll<00:02:55.709> get<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.070> pain

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
train station so we'll get to the pain

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.220 
train station so we'll get to the pain
part<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.060> here's<00:02:57.269> just<00:02:57.360> an<00:02:57.600> overlook<00:02:58.049> up

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
part of it so here's just an overlook up

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.940 
part of it so here's just an overlook up
the<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.790> main<00:03:00.450> part<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.620> can

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
the the main part of it and so you can

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.860 
the the main part of it and so you can
see<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.340> have<00:03:02.459> some<00:03:02.610> monkey<00:03:02.970> bars<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.690> go

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
see we have some monkey bars that go

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.580 
see we have some monkey bars that go
diagonals<00:03:04.769> horizontal<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.880> then<00:03:06.090> Dino<00:03:07.080> again

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
diagonals horizontal and then Dino again

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.470 
diagonals horizontal and then Dino again
she's<00:03:08.220> kind<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.489> practice<00:03:08.850> your<00:03:09.000> strength<00:03:09.330> on

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
she's kind of practice your strength on

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.940 
she's kind of practice your strength on
there<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:09.959> have<00:03:09.989> two<00:03:10.290> targets<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.799> can

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
there then we have two targets I can

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.320 
there then we have two targets I can
show<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.250> what<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.880> do<00:03:12.000> with<00:03:12.150> those

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
show you what you can do with those

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.539 
show you what you can do with those
later<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.810> then<00:03:13.380> like<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.980> said<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.280> was<00:03:14.459> gonna

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
later and then like I said I was gonna

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.110 
later and then like I said I was gonna
get<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.330> dummy<00:03:16.370> see<00:03:17.370> there<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.730> knot

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
get to the dummy see there is a knot

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.819 
get to the dummy see there is a knot
that<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.840> tied<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.380> there<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.799> snug<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.440> I

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
that is tied in there just snug and so I

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.190 
that is tied in there just snug and so I
don't<00:03:23.130> usually<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:24.000> cuz<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.810> probably

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
don't usually do that cuz it probably

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.289 
don't usually do that cuz it probably
isn't<00:03:25.350> good<00:03:25.620> for<00:03:25.769> Lego<00:03:26.220> maybe<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.000> don't

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
isn't good for Lego maybe is I don't

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.050 
isn't good for Lego maybe is I don't
really<00:03:27.510> know<00:03:27.690> but<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:29.430> as<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.670> could<00:03:29.820> see

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
really know but the as you could see

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.530 
really know but the as you could see
kind<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.780> wraps<00:03:31.350> around<00:03:31.530> him<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.340> he

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
kind of wraps around him and he

a sliding door that I'll show you the
mechanism<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.629> back<00:03:43.810> but<00:03:44.110> I'll<00:03:44.739> just<00:03:44.980> show

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
mechanism in the back but I'll just show

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.369 
mechanism in the back but I'll just show
you<00:03:45.220> what<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.459> looks<00:03:45.700> like<00:03:45.879> first<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.689> you<00:03:46.750> push

this thing right here and then it opens
up<00:03:49.420> like<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.470> futuristic<00:03:51.480> building<00:03:52.480> you'd<00:03:52.720> see

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
up like a futuristic building you'd see

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.720 
up like a futuristic building you'd see
yeah<00:03:53.439> you'd<00:03:53.590> see<00:03:53.829> these<00:03:53.950> kind<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.459> in<00:03:54.670> a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
yeah you'd see these kind of in a

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.580 
yeah you'd see these kind of in a
futuristic<00:03:55.150> building<00:03:55.659> like<00:03:55.900> The<00:03:56.200> Hunger

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
futuristic building like The Hunger

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.830 
futuristic building like The Hunger
Games<00:03:56.620> because<00:03:57.370> yeah<00:03:57.879> it's<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.209> future<00:03:58.359> so

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
Games because yeah it's in the future so

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.300 
Games because yeah it's in the future so
you<00:03:59.260> would<00:03:59.379> see<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.590> lot<00:03:59.829> of<00:03:59.920> these<00:03:59.980> I'm<00:04:00.159> gonna

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
you would see a lot of these I'm gonna

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.110 
you would see a lot of these I'm gonna
show<00:04:00.549> you<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:00.730> mechanism<00:04:00.879> at<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.299> back<00:04:01.510> and

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
show you the mechanism at the back and

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.729 
show you the mechanism at the back and
so<00:04:04.120> yeah<00:04:04.420> it's<00:04:04.569> basically<00:04:04.989> held<00:04:05.170> together<00:04:05.319> by

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
so yeah it's basically held together by

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.869 
so yeah it's basically held together by
these<00:04:06.459> kind<00:04:07.060> of<00:04:07.260> these<00:04:08.370> plates<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.549> are<00:04:09.609> kind

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
these kind of these plates that are kind

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.270 
these kind of these plates that are kind
of<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.480> measure<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.870> one<00:04:11.379> and<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.620> half<00:04:11.650> bricks

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
of the measure of one and a half bricks

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.539 
of the measure of one and a half bricks
and<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.389> really<00:04:13.599> helps<00:04:14.079> me<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.440> get<00:04:14.889> the

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
and so that really helps me to get the

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.349 
and so that really helps me to get the
make<00:04:16.359> sure<00:04:16.570> that<00:04:16.750> it's<00:04:17.229> all<00:04:17.440> nice<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.160> fit<00:04:19.150> and

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
make sure that it's all nice and fit and

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.140 
make sure that it's all nice and fit and
able<00:04:20.289> to<00:04:20.410> slide<00:04:20.769> through<00:04:21.130> without<00:04:21.459> falling

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
able to slide through without falling

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.650 
able to slide through without falling
off<00:04:22.300> so<00:04:23.139> I'll<00:04:23.260> get<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.039> right<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.910> the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
off so I'll get to the right of the the

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.480 
off so I'll get to the right of the the
move<00:04:25.840> trim<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:26.410> here's<00:04:26.710> our<00:04:26.919> not<00:04:27.190> very

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
Apple but since the Apple did not fit in

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.770 
Apple but since the Apple did not fit in
the<00:04:47.830> pigs<00:04:48.190> mount<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:48.669> just<00:04:48.849> decided<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.300> stick

your<00:04:49.870> arms<00:04:50.139> back<00:04:50.289> so<00:04:50.800> because<00:04:51.130> that's<00:04:51.280> how

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
your arms back so because that's how

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.890 
your arms back so because that's how
Lego<00:04:51.729> works<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.150> can't<00:04:52.360> really<00:04:52.539> put<00:04:52.780> the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
Lego works you can't really put the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.770 
Lego works you can't really put the
Apple<00:04:53.229> nose<00:04:53.380> mouth<00:04:53.820> but<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:55.360> have<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:55.539> ball

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
perfect angle you can see you have some

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.650 
perfect angle you can see you have some
ice<00:05:01.200> cream<00:05:01.230> over<00:05:01.620> there<00:05:01.890> a<00:05:02.160> little<00:05:02.520> table<00:05:03.360> and

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
ice cream over there a little table and

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.790 
with these targets so like I said you
can<00:05:19.440> fit<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.710> spear<00:05:20.220> in<00:05:20.310> there<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:21.770> probably<00:05:22.770> a

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
can fit a spear in there and probably a

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.940 
can fit a spear in there and probably a
lot<00:05:23.100> of<00:05:23.160> other<00:05:23.460> pipe<00:05:24.030> like<00:05:24.360> objects<00:05:25.080> because

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
lot of other pipe like objects because

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.790 
lot of other pipe like objects because
there<00:05:26.310> is<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.520> little<00:05:27.080> axle<00:05:28.080> fitting<00:05:28.500> in<00:05:28.620> there

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
there is a little axle fitting in there

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.980 
there is a little axle fitting in there
and<00:05:29.010> so<00:05:29.250> kind<00:05:29.940> of<00:05:30.000> works<00:05:30.210> out<00:05:30.420> nice<00:05:30.960> and

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
and so kind of works out nice and

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.280 
and so kind of works out nice and
perfect<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:32.240> that's<00:05:33.240> actually<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.780> benefit

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
perfect and that's actually the benefit

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.810 
perfect and that's actually the benefit
to<00:05:34.500> these<00:05:34.650> kinds<00:05:35.010> of<00:05:35.070> targets<00:05:35.430> usually<00:05:35.790> I

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
to these kinds of targets usually I

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.650 
to these kinds of targets usually I
would<00:05:36.060> have<00:05:36.180> just<00:05:36.420> put<00:05:36.660> in<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.680> sticker<00:05:38.220> but<00:05:39.150> I

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
would have just put in a sticker but I

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.210 
would have just put in a sticker but I
thought<00:05:40.200> that<00:05:40.410> maybe<00:05:40.620> this<00:05:40.800> was<00:05:40.980> better

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
thought that maybe this was better

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.980 
thought that maybe this was better
because<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:41.670> can<00:05:41.790> actually<00:05:41.970> put<00:05:42.420> something

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
because you can actually put something

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.250 
because you can actually put something
like<00:05:43.320> stuck<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.490> target<00:05:44.880> so<00:05:45.330> also<00:05:46.110> an

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
like stuck the target so also an

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.800 
like stuck the target so also an
additional<00:05:46.890> feature<00:05:47.160> that<00:05:47.580> you<00:05:47.910> can<00:05:48.090> do<00:05:48.300> is

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
additional feature that you can do is

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.200 
additional feature that you can do is
you<00:05:48.960> can<00:05:49.110> fit<00:05:49.530> little<00:05:50.160> objects<00:05:50.730> or<00:05:50.880> people

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
you can fit little objects or people

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.260 
you can fit little objects or people
