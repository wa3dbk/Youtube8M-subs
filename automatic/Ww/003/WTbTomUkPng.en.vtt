00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
seconds and then it goes on a little bit

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.790

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
blah but yeah and this was basically

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.630 
blah but yeah and this was basically
probably<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> best<00:00:50.190> videos<00:00:50.489> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
probably one of the best videos that
