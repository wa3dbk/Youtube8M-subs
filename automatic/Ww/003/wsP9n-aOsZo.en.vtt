impact resistance and also it's very
easy<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.530> apply<00:00:35.860> now<00:00:36.220> what<00:00:36.400> you<00:00:36.460> can<00:00:36.580> see<00:00:36.730> if<00:00:36.910> we

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
easy to apply now what you can see if we

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.170 
easy to apply now what you can see if we
look<00:00:37.180> inside<00:00:37.390> here<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:39.309> actually<00:00:39.400> got<00:00:39.760> it's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
look inside here it's actually got it's

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.820 
look inside here it's actually got it's
made<00:00:40.390> up<00:00:40.510> of<00:00:40.600> three<00:00:40.659> really<00:00:41.170> thin<00:00:41.379> layers<00:00:41.589> the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
made up of three really thin layers the

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.649 
made up of three really thin layers the
top<00:00:42.040> layer<00:00:42.220> is<00:00:42.370> really<00:00:42.640> hard<00:00:42.879> it<00:00:43.119> spreads<00:00:43.479> the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
top layer is really hard it spreads the

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.500 
top layer is really hard it spreads the
impact<00:00:44.049> force<00:00:44.350> across<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:45.010> screen<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.360> the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
impact force across the screen and the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.200 
impact force across the screen and the
impact<00:00:46.869> protection<00:00:47.019> layer<00:00:47.440> in<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.799> middle<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
impact protection layer in the middle is

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.030 
impact protection layer in the middle is
the<00:00:49.449> similar<00:00:50.080> material<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.589> what<00:00:50.710> you'll<00:00:50.830> find

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
the similar material to what you'll find

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.820 
the similar material to what you'll find
in<00:00:51.280> bulletproof<00:00:51.580> glass<00:00:51.970> rather<00:00:52.900> incredibly

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
in bulletproof glass rather incredibly

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.070 
in bulletproof glass rather incredibly
and<00:00:54.040> then<00:00:54.159> the<00:00:54.280> soft<00:00:54.489> base<00:00:54.699> layer<00:00:54.970> absorbs<00:00:55.540> the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
and then the soft base layer absorbs the

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.649 
and then the soft base layer absorbs the
impact<00:00:56.199> so<00:00:56.650> when<00:00:56.830> you<00:00:56.979> hit<00:00:57.159> something

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
impact so when you hit something

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.329 
impact so when you hit something
directly<00:00:58.659> on<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.320> screen<00:00:59.559> instead<00:01:00.159> of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
directly on the screen instead of

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.490 
directly on the screen instead of
cracking<00:01:00.939> it<00:01:01.089> what<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.540> does<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:01.930> spreads<00:01:02.290> the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
cracking it what it does it spreads the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.439 
cracking it what it does it spreads the
force<00:01:02.530> out<00:01:02.979> and<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.610> stops<00:01:03.879> your<00:01:04.059> iPhone

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
force out and it stops your iPhone

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.480 
force out and it stops your iPhone
screen<00:01:04.600> from<00:01:04.900> getting<00:01:05.229> cracked<00:01:05.500> which<00:01:06.310> is

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
screen from getting cracked which is

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.370 
screen from getting cracked which is
really<00:01:06.670> really<00:01:06.909> awesome<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:07.689> we<00:01:07.869> just<00:01:08.049> open

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
really really awesome so we just open

really really awesome so we just open
this<00:01:08.470> up<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.969> we'll<00:01:09.969> see<00:01:10.179> about<00:01:10.270> applying<00:01:10.719> it

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
this up and we'll see about applying it

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:14.370 
this up and we'll see about applying it
on<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.229> screen<00:01:11.560> of<00:01:11.740> my<00:01:12.640> iphone<00:01:13.119> 5<00:01:13.479> if<00:01:13.810> i<00:01:14.140> can

so<00:02:15.680> let's<00:02:15.920> see<00:02:16.519> how<00:02:16.550> easy<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.239> is<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.480> get<00:02:17.750> on

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
so let's see how easy this is to get on

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:34.479 
so let's see how easy this is to get on
the<00:02:18.080> device<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:33.110> repeal<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.769> bit<00:02:34.040> off<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
the device so repeal this bit off the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.300 
the device so repeal this bit off the
red<00:02:34.730> bit<00:02:34.910> comes<00:02:35.120> off<00:02:35.299> first<00:02:36.310> nicely

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
red bit comes off first nicely

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.430 
red bit comes off first nicely
color-coordinated<00:02:38.299> there<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.930> stop<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.319> from

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
taking the wrong part off first and then

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.650 
taking the wrong part off first and then
I<00:02:42.200> align<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.799> with<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.010> various<00:02:43.459> parts<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.150> my

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
I align it with the various parts of my

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.770 
I align it with the various parts of my
iPhone<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.430> can<00:02:46.610> do<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.120> video<00:02:47.329> I'm

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
iPhone so you I can do this on video I'm

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.660 
iPhone so you I can do this on video I'm
looking<00:02:48.110> at<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.290> from<00:02:48.380> an<00:02:48.560> angle<00:02:48.920> here<00:02:49.190> once

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
looking at it from an angle here once

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.729 
looking at it from an angle here once
you've<00:02:49.849> aligned<00:02:50.329> it<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:50.750> placed<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.260> down<00:02:51.530> it

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
you've aligned it and placed it down it

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.069 
you've aligned it and placed it down it
should<00:02:51.769> just<00:02:52.190> spread<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.690> attach

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
should just spread and just attach

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.030 
should just spread and just attach
itself<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.739> don't<00:02:54.920> have<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:56.410> do<00:02:57.410> any<00:02:57.590> messing

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
itself you don't have to do any messing

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.390 
itself you don't have to do any messing
around<00:02:58.160> really<00:02:59.769> at<00:03:00.769> least<00:03:00.950> that's<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.310> idea

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
around really at least that's the idea

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.699 
around really at least that's the idea
you<00:03:01.849> can<00:03:01.970> see<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.299> spreading<00:03:02.750> on<00:03:03.290> its<00:03:03.500> own

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
you can see it's spreading on its own

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.460 
you can see it's spreading on its own
there<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:05.299> any<00:03:05.450> last<00:03:05.720> air<00:03:05.959> bubbles<00:03:06.349> that

there and any last air bubbles that
remaining<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.220> can<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.849> can<00:03:08.060> squeeze<00:03:08.360> them

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
remaining you can you can squeeze them

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.080 
remaining you can you can squeeze them
out<00:03:09.250> that's<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.430> rather<00:03:10.640> good<00:03:10.879> sound<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.930> then
