00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
pretty good football teams that we

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.130 
pretty good football teams that we
haven't<00:02:35.150> come<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.360> find<00:02:35.630> out<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:37.900> still<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.020> my

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
haven't come to find out I still in my

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.210 
haven't come to find out I still in my
heart<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.410> hearts<00:02:39.470> believe<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:39.980> should<00:02:40.070> have

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
heart of hearts believe we should have

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.800 
heart of hearts believe we should have
won<00:02:40.340> those<00:02:40.490> games<00:02:40.780> but<00:02:41.780> we<00:02:41.810> didn't<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.520> I

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
won those games but we didn't and I

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.240 
won those games but we didn't and I
think<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:44.959> about<00:02:45.230> developing<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:45.890> mindset

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
think it's about developing a mindset

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.630 
think it's about developing a mindset
it's<00:02:46.550> about<00:02:46.820> developing<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.480> culture<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:49.400> a

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
it's about developing a culture of of a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.720 
it's about developing a culture of of a
killer<00:02:49.910> instinct<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.570> of<00:02:51.080> competing<00:02:52.040> for<00:02:52.340> 60

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
killer instinct of of competing for 60

minutes with relentless effort and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.850 
minutes with relentless effort and
execution

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
execution

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
to see what he looked like at that spot

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.670 
to see what he looked like at that spot
I'll<00:03:51.720> have<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.959> go<00:03:52.080> back<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.290> look<00:03:52.500> at<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
I'll have to go back and look at the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.729 
I'll have to go back and look at the
film<00:03:52.950> quite<00:03:53.310> honestly<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:54.540> don't<00:03:55.230> get<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.590> see

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
film quite honestly I don't get to see

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.500 
film quite honestly I don't get to see
everything<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.459> practice<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.940> entire<00:03:57.209> time

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
everything in practice the entire time

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.650 
everything in practice the entire time
so<00:03:58.410> we're<00:03:58.860> just<00:03:58.980> trying<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.190> get<00:03:59.340> an<00:03:59.430> idea

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
so we're just trying to get an idea

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.780 
so we're just trying to get an idea
because<00:04:00.830> honestly<00:04:01.830> we<00:04:02.010> could<00:04:02.160> start<00:04:02.400> Andre

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
because honestly we could start Andre

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.060 
because honestly we could start Andre
Walker<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.420> his<00:04:03.540> foot<00:04:03.810> could<00:04:04.140> get<00:04:04.799> injured

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
Walker and his foot could get injured

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.440 
Walker and his foot could get injured
the<00:04:05.220> second<00:04:05.519> play<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.790> game<00:04:05.940> we<00:04:06.120> need<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.299> have

the second play the game we need to have

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.650 
the second play the game we need to have
a<00:04:06.480> plan<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:07.019> place<00:04:07.730> big<00:04:08.730> picture<00:04:08.970> wise<00:04:09.299> so<00:04:09.540> we

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
a plan in place big picture wise so we

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.090

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
reps left tackle and then we'll have to

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.030
