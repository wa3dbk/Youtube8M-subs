a<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:31.980> bit<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.220> Hubble<00:00:32.700> from<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
a little bit like a Hubble from the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.000 
a little bit like a Hubble from the
first<00:00:33.390> day<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:34.530> gets<00:00:34.800> converted<00:00:35.220> all<00:00:37.010> bodies

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
first day one gets converted all bodies

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.360 
first day one gets converted all bodies
around<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.670> body<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.150> spiral<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
around the body can spiral and this and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.490 
around the body can spiral and this and
when<00:00:44.520> you're<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.150> can<00:00:45.330> also<00:00:45.480> separate<00:00:46.199> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
when you're up you can also separate and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
when you're up you can also separate and
again<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.340> maybe<00:00:47.520> jump<00:00:47.970> and<00:00:48.239> catch<00:00:48.480> each

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
again and maybe jump and catch each

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.510 
again and maybe jump and catch each
