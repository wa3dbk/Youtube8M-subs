suited the with a player like this I'm
going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.480> isolating<00:00:27.990> pretty<00:00:28.380> wide<00:00:28.619> I've

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
going to be isolating pretty wide I've

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.240 
going to be isolating pretty wide I've
got<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.609> pretty<00:00:30.240> loose<00:00:30.840> player<00:00:31.230> directly<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:32.009> my

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
got a pretty loose player directly on my

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.799 
got a pretty loose player directly on my
left<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:34.100> then<00:00:35.100> I've<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.360> two<00:00:36.360> knits

directly<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.829> their<00:00:38.460> left<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:40.850> this<00:00:41.850> hand<00:00:42.120> is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
directly to their left so this hand is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
directly to their left so this hand is
going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> play<00:00:42.980> obviously<00:00:43.980> very<00:00:44.579> well<00:00:44.760> in

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
going to play obviously very well in

www<00:00:49.590> calls<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.309> I'll<00:00:50.610> worry<00:00:50.879> about<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.180> then

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
www calls then I'll worry about it then

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.700 
www calls then I'll worry about it then
but<00:00:51.949> for<00:00:52.949> now<00:00:53.039> these<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> suited<00:00:55.020> kind<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
but for now these kind of suited kind of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
but for now these kind of suited kind of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
fifty and a seven now at this point he

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.440 
fifty and a seven now at this point he
could<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.650> doing<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:18.299> wide

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
could be doing this with a really wide

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.530 
could be doing this with a really wide
range<00:01:18.750> I've<00:01:19.350> got<00:01:19.670> all<00:01:20.670> kinds<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.119> backdoor

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
range I've got all kinds of backdoor

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.620 
range I've got all kinds of backdoor
drawers<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.479> both

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
drawers and I actually think that both

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.810 
drawers and I actually think that both
my<00:01:25.259> queen<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.680> mine<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.869> good

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
my queen and mine are going to be good

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.600 
my queen and mine are going to be good
very<00:01:29.820> often<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.780> decide<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> raise<00:01:32.189> in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
very often here so I decide to raise in

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
very often here so I decide to raise in
order<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> isolate<00:01:34.189> and<00:01:36.110> prop<00:01:37.110> calls<00:01:37.890> which

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
order to isolate and prop calls which

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.859 
order to isolate and prop calls which
I'm<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.840> thrilled<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.380> all<00:01:40.560> about<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
I'm not thrilled that all about and

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.609 
I'm not thrilled that all about and
fastly<00:01:42.869> calls<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:44.030> turn<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> nine<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
fastly calls so I turn a nine and this I

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.109 
fastly calls so I turn a nine and this I
definitely<00:01:50.070> consider<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.549> an<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.820> against

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
definitely consider this an out against

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.310 
definitely consider this an out against
fast<00:01:51.479> Louis<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.320> against<00:01:52.530> prop<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:54.119> don't<00:01:54.740> um

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
fast Louis but against prop I I don't um

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.209 
fast Louis but against prop I I don't um
he<00:01:58.320> could<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:59.930> I<00:02:00.930> definitely<00:02:01.710> feel<00:02:02.100> like

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
he could have I definitely feel like

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.310 
he could have I definitely feel like
he's<00:02:02.369> strong<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:02.850> I'm<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.869> sure<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
he's strong here I'm just not sure to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.940
