00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.169
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.930
 home cinema deluxe today is about the 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:19.060
 film orphan the orphan and that is 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.610
 a psycho thriller from the year 2009 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.130
 shot by the director jaume collet-serra 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.780
 a spanish director why i got the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.970
 Names probably wrong to pronounce 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.280
 it is about the family coleman consisting 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.630
 from Kate and John Coleman and their two 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.239
 children at the birth of the third 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.580
 Kindes, however, is a bit wrong kate 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.740
 he suffers a stillbirth and so on 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.810
 the family decides later 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
 child from a catholic home too 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.600
 to adopt 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.310
 the child she joins you for 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.470
 it says there and it's nine 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.700
 years old and very different than that 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.070
 other children she is rather 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.530
 introverted but very polite and very 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.970
 far advanced for her age and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.310
 The family happiness seems at first 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.920
 look again until then 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.620
 mysterious events happen in the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.210
 it seems to be involved with this 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.790
 By the way, the production of the film had 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.889
 Leonardo Dicaprio his fingers in the game 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.079
 and he just has a feel for what 

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:13.149
 make good films and the film around the 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.280
 to anticipate is really good 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.439
 First of all, the film looks like 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.549
 a drama and the character drawing 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.590
 does not come too short here 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.719
 What a horror movie is not common 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.999
 But here how the fist fits your eyes 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.920
 because the film is also serious 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:27.850
 takes and quite the claim 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.859
 Follow a good one here 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.899
 character drawing to the day to lay 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.479
 this succeeds the scriptwriters here 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.490
 really good as well then later filler 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.350
 or horror elements in the story 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.450
 The whole thing does not seem to come in 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.279
 overloaded and not too cheesy in 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.689
 So my eyes tried the movie 

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:46.299
 even on the bottom of the facts 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.990
 to stay and everything realistic too 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.999
 tell 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.189
 the whole is carried by really 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.590
 outstanding actors so vera 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.389
 farmiga played kate coleman one 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.700
 great actress in mine 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:59.950
 eyes like she showed the sourcecode 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.749
 Peter Sarsgaard plays John Coleman 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.729
 her husband does it too 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.759
 really great but who really me 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.099
 but it is the companies that impressed 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.869
 The nine-year-old orphan plays first 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.430
 that's really outstanding what this one is 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.160
 young girl here on the canvas 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.220
 brings 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.810
 really a great performance too 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.430
 the other children are acting actors 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.720
 very natural in this movie 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.090
 I have the movie in English 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.040
 Original sound looked so I can not do anything 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.930
 to say about German dubbing 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.120
 the most two children actors 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.010
 not exactly the yellow of the egg is but 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.180
 as I said in the original that is really 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.920
 played great 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.020
 the film also takes on the early days 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.030
 to establish the characters themselves 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.410
 quite pleasant because so you can 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.240
 a personal bond to the 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.800
 Build character and the 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.750
 underlines again the claim of 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.760
 tell a story to this film 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.800
 want the audience to touch the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.990
 do not leave cold like a 08 15 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.420
 horrorfilm sometimes like that today 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.890
 There are definitely very brutal here 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.840
 scenes of tension but none 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.820
 to demolish but on the contrary 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.350
 The story just continues to advance 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.880
 So here I also find very pleasant 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.960
 that the splatter effects not the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.030
 gain the upper hand 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.280
 the film is running cold in the back 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.260
 then down to a tourist with 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.730
 No one would have expected that 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.530
 So I can not imagine that 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.880
 someone with this tourist expects as 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.260
 The crowd can surprise me 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.600
 that he blew me away 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.730
 and of course how it is with such a twist 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.350
 the end is matter of taste and the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.670
 further course of the story 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.200
 but i really only can 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.510
 recommend if you have a psychothriller 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.090
 because the characters want to see seriously 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.860
 Takes well with good actors 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.600
 scene really great 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.800
 written then you are here at the 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.870
 right address 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.459
 This is one of the best psychothriller 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.190
 I have seen in the last time 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.709
 A very clear recommendation from me so 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.520
 orphan the orphan this movie has it 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.410
 in itself 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.450
 you can see that in my score as well 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.459
 I give the film grandiose nine of 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.080
 ten possible points if you like the movie 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.910
 Write me write like you 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.260
 the fandet if you then just as good 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.120
 I found if you do not have the 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.220
 If you have seen this, do it 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.480
 you are on such films and I would 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.489
 Happy if you are the next time 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.730
 to be there again until then 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.730
 Nothing
