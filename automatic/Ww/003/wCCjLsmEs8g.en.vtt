today's<00:00:05.950> question<00:00:06.309> comes<00:00:06.459> from<00:00:06.609> Jamie<00:00:07.149> and<00:00:07.359> he

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
today's question comes from Jamie and he

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.140 
today's question comes from Jamie and he
asks<00:00:07.990> what's<00:00:08.860> the<00:00:09.010> difference<00:00:09.309> between<00:00:09.430> speed

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
asks what's the difference between speed

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.529 
asks what's the difference between speed
and<00:00:10.420> control<00:00:10.660> and<00:00:11.170> spar<00:00:12.119> that's<00:00:13.119> actually<00:00:13.449> an

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:13.539 
and control and spar that's actually an

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.490 
and control and spar that's actually an
excellent<00:00:13.779> question<00:00:14.049> and<00:00:14.289> it's<00:00:14.439> something

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
excellent question and it's something

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.250 
excellent question and it's something
that<00:00:14.889> I<00:00:14.920> think<00:00:15.250> we<00:00:15.490> skip<00:00:16.420> over<00:00:16.630> perhaps<00:00:16.990> a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
that I think we skip over perhaps a

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.230 
that I think we skip over perhaps a
little<00:00:17.380> too<00:00:17.500> soon<00:00:17.920> and<00:00:18.279> in<00:00:18.760> fact<00:00:18.939> I'm<00:00:19.029> going<00:00:19.150> to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
little too soon and in fact I'm going to

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.330 
little too soon and in fact I'm going to
broaden<00:00:19.599> it<00:00:19.720> out<00:00:19.810> a<00:00:19.869> little<00:00:20.109> bit<00:00:20.260> and<00:00:20.500> say<00:00:20.650> what

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
broaden it out a little bit and say what

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.279 
broaden it out a little bit and say what
is<00:00:21.520> control<00:00:22.090> what<00:00:22.360> does<00:00:22.450> it<00:00:22.570> look<00:00:22.750> like<00:00:23.020> and

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
is control what does it look like and

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.500 
is control what does it look like and
are<00:00:23.710> there<00:00:23.920> levels<00:00:24.520> of<00:00:24.670> control<00:00:25.060> that<00:00:25.180> we<00:00:25.240> can

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
are there levels of control that we can

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.380 
are there levels of control that we can
use<00:00:25.750> in<00:00:26.020> our<00:00:26.410> martial<00:00:26.800> arts<00:00:26.980> training<00:00:27.390> so

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
use in our martial arts training so

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.410 
use in our martial arts training so
first<00:00:28.690> of<00:00:28.810> all<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.949> definition<00:00:30.850> for<00:00:31.000> control

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
first of all a definition for control

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.779 
first of all a definition for control
that<00:00:31.869> might<00:00:32.079> seem<00:00:32.320> easy<00:00:32.590> is<00:00:32.829> simple<00:00:33.219> don't

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
that might seem easy is simple don't

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.270 
that might seem easy is simple don't
hurt<00:00:33.940> your<00:00:34.149> partner<00:00:34.600> or<00:00:35.020> your<00:00:35.109> opponent<00:00:35.559> but

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
hurt your partner or your opponent but

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.590 
hurt your partner or your opponent but
we<00:00:36.399> can<00:00:36.519> actually<00:00:36.609> break<00:00:36.969> it<00:00:37.089> down<00:00:37.239> into<00:00:37.449> two

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
we can actually break it down into two

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.309 
we can actually break it down into two
primary<00:00:38.199> categories<00:00:38.819> or<00:00:39.819> rules<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:41.079> first

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:41.319 
primary categories or rules the first

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:44.759 
primary categories or rules the first
rule<00:00:41.530> is<00:00:41.609> aim<00:00:42.609> accurately<00:00:43.479> and<00:00:43.870> land<00:00:44.559> your

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
rule is aim accurately and land your

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.250 
rule is aim accurately and land your
stripe<00:00:45.129> where<00:00:45.519> you're<00:00:45.670> looking<00:00:45.819> to<00:00:46.089> go<00:00:46.210> so<00:00:46.960> for

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
stripe where you're looking to go so for

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.219 
stripe where you're looking to go so for
example<00:00:47.710> if<00:00:48.609> I'm<00:00:48.819> striking<00:00:49.179> and<00:00:49.569> I'm<00:00:49.989> just

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.229 
example if I'm striking and I'm just

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.369 
example if I'm striking and I'm just
swinging<00:00:50.589> wildly<00:00:51.129> and<00:00:51.429> I<00:00:51.639> can<00:00:52.030> hit<00:00:52.239> stuff<00:00:52.659> but

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
swinging wildly and I can hit stuff but

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.289 
swinging wildly and I can hit stuff but
it<00:00:53.499> has<00:00:53.679> no<00:00:53.889> direct<00:00:54.339> impact<00:00:54.549> of<00:00:54.969> where<00:00:55.149> I'm

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
it has no direct impact of where I'm

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.219 
it has no direct impact of where I'm
aiming<00:00:55.569> then<00:00:56.319> I<00:00:56.350> lack<00:00:56.829> control<00:00:57.219> in<00:00:57.489> that<00:00:57.639> sense

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
aiming then I lack control in that sense

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:03.180 
aiming then I lack control in that sense
the<00:00:59.229> other<00:00:59.440> is<00:01:00.149> using<00:01:01.149> force<00:01:01.839> temperance<00:01:02.530> now

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
the other is using force temperance now

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.189 
the other is using force temperance now
what<00:01:03.369> that<00:01:03.399> means<00:01:03.549> is<00:01:04.030> I<00:01:04.299> may<00:01:04.780> be<00:01:04.839> very

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
what that means is I may be very

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.859 
what that means is I may be very
accurate<00:01:05.500> but<00:01:06.310> if<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.670> don't<00:01:07.060> know<00:01:07.210> how<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.420> pull

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
accurate but if I don't know how to pull

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.160 
accurate but if I don't know how to pull
my<00:01:08.170> country<00:01:08.590> my<00:01:08.800> speed<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:09.640> impact<00:01:10.120> back<00:01:10.420> then

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
my country my speed and impact back then

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.710 
my country my speed and impact back then
again<00:01:11.620> I<00:01:11.860> lack<00:01:12.100> control<00:01:12.580> so<00:01:13.090> for<00:01:13.330> example

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
again I lack control so for example

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.660 
again I lack control so for example
let's<00:01:13.930> say<00:01:14.140> I'm<00:01:14.740> aiming<00:01:15.070> for<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.310> nice<00:01:15.490> clean

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
let's say I'm aiming for a nice clean

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.430 
let's say I'm aiming for a nice clean
chest<00:01:16.060> shot<00:01:16.240> but<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.600> only<00:01:16.900> thing<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:17.140> can<00:01:17.320> do

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
chest shot but the only thing I can do

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.100 
chest shot but the only thing I can do
is<00:01:17.560> just<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.850> only<00:01:19.060> thing<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.270> can<00:01:19.450> do<00:01:19.570> is<00:01:19.690> slam

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
is just the only thing I can do is slam

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.200 
is just the only thing I can do is slam
I<00:01:20.380> don't<00:01:20.740> know<00:01:20.950> how<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.190> stop<00:01:21.490> from<00:01:21.790> hitting<00:01:22.000> my

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
I don't know how to stop from hitting my

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
I don't know how to stop from hitting my
partner<00:01:23.050> hard<00:01:23.320> then<00:01:24.310> again<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:24.970> lack<00:01:25.420> control

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
partner hard then again I lack control

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.950 
partner hard then again I lack control
so<00:01:26.860> using<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:27.700> we<00:01:28.000> can<00:01:28.330> answer<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.930> question

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
so using that we can answer the question

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.080 
so using that we can answer the question
rather<00:01:29.500> directly<00:01:29.980> what's<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.760> difference

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
rather directly what's the difference

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.530 
rather directly what's the difference
between<00:01:31.450> speed<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.230> control<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:32.890> sparring

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
between speed and control and sparring

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.140 
between speed and control and sparring
now<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:34.570> can<00:01:34.900> hit<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.260> my<00:01:35.890> partner<00:01:36.640> here<00:01:36.820> very

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
now I can hit this my partner here very

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.450 
now I can hit this my partner here very
fast<00:01:37.480> so<00:01:37.960> for<00:01:38.500> example<00:01:38.830> if<00:01:38.920> I'm<00:01:39.070> if<00:01:39.310> I'm

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
fast so for example if I'm if I'm

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.420 
fast so for example if I'm if I'm
sparring<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.630> just<00:01:40.870> come<00:01:41.050> in<00:01:41.230> you<00:01:41.500> know<00:01:41.530> and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
sparring and I just come in you know and

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.460 
sparring and I just come in you know and
I<00:01:42.700> just<00:01:42.910> punch<00:01:43.240> them<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.570> face<00:01:43.780> very<00:01:44.140> fast

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
I just punch them in the face very fast

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.120 
I just punch them in the face very fast
that<00:01:45.190> was<00:01:45.370> speed<00:01:45.640> but<00:01:46.450> if<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:47.230> can<00:01:47.560> come<00:01:47.770> in<00:01:47.950> with

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
that was speed but if I can come in with

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.690 
that was speed but if I can come in with
that<00:01:48.159> same<00:01:48.580> amount<00:01:48.880> in<00:01:49.120> and<00:01:49.600> just<00:01:50.290> miss<00:01:50.700> then

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
that same amount in and just miss then

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.870 
that same amount in and just miss then
I'm<00:01:52.030> using<00:01:52.210> control<00:01:52.870> at<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.230> same<00:01:53.260> time<00:01:53.880> so

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
I'm using control at the same time so

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.210 
I'm using control at the same time so
that<00:01:55.090> concludes<00:01:55.270> how<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.690> might<00:01:55.990> define

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
that concludes how you might define

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.370 
that concludes how you might define
control<00:01:57.220> in<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.550> very<00:01:57.730> base<00:01:58.030> level<00:01:58.180> but<00:01:59.170> let's

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
control in a very base level but let's

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.050 
control in a very base level but let's
take<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.980> next<00:02:00.100> level<00:02:00.550> how<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:00.790> might

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
take it to the next level how you might

after a couple of years when students

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.920 
after a couple of years when students
get<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.310> hang<00:02:48.489> of<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.760> they'll<00:02:49.600> start<00:02:49.720> to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
get the hang of it they'll start to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.720 
get the hang of it they'll start to
speed<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.410> up<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.709> make<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.860> look<00:02:51.100> better<00:02:51.310> and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
speed it up and make it look better and

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.540 
speed it up and make it look better and
crisper<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.300> faster<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.950> keep<00:02:54.070> on<00:02:54.220> coming

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
crisper and faster so keep on coming

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.070 
crisper and faster so keep on coming
today<00:02:54.670> we'll<00:02:55.090> eventually<00:02:55.360> start<00:02:55.810> looking

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
today we'll eventually start looking

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.290 
today we'll eventually start looking
something<00:02:56.770> like<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.130> where<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> strike

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
something like this where the strike

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.890 
something like this where the strike
will<00:02:58.510> come<00:02:58.720> in<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.080> we'll<00:02:59.170> block<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.400> then

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
will come in and we'll block and then

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.260 
will come in and we'll block and then
and<00:03:01.900> we'll<00:03:02.080> strike<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.709> return<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:04.030> next

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
and we'll strike and return and the next

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.640 
and we'll strike and return and the next
punch<00:03:04.480> will<00:03:04.630> come<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.900> we'll<00:03:05.020> block<00:03:05.230> and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
punch will come in we'll block and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.740 
punch will come in we'll block and
strike<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.510> return<00:03:08.280> now<00:03:09.280> on<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.420> surface

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
strike and return now on the surface

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.539 
strike and return now on the surface
that<00:03:10.900> looks<00:03:10.959> like<00:03:11.320> X<00:03:11.530> looks<00:03:11.950> like<00:03:12.040> excellent

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
that looks like X looks like excellent

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.140 
that looks like X looks like excellent
control<00:03:12.880> but<00:03:13.690> there's<00:03:13.870> some<00:03:14.049> problems<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.910> you

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
control but there's some problems if you

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.750 
control but there's some problems if you
notice<00:03:16.540> if<00:03:16.720> we<00:03:16.840> slow<00:03:17.080> things<00:03:17.350> down<00:03:17.440> here<00:03:17.950> when

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
notice if we slow things down here when

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.289 
notice if we slow things down here when
I<00:03:19.060> do<00:03:19.630> my<00:03:19.810> block<00:03:20.320> I'm<00:03:20.830> routing<00:03:21.519> into<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.880> stance

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
I do my block I'm routing into a stance

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.590 
I do my block I'm routing into a stance
and<00:03:22.750> then<00:03:23.560> I'm<00:03:24.040> using<00:03:24.400> my<00:03:24.670> innate<00:03:24.970> ability<00:03:25.480> to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
and then I'm using my innate ability to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.449 
and then I'm using my innate ability to
calculate<00:03:25.810> distance<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:27.160> punch<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.060> Miss<00:03:29.459> now

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
calculate distance to punch and Miss now

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.940 
calculate distance to punch and Miss now
I'm<00:03:30.790> missing<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.630> that's<00:03:31.959> good<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.500> I'm

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
I'm missing and that's good and I'm

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.550 
I'm missing and that's good and I'm
striking<00:03:33.250> fast<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.060> that's<00:03:34.239> good<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:35.470> only

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
striking fast and that's good the only

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.830 
striking fast and that's good the only
problem<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.250> this<00:03:36.790> strike<00:03:37.209> has<00:03:37.420> no<00:03:37.660> real

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
problem is this strike has no real

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.990 
problem is this strike has no real
functionality<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:39.190> has<00:03:39.400> no<00:03:39.640> penetration

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
functionality it has no penetration

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.020 
functionality it has no penetration
power<00:03:40.739> because<00:03:41.739> I'm<00:03:41.920> rooting<00:03:42.370> down<00:03:42.519> into<00:03:42.580> my

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
power because I'm rooting down into my

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.170 
power because I'm rooting down into my
stance<00:03:43.299> too<00:03:43.630> soon<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.640> maximum

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
stance too soon this is the maximum

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.710 
stance too soon this is the maximum
amount<00:03:46.480> of<00:03:46.959> punch<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.920> I<00:03:47.950> have<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.640> might<00:03:49.540> be

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
amount of punch that I have I might be

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.479 
amount of punch that I have I might be
able<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.019> lean<00:03:50.290> in<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.739> touch<00:03:50.920> him<00:03:51.160> but<00:03:51.310> then

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
able to lean in and touch him but then

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.490 
able to lean in and touch him but then
I've<00:03:51.670> lost<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.420> whole<00:03:52.570> functionality<00:03:53.320> of<00:03:53.380> the

I've lost the whole functionality of the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.940 
I've lost the whole functionality of the

stance so in reality over years if I

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.550 
stance so in reality over years if I
never<00:03:57.160> learned<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.549> adapt<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.560> am

training bad habits and something very
important<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.829> keep<00:04:02.980> in<00:04:03.160> mind<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.579> muscle

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
important to keep in mind is muscle

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.930 
important to keep in mind is muscle
memory<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:05.019> very<00:04:05.350> real<00:04:06.070> issue<00:04:06.489> when<00:04:06.880> it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
memory is a very real issue when it

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.240 
memory is a very real issue when it
comes<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.540> using<00:04:08.230> techniques<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.860> times<00:04:09.070> of

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
comes to using techniques and times of

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.160 
comes to using techniques and times of
high<00:04:09.400> stress<00:04:09.600> so<00:04:10.600> if<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.930> practice<00:04:11.530> this<00:04:11.980> a

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
high stress so if you practice this a

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.510 
high stress so if you practice this a
thousand<00:04:14.170> times<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.739> it's<00:04:14.860> burned<00:04:15.099> into<00:04:15.310> your

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
thousand times and it's burned into your

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.949 
thousand times and it's burned into your
muscle<00:04:15.819> memory<00:04:15.910> there's<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.570> very

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
muscle memory there's a very

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.300 
muscle memory there's a very
real<00:04:17.049> chance<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.470> you're<00:04:17.769> not<00:04:17.799> going<00:04:18.190> to

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
real chance that you're not going to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.029 
real chance that you're not going to
automatically<00:04:18.940> adjust<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.410> being<00:04:20.709> able<00:04:20.829> to

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
automatically adjust in to being able to

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.670 
automatically adjust in to being able to
strike<00:04:21.340> at<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.579> right<00:04:21.609> distance<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:23.410> that

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
strike at the right distance so that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.770 
strike at the right distance so that
being<00:04:23.889> said<00:04:24.009> when<00:04:24.910> we<00:04:25.090> practice<00:04:25.630> our

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
being said when we practice our

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.800 
being said when we practice our
techniques<00:04:26.319> first<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.490> all<00:04:27.639> we<00:04:28.300> need<00:04:28.509> to<00:04:28.569> make

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
techniques first of all we need to make

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.650 
techniques first of all we need to make
sure<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.229> we<00:04:29.440> strike<00:04:30.009> with<00:04:30.660> penetration

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
sure that we strike with penetration

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.860 
sure that we strike with penetration
available<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:33.400> means<00:04:33.639> instead<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.509> striking

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
available that means instead of striking

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.990 
available that means instead of striking
like<00:04:35.289> this<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:36.099> need<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.180> strike<00:04:37.509> like<00:04:37.810> this

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
like this I need to strike like this

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.029 
like this I need to strike like this
because<00:04:40.000> from<00:04:40.210> here<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.810> can<00:04:41.229> still<00:04:41.560> move<00:04:41.800> my

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
because from here I can still move my

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.499 
because from here I can still move my
hand<00:04:42.340> through<00:04:42.699> and<00:04:43.620> strike<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.770> target<00:04:45.509> so

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
hand through and strike the target so

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.589 
hand through and strike the target so
using<00:04:46.840> keeping<00:04:47.440> that<00:04:47.560> mine<00:04:47.880> this<00:04:48.880> would<00:04:49.180> be<00:04:49.360> a

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
using keeping that mine this would be a

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.670 
using keeping that mine this would be a
bad<00:04:49.990> use<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.560> control<00:04:51.039> if<00:04:51.430> I'm<00:04:51.639> here<00:04:52.680> that

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
bad use of control if I'm here that

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.490 
bad use of control if I'm here that
would<00:04:53.889> be<00:04:53.919> not<00:04:54.280> good<00:04:54.550> however<00:04:55.389> this<00:04:56.080> would<00:04:56.320> be

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
would be not good however this would be

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.409 
would be not good however this would be
much<00:04:56.680> better<00:04:57.630> here<00:04:59.580> because<00:05:00.580> as<00:05:00.820> I'm<00:05:01.060> striking

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
much better here because as I'm striking

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.320 
much better here because as I'm striking
I'm<00:05:01.949> pulling<00:05:03.840> with<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:05.080> still<00:05:05.680> available

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
I'm pulling with that still available

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.210 
I'm pulling with that still available
and<00:05:07.330> that<00:05:07.360> brings<00:05:07.690> us<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.870> our<00:05:08.139> next<00:05:08.380> point

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
and that brings us to our next point

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.939 
and that brings us to our next point
which<00:05:09.580> is<00:05:09.699> very<00:05:09.729> important<00:05:10.530> using<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.650> stance

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
which is very important using the stance

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.570 
which is very important using the stance
for<00:05:12.659> force<00:05:13.659> momentum<00:05:14.349> into<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.310> target

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
for force momentum into the target

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.820 
for force momentum into the target
instead<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.449> just<00:05:16.780> rooting<00:05:17.229> into<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.590> ground

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
instead of just rooting into the ground

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.029 
instead of just rooting into the ground
if<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:19.000> hit<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.479> deep<00:05:19.750> stance<00:05:20.139> and<00:05:20.470> strike<00:05:21.009> like

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
if I hit a deep stance and strike like

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.409 
if I hit a deep stance and strike like
this<00:05:22.050> then<00:05:23.050> I'm<00:05:23.380> using<00:05:23.800> some<00:05:24.759> hip<00:05:25.000> some

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
this then I'm using some hip some

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.499 
this then I'm using some hip some
shoulder<00:05:25.840> some<00:05:26.110> arm<00:05:26.380> in<00:05:27.190> order<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.639> strike<00:05:27.940> I'm

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
shoulder some arm in order to strike I'm

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.659 
shoulder some arm in order to strike I'm
not<00:05:28.930> letting<00:05:29.320> my<00:05:29.349> entire<00:05:29.800> body<00:05:30.190> weight<00:05:30.430> go

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
not letting my entire body weight go

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.570 
not letting my entire body weight go
through<00:05:31.000> into<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.479> opponent<00:05:32.039> instead<00:05:33.039> I<00:05:33.400> need

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
through into the opponent instead I need

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.189 
through into the opponent instead I need
to<00:05:33.699> calculate<00:05:33.909> distance<00:05:34.570> so<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:34.900> way<00:05:35.050> I'm

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
to calculate distance so that way I'm

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.719 
to calculate distance so that way I'm
moving<00:05:35.440> into<00:05:35.940> optical<00:05:36.940> range<00:05:37.300> so<00:05:38.110> that<00:05:38.349> way<00:05:38.500> I

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
moving into optical range so that way I

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.570 
moving into optical range so that way I
strike<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:40.030> settle<00:05:40.479> at<00:05:40.659> the<00:05:40.870> same<00:05:41.110> time<00:05:41.580> so

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
strike and settle at the same time so

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.249 
strike and settle at the same time so
the<00:05:42.729> difference<00:05:43.120> being<00:05:43.389> from<00:05:43.690> here<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:43.990> can

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
the difference being from here I can

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.839 
the difference being from here I can
strike<00:05:45.449> like<00:05:46.449> that<00:05:46.479> or<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.919> can<00:05:48.130> sit<00:05:48.430> I<00:05:48.460> can

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
strike like that or I can sit I can

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.870 
strike like that or I can sit I can
shift<00:05:49.180> in<00:05:49.419> and<00:05:49.599> strike<00:05:49.930> here<00:05:53.880> significant

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
shift in and strike here significant

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.790 
shift in and strike here significant
different<00:05:55.180> power<00:05:55.360> the<00:05:55.810> exact<00:05:56.259> same<00:05:56.530> body

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
different power the exact same body

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.320 
different power the exact same body
movement<00:05:57.509> so<00:05:58.509> if<00:05:58.750> I'm<00:05:58.960> striking<00:05:59.729> with<00:06:00.729> proper

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
movement so if I'm striking with proper

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.860 
movement so if I'm striking with proper
control<00:06:01.840> in<00:06:02.139> an<00:06:03.039> effective<00:06:03.610> means<00:06:03.880> what<00:06:04.750> I'm

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
control in an effective means what I'm

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.959 
control in an effective means what I'm
doing<00:06:05.409> is<00:06:05.590> I'm<00:06:05.860> getting<00:06:06.159> into<00:06:06.550> proper

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
doing is I'm getting into proper

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:08.040 
doing is I'm getting into proper
distance<00:06:07.300> with<00:06:07.509> my<00:06:07.659> body

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
distance with my body

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.310 
distance with my body
so<00:06:08.860> that<00:06:08.979> I<00:06:09.009> have<00:06:09.250> body<00:06:10.090> weight<00:06:10.419> shifting<00:06:11.050> into

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
so that I have body weight shifting into

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.430 
so that I have body weight shifting into
my<00:06:11.440> opponent<00:06:11.949> and<00:06:12.150> strike<00:06:13.150> availability<00:06:13.990> but

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
my opponent and strike availability but

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.070 
my opponent and strike availability but
at<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:14.680> same<00:06:14.919> time<00:06:15.340> as<00:06:15.669> I'm<00:06:16.389> striking<00:06:16.719> I'm

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
at the same time as I'm striking I'm

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.490 
at the same time as I'm striking I'm
pulling<00:06:17.979> back<00:06:18.190> and<00:06:18.430> not<00:06:18.699> hitting<00:06:19.030> so<00:06:19.990> instead

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
pulling back and not hitting so instead

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.860 
pulling back and not hitting so instead
of<00:06:20.560> this<00:06:21.419> it<00:06:22.419> looks<00:06:22.690> more<00:06:22.930> like<00:06:23.139> this

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.720 

now<00:06:28.040> one<00:06:29.040> final<00:06:29.460> point<00:06:30.380> if<00:06:31.380> I<00:06:31.650> train<00:06:32.100> for<00:06:32.400> years

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
now one final point if I train for years

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.110 
now one final point if I train for years
constantly<00:06:33.630> pulling<00:06:34.410> punches<00:06:34.640> then<00:06:35.640> as<00:06:36.000> I

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
constantly pulling punches then as I

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.420 
constantly pulling punches then as I
mentioned<00:06:36.180> earlier<00:06:36.810> even<00:06:37.350> if<00:06:37.560> I'm<00:06:37.710> training

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
mentioned earlier even if I'm training

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.430 
mentioned earlier even if I'm training
my<00:06:38.760> strength<00:06:39.090> properly<00:06:39.690> there's<00:06:40.110> a<00:06:40.200> decent

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
my strength properly there's a decent

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.810 
my strength properly there's a decent
chance<00:06:40.680> that<00:06:41.100> in<00:06:41.250> a<00:06:41.340> high-stress<00:06:41.700> situation

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
chance that in a high-stress situation

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.880 
chance that in a high-stress situation
I'm<00:06:42.480> actually<00:06:42.720> going<00:06:43.140> to<00:06:43.290> pull<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:43.650> punch

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
I'm actually going to pull the punch

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.560 
I'm actually going to pull the punch
just<00:06:44.640> because<00:06:44.910> that's<00:06:45.030> what<00:06:45.210> I'm<00:06:45.330> used<00:06:45.510> to

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
just because that's what I'm used to

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.750 
just because that's what I'm used to
doing<00:06:45.780> so<00:06:46.740> when<00:06:46.890> you<00:06:46.980> train<00:06:47.280> in<00:06:47.430> this<00:06:47.580> way

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
doing so when you train in this way

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.480 
doing so when you train in this way
especially<00:06:48.270> against<00:06:48.630> the<00:06:48.660> bag<00:06:49.160> it's<00:06:50.160> a<00:06:50.280> very

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
especially against the bag it's a very

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.190 
especially against the bag it's a very
good<00:06:50.670> idea<00:06:50.760> to<00:06:50.970> rotate<00:06:51.680> control<00:06:52.680> and<00:06:53.180> strike

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
good idea to rotate control and strike

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.510 
good idea to rotate control and strike
so<00:06:55.200> that<00:06:55.380> way<00:06:55.530> I'm<00:06:55.710> using<00:06:55.980> the<00:06:56.130> exact<00:06:56.490> same

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
so that way I'm using the exact same

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.180 
so that way I'm using the exact same
body<00:06:57.000> movement<00:06:57.600> for<00:06:58.200> my<00:06:58.350> control<00:06:58.770> technique

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
body movement for my control technique

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.630 
body movement for my control technique
as<00:06:59.370> is<00:07:00.120> my<00:07:00.450> strike<00:07:01.130> so<00:07:02.130> this<00:07:02.250> is<00:07:02.370> very<00:07:02.550> good

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640 
as is my strike so this is very good

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.660 
as is my strike so this is very good
because<00:07:02.820> then<00:07:03.720> I<00:07:03.750> don't<00:07:04.020> have<00:07:04.350> a<00:07:04.560> dojo<00:07:05.160> mindset

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670 
because then I don't have a dojo mindset

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.450 
because then I don't have a dojo mindset
and<00:07:05.820> a<00:07:06.300> street<00:07:06.570> mindset<00:07:07.020> all<00:07:07.590> I<00:07:07.650> have<00:07:07.980> is<00:07:08.160> one

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
and a street mindset all I have is one

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.300 
and a street mindset all I have is one
effective<00:07:09.390> mindset<00:07:10.010> so<00:07:11.010> that<00:07:11.160> looks

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
effective mindset so that looks

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:21.140 
effective mindset so that looks
something<00:07:11.580> like<00:07:11.730> this<00:07:12.000> from<00:07:12.450> here<00:07:20.060> so<00:07:21.060> I'm

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
something like this from here so I'm

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.040 
something like this from here so I'm
using<00:07:21.330> the<00:07:21.510> same<00:07:21.780> mechanics<00:07:22.470> both<00:07:22.710> times
