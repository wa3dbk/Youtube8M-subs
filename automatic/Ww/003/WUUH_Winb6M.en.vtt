00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.189
 today 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.490
 Ana 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.170
 the very interesting progression course that happens 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.930
 these conversions extended eyebrows dominant is subsidy is second 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.570
 cadence 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.380
 what happens to the extended progressions 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.729
 we will see, for example, they have 50 mins given 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.189
 five of the wounded five of the 5 5 to solve a lot 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.930
 or replacement of 5 150 solve a thing 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.910
 even though he never won 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.990
 they can mix with the mind can suddenly make the five of the sub-5 of the 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.990
 always consub 5 and beyond and exploring these things 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.530
 but the sadness 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.610
 does not start suddenly 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.540
 I do not give it 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.540
 so I've been thinking of 5 to 5 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.490
 I have pain with seven 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.200
 I went back to play far 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.700
 seventh infarct 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.460
 it would be another yes 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 What would solve RondÃ´nia I was wrong with 7 thousand 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.710
 other five 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.729
 I will settle where I have wronged myself with seven 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.540
 other five that prevail then 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.500
 What happens in these cases 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.920
 we have a settlement agreement accustomed to cordial 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.960
 and there we have workshops and on the sidewalks cause of risks up to 3 to 2 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.930
 I've been two comparsas one of them 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.570
 papuda is sector can use dominant 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.210
 they can even help 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.020
 4 using two in each 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.260
 I use them to use a dominant at each note each time 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.050
 and it will always come 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.560
 so for example 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.259
 if an accordion solution is suddenly a greater gift when the airplane 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 he does not care about slow steps in the staff 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.920
 she can do something about that another 5 or 5 five of her six 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.139
 so suddenly I'm going to use I chose to use 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.399
 according to them 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.809
 so I can use four second policemen put him the 2nd 5 even with 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.339
 bottom step 2 5 2 5 and 5 5 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.209
 He really thought that I did not give 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.949
 so if I tell 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.939
 2 5 employers 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.889
 I can do a sequence 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.819
 and the beginning of a beginning 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:36.650
 any 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.989
 after this sequence that I 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.249
 flat minor 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.019
 2 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.019
 of lost steps final result 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.779
 which consequently is the 2 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:55.549
 of someone being two of maeda de miguel grasses 2 5 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.339
 and I solved 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.489
 there is less would be the 2nd of someone then solved 2 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.059
 5 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.579
 the block is smaller 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.789
 these would be two 5 ae 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:12.269
 there is no major sector problem in the world 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.589
 2 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.489
 with them 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.399
 4 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:22.929
 finally 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.259
 I solved the world 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:27.859
 I can do multiple sequences show second cadence kings 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.109
 Mixing what I want I can do all of a sudden 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.299
 skin 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.549
 What do you talk about? 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.809
 there I can think of these made an effort of 5km bracalli 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.229
 2 5 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.749
 but one can see why one month after the landing of cargo 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.209
 5 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.599
 the woman 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.339
 2 the psd would actually not go up 2 the servers 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.339
 but the mi5 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.619
 upload 2 - mi5 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.409
 after 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.639
 5 other 5 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.029
 one should not let those associated with the 15 kilometer 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:16.729
 it is information the endless ways you have to combine 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.349
 these 5 2 5 fit 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.930
 of form 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.630
 extended to ok just need to see what you have 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.380
 of space for you to do this if you want and if you want what you want 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.289
 want to use 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.840
 if you want to use the scientists to 1 2% in the south 5 consumers 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.680
 in general we ride 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.199
 a kind of graphic of what we want 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.270
 so I want to do 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.520
 blocks 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.250
 d2 subsidy then there has to be a scheme of forme an advice do these 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.069
 2005 blocks while strap the chord resolution I want 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.169
 certain questions then 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.529
 the course will use all of these five subsidies and 2 5 and 7 7 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:03.189
 we made up to this 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.479
 the first thing 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.729
 this will have your music that such regional 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.870
 you can make substitutions according to the functions - the functions 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.189
 huh 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.050
 you can do the replacement 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.780
 by tite chords is the same function the agreement is replacing 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.620
 and you can add 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.249
 the two five of these agreements you replace 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:29.270
 okay 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.849
 so for example 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.150
 in simple music then 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.080
 Maria 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.080
 but did not move 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.889
 O 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.720
 O 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.360
 to want we have in the first degree after he made the only 4 dominant ones 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.099
 wine and dominant back to a 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:07.129
 I do not know sponsorship second degree according to him 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.770
 presented his house the next day way 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.139
 the case 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.589
 the year in a recent period 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.589
 2 2 the observers 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.539
 the elevators 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.819
 your 5-kilo substitute with five now acts 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.669
 the building 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.999
 we had 5 where I wanted now I go with a 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:36.999
 Suddenly his souza subsidy 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.589
 the whole collection 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:47.749
 heals 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:51.009
 no management 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.779
 the term of five five 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:56.139
 under five in the world 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.919
 as 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.469
 residents 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:04.960
 the five of 4 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.399
 after the rumors 

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:10.409
 t2 substitute if it is resolved 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:13.770
 5 3 nani 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.939
 rose 5 5 2% 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:19.939
 at five 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:24.899
 the players 

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:26.729
 5 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.729
 yea 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.860
 We leverage people to change 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.669
 dramatically with harmony 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:37.589
 and ok 

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:41.460
 in fact what we are doing what we are doing is not 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.880
 many people said that the actual exam 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.749
 Harmonic sophistication 

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:53.609
 I'm not altering mine in harmony yes progression terms of a 

00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:54.069
 tonic
