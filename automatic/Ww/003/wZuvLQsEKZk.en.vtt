 your apps mania you already know a program 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.420
 where every monday wednesday and friday 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.429
 We collect the best applications of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.990
 moment and we have very new 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.639

 comfortable leave your I like that 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.240
 we start 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.340
 today we are going to start with a browser 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.530
 perhaps the fastest browser in the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.880
 Galaxy available for iOS for Android 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.200
 and I love it for all its 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.420
 functions that have guys but is that 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.800
 It is also very fast and in itself 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.390
 this was not enough for us 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.250
 we have an option called speed 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.290
 dial with which we are going to be able 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.540
 memorize web pages to access 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 she much faster yet but more 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.950
 little things if we want speed we have the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.290
 option of text only in this way is not 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.600
 they are going to load the images only 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.070
 are going to load extra text load and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.019
 This way we will be able to load 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.280
 the pages much faster no more 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.350
 little things we have here guys 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.059
 we have a night mode because we are in the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 bed and to be able to read more comfortably 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.809
 let's put it in day mode we have 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.610
 also a super download manager 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.260
 interesting with wifi and schering for 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.510
 move from the computer to your 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.880
 ios android device the way more 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.159
 fast and then at the end posts videos 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.560
 music and images to house them in this 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.000
 small file manager we do not have 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.229
 more little things guys because from here we 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.820
 let's find the option to be able 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.340
 install themes or even power 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.829
 synchronize everything this whole application what 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.170
 downloads the bookmarks and such 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.470
 at the end then with the cloud not 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.960
 and with gestures let's go to the tab 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.450
 next or let's go to the tab 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.670
 previous with two fingers down we're going 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.009
 to open a new tab we are in the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.229
 macbook mars notice us from 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.049
 here we are going to have so good we can 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.820
 make folders in the style of ios 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.619
 we take and drag to the folder and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.450
 we will be able to do it this way 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.430
 create and organize our burn 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.680
 bookmarks in a much more way 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.479
 efficient guys here we have good then 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.729
 at the end the view of all the windows 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.069
 that we have open but in case this does not 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.560
 a very fast browser was enough 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.119
 as I say we filial them to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.250
 load faster still all the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.259
 pages the most accessed in addition 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.239
 we have a download manager that is 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.190
 hyper mega fast guys we are in the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.140
 macupdate page and note that from 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.700
 here we download in a way 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.410
 incredibly fast so any 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.030
 file and then we have it here 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.410
 available and guys and girls so that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.750
 you can do what you want 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.080
 I downloaded for example mac from the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.549
 beta 3 of the reader beta 3 and from 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.010
 here, notice that I can share it 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.260
 good with any by telegram 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.150
 sorted by dropbox where you 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.730
 you want for the end to pass it to the great 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.200
 no doubt boys girls the best 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.060
 web browser that we can have 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.770
 available on a mobile device at 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.710
 minus the fastest 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.350
 good guys we have already for ios for 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.870
 android hungry pÃ©rez 2 maybe good without 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.120
 doubt is the best hungry best until the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.460
 date but maybe because of course blond has 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.200
 exploited both your franchise that is a 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.000
 little bit more the same we have animations 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.010
 new we have new gameplay we have 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.960
 new birds we have a new system 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.460
 card is very similar although the 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.100
 playability to what we already had before 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.320
 no but clear at the end as I say 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.540
 Rovio has exploited both his franchise 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.880
 that no longer surprises and in this game a 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.560
 Although it is the best of all not 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.960
 just shine as much as it should 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.000
 although no doubt for the fans of angry 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.100
 birds without a doubt we are among the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.050
 best of all and will make us pass 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.430
 hours and hours of fun we have 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.870
 news guys not only the 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.730
 animations as you are seeing but that 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.860
 now each level is divided into two 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.720
 phases and we have to be very careful 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.260
 because now with the new system of 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.000
 letters 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.460
 we already know that each bird 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.290
 has a different and clear skills 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.940
 it depends there are some birds that can 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.070
 break the glass better others break 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.630
 better the stone and lime not good then 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.510
 in the end the roll is that we have to 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.069
 save the corresponding birds 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.290
 and more successful for each other 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.180
 we can pass each one of these 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.709
 levels of these visions is very 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.200
 funny guys girls I recommend it 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.280
 If you are fans, you will love it, even though I 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.959
 I tell you it 's more of the same 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.000
 always thought that the best 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.120
 messaging applications are those 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.010
 that allow us to talk without chat is a 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.720
 new messaging application guys and 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.850
 is very curious because with her we are going to 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.620
 power we will not be able to chat we are going to 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.959
 to be able to write we will not be able to pass 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.700
 only link we will be able to talk is 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.290
 a conventional application with it 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.019
 let's be able to us 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.019
 talk to our friends create groups 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.069
 Well let's stop we will see what is 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.439
 talking joey good we the 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.300
 application is very good and simply 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.219
 it serves to speak we have created 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.810
 a group we can listen to what is being 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:38.430
 saying either we keeping 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.199
 clicked here we will be able to talk 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.270
 notice that we can also send 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.460
 stickers but as audio what 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.139
 we would send would be a sticker as you are 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.909
 listening is very good application 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.169
 guys because you're not going to waste your time 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.289
 they are going to waste our time 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.689
 talking and such you do not just go to 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.759
 talk and you forget and for and to 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.229
 listen as nothing simply the jce a 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.240
 little button and you will listen to the messages 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.370
 that your friends leave you while 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.840
 you do other tasks and we consume 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.389
 time I really like this format of 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.770
 ideas only for the voice guys 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.389
 girls, nothing, I hope you liked it 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.490
 that you can support us with your 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.770
 like and here I say goodbye until next time 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.360
 you have something that you are good to me 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.379
 Fucked up I want to teach a little bit and 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.379
 workspace
