00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.379
 well it it everybody knows it 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.570
 scared we find ourselves today for 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.040
 to speak of the sacrieur that it takes 5.6 me 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.960
 claes that was not basic on the game 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.720
 dofus to when Y'avait not his 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.279
 crypt waits does not have to dope 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.180
 generally a long time ago and 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.349
 that may be why there is a 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.730
 peculiarity at the level of 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.470
 sacred at the level of their stats one of 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.239
 vitality it gives them two it's 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.220
 really a big exception is rather 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.380
 a strong point and that's what gives them 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.180
 this little role of tank is almost 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.469
 all the sacrifices have armored life and 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.370
 often I see sacred ones 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.590
 do not care about my mouth because they have 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.170
 still more than eight months fucking this 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.790
 annoys me about dofus who in the past 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.410
 even more distant klein during 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.960
 twenty-nine the coronations there were 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.030
 infinite chastisements during a round all 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.810
 the bush was carried out remained during 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.340
 all the fight sent stuff rather 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.020
 huge often small sacrifices 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.150
 stroll to punishments over 3000 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.400
 of skill everything was normal at the time 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.770
 the fate of his crisis is still good 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.049
 changed since but by their role do you 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.119
 do not worry about stuffing themselves sacrificing themselves 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.500
 have always known how to do it sometimes 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.280
 the impression that they may have a little 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 too much no 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.450
 I want to commit suicide because 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.040
 it's cool death birds too cool and 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.420
 thanks to their punishment the esa creating a 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.580
 big punching force in every 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.229
 element and can afford to 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.600
 leave the stages for little gets 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.909
 the more their resistance and vitality this 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.110
 that makes this really powerful and 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.090
 which is very annoying to the impression 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.440
 three goals to two runs ever and 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.320
 when it goes down it would be 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.520
 that a little boom is the purest 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.190
 good after a little flaw anyway 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.659
 for his crisis and at a distance it's 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.460
 for that I often write you 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.300
 asked to cra come to their bodies at 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.550
 body 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.600
 my little hope but do you 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.430
 do not worry going to be created even 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.620
 found some small techniques for 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.970
 counter this technical weakness number 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.950
 a 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.000
 spam invokes them to style transport 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.790
 more easily to get closer 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.560
 the technical enemy number 2 play with 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.990
 a bow 1 the aroma of the arcs nice for the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.300
 sacred it was rather useful and the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.800
 technical but in 3 stand at the bottom 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.200
 lama for this ride not really the 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.190
 most logical technique of dofus 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.800
 brothel this technique is one of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.820
 worse the point of view that we managed to 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.560
 remove the water but it must 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.830
 go to the bottom 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.630
 unbearable and that plays like that 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.130
 good I talked a lot about pvp with the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.110
 sacraments also puts in it they are 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.120
 known for their big pharma frigost 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.470
 for example sometimes we really have a 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.490
 present are boots in so much that 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.950
 his wife quickly etc 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.110
 but so little trick today in 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.150
 company to roger the head of the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.160
 anti-bot fight that will explain us 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.760
 how to do that are boots 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.440
 or simple players hello I then 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.920
 tell all your technique what is it 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.830
 that it is 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.750
 it's very easy, you just have to 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.340
 tell your old bone to create a mp 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.709
 for example because the general 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.160
 so after two types of answers 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:58.420
 possible to the wretched princess that 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.550
 answer we do not pinch too much of a priori 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.069
 no answer and so many others because 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.540
 that here is the dad box three options 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.120
 of play take you or double tg tell you 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.500
 of course it's a player 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.590
 so that's the advice for his 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.660
 written session or simply a pear bot 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.730
 to havas thank you roger for his advice of 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.500
 professionals and so that's it 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.840
 for the sacred you will understand 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.180
 this class cali the rush the time that 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.140
 is the big strike force 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.239
 unfortunately to some players who 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.440
 have not yet understood 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.459
 but here are more and more hazards do not hesitate 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.260
 not like the breasts 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.260
 if you liked it was it can 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.120
 we 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.590
 no
