every<00:01:45.620> topic<00:01:45.920> every<00:01:46.400> year<00:01:46.700> we<00:01:47.060> have<00:01:47.240> three

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
every topic every year we have three

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.110 
every topic every year we have three
topics<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.470> at<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.250> end<00:01:49.400> of<00:01:49.490> each<00:01:49.580> topic<00:01:49.850> we

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
topics and at the end of each topic we

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.330 
topics and at the end of each topic we
have<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.630> sketchbook<00:01:51.590> we<00:01:52.040> do<00:01:52.160> like<00:01:52.310> a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
have a sketchbook we do like a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.240 
have a sketchbook we do like a
presentation<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.570> show<00:01:54.380> all<00:01:54.650> of<00:01:54.860> our<00:01:54.980> like

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
presentation to show all of our like

thinking<00:01:55.730> through<00:01:56.060> each<00:01:56.270> stage<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.870> the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
thinking through each stage of the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.860 
thinking through each stage of the
project<00:01:57.170> we<00:01:57.860> have<00:01:57.890> final<00:01:58.370> boards<00:01:58.910> of<00:01:59.480> capsule

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
project we have final boards of capsule

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.140 
project we have final boards of capsule
collections<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:00.980> they<00:02:01.550> also<00:02:01.730> have<00:02:01.940> come

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
collections and then they also have come

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.940 
collections and then they also have come
together<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.750> then<00:02:02.870> they'll<00:02:03.230> go<00:02:03.440> through<00:02:03.770> on

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
together and then they'll go through on

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.500 
together and then they'll go through on
and<00:02:04.220> they'll<00:02:04.340> give<00:02:04.520> us<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.820> must<00:02:04.970> we<00:02:05.150> don't<00:02:05.330> have

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
and they'll give us a must we don't have

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.050 
and they'll give us a must we don't have
exams<00:02:05.930> but<00:02:06.740> we<00:02:06.830> have<00:02:07.010> like<00:02:07.250> three<00:02:07.640> separate

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
exams but we have like three separate

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.240 
exams but we have like three separate
topics<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.719> the<00:02:08.810> year<00:02:08.959> that<00:02:09.769> we<00:02:09.859> just<00:02:10.009> worked

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
topics in the year that we just worked

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.120 
topics in the year that we just worked
awesome

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
awesome

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.670 
awesome
on<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> mark<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.420> first<00:02:12.630> project<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.320> had

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
on a mark for the first project we had

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.890 
on a mark for the first project we had
to<00:02:13.800> look<00:02:14.010> at<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:15.120> had<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.360> study<00:02:15.600> visual

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to look at we had to study visual

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.320 
to look at we had to study visual
research<00:02:16.470> first<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.640> was<00:02:17.790> mainly<00:02:18.030> focused

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
research first that was mainly focused

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.030 
research first that was mainly focused
on<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> research<00:02:19.140> part<00:02:19.470> that's<00:02:19.710> because<00:02:19.920> it

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
on the research part that's because it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.030 
on the research part that's because it
was<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> first<00:02:20.280> topic<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.740> chose

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
was the first topic we there I chose

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.550 
was the first topic we there I chose
flowers<00:02:23.610> for<00:02:23.820> mine<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.300> was<00:02:24.570> looking<00:02:24.720> at<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
flowers for mine so I was looking at the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.830 
flowers for mine so I was looking at the
different<00:02:25.920> types<00:02:26.190> different<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.330> each<00:02:27.450> season

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
different types different in each season

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.750 
different types different in each season
dead<00:02:28.290> flowers<00:02:28.830> flowers<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.520> were<00:02:29.580> still

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
dead flowers flowers that were still

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.930 
dead flowers flowers that were still
alive<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.510> then<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:31.130> did<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:32.280> observational

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
alive and then we did like observational

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.250 
alive and then we did like observational
drawings<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.660> things<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.200> then<00:02:34.320> from<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.650> I

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
drawings and things and then from that I

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.960 
drawings and things and then from that I
like<00:02:37.260> projected<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.040> images<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.700> I've<00:02:38.790> done

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
like projected the images that I've done

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.370 
like projected the images that I've done
onto<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.570> mannequins<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.140> could<00:02:40.290> look

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
onto and the mannequins so I could look

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.290 
onto and the mannequins so I could look
at<00:02:40.500> shapes<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.820> think<00:02:42.000> that's

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
at shapes and so that I think that's

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.330 
at shapes and so that I think that's
where<00:02:42.540> my<00:02:42.780> works<00:02:43.020> have<00:02:43.140> developed<00:02:44.010> further

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
where my works have developed further

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.910 
where my works have developed further
when<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.700> could<00:02:44.940> start<00:02:45.210> using<00:02:45.830> materials<00:02:46.830> and

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
when I could start using materials and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.590 
when I could start using materials and
the<00:02:46.980> mannequin<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.460> projecting<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.240> images

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
the mannequin and projecting the images

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.910 
the mannequin and projecting the images
I<00:02:48.720> think<00:02:48.930> that's<00:02:49.080> when<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.260> started<00:02:49.770> really

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
I think that's when it started really

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.190 
I think that's when it started really
and<00:02:50.160> then<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.300> design<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> capsule

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
and then just to design a capsule

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.780 
and then just to design a capsule
collection<00:02:52.350> format<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.130> swear<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:53.640> that

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
collection format and I swear it's that

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.760 
collection format and I swear it's that
topics<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.360> finished<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.320> some

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
topics that finished you have some

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.950 
topics that finished you have some
lectures<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.090> other<00:02:57.210> building<00:02:57.660> with<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
lectures in the other building with the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.260 
lectures in the other building with the
rest<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.470> evening<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.490> some<00:02:59.790> smaller

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
rest of the evening we have some smaller

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.720 
rest of the evening we have some smaller
lectures<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:00.960> go<00:03:01.140> over<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.010> more<00:03:02.250> fashion

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
lectures that go over so more fashion

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.940 
lectures that go over so more fashion
based<00:03:02.910> things<00:03:03.540> we<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.590> here<00:03:04.830> as

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
based things we have that in here as

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.060 
based things we have that in here as
well<00:03:05.930> we<00:03:06.930> also<00:03:07.080> have<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.290> technical<00:03:07.830> teacher

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
well we also have a technical teacher

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.330 
well we also have a technical teacher
she<00:03:08.370> goes<00:03:08.550> over<00:03:08.850> scenes<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:10.350> going<00:03:11.220> over

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
she goes over scenes and just going over

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.980 
she goes over scenes and just going over
all<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.580> manufacture<00:03:12.270> because<00:03:12.390> they<00:03:12.660> want<00:03:12.840> to

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
get to a high standard because a lot of

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.400 
get to a high standard because a lot of
the<00:03:21.000> people<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.420> go<00:03:21.570> into<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.930> industry

the people that go into the industry

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.410 
the people that go into the industry
have<00:03:23.010> done<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> lot<00:03:23.460> of<00:03:23.520> design<00:03:23.880> work<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.300> they

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
have done a lot of design work but they

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.600 
have done a lot of design work but they
haven't<00:03:24.840> they<00:03:25.380> don't<00:03:25.650> really<00:03:26.010> know<00:03:26.160> how<00:03:26.580> to

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
haven't they don't really know how to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.040 
haven't they don't really know how to
make<00:03:26.910> things<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:27.330> they<00:03:27.450> want<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.720> make<00:03:27.840> sure<00:03:27.870> we

given us like a group of models that

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.770 
given us like a group of models that
we've<00:03:59.190> we're<00:03:59.790> going<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.000> use<00:04:00.180> for<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.480> catwalk

we've we're going to use for the catwalk
show<00:04:01.020> and<00:04:01.290> yesterday<00:04:02.190> we<00:04:02.370> were<00:04:02.520> given<00:04:02.820> a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
show and yesterday we were given a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.460

particular<00:04:03.330> model<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.630> we<00:04:03.840> have<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.230> dress

particular model that we have to dress

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.410 
particular model that we have to dress
in<00:04:05.040> fact<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.460> think<00:04:05.580> that's<00:04:05.850> gonna<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:06.270> quite

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
in fact so I think that's gonna be quite

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.300 
in fact so I think that's gonna be quite
interesting<00:04:06.540> whether<00:04:07.290> we<00:04:07.440> can<00:04:07.650> like<00:04:07.800> get<00:04:08.130> up

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
interesting whether we can like get up

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.680 
interesting whether we can like get up
to<00:04:08.490> speed<00:04:08.790> with<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.150> because<00:04:09.240> we've<00:04:09.480> actually

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
to speed with it because we've actually

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.210 
to speed with it because we've actually
got<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.230> dress<00:04:10.470> them<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:10.860> make<00:04:10.980> sure<00:04:11.010> they're

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
got to dress them and make sure they're

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.400 
got to dress them and make sure they're
ready<00:04:11.400> on<00:04:11.670> time<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.240> so<00:04:12.750> now<00:04:12.780> I'm<00:04:13.050> looking

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
ready on time and so now I'm looking

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.510 
ready on time and so now I'm looking
forward<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:13.860> that<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.040> think<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.400> will<00:04:14.490> be

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
forward to that I think that will be

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.710 
forward to that I think that will be
good

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
good

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.810 
good
this<00:04:16.720> stuff<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:17.230> learn<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.620> is<00:04:17.950> good<00:04:18.430> like

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
this stuff that we learn is is good like

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.360 
this stuff that we learn is is good like
the<00:04:19.329> fact<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.720> we've<00:04:19.930> got<00:04:20.139> three<00:04:20.739> teachers

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
the fact that we've got three teachers

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.629 
the fact that we've got three teachers
and<00:04:21.750> there's<00:04:22.750> 30<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.350> us<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.830> mean<00:04:24.010> if<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.400> go<00:04:24.580> to

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
and there's 30 of us I mean if you go to

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.440 
and there's 30 of us I mean if you go to
a<00:04:25.470> university<00:04:26.470> in<00:04:26.980> London<00:04:27.010> you've<00:04:27.580> got<00:04:27.790> like<00:04:28.180> I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
a university in London you've got like I

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.409 
a university in London you've got like I
don't<00:04:28.690> know<00:04:28.810> 200<00:04:29.440> 300<00:04:30.060> students<00:04:31.060> on<00:04:31.210> one

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
don't know 200 300 students on one

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.600 
don't know 200 300 students on one
course<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:31.870> we've<00:04:31.960> got<00:04:32.110> 30<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:32.889> we<00:04:33.070> have<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.340> lot

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
course and we've got 30 so we have a lot

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.540 
course and we've got 30 so we have a lot
more<00:04:33.639> like<00:04:34.540> time<00:04:34.840> with<00:04:35.139> teachers<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:36.100> because

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
more like time with teachers and because

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.520 
more like time with teachers and because
they're<00:04:36.700> also<00:04:36.880> pay<00:04:37.330> cover<00:04:37.690> different<00:04:37.930> areas

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
they're also pay cover different areas

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.920 
they're also pay cover different areas
you've<00:04:38.740> each<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:40.000> need<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.180> see<00:04:40.510> them<00:04:40.780> and

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
you've each you you need to see them and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.690 
you've each you you need to see them and
you<00:04:41.020> each<00:04:41.139> learn<00:04:41.410> from<00:04:41.710> them<00:04:41.889> so<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.490> better

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
you each learn from them so it is better

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.670 
you each learn from them so it is better
that<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:43.030> think<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.510> even<00:04:44.080> though<00:04:44.169> you're

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
that I think it even though you're

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.590 
that I think it even though you're
meeting<00:04:45.070> less<00:04:45.250> people<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.970> sense<00:04:46.240> it's

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
meeting less people in a sense it's

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.770 
meeting less people in a sense it's
better<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:46.990> you've<00:04:47.380> you've<00:04:47.889> got<00:04:47.950> a<00:04:48.190> smaller

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
better that you've you've got a smaller

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.629 
better that you've you've got a smaller
class<00:04:49.780> then<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.500> do<00:04:50.770> get<00:04:50.919> more<00:04:51.040> teaching<00:04:51.460> time

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
class then you do get more teaching time

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.870 
class then you do get more teaching time
more<00:04:51.940> quality<00:04:52.330> time<00:04:52.510> with<00:04:52.570> them
