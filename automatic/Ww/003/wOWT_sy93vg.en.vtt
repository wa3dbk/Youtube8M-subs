00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.650
 once and you have created or you have achieved 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.200
 your account 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.380
 of sokratis you find this panel of 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.529
 control to be able to create your surveys or 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.080
 questions above all you see this number 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.300
 of room that is basically the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.480
 code that students will need 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.610
 to enter in your apps of sokratis 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.830
 of student and thus be able to see the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.769
 questions that you have proposed and power 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.110
 enter your answers you have four 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.659
 options during class one would be 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.239
 start a survey that you have prepared 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:51.960
 previously the lesson with questions and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.420
 answers that you wanted to evaluate the student 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.549
 another option is an issue that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.650
 basically they are quick questions that do not 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.989
 they need the need to have 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.070
 prepared in advance simply the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.650
 we launched at the time of the election 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.540
 when we have an idea or we have 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.100
 a doubt about the level of understanding 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.170
 that students have acquired 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 there is also the space race option that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.010
 basically it 's with a career a 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.770
 contest to see who answers more 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.010
 quickly to some questions and on the other 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.350
 we have success 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.050
 we also have the option from manich 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.910
 crisis is the button to manage all 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.730
 the polls quiz questions that 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.550
 we have previously configured for 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.500
 can see edit duplicate or even 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.300
 delete a survey but also to 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.580
 see the survey reports that we have 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.500
 done previously if we want 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.890
 maybe review the results of the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.890
 students 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.190
 we can start by asking a question 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.900
 quick that does not require preparation 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.120
 previous objective we click here we see that 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.100
 we have the options to make a 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.009
 True false question 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.570
 a question with multiple answers and 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.600
 also an open question 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.940
 click here we can write it here the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.039
 question type, we can say it in 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.280
 loud voice in oral or we can write it 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.170
 the blackboard if we need 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.360
 and today he has written here he asks me which 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.330
 It is the capital of Italy and we have the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.880
 possibility of allowing only one 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.650
 answer per student or allow a 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.610
 unlimited number of answers per 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.460
 student 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.280
 the unlimited option is delimited 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.290
 can help us if for example not all 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.580
 the students have an ipad or our 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.250
 evidence not everyone has a 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.430
 mobile device or are working on 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.650
 groups then each student from the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.010
 same device can respond to the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.320
 question passing the device between 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.390
 they can also make the 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.250
 student is identified is to say that 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.350
 have to enter your name or 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.260
 simply that they are anonymous answers 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.130
 to see the total result 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.810
 We can start 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.310
 and see that as the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.410
 students go answering us 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.090
 will appear the results we see here that 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.280
 a response has already disappeared from a 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.470
 student above all we can see the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.020
 total number of students we have 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.870
 achieved in this question session and 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.700
 answers that are basically 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.340
 connected to this room once the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.960
 students have finished responding to 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.060
 the question we can simply 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.750
 finish by clicking on finish 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.030
 the survey we can now make a 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.850
 true or false question by 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.460
 example is true that the author of the 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.940
 celestina is fernando de rojas and the 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.070
 students now in the same way we 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.460
 can answer from their ipads to the 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.410
 Question with true true or false be 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.030
 if we do a refresh here up 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.310
 we are seeing the results that we 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.770
 send the students we see that we have 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.810
 already answered a student and as 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.430
 the others will answer us we will see 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.900
 the percentages that have answered a 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.330
 true and the percentages that have 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.670
 answered false 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.050
 the quick questions allow you 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.150
 improvise for example a debate 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.460
 around a question as you go 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.290
 watching the evolution of the election and 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.240
 really create an environment an environment 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.790
 more dynamic also this kind of 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.500
 questions encourages students 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.080
 express your point of view or show 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.210
 your knowledge or knowledge of 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.650
 anonymous form and in this way a 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.910
 way more integral than if they did 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.910
 public way in the class
