00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.710 
let's look at the gameplay in more
detail<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.399> video<00:01:26.640> size<00:01:26.970> was<00:01:27.210> really

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
detail because the video size was really

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.359 
detail because the video size was really
small<00:01:27.990> i<00:01:28.289> zoomed<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.280> unfortunately

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
small i zoomed it in but unfortunately

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.880 
small i zoomed it in but unfortunately
we<00:01:29.910> have<00:01:29.940> lost<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.540> lot<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.720> quality<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.740> can

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
we have lost a lot of quality as you can

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.340 
we have lost a lot of quality as you can
tell<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> visual<00:01:32.760> effects<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.330> insane<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
tell the visual effects are insane and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.830 
tell the visual effects are insane and
