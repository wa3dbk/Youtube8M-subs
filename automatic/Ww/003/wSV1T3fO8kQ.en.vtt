00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.890
 today today today we

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.850
 we feel that it's been that we 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.800
 asked a rather nice headphones a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.240
 little bit of bluetooth and hands 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.370
 free and everything is actually we found 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.350
 am here then it's a nice age 503 to 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.110
 know that there is also under the brand 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.190
 nokia here apparently after lusigny 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.200
 do both they do it without mark 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.280
 nokia and do it without the brand nokia 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.150
 so we are rather what we 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.309
 interested is ready to send 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.650
 products with logos and all that goes 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.239
 not always good customs so it's 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.040
 a rather nice product 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.080
 forget all fight not that we will you 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.160
 present right away so the headphones 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.200
 is rather simple we are going 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.160
 find the start buttons 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.280

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.940

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.030
 of the play button here play pause 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.110
 before this return 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.190
 then you will have the headphones here and 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.259
 finally a connection that will be hidden 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:39.590
 under the seal here to be able to reload 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:41.479
 the device with usb cable with the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.950
 connectivity here in the box you will 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.620
 a mains charger is France 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.240
 rather simple so the headphones are 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.040
 pretty cali is comfortable enough 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.330
 we're going to get them going we'll see a 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.320
 little bit how does it work you go 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.770
 see it's pretty simple so you 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.680
 turn on your smartphone here you put 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.030
 bluetooth you stay supported 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.080
 long time long time on the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.080
 power button to search 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.160
 red when he stayed and then removed five 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.030
 years to flash long time he 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.070
 will go in search you do 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.110
 a search for devices on the 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:23.830
 phone finds the bh 508 we have 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.830
 Donations also change color 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.180
 I maintain the highest is here it will be 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.210
 well here is the headset is 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.130
 directly connected to the phone 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.750
 so that's after that when you 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.890
 you'll have to read the music will suffice 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.360
 to press play here but the headphones 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.330
 it's okay I'll put it a little bit 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.890
 thoroughly to hear you have 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.540
 the city also to adjust the volume 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.540
 on the headset here 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.110
 4 then it's simple it will be necessary 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.879
 you just have to press play for 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.940
 put the music on the road that makes 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.940
 rather simple to advance for 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:21.480
 do their turn me I have two 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:23.040
 songs so in principle it's 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.470
 pretty simple you simply presles 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.569
 pressed fast forward play called 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.860
 pick up the the right from the moment 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.370
 the device etc. will connect you to your 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.220
 phone 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.900
 after the biggest is done volume + 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.609
 - the buttons so we because we have 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.120
 loved on the helmet 1 it's a helmet 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.140
 bluetooth in 2.0 so here it allows me 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.890
 to have a very very good connected 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.720
 with your device 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.970
 we have in art well liked the control 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.340
 of music here before this back the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.930
 reading the volume control one would have 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.190
 liked the hands-free function that 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.959
 will get off the hook because there is 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.480
 also a hidden sow mic that 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.329
 will do that which pedestrians would have 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.430
 well liked the look it's a very device 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.169
 pretty in view it is comfortable enough 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.630

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.410
 true that it makes a whole that is 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.620
 rather classy we would have liked too 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.349
