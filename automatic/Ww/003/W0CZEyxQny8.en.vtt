I ever have I'm not expecting big things
straightaway<00:04:39.220> but<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.460> think<00:04:39.730> hopefully<00:04:40.150> that

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
straightaway but I think hopefully that

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.940 
straightaway but I think hopefully that
momentum<00:04:41.020> I'll<00:04:41.140> build<00:04:41.320> through<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.710> year<00:04:41.920> and

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
momentum I'll build through the year and

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.520 
momentum I'll build through the year and
we<00:04:42.370> can<00:04:42.520> end<00:04:42.670> up<00:04:42.790> getting<00:04:43.390> some<00:04:43.690> very<00:04:44.320> very

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
we can end up getting some very very

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.740 
we can end up getting some very very
decent<00:04:44.980> results<00:04:45.370> as<00:04:45.490> you
