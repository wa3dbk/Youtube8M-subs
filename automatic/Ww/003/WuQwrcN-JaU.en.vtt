00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.730
 of the first episode I had posted on 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.739
 my channel the day before at 208 months 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.720
 now and I hesitated a lot 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.910
 sincerely I hesitated before you 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.540
 do the following like that and there tell you 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.160

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.890
 the second episode but the guys I'm going 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.770
 answer you 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.320
 it's simple because it's 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.310
 first episode to the old he had he 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.740
 was really controversial 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.060
 there were people a lot of 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.979
 people he had liked the video 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.990
 that they would find the job cool 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.640
 all that on the other hand I had other 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.340
 people who did not like it at all 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.500
 the video that kill polemics 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.820
 work simply and I can 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.320
 understand because it's true that the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.570
 video she was she was bof we're going 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.420
 say things as they are and that's it 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.369
 hence the fact that I hesitated 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.759
 relaunch that but finally I got 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.310
 decided 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.899
 I said I 'll do them anyway 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.240
 but work more concrete cleaner 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.950
 work better so hence the fact that 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.850
 I reduced the sequences we went 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.770
 from 10 to 5 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.630

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.899
