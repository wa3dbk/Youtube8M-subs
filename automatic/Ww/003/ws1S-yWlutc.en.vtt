one of what might be the best game of
all<00:00:51.719> time<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.440> my<00:00:52.980> opinion<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.550> probably<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:56.030> if

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
all time in my opinion it probably is if

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.700 
all time in my opinion it probably is if
you<00:00:57.270> did<00:00:57.420> play<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> game<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.170> maybe<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you did play the game and maybe you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.060 
you did play the game and maybe you
thought<00:00:58.949> well<00:00:59.629> not<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.809> my<00:01:01.079> thing<00:01:01.140> or

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
thought well not really my thing or

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.529 
thought well not really my thing or
maybe<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.550> beat<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.090> thought<00:01:03.300> well

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
maybe you beat it you thought well

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.840

something<00:01:06.119> else<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.750> would<00:01:07.740> encourage<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
something else I would encourage you to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.789 
something else I would encourage you to
watch<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.200> let's<00:01:10.470> play

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799

watch a little bit of this let's play
and<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.390> you'll<00:01:12.659> find<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.500> is

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
and I think you'll find that there is

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.480 
and I think you'll find that there is
there<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:15.170> several<00:01:16.170> ways<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:17.220> through

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
there are several ways you go through

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
there are several ways you go through
this<00:01:17.610> game<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.509> certainly<00:01:18.659> becomes<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
this game and it certainly becomes a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.300 
this game and it certainly becomes a
whole<00:01:19.710> new<00:01:20.009> experience<00:01:21.470> in<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.710> let's<00:01:23.009> play

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
whole new experience in this let's play

anything he's kind of get used to feel
the<00:02:58.670> game<00:02:59.440> something<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.500> thought<00:03:00.709> was<00:03:00.829> kind<00:03:00.980> of

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
the game something I thought was kind of

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.680 
the game something I thought was kind of
strange<00:03:01.280> about<00:03:01.519> this<00:03:01.730> part<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.510> you

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
strange about this part is that you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.479 
strange about this part is that you
don't<00:03:02.810> have<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.260> actually<00:03:03.410> shoot<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.130> doors

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
don't have to actually shoot the doors

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.030 
don't have to actually shoot the doors
for<00:03:04.850> them<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.060> open<00:03:05.260> which<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.470> don't<00:03:06.590> think<00:03:06.769> is

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
for them to open which I don't think is

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.470 
for them to open which I don't think is
true<00:03:07.250> for<00:03:07.640> any<00:03:07.910> other<00:03:08.950> Metroid<00:03:09.950> game<00:03:10.489> any

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
true for any other Metroid game any

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.370 
true for any other Metroid game any
other<00:03:11.720> area<00:03:12.109> as<00:03:12.950> far<00:03:13.130> as<00:03:13.220> i<00:03:13.310> know<00:03:13.370> i<00:03:13.609> don't<00:03:13.910> know

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
other area as far as i know i don't know

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.680 
other area as far as i know i don't know
just<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:16.340> make<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.609> game<00:03:16.790> go<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> little<00:03:17.450> bit

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
just to make the game go a little bit

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.370 
just to make the game go a little bit
faster<00:03:18.260> something<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.190> want<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.430> do<00:03:19.609> here<00:03:20.209> is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
faster something you want to do here is

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.270 
faster something you want to do here is
duck<00:03:21.380> down<00:03:21.590> here<00:03:22.070> by<00:03:22.400> really<00:03:22.910> scale

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
duck down here by really scale

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.699 
duck down here by really scale
you'll<00:03:24.610> notice<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.150> take<00:03:25.330> 15<00:03:25.780> damage<00:03:26.290> as

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
you'll notice that you take 15 damage as

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.760 
you'll notice that you take 15 damage as
opposed<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.730> normal<00:03:27.790> 5<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:29.319> or<00:03:29.440> something

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
opposed to normal 5 and or something

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.460 
opposed to normal 5 and or something
else<00:03:29.920> touch<00:03:30.220> his<00:03:30.400> body<00:03:30.580> his<00:03:30.819> tail<00:03:31.120> does<00:03:31.470> much

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
else touch his body his tail does much

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.990 
else touch his body his tail does much
more<00:03:32.500> damage<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:35.380> anyway<00:03:35.709> just<00:03:36.610> happened

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
more damage so anyway just happened

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.660 
more damage so anyway just happened
there<00:03:37.180> Ridley<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.500> gown<00:03:38.890> for<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.130> Met<00:03:39.160> Freud

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
there Ridley the gown for the Met Freud

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.220 
there Ridley the gown for the Met Freud
and<00:03:39.880> now<00:03:40.420> we're<00:03:40.569> getting<00:03:40.750> out<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:40.900> here<00:03:41.050> before

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
and now we're getting out of here before

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.260 
and now we're getting out of here before
the<00:03:41.620> place<00:03:41.830> self-destructs<00:03:42.580> for<00:03:42.819> whatever

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
the place self-destructs for whatever

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.710 
the place self-destructs for whatever
reason<00:03:44.340> you'll<00:03:45.340> notice<00:03:45.550> here<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.390> am

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
reason you'll notice here that I am

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.900 
reason you'll notice here that I am
quickly<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:48.160> clean<00:03:48.520> my<00:03:48.730> gun<00:03:49.030> up<00:03:49.300> and<00:03:49.840> down<00:03:50.170> and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
quickly and clean my gun up and down and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.150 
quickly and clean my gun up and down and
what<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:52.120> does<00:03:52.390> is<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:53.140> actually<00:03:53.260> moves

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
what that does is it actually moves

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.850 
what that does is it actually moves
Samus<00:03:54.880> for<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.330> pixel<00:03:55.810> every<00:03:56.410> time<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.709> do<00:03:56.830> that

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
Samus for a pixel every time you do that

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.610 
Samus for a pixel every time you do that
so<00:03:57.220> doing<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:58.269> just<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.170> get<00:03:59.290> yourself

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
so doing that is just to get yourself

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.410 
so doing that is just to get yourself
out<00:03:59.769> here<00:03:59.800> a<00:04:00.010> little<00:04:00.280> bit<00:04:00.610> master<00:04:01.090> which<00:04:01.269> is

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
out here a little bit master which is

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.770 
out here a little bit master which is
useful<00:04:01.600> for<00:04:02.519> your<00:04:03.519> speedrun<00:04:04.090> or<00:04:04.450> whatnot

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
useful for your speedrun or whatnot

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.720 
useful for your speedrun or whatnot
we'll<00:04:05.230> see<00:04:05.410> about<00:04:05.440> as<00:04:05.950> much<00:04:06.280> time<00:04:06.519> as<00:04:06.670> possible

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
we'll see about as much time as possible

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.660 
we'll see about as much time as possible
I<00:04:09.480> am<00:04:10.709> pretty<00:04:11.709> bad<00:04:11.950> getting<00:04:12.340> out<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.550> here

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
I am pretty bad getting out of here

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
I am pretty bad getting out of here

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
actually get out at the time of 36 or

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.460 
actually get out at the time of 36 or
something<00:04:18.510> definitely<00:04:19.510> possible<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.959> get<00:04:20.079> 45

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
something definitely possible to get 45

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.409 
something definitely possible to get 45
or<00:04:21.450> we're<00:04:22.450> higher<00:04:22.720> left<00:04:23.110> on<00:04:23.290> your<00:04:23.410> clock<00:04:23.650> so
