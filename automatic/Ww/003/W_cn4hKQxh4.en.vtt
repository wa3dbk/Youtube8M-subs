00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840 
but now the cats out the bag i inquired
about<00:01:09.869> Allah<00:01:10.229> John<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.770> Benfica<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.640> how

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
about Allah John for Benfica see how

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.149 
about Allah John for Benfica see how
much<00:01:12.060> they'd<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.659> willing<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.350> let<00:01:13.530> him<00:01:13.650> go<00:01:13.890> for

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
against Newcastle United in the BPL look

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
against Newcastle United in the BPL look
at<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.460> folly<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:36.329> taboo<00:01:36.659> she<00:01:36.869> looking<00:01:37.170> for

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
at that folly from taboo she looking for

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.499 
at that folly from taboo she looking for
that<00:01:37.350> top<00:01:37.590> corner<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.340> surely<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.180> one

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that top corner but surely that was one

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.660 
that top corner but surely that was one
nail<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.900> Newcastle<00:01:40.470> because<00:01:40.740> Tim<00:01:40.979> Howard<00:01:41.310> he

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
nail to Newcastle because Tim Howard he

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.219 
nail to Newcastle because Tim Howard he
held<00:01:41.909> onto<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> ball<00:01:42.360> fair<00:01:42.689> enough<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:42.990> he

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
held onto the ball fair enough but he

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.069 
held onto the ball fair enough but he
staggered<00:01:43.829> back<00:01:44.040> across<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.000> line<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.479> reckon

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
staggered back across the line I reckon

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.990 
staggered back across the line I reckon
if<00:01:46.259> goal-line<00:01:46.500> technology<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.610> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
if goal-line technology was in that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.719 
if goal-line technology was in that
would<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.270> 1<00:01:48.479> l<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> Tim<00:01:49.740> Howard<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.340> proven

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
would be 1 l and Tim Howard was proven

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.999 
would be 1 l and Tim Howard was proven
to<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.180> stoppable<00:01:51.689> force<00:01:52.110> between<00:01:52.649> those

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
to be in a stoppable force between those

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
to be in a stoppable force between those

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
gameplay but on the small animations too

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.140 
gameplay but on the small animations too
so<00:04:13.739> when<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> player<00:04:14.100> gets<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.430> horrible<00:04:14.790> injury

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150

that's<00:04:22.740> what's<00:04:22.919> going<00:04:23.099> to<00:04:23.190> make<00:04:23.370> this<00:04:23.550> game

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
that's what's going to make this game

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.400 
that's what's going to make this game
just<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.150> little<00:04:24.419> bit<00:04:24.539> more<00:04:24.660> realistic<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.320> my

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
just a little bit more realistic in my

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.379 
just a little bit more realistic in my
opinion<00:04:25.710> what<00:04:26.250> do<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.430> guys<00:04:26.669> think<00:04:26.729> do

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
opinion what do you guys think do

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.059 
opinion what do you guys think do
think<00:04:27.539> they<00:04:27.659> should<00:04:27.870> involve<00:04:28.229> small

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
think they should involve small

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.159 
think they should involve small
animations<00:04:29.699> like<00:04:29.849> that<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.330> know<00:04:30.599> one

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
animations like that I know one

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.080 
animations like that I know one
animation<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.860> does<00:04:32.039> annoy<00:04:32.249> me<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:32.699> when

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
animation that does annoy me is when

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.510 
animation that does annoy me is when

you're about to make a sub and you see

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.920 
you're about to make a sub and you see
the<00:04:35.639> player<00:04:35.849> walking<00:04:36.240> around<00:04:36.569> you<00:04:36.840> know

me<00:04:39.120> because<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.479> goes<00:04:39.840> on<00:04:40.050> for<00:04:40.289> a<00:04:40.349> little<00:04:40.560> bit

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
me because it goes on for a little bit

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.860 
me because it goes on for a little bit
longer<00:04:40.919> then<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.909> actually<00:04:42.060> think<00:04:42.449> it<00:04:42.629> should

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
longer then you actually think it should

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.469 
longer then you actually think it should
do<00:04:43.080> or<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:43.830> don't<00:04:44.340> even<00:04:44.639> get<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:44.969> option<00:04:45.120> to

me<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:48.840> mean<00:04:49.050> having<00:04:49.289> something<00:04:49.650> like<00:04:49.830> a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
me but I mean having something like a

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.550 
me but I mean having something like a
guy<00:04:51.150> coming<00:04:51.449> onto<00:04:51.689> the<00:04:51.779> pitch<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.169> aiding<00:04:52.469> the

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
player off or maybe even stretch I think

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.269 
player off or maybe even stretch I think
that<00:04:54.689> that'd<00:04:55.139> be<00:04:55.289> really<00:04:55.499> interesting<00:04:56.009> to<00:04:56.039> see

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:56.279 
that that'd be really interesting to see

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.179 
that that'd be really interesting to see
any<00:04:56.999> way<00:04:57.180> we<00:04:57.479> do<00:04:57.749> be<00:04:57.990> burma<00:04:58.379> gun<00:04:58.560> which<00:04:58.770> puts<00:04:59.039> us

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
any way we do be burma gun which puts us

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.920 
any way we do be burma gun which puts us
through<00:04:59.249> to<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.789> next<00:04:59.909> round<00:05:00.060> of<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.330> FA<00:05:00.449> Cup

through to the next round of the FA Cup

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.679 
through to the next round of the FA Cup
but<00:05:01.500> look<00:05:01.680> at<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:01.919> Darren<00:05:02.759> Bent<00:05:03.000> will<00:05:03.360> be<00:05:03.539> out

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689 
but look at that Darren Bent will be out

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:05.990
