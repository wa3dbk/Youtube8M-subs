00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.279
 hi girls his family and they are places 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.690
 with you or if the small shop of the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.320
 ideas 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:25.130
 today we will make an origami necklace on 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.910
 material that we need a chain 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.489
 incorrect field of origami hooks 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.450
 pencil and brush scissors with the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.640
 vinyl caliper we start by taking the la 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.510
 paper three callouts of the squares 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.750
 of the pencil and since we take the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.910
 paper and with the grasp 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:01:00.230
 let's make a rectangle of about 4 e 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:00.230
 half by five means we join the points 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 rita so we get the rectangle 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:22.100
 we begin to create the boat 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:27.940
 first we explain the point in half 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:33.340
 in the middle we bend the first side 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:36.770
 we also explain the other if we notice that 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:41.170
 they are not perfectly aligned with the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.170
 scissor resume the excess 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:55.190
 perfect 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:00.920
 after which you will have this action 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:07.160
 we fold the first one read above 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.160
 turn upside down and close at the end 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.400
 of the paper and the same procedure it 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.400
 let's make 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:27.320
 on the other hand we get a triangle that 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.320
 we open and join the two opposite sides 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:46.050
 an excellent dogfish and bend again 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:50.849
 yours the two edges so we have the part 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:56.150
 central was a second rhombus 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.150
 little one and then with indicated zzÃ  we open 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.980
 the paper getting the boat 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.319
 complicated his boat we take a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.860
 container where I played was the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.549
 tail of the faculty of lika the brush e 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.200
 let's brush the glue on 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.500
 internal and external part of the boat 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.660
 to make it more durable 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.840
 I advise you to do on the side at a time 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:36.510
 so that you avoid the boat you are 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:38.390
 attacks I work but always 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.069
 glue also in the cracks so that 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.069
 fix the boat 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.269
 let it dry and then do the same 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.400
 other internal procedure 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:54.360
 speaking his necklace circulate quici 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.780
 small boats among which I have repeated 15 times 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.599
 the folding passage of the paper e 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.720
 application of the glue mine 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.220
 advice is to let the towel dry 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.150
 glue a whole day 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:14.250
 we take red with mad and that 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.709
 metal tip pierce a single piece of data 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.570
 of our wand and we repeat 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.989
 the operation among all the others 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:27.810
 take our necklace e 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:31.979
 we calculate about 70 80 centimeters and how 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.270
 pushed him cut soul we remove it 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:40.560
 our chain we proceed to 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:43.740
 insert our boats 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.630
 which have been previously looked at 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.060
 if you want you can help yourself with the pliers 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:58.940
 being careful not to break them 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.940
 chopsticks and slide help me 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.080
 put on the last boat for 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.970
 complete our necklace we put at 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.980
 center the boats a little 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:24.420
 goro insistence so and we proceed to 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:33.540
 put closure 1 obviously a 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:40.850
 certainly we insert them and give ourselves on the other 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.850
 part I hear the concert we open it 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:51.290
 we insert it we close the column e 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.290
 dominated I hope you like it
