the<00:01:05.240> effect<00:01:05.570> should<00:01:06.530> be<00:01:06.940> increased<00:01:07.940> energy

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
the effect should be increased energy

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.550 
the effect should be increased energy
throughout<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.630> day<00:01:08.720> though<00:01:09.230> you<00:01:09.290> could

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
hours one of our test subjects was

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.340 
hours one of our test subjects was
already<00:01:35.939> reporting<00:01:36.390> feeling<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> effects<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
already reporting feeling the effects of

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.300 
already reporting feeling the effects of
the<00:01:37.470> pill<00:01:38.689> super<00:01:39.689> super<00:01:40.200> wired<00:01:40.470> right<00:01:40.860> now

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the pill super super wired right now

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.180 
the pill super super wired right now
like<00:01:42.080> like<00:01:43.080> I<00:01:43.200> feel<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.830> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> matrix

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
like like I feel like I'm in the matrix

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.899 
like like I feel like I'm in the matrix
like<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> could<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.119> things<00:01:45.450> different<00:01:45.930> I

was me but I was able to do it
I<00:02:24.120> took<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.450> right<00:02:24.510> before<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.840> drove<00:02:25.650> home

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.800 
my hands were jittery when I got home my
eyes<00:02:37.410> were<00:02:37.739> super<00:02:38.100> hoping<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:39.209> felt<00:02:39.510> like

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
eyes were super hoping I just felt like

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.500 
eyes were super hoping I just felt like
I<00:02:40.140> had<00:02:41.100> twice<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.700> amount<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.880> energy<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.209> I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
I had twice the amount of energy that I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.449 
I had twice the amount of energy that I
should<00:02:42.799> so<00:02:43.799> I've<00:02:43.890> been<00:02:44.010> taking<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.340> energy

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
should so I've been taking the energy

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.690 
should so I've been taking the energy
pills<00:02:44.910> its<00:02:45.299> third<00:02:45.660> day<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:47.130> still<00:02:47.489> feel

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
pills its third day and I still feel

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.729 
pills its third day and I still feel
nothing<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.690> first<00:02:49.019> day<00:02:49.230> maybe<00:02:49.410> when<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.650> took

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
nothing the first day maybe when I took

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.150 
nothing the first day maybe when I took
it<00:02:49.950> there<00:02:50.370> was<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.640> little<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:52.160> little

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
it there was like a little like a little

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.520 
it there was like a little like a little
surge<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.420> think<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.900> was<00:02:54.989> more<00:02:55.079> mental

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
surge but I think that was more mental

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.949 
surge but I think that was more mental
than<00:02:55.560> anything<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.570> rest<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
than anything and then the rest of the

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.130 
than anything and then the rest of the
time<00:02:58.109> I<00:02:58.140> took<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.799> was<00:02:58.920> just
