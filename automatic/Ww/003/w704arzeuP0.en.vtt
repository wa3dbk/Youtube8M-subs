00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.009
 hello how are you friends and welcome my 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.199
 name is juan cruz martÃ­nez and in this 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.840
 video I'm going to pass a small study 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.570
 sometimes 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.940
 in which I fall without thinking 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.380
 too much sometimes I find myself doing 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.650
 this exercise and I find it interesting 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.880
 to make them see if it turns out 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.740
 interest has to do with thinking about this 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.950
 performance 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.870
 1 1 and 1 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.690
 i 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.079
 and always marking the left on a 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.079
 pulse 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.239
 the other three notes to the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.239
 three others in others remaining 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.409
 TA Ta ta 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.580
 and give it different value and approximate the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.590
 lengthen each other with 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.690
 the only slogan that the left 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.560
 falls hard to see if I explain 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.560
 showing it 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.310
 ah 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.660
 camila we started to start 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.330
 well then as a slogan I leave it to you 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.700
 because it is a short army and quickie 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.410
 as a slogan the left always falls 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.410
 in a corner with the metronome 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.190
 and the three left of the three hands 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.190
 who follow after 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.160
 you have to go squeezing 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.030
 or lengthening 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.960
 and the slogan is to always fall with the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.010
 left with the metronome still 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.240
 agreed well what is this 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.740
 exercise but I think it 's 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.510
 interesting to continue as a job 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.620
 mentally and as a domain work of the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.860
 pulse yes I hope it serves you 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.860
 we see
