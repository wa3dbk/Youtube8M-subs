00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.870
 given to the basket and we have the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.010

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.620

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.190
 lately is what I have I'm going for a 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.020
 site to another always and there is air 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.570
 conditioning put my mother of the 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.360
 Villa's theory I've seen it 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.980
 seen your life with that of before and 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.430
 what I say with the l conditioned on 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.980
 all sites because it affects me in the voice if 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.440
 I have a lot of voice because what 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.480
 I notice always look at that steal look that stole 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.760
 look what he stole again again 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.319
 again and again I have done it 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.629
 from behind it has bothered me but as 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.920
 it can be is that it runs a lot 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.110
 calvin runs runs too much and I 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.299
 trim and always distances there in the 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.920
 race and well this is the penultimate 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.130
 possession by come throw and throw already 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.780
 throw and you do not do it anymore you do not make me 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.550
 good at the end but good we 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.860
 we won the conference final 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.470
 we won it and we arrived at the 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.900
 final and there the game I suppose I am 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.020
 how ugly it is I think it's doing that 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.120
 but good basket in the last second 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.850
 and well let's win very well at the end 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.480
 the match of 16 dots we are 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.530
 champions of the conference this and 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.330
 we will play the finals of the nba again 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.540
 in this case we will play them this time 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.770
 against oklahoma I preferred as a rival 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:56.370
 the lakers but well ok nothing oklahoma 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.770
 there against a ibaka against durant and 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.080
 against westbrook no and good and his 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.270
 cronies and their cronies and good we are going to 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.950
 see the press conference that in the end 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.950
 we have managed to trace this 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.430
 it was very difficult let's see how 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.080
 is 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.080
 it does not make you want valgesta 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.970
 well we trace it back we have traced which 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.340
 has been the key because we do not give up 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.389
 our style the merit is of 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.370
 coach 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.370
 I do not know very well what to say but good 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.430
 as you always see nes and that you love 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.430
 the microphones 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.900
 the gloves of the signature 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.610
 I create a little step that takes a little step 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.370
 win again the finals good a 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.740
 little step that there are four parties there 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.350

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.560
