00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.860
 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.860
 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.410
 hello today friends i will tell you about 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.600
 something interesting called robocop 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.270
 for some reason only now stumble upon 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.689
 she was pleasantly surprised by the plot of the game 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.630
 brings us far 2028 and 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 talk about how omnicorp corporation 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.219
 starts his project to create 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.590
 half man half robot as we 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.290
 hit the future then there can not be avoided 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.450
 flying drones advanced weapons and 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.969
 other superpowers in the form of 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.460
 thermal imager or scanner in general 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.620
 ponapriduyat enough for all 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.440
 use it to miss no time 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.539
 your mission is banal but entertaining 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.180
 you need to fight crime in 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.090
 the most dangerous city is not even a country from 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.949
 whole planet feel the scales yourself 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.170
 gameplay on your screen 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.689
 I will only say that he seems to be holding off 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.460
 your freedom of movement as inside 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.400
 one location you can navigate 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.500
 only two points but I would not say 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.140
 that playing want to run all over the map 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.810
 of course when the defense is no longer there 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.759
 then it would not hurt but complexity 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.189
 because of this only increases a 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.140
 Such serious games are not a minus what 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.450
 concerns upgrading and pumping hero 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.210
 then there is a lot of everything and you need 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.250
 emphasize that you can buy it for 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.079
 money earned in the game for what 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.090
 developers special thanks 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.610
 because very often there are good 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.409
 games but without their money them right away 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.540
 it gets boring to play in the game 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.939
 decent graphics with good dynamics and 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 physics is well developed not only your 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.380
 hero but also opponents and the audience itself 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.380
 manage this hero becomes 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.509
 easy and even interesting in general I think 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.570
 much more will be interested in this creation 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.549
 because the game turned out to Pyaterochka with you 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.380
 I had Misha duke on this 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.270
