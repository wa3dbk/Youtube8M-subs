360<00:00:18.990> docking<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> first<00:00:20.640> boat<00:00:20.820> in

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
360 docking this is the first boat in

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.330 
360 docking this is the first boat in
the<00:00:21.150> country<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:22.170> has<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.560> system<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the country it has this system on it and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.130 
the country it has this system on it and
we're<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.820> give<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> shot<00:00:24.359> for<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
we're going to give it a shot for the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.640 
we're going to give it a shot for the
first<00:00:25.320> time<00:00:26.869> I've<00:00:27.869> actually<00:00:27.930> never<00:00:28.349> driven

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
first time I've actually never driven

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.479 
first time I've actually never driven
this<00:00:28.769> boat<00:00:29.730> before<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.800> there's<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> rule<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
this boat before and there's a rule that

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.250 
this boat before and there's a rule that
you<00:00:32.969> know<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> bigger<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> title<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you know the bigger the title and the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.470 
you know the bigger the title and the
company<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.070> less<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.579> about<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
company the less you know about the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.910 
company the less you know about the
systems<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.410> don't<00:00:37.559> let<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> drive

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
systems and they don't let you drive

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.680 
systems and they don't let you drive
these<00:00:38.100> anymore<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.969> I've<00:00:39.180> never<00:00:39.390> practiced

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
these anymore so I've never practiced

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.060 
these anymore so I've never practiced
with<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.500> take<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:40.860> for

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
with this I'm going to take it out for

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.040 
with this I'm going to take it out for
the<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:41.280> time<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> make

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the first time this is going to make

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.860 
the first time this is going to make
docking<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.620> breeze<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.270> cruising<00:00:45.629> sailor

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
docking a breeze for the cruising sailor

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.840 
docking a breeze for the cruising sailor
and<00:00:46.260> let's<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:46.980> give<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> shot<00:00:47.489> we'll<00:00:47.640> take

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and let's just give it a shot we'll take

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.700 
and let's just give it a shot we'll take
this<00:00:47.969> 44<00:00:48.329> foot<00:00:48.539> around<00:00:48.629> we'll<00:00:49.260> spin<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> around

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
this 44 foot around we'll spin it around

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.779 
this 44 foot around we'll spin it around
and<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:50.219> happens

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and see what happens

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.360 
and see what happens
so<00:00:51.360> I'm<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.660> engaging<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.770> joystick<00:00:53.340> right

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so I'm just engaging this joystick right

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.040 
so I'm just engaging this joystick right
here<00:00:53.850> everything's<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.600> joystick

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
here everything's going this joystick

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.889 
here everything's going this joystick
and<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:56.070> particular<00:00:56.460> system<00:00:57.180> incorporates

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and this particular system incorporates

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.130 
and this particular system incorporates
the<00:00:58.199> autopilot<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.399> bow<00:00:59.579> thruster<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the autopilot the bow thruster and a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.770 
the autopilot the bow thruster and a
rotating<00:01:01.890> sail<00:01:02.460> drive<00:01:02.760> unit<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.570> under

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
rotating sail drive unit that's under

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.179 
rotating sail drive unit that's under
the<00:01:03.870> boat<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.290> sweet<00:01:04.530> things<00:01:04.769> come<00:01:05.010> together

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the boat so sweet things come together

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.700 
the boat so sweet things come together
to<00:01:05.610> make<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.119> system<00:01:06.510> possible<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.470> very

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
to make this system possible so very

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
to make this system possible so very
very<00:01:08.420> simply<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.659> tip<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> joystick

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
very simply if I tip the joystick

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.640 
very simply if I tip the joystick
forward<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.920> go

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
forward I go

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.270 
forward I go
if<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.450> want<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.540> turn<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.780> my<00:01:14.050> right<00:01:14.080> I<00:01:14.560> just

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
if I want to turn to my right I just

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.880 
if I want to turn to my right I just
have<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.490> spin<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.290> if<00:01:17.410> I<00:01:17.470> want<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.740> back

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
have to spin it and if I want to back

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.890 
have to spin it and if I want to back
outside<00:01:18.130> of<00:01:18.400> this

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.230 

so<00:01:21.470> again<00:01:21.980> I've<00:01:22.130> never<00:01:22.160> practiced<00:01:22.910> with<00:01:23.030> this

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
so again I've never practiced with this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.880 
so again I've never practiced with this
this<00:01:23.870> is<00:01:24.050> all<00:01:24.290> new<00:01:25.570> but<00:01:26.570> shocking<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.560> one<00:01:27.770> of

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
this is all new but shocking is one of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.850 
this is all new but shocking is one of
these<00:01:28.010> very<00:01:28.460> very<00:01:28.700> big<00:01:29.000> stumbling<00:01:29.990> blocks<00:01:30.380> for

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
these very very big stumbling blocks for

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:43.890 
these very very big stumbling blocks for
new<00:01:31.390> sailors

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.190 

I'm<00:01:44.470> just<00:01:44.650> walking<00:01:44.890> this<00:01:45.190> transom

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.740 

I'm<00:01:48.830> just<00:01:49.040> using<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.430> lateral<00:01:49.790> movement<00:01:50.060> to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
I'm just using it a lateral movement to

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.590 
I'm just using it a lateral movement to
push<00:01:50.960> this<00:01:51.110> both<00:01:51.320> sideways<00:01:52.390> what's<00:01:53.390> great

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
push this both sideways what's great

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.749 
push this both sideways what's great
about<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:54.470> system<00:01:54.650> for<00:01:54.979> sailors<00:01:55.310> is<00:01:55.549> that

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
about this system for sailors is that

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.050 
about this system for sailors is that
probably<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.509> most<00:01:56.659> intimidating<00:01:57.080> time<00:01:58.060> for

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
probably the most intimidating time for

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.270 
probably the most intimidating time for
a<00:01:59.090> new<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.479> new<00:01:59.540> sailor<00:01:59.960> or<00:02:00.500> maybe<00:02:00.740> someone<00:02:01.100> up

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
a new a new sailor or maybe someone up

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.760 
a new a new sailor or maybe someone up
upgrading<00:02:02.149> to<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.299> larger<00:02:02.689> boat<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.320> taking

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
upgrading to a larger boat is taking

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.740 
upgrading to a larger boat is taking
that<00:02:03.860> boat<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.490> out<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.759> slip<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:05.210> is

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
that boat in and out of the slip that is

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.309 
that boat in and out of the slip that is
a<00:02:05.950> high-stress<00:02:06.950> moment<00:02:07.789> it's<00:02:08.660> when<00:02:08.899> husbands

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
a high-stress moment it's when husbands
