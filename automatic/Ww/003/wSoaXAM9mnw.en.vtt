00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.590 
know to keep it interesting for them you
know<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.009> don't<00:01:29.100> want<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> become<00:01:29.790> mundane<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
know we don't want to become mundane and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300 
know we don't want to become mundane and
you<00:01:30.900> know<00:01:30.990> because<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.740> practice<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you know because it is just practice and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950 
you know because it is just practice and
we<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> play<00:01:32.939> game<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
we don't get a play game so I think the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.399 
we don't get a play game so I think the
key<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.380> us<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:35.790> don't<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.720> every<00:01:37.020> day

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
key for us is don't don't go every day

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
key for us is don't don't go every day
and<00:01:37.439> bang<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.070> each<00:01:38.250> other<00:01:38.520> make<00:01:38.759> sure<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.030> have
