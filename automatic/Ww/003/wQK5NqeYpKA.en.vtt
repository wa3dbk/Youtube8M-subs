00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.019 
yes the great thing about skygrid is the
fact<00:05:26.960> there's<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.169> lot<00:05:27.560> of<00:05:27.590> resources<00:05:28.250> but<00:05:28.909> the

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
fact there's a lot of resources but the

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.659 
fact there's a lot of resources but the
thing<00:05:29.300> is<00:05:29.330> that's<00:05:29.719> risky<00:05:30.319> versus<00:05:30.860> reward<00:05:31.099> like

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
thing is that's risky versus reward like

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.550 
thing is that's risky versus reward like
this<00:05:31.969> there's<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:32.539> much<00:05:32.690> risk<00:05:33.050> in<00:05:33.199> this<00:05:33.319> game

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
this there's so much risk in this game

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.980 
this there's so much risk in this game
it's<00:05:34.039> very<00:05:34.310> very<00:05:34.789> really<00:05:35.330> yes<00:05:35.690> if<00:05:35.960> you
