00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 well i'm glad to greet you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.819
 friends already the second time I'm separated from 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.550
 main themes of your channel and on 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.580
 This time I am shooting a branded cover review 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.309
 from asus for a smartphone like asus 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.010
 zenfone 5 and what is this branded case 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.570
 book and today i will tell you that he 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.930
 It is to show such 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.970
 forms up pretty interesting today 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.609
 tell you what he is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.939
 there is a back here we are focusing me 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.099
 catch the phone well how would he 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.570
 is like a cover then 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.489
 There is a standard Strebkov cover 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.460
 removed is replaced by a carrying case and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.980
 we actually have phone cases 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.230
 so I remember already opened in advance all 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.870
 it lies and waits for its time that is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.510
 let's open the lid yes I mean it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.590
 regular cap 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.820
 absolutely not calculated on which 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.340
 remain 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.870
 find a gift is written intel well how 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.590
 and don zenfone site unpack so 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.539
 our cover and here we have that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.750
 the cover 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.420
 we put aside the cover 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.700
 branded asus from behind is written zenfone 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.000
 and actually inside we have here 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.460
 such is the usual cardboard box 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.340
 nothing interesting from yourself 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.180
 It is like this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.670
 our whole case looks like that is it so 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.189
 closes here the hole for the camera and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 that is, they are a little different comparison 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.810
 there are reflections here 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.159
 and and fingerprints and here it is not 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.400
 how do you know how well and even thousands of backs 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.299
 street and 3008 that is here we have 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.670
 intel logo and 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.680
 and here there is no what is it so let's go further 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.049
 Consider this wonderful case then 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.250
 there is a hole for the screen but okay 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.399
 something i say and say let's remove 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.530
 the second key will try to connect it 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.299
 to our phone that is he with him 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.299
 absolutely must be compatible 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.750
 should react 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.750
 must be absolutely compatible then 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.060
 let's look up the case like him 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.050
 adjacent to our phone that is here 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.920
 and everything is written with a flash logo and 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.940
 camera 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.400
 But I would like to say that this is how it is. 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.330
 would be the thing that we are at first our phone 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.340
 it is much much much thinner then 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.120
 there is for example and here the camera shakes out 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.830
 and here is the camera 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.810
 on the contrary do not stick out that is well 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.470
 maybe it's just a few millimeters 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.630
 but she is thin our pretty nice and we 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.819
 see as if you thought it was 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.430
 protective dance cover is just cool 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.830
 branded case 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.980
 this cover is of course protective but she 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.280
 not much different from the screen too 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.920
 here 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.950
 protection and not fully protected well and 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.989
 let's see what is capable 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.849
 you understand that this is just a cover of asus to 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.060
 it has the usual function let's 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.519
 turn on pubs and here shows the time 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.739
 messages and so on that is it is 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.390
 small interactive menu cover 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:23.350
 Yes, there is a flashlight 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.650
 flashlight is my own 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.019
 the flashlight works so we turned off by 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.430
 timer, everything 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:39.000
 Case work but well worth it to us so that's 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:42.790
 I would like to remove this film of course 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.709
 should we lift the lid like this screen 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.530
 wonderful disappears when we are 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.720
 throws on the standard launcher for something 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.239
 there is this function is not connected immediately 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.829
 cover that is for example it turns 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.790
 in settings 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.739
 in the settings screen and you flip cover 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.540
 that is, if we turn off the standard one 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.060
 the function is off no nothing 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.319
 happens if we close the cover and when 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:12.040
 enabled this function 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:13.989
 how can it be closed? 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.040
 there is even a random generator 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:21.150
 questions like asking him 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:25.390
 anything you ask and actually 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.220
 full shields answers random questions 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.750
 that is, I do not know what it is invented 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.520
 It was most likely to be checked. 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.520
 sensor or accelerometer i.e. if 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.460
 shake it also works that is 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.170
 weather and so on let's do it again 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.680
 consider in one the ability of this 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.430
 cover 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:49.090
 yes that is all buttons yusb all this 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:51.130
 fits and let's say well a case 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.600
 still it has compatibility with the music I was given 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.680
 Now the music 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.290
 disconnect so that youtube me not 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.160
 I scolded for using to someone else so 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.990
 as if 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.600
 accelerometer works up to including music 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.580
 close the cover 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.640
 pubs here here track name can 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.350
 list next press pause but 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.020
 and actually it appears separate 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.060
 window yes like on the desktop so 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.150
 in fact nothing has changed and Well 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.979
 that is, there is, as it were when when when there 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.490
 someone calling when calling here 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:30.460
 there is a name well, the caller's name and 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.010
 buttons reset or take when this too 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.380
 convenient because the phone itself 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.710
 imagine he's pretty big and reach out 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:42.910
 the buttons are a little awkward well then 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:45.150
 Here is such a cover, in principle, in my opinion 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:50.169
 it is a very good cover it 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:52.479
 different that is from this standard 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.060
 asus avs whom I would not risk a cover 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.250
 just such a panel into place on 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.100
 plastic it is just a very thin and 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.320
 It is perfect for our asus 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.050
 because it is intended only for him 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.780
 that is, the clippings for the speaker here are all 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.710
 there is and it's pretty nice case 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.479
 I will voice the price for which I bought 1500 s 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.729
 plus rubles that is, it costs you more 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.189
 1500 rubles 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.050
 and why he is pretty expensive and in him 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:21.659
 pretty ha ha ha good 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.409
 functional but the phone is almost not like 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:26.819
 will not protect but how would you 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.999
 you can always hang out in front of friends 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:34.379
 and so on, so here and friends this 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:38.639
 There was a review on the case of zenfone 5 like with you 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.259
 I was a developer and I think Swami say goodbye 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.539
 you liked this review like 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.460
 and most likely we are on my channel 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:48.529
 there will be such a separate heading where I 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.529
 just gonna be watching everyone for now
