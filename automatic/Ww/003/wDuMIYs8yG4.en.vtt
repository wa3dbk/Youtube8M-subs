00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.479 
I that's where this one came from and it
wound<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.239> doing<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.379> within<00:01:05.159> probably

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
wound up doing this within probably

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.090 
wound up doing this within probably
about<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> month<00:01:06.240> month<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.840> half<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.380> this
