has been removed you can simply remove

00:02:50.599 --> 00:03:03.640 
has been removed you can simply remove
the<00:02:50.690> head<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:54.310> say<00:02:55.310> simply<00:02:55.700> but

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.080 

they're<00:03:04.650> double<00:03:04.830> again<00:03:07.730> there<00:03:08.730> shouldn't<00:03:09.000> be

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
they're double again there shouldn't be

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.290 
they're double again there shouldn't be
anything<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.540> fall<00:03:10.490> down<00:03:11.490> in<00:03:11.700> your<00:03:11.850> cylinder

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
doesn't if that doesn't work it's gonna

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.300 
doesn't if that doesn't work it's gonna
wreak<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.690> most<00:03:57.840> likely<00:03:57.959> won't<00:03:58.380> simply

wreak on it most likely won't simply
just<00:03:59.490> pull<00:03:59.700> your<00:03:59.820> cylinder<00:04:00.240> head<00:04:00.450> off<00:04:03.709> once

just pull your cylinder head off once

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.910 
just pull your cylinder head off once
you<00:04:04.830> have<00:04:04.980> your<00:04:05.130> cylinder<00:04:05.720> removed<00:04:06.890> like<00:04:07.890> I

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
you have your cylinder removed like I

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.710 
you have your cylinder removed like I
said<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.250> while<00:04:08.400> ago<00:04:08.459> we<00:04:08.820> tried<00:04:09.060> using<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.510> pull

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
said a while ago we tried using the pull

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.259 
said a while ago we tried using the pull
rope<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.080> get<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.320> piston<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.769> come<00:04:10.980> up<00:04:11.269> you

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
rope to get the piston to come up you

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.570 
rope to get the piston to come up you
can<00:04:12.420> either<00:04:12.630> do<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.840> or<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:14.010> can<00:04:14.160> just<00:04:14.220> bump

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
can either do that or you can just bump

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.120 
can either do that or you can just bump
your<00:04:14.760> starter<00:04:15.209> just<00:04:15.900> bump<00:04:16.140> it<00:04:16.290> very<00:04:16.590> very<00:04:16.950> very

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
your starter just bump it very very very

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.000 
your starter just bump it very very very
lightly<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:18.150> get<00:04:18.900> your<00:04:19.109> piston<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.530> rise<00:04:19.739> to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
lightly to get your piston to rise to

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.010 
lightly to get your piston to rise to
the<00:04:20.100> top<00:04:22.910> once<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.030> have<00:04:24.180> your<00:04:24.330> piston<00:04:24.750> up<00:04:24.870> you

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
the top once you have your piston up you

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.469 
the top once you have your piston up you
won't<00:04:25.169> be<00:04:25.290> sure<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.950> put<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.490> rag<00:04:26.760> underneath<00:04:27.180> it

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
won't be sure to put a rag underneath it

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.830 
won't be sure to put a rag underneath it
so<00:04:28.260> your<00:04:28.470> clip<00:04:28.770> holding<00:04:29.190> your<00:04:29.340> piston<00:04:29.840> does

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
so your clip holding your piston does

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.320 
so your clip holding your piston does
not<00:04:31.140> fall<00:04:31.590> down<00:04:31.890> into<00:04:32.190> your<00:04:32.430> motor<00:04:32.700> if<00:04:33.030> this

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
not fall down into your motor if this

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.230 
not fall down into your motor if this
ever<00:04:33.570> happens<00:04:34.729> it's<00:04:35.729> time<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:36.060> pull<00:04:36.210> the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
ever happens it's time to pull the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.150 
ever happens it's time to pull the
motion<00:04:36.650> I'm<00:04:37.650> gonna<00:04:37.800> take<00:04:37.950> a<00:04:37.979> small

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
motion I'm gonna take a small

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.190 
motion I'm gonna take a small

screwdriver or a pin or anything and
there's<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.740> groove<00:04:44.070> in<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.400> piston<00:04:45.290> about

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
there's a groove in the piston about

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.480 
there's a groove in the piston about
right<00:04:46.500> here<00:04:47.060> where<00:04:48.060> your<00:04:48.240> wrist<00:04:48.540> pin<00:04:48.840> goes

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
right here where your wrist pin goes

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.010 
right here where your wrist pin goes
just<00:04:50.490> wanna<00:04:50.669> stick<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.240> in<00:04:51.330> there

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.200 

pop<00:04:56.020> your<00:04:56.230> clip<00:04:56.440> out

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.470 

take<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.960> finger
