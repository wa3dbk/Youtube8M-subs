00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.379
 good morning I have an appointment for one 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.379
 sports doctor visit dell and caroline 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:56.410
 thanks hello dear life ok sportivissima 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.850
 leave your coat if you want 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 start to undress 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.120
 and minimal on all the evening specs money 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.030
 home will notice that this is the basin 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.470
 of the high left side and slightly 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.380
 moved down the fee brings the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.820
 there was a cracked left shoulder 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.020
 known actress for so long 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.970
 this so this imperfection 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.370
 I think it could be studied in 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.130
 most appropriate way with a 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.140
 particular device not radiological 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.420
 a computerized appliance of 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.990
 latest generation with which not 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.090
 we can photograph your back and 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.710
 take a picture of this back 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.320
 three-dimensional to make a 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.030
 a little more careful observation 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.240
 of what I can do I have 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.920
 only with the eyes so if so 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.170
 allowed us to study you a little bit 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.730
 more in depth we go to rai col 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.730
 Greek doctor, let's make this water 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:33.160
 ok now you have to stay in underwear for the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.930
 visit to which the then exam is also stripped 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.970
 we will stick it out exactly here 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.730
 so very good 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.520
 the important thing is that you are in front of the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.760
 tv ok I'll explain how quickly 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.700
 the machine works so you understand well 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.410
 there is no radiation everything happens with 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.290
 a camera is a light that comes 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.330
 projected onto your body creates a 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.050
 let's say game of lights and shadows let's say 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.700
 so and through a calculation 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.800
 trigonometric the machine calculates in 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.990
 based on this effect 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.700
 the positioning of the vertebrae e 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.380
 then the posture of your column 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.380
 ok then let's get started 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.740
 then how do you see in those few seconds 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.170
 of acquisition the machine did 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.630
 substantially 12 photographs of the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:53.800
 of your column given the colors are 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.600
 they are chosen based on how it is 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.200
 set your back let's have his say 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.440
 suter 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:04.540
 from here these are essentially the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:08.510
 results that your exam got 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.830
 you can see here for example this 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.050
 basically indicates how you are 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.410
 put in the sagittal plane the two 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.410
 vertebrae 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.280
 then the evaluation is finished 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.670
 basically it came from that up 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.960
 indication of 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.920
 scoliotic attitude that 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.630
 actually he had the whole car and 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.980
 of all so much 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.150
 for four 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.920
 this alteration by 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.990
 all beautiful 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.990
 and clearly in your request 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.840
 if there is not this substantially then 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:17.169
 heat and we voted for the effects 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.479
 where I saw these discrepancies between 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.060
 right and left between north and south of the 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.569
 His back were then detected 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.270
 in the car actually 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.569
 of structural anomalies 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.520
 at this point we objectively 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.139
 a situation we can spend on 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.259
 correct with a series of systems 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.120
 systems can be multiple 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:43.050
 they can be gymnastic systems 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.699
 specific may be systems of 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.270
 applications of osteopathic protocols or 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.840
 kinesiological care is simply a 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.789
 together 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.500
 the application of orthotics specifically 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:06:01.750
 processed to correct this disgust 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.500
 we manage to perfectly balance the 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.229
 your musculature and the nation to 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.420
 column and then give you back a 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:13.600
 attitude no longer spoiled but 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:17.080
 currently runs so maybe now 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.150
 we come back to say salt if we are concerned 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.480
 a little the pole situation 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.850
 objectively six eyes all together and 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.950
 then let's try to resume today 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.210
 will take action or decide 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.950
 if subject to measures for 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.950
 solve the situation test
