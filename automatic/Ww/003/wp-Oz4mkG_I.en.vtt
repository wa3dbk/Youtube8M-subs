did this review license plate reading is
very<00:01:15.570> accurate<00:01:15.869> especially<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:17.130> you're

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
very accurate especially if you're

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
people do it but I'm just doing it as

demonstration

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.630 

the<00:01:30.100> brightness<00:01:30.429> is<00:01:31.770> pretty<00:01:32.770> good<00:01:33.039> you<00:01:33.460> will

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
the brightness is pretty good you will

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.219 
the brightness is pretty good you will
get<00:01:33.939> -<00:01:34.240> reflection<00:01:35.079> I<00:01:35.350> have<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.920> CPL<00:01:36.929> filter

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
get - reflection I have the CPL filter

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.010 
get - reflection I have the CPL filter
I<00:01:38.439> removed<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:39.399> UV<00:01:39.850> filter<00:01:39.880> they<00:01:40.479> came<00:01:40.750> with

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
I removed the UV filter they came with

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.169 
I removed the UV filter they came with
it<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:42.009> still<00:01:42.310> will<00:01:42.490> get<00:01:42.759> some

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
it and you still will get some

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.929 
it and you still will get some
reflection<00:01:43.840> if<00:01:43.990> it's<00:01:44.170> bright<00:01:44.439> out<00:01:44.939> but

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
reflection if it's bright out but

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.899 
reflection if it's bright out but
frankly<00:01:46.479> that's<00:01:46.689> not<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.020> problem<00:01:47.409> for<00:01:48.069> my<00:01:48.250> use

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
frankly that's not a problem for my use

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.660 
frankly that's not a problem for my use
I<00:01:48.939> do<00:01:49.179> not<00:01:49.569> care<00:01:50.020> about<00:01:50.289> seeing<00:01:50.799> that's<00:01:51.130> on<00:01:51.849> my
