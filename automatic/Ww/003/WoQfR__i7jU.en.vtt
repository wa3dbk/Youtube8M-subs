now my biggest tip for the dough is to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.420 
now my biggest tip for the dough is to
mix<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.450> until<00:01:28.870> it's<00:01:29.170> just<00:01:29.290> combined<00:01:30.040> you<00:01:30.280> do

not want to over mix your dough because

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.310 
not want to over mix your dough because

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
very difficult to tell when these are

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.350 
very difficult to tell when these are
done<00:02:17.830> because<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.580> course<00:02:18.820> they<00:02:19.030> have<00:02:19.180> that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
done because of course they have that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.229 
done because of course they have that
cinnamon<00:02:19.900> kind<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.530> brown<00:02:20.739> sugar<00:02:20.769> look<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:21.970> you
