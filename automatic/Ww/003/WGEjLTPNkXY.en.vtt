00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
long so my thoughts on his hair is that

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.550 
long so my thoughts on his hair is that
it's<00:01:47.990> very<00:01:48.550> thin<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:49.820> it's<00:01:50.750> too<00:01:50.990> long<00:01:51.229> in<00:01:51.440> my

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
it's very thin and it's too long in my

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.680 
it's very thin and it's too long in my
opinion<00:01:51.890> but<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.759> what<00:01:53.030> bothers<00:01:53.390> me<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.570> most

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
opinion but the what bothers me the most

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.969 
opinion but the what bothers me the most
is<00:01:54.080> how<00:01:54.289> thin<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.979> is<00:01:55.009> um<00:01:55.690> if<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:57.229> was<00:01:57.410> fuller<00:01:57.800> i

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
is how thin it is um if it was fuller i

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.430 
is how thin it is um if it was fuller i
don't<00:01:58.399> think<00:01:58.550> i<00:01:58.640> would<00:01:58.700> like<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.090> much<00:01:59.780> more<00:02:00.140> i

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
don't think i would like it much more i

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.600 
don't think i would like it much more i
guess<00:02:01.310> over<00:02:01.729> time<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.330> will<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:03.560> know<00:02:03.740> pull

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
guess over time it will you know pull

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.910 
guess over time it will you know pull
out<00:02:04.789> more<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.450> become<00:02:05.780> more<00:02:05.810> voluminous<00:02:06.349> but

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
out more and become more voluminous but

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.199 
out more and become more voluminous but
at<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.250> moment<00:02:07.399> it's<00:02:07.729> pretty<00:02:08.209> flat<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:10.209> yeah
