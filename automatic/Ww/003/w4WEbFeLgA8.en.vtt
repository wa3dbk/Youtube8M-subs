00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.340
 little packets to see what we have to do now

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.439
 my mother good crap as you know the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.439
 second 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.650
 elite 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.479
 I have this one that I already have very well and 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.200
 now let's see the third one to see we're going 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 to brush something 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.430
 Ok, so I think I have both 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.080
 that nothing guys let's see what we 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.700
 they play in the last three supplies 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.440
 I hope that I touch one please and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.000
 good transition and we go back with the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.830
 last supplies good guys then 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.360
 Here we are with the last round of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.670
 supplies and good we have here those 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.280
 three packets prepared so we're going 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.970
 to start on the left this time to 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.970
 see that we have to 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:09.149
 a year and a few not much 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.380
 bad luck keep going with the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.380
 second packet 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.750
 good boots are cool so cool 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.780
 hey I did not have elite boots I find a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.910
 and a dice machine gun from 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.080
 precision takes away one of damage and you 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.090
 remove one reach 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.180
 It does not look like it's very good, you'll tell me 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.810
 and we are going to open the last packet to 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.810
 see how 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.220
 for nothing is not much to see so 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.430
 one of you asked me to teach you 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.080
 the arsenal to see if he had something that he did not 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.480
 had taught or anything I think 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.970
 that I have opened everything what has opened 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.850
 I taught it but well here you have 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.960
 more or less what I have of elite not 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.870
 it's a little bit not yet and good about weapons 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.300
 professionals I think the only one 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.480
 it's worth it's the hold click and 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.430
 good the rigor also example you already know 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.260
 who used it and then good 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.870
 you 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.300
 will you say yes I have something that deserves the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.090
 I'm passing you grief 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.130
 and I do not think so but you guys 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.890
 you will say that you still see some little gem of 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.870
 You are cadet that I have no idea 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.930
 and you tell me but how do you have that weapon and 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.680
 you do not use or anything you do not 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.080
 I'm going through and well the truth is that 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.200
 I've only messed it up once, erasing the 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.050
 line pad that you have thrown me all is 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.610
 an incredible and good anger this is what 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.710
 what do I have after I have these that are 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.130
 those that are not exchangeable 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.590
 and good here you have to find more than 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.630
 more or less are fine is this is this 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.620
 I like pretty much to see three 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:04.730
 I like it a lot and well this is what 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.520
 I have no more I do not know what what 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.770
 you think I do not think either 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.600
 an arsenal more or less wrong and I do not know 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.890
 but good is normal and so nothing 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.200

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.970
 video you see that I continue with the streak of 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.130
 bad luck let's hope that the week that 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.170

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.670
