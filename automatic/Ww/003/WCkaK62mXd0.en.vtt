we're<00:01:47.240> making<00:01:47.539> we're<00:01:47.630> trying<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.960> make<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.109> new

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
we're making we're trying to make a new

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.319 
we're making we're trying to make a new
experience<00:01:49.039> that<00:01:49.609> people<00:01:49.729> haven't<00:01:50.060> had

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
experience that people haven't had

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.910 
experience that people haven't had
before<00:01:50.450> something<00:01:51.380> that's<00:01:51.649> fun<00:01:51.890> and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
before something that's fun and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.440 
before something that's fun and
innovative<00:01:52.249> for<00:01:52.609> the<00:01:52.670> driving<00:01:53.030> genre<00:01:53.390> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
innovative for the driving genre and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.490 
innovative for the driving genre and
something<00:01:53.719> that<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:53.929> really<00:01:54.170> just<00:01:54.289> going<00:01:54.439> to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
something that is really just going to

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.959 
something that is really just going to
break<00:01:54.710> things<00:01:54.890> apart<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.429> kind<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.789> you<00:01:55.939> know

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
break things apart and kind of you know

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.849 
break things apart and kind of you know
change<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.450> way<00:01:56.539> people<00:01:56.569> think<00:01:57.020> driving

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
change the way people think driving

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.949 
change the way people think driving
games<00:01:58.069> and<00:01:58.340> progression<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.209> talking<00:01:59.689> about

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
games and progression and talking about

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.130 
games and progression and talking about
30<00:02:00.560> hours<00:02:00.709> of<00:02:01.100> play<00:02:01.659> what<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:02.810> means<00:02:03.020> to

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
30 hours of play what that means to

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.589 
30 hours of play what that means to
people<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.619> it's<00:02:04.130> it's<00:02:04.849> we're<00:02:05.270> out<00:02:05.390> in

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
people so it's it's we're out in

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.599 
people so it's it's we're out in
uncharted<00:02:06.289> territory<00:02:06.829> that's<00:02:07.099> for<00:02:07.280> sure<00:02:07.429> no

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
uncharted territory that's for sure no

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.009 
uncharted territory that's for sure no
and<00:02:07.789> that's<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:08.000> good<00:02:08.119> thing<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.509> single<00:02:08.869> player

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
and that's a good thing a single player

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.430 
and that's a good thing a single player
you<00:02:09.289> if<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.709> can<00:02:09.830> find<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.069> you<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.220> drive<00:02:10.489> it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
you if you can find it you can drive it

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.160 
you if you can find it you can drive it
and<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.709> get<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.250> drive<00:02:13.519> you<00:02:14.269> get<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.569> get<00:02:15.019> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and you get to drive you get you get the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.630 
and you get to drive you get you get the
mods<00:02:15.500> for<00:02:16.010> winning<00:02:16.730> races<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:18.140> multiplayer

mods for winning races in multiplayer

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.819 
mods for winning races in multiplayer
you<00:02:19.640> star<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.629> particular<00:02:20.840> car<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.500> earn

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
you star in a particular car you earn

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.559 
you star in a particular car you earn
cars<00:02:22.280> as<00:02:22.549> you<00:02:22.700> reach<00:02:22.879> particular<00:02:23.209> speed

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
cars as you reach particular speed

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.960 
cars as you reach particular speed
levels<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.049> you<00:02:24.110> get<00:02:25.040> awarded<00:02:25.370> modest<00:02:25.730> as<00:02:25.849> you

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970

do<00:02:26.840> particular<00:02:27.400> milestones<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.579> those

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
do particular milestones in those

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.580 
do particular milestones in those
vehicles<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.780> it's<00:02:30.019> a<00:02:30.079> slightly<00:02:30.319> different

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
vehicles so it's a slightly different

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.039 
vehicles so it's a slightly different
progression<00:02:31.209> it's<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.450> know<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:32.569> loosely

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
progression it's you know it's loosely

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.869 
progression it's you know it's loosely
based<00:02:33.500> on<00:02:33.739> me<00:02:34.010> what<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.430> get<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.730> seeing

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
based on me what you get to seeing

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.460 
based on me what you get to seeing
shooters<00:02:35.690> where<00:02:35.870> if<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.079> play<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.349> single

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
shooters where if you play the single

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.809 
shooters where if you play the single
player<00:02:36.650> game<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.040> get<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.280> experience<00:02:37.519> many

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
player game you get to experience many

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.789 
player game you get to experience many
different<00:02:38.180> weapons<00:02:38.480> for<00:02:38.599> example<00:02:39.049> but<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:39.709> the

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
different weapons for example but in the

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.630 
different weapons for example but in the
multiplayer<00:02:40.129> game<00:02:40.430> you've<00:02:40.579> got<00:02:40.609> a<00:02:40.730> longer

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
multiplayer game you've got a longer

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.599 
multiplayer game you've got a longer
longer<00:02:43.640> play<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.859> in<00:02:45.859> order<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.160> be<00:02:46.310> able<00:02:46.400> to

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
longer play to in order to be able to

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.000 
longer play to in order to be able to
level<00:02:47.239> up<00:02:47.390> speed<00:02:48.109> points<00:02:48.410> up<00:02:48.560> roughly

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
level up speed points up roughly

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.000 
level up speed points up roughly
analogous<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.810> XP<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:50.959> different<00:02:51.260> games<00:02:51.470> but<00:02:51.950> a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
analogous to XP in different games but a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.890 
analogous to XP in different games but a
great<00:02:52.250> thing<00:02:52.519> though<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.480> speed

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
great thing though is that the speed

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.000 
great thing though is that the speed
points<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.319> earn<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.680> single<00:02:54.980> player

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
points that you earn in single player

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.569 
points that you earn in single player
will<00:02:55.480> map<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.720> multiplayer<00:02:57.560> as<00:02:57.739> well<00:02:57.889> so<00:02:58.190> the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
will map to multiplayer as well so the

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.580 
will map to multiplayer as well so the
time<00:02:58.819> you<00:02:58.940> put<00:02:59.120> into<00:02:59.150> single<00:02:59.720> player<00:02:59.930> will

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
time you put into single player will

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.830 
time you put into single player will
also<00:03:00.859> accelerate<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.609> up<00:03:02.060> through<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.599> speed

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
also accelerate you up through the speed

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:11.420 
also accelerate you up through the speed
levels

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:21.800 

you

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.870 

you
