00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.940
 general diagram of the fabrication of belief 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.340
 looks like this we wind 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.540
 the first layer is shifted in different 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.280
 directions turns not so then la than 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.420
 this layer it dries out 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.350
 shake the second layer is shifted in the same way 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.379
 first we take out at 3 no two threads 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.469
 3 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.689
 2 inaccurate one not soak again 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:12.180
 The first condition for this form 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.430
 entrenched and at the end of Moscow means 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.049
 finances 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.420
 Europe is the pattern that turns on 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.789
 congress that is one thread should be 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.140
 dark another light most 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:28.170
 the best view there is light 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.039
 silver well and it is not only that light 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.049
 by itself it has its own way so 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.390
 there is this reflective surface without 5 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.110
 that is, the pattern you get pretty 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.420
 interesting here but in our case our 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.799
 light thread will look like the second 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.569
 the thread we will have lilac lyrics 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.939
 well, the third bit to it is practically 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.530
 accounts with little thread without which 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.470
 it costs no one vibro for this 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.619
 Draft start in short black 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.929
 winding on which then will 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.700
 position the pattern b as the graph further 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.540
 we weave here 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.319
 grandfather two more threads that we chose 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.590
 sirenix 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.870
 light lilac nso pyshechku and start 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.599
 wind the coils should fit snugly 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.840
 each other but so that later they can 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.209
 was to move a strong tension example 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.900
 uterus hold no need we then need 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.900
 will move 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:39.319
 we avoid turns to meet bruce arc 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.319
 the entire length of the winding 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.520
 after drying of the first layer is required to 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.650
 need to smooth the surface very sharp 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.140
 blade is necessary to tie all the strings 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.140
 which appeared after drying varnish 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.320
 for our perimeter to look like 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.070
 taken out of context we limit 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.070
 his patterns 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.200
 I want to note again that on this layer 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.380
 oil must also lie tight coil to 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.510
 a loop without gaps but at the same time 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.640
 you need to keep tight stretch because 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.640
 the top layer is more difficult to move personally 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.510
 so build we also attach 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.340
 fancy pattern 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.370
 shifting the threads in opposite 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.370
 directions 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:30.169
 when extracting the threads in principle to 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:33.680
 avoid unpleasant surprises 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:40.250
 one voice one at a time 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:42.349
 then the second going on its patterns top 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.750
 the thread usually leave the quarrel out 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.229
 whichever are the bottom three 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.479
 boundaries 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.120
 black thread remaining on the top layer 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.139
 it gives the node a contrast not 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.979
 expressiveness 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:57.220
 if you use the camera in 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.659
 the green thread is already dawn on the green 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.949
 branch believe dark green and 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.680
 leave at the top 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.349
 the top layer is a dark green thread you have 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.280
 the pattern will turn out saturated green but not 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.280
 such a time 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.870
 complete this finishing process 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.510
 varnishing after varnish 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.760
 the coating is already visible 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.760
 what kind of got your zone
