00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.470
 what are those fischer down there 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.860
 no matter i think i can fly i 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.860
 can escape or not 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.820
 yes and welcome to a new murder 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.369
 presentation this time his desired 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.630
 from mister to the pkl something and 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.160
 jain village yes as I said in the 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.330
 write description or comments 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.750
 you can now give her the comments 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.970
 write 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.600
 and i will possibly this monster 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.430
 Imagine and she had the cracks mods 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.500
 presented so the panel switches 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.090
 choose which parachute place to see and 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.010
 a couple of reptiles you can see here 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.720
 can see a bit of lattice like that 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:57.710
 very small something bigger and also completely 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.280
 low you will see her soon and 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.839
 yes, we start with the parachute 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.180
 You can do that so much 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.470
 you can see there comes up to three wool 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.960
 there are two drive there and one 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.040
 live in such a parachute and we 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.390
 Fly around again for a short time 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.799
 not as a principle as it would look 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.549
 if I do not get down here now 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.620
 would have jumped without parachute and such 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.840
 again very briefly in the normal mode 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.580
 go and now you can be quite happy 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.320
 Jump down and then he will join 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.180
 a parachute with which we unfortunately 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.350
 can not really direct or yet 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.610
 You can take longer but I have them 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.060
 not really out that is possible 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.680
 goldinvest.de company with the mouse 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.820
 one left with the mouse one steers simply 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.229
 with the mouse as you can see 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.600
 think with the mouse i think i have to 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.430
 just to steer the mouse and that and that 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.140
 does one land then this is supposed to 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.990
 wrong are always different and 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.429
 were landed zag wrong way and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.070
 as in this package the benefit of one 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.719
 certain time simply from that is a 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.250
 really cool thing if I can definitely 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.890
 Good use if you down from above 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.310
 jumps and yes that was the peugeot now 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.509
 Let's go to the whole new one 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.460
 reptiles we have 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.869
 I'll show you all the ones I have 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.429
 also in this box purely geballert 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.130
 have and show you how to man 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.570
 These ten can and what the stop drop 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.030
 most of them just drop it 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.780
 So leather and halt beef so that q 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.410
 meat normally 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.380
 buck of just out here is the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.600
 By the way, one 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.030
 an alligator or something and that is 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.080
 very dangerous if he is 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.319
 I now also hurt one was seen 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.270
 already tried here leather and stuff and 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.610
 For example, you do not really know fishermen 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.650
 can tame it here again, you can 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.040
 with flowers 10 you have to flowers for that 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.980
 then we'll listen to you changed 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.330
 they sat down a bit , yes 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.410
 you can see it already have the old one 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.700
 love i think i can do that 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.060
 love together that's not so 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.580
 all 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.750
 and you can already see the train here 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.519
 Somehow everywhere I have until now 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.900
 not yet found but I guess 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.700
 which are on the distribution of with 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.390
 spore because i can sponge that has 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.980
 drill 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.680
 You can once do of the animals 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.810
 have to watch what the subtropics of the pressure 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.290
 For example, nothing but experience 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.280
 so have very very small representatives 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.840
 Since I have to look very short even though 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.980
 I arrive at you that one can now 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.780
 including flowers ten of them , too 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.650
 certainly the tropics I think so too 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.959
 not only that there is nothing except 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.340
 experience here but from toilet sheets 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.840
 Eater is already in love with it 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.190
 and broke down well-placed 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.269
 nothing comes out and beat that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.829
 you have one for that one 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.870
 carnivore toughest carnivore 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.160
 come again with meat ten 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.370
 leaves then looks like 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.799
 Richie's question probably comes as well 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.329
 meat and leather out of this is think 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.260
 I'm a carnivore too 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.060
 it will also be meat and leather 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.200
 come out exactly 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.820
 So you can already see that's how it is 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.459
 some species that have been added here 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.690
 some are quite interesting from he wants 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.430
 Now a lot of carnivorous 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.820
 dead meat more justice 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.769
 hands 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.870
 so have some that are 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.060
 I also believe carnivores exactly and 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.640
 let's go in and I again the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.590
 evil evil crocodiles here or a few 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.760
 evil crocodile event already quite nice on 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.350
 I see you want me here 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.160
 already under bottles you can us 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.900
 do not be ashamed 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.570
 But they also like to go 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.040
 get the mouth already notice the tuber 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.120
 also a bit around a bit 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.410
 because the are dead and yes that's it 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.419
 actually almost I can 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.489
 once again the whole website is shooting here 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.240
 I have packed all of them too 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.490
 with this one on 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.440
 that's a herbivore that 's too 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.960
 a herbivore that is also in the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.900
 shallow herbivore 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.699
 this is an evil that the crocodile 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.819
 now a carnivore that the 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.090
 herbivore so what are we doing 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.770
 everything in 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.930
 so we have not done you then 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.990
 Let's start this is here 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.740
 carnivore this is one 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.789
 carnivore this is one 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.970
 carnivore this is one 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:56.130
 that's a carnivore xbox okay 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.620
 this is a wicked big crocodile 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.479
 what you would like to eat up here 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.130
 is also a crocodile and this is here 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.539
 like a normal herbivore like 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.430
 small are on now I need 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.139
 optimal for a magnifying glass but those are 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.880
 really damn small and that's it 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.070
 cool at the place almost nothing added 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.599
 is also cool by the private law 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.280
 the invention although it already 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.259
 There are several times that was from this 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.330
 motto if he proposes at which place 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.220

 his power is mist apl km 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.099
 At some point it was time to look again 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:34.470
 it means the same 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:36.180

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.430
 I am already looking for a part 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.520
 not after any more 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.259
