00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.800 
I'm using a on pump that I purchased
from<00:02:48.440> Lowe's<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:50.480> direct<00:02:50.840> drive<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.360> it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
from Lowe's it's direct drive so that it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.670 
from Lowe's it's direct drive so that it
ensures<00:02:55.270> good<00:02:56.270> pressure<00:02:56.630> at<00:02:59.140> Heights<00:03:00.140> like<00:03:00.470> my

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
ensures good pressure at Heights like my

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.880 
ensures good pressure at Heights like my
topsy-turvy<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.430> my<00:03:01.640> beans<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.560> used<00:03:03.770> a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
topsy-turvy and my beans and I used a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.650 
topsy-turvy and my beans and I used a
half<00:03:04.040> inch<00:03:04.280> line<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:04.910> ran<00:03:05.030> along<00:03:05.630> the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
half inch line that ran along the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.360 
half inch line that ran along the
railing<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:07.700> tee<00:03:08.000> splitter<00:03:08.450> here<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.380> then

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
railing and a tee splitter here and then

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.550 
railing and a tee splitter here and then
I<00:03:10.400> have<00:03:10.489> quarter<00:03:10.940> inch<00:03:11.120> lines<00:03:11.660> coming<00:03:12.110> off<00:03:12.320> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
I have quarter inch lines coming off the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.140 
I have quarter inch lines coming off the
main<00:03:12.739> line<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:14.239> way<00:03:14.420> every<00:03:14.720> line<00:03:14.930> has<00:03:15.230> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
main line that way every line has the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.710 
main line that way every line has the
max<00:03:17.150> pressure<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:18.380> can<00:03:19.510> max<00:03:20.510> pressure

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
max pressure it can max pressure

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.340 
max pressure it can max pressure
available<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:22.900> discovered<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.019> through

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
available and discovered this through

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.410 
available and discovered this through
some<00:03:24.500> testing<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.160> found<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.700> was<00:03:25.850> getting<00:03:26.269> very

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
some testing I found I was getting very

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.060 
some testing I found I was getting very
little<00:03:26.630> pressure<00:03:26.930> with<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.230> magnetic<00:03:27.800> drive

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
little pressure with a magnetic drive

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.870 
little pressure with a magnetic drive
pump<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.420> also<00:03:29.959> getting<00:03:30.610> very<00:03:31.610> little

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
pump and also getting very little

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.400 
pump and also getting very little
pressure<00:03:32.090> having<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.690> all<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:32.989> quarter-inch

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
pressure having it all in quarter-inch

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.940 
pressure having it all in quarter-inch
lines<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.810> end<00:03:35.959> result<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.620> have

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
lines so this is the end result I have

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.490 
lines so this is the end result I have
some<00:03:37.160> oregano<00:03:37.489> growing<00:03:38.000> over<00:03:38.239> here<00:03:38.500> and

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
some oregano growing over here and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.170 
some oregano growing over here and
what's<00:03:39.739> great<00:03:39.890> about<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.340> is<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.760> just<00:03:40.970> fill

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
what's great about this is I just fill

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.390 
what's great about this is I just fill
up<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.450> bucket<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.680> does<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.070> rest<00:03:43.280> for

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
up the bucket and it does the rest for

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.600 
up the bucket and it does the rest for
me<00:03:43.610> I<00:03:44.000> have<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.080> time<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.560> go<00:03:45.709> off<00:03:45.860> at<00:03:46.070> 7:00<00:03:46.459> a.m.
