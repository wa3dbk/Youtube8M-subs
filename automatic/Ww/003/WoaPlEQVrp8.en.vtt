00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.460 

Jeb<00:05:21.620> Bush<00:05:22.240> yeah<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.390> code<00:05:23.810> only<00:05:23.960> really<00:05:24.260> came

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
Jeb Bush yeah this code only really came

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.460 
Jeb Bush yeah this code only really came
out<00:05:24.500> through<00:05:24.860> kotaku<00:05:25.900> he<00:05:26.900> was<00:05:27.020> today<00:05:27.170> even<00:05:27.560> oh

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
out through kotaku he was today even oh

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.060 
out through kotaku he was today even oh
come<00:05:30.470> on<00:05:30.530> I<00:05:32.110> probably<00:05:33.110> got<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.650> mention<00:05:33.920> that<00:05:33.950> a

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
come on I probably got to mention that a

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.260 
come on I probably got to mention that a
Z<00:05:34.640> is<00:05:34.970> turbo<00:05:35.500> just<00:05:36.500> holding<00:05:36.890> down<00:05:36.980> Z<00:05:37.280> is<00:05:37.430> turbo

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
Z is turbo just holding down Z is turbo

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.400 
Z is turbo just holding down Z is turbo
so<00:05:38.570> it<00:05:38.690> really<00:05:38.840> depends<00:05:39.170> on<00:05:39.380> Oh<00:05:41.290> dunk<00:05:42.290> face

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410
