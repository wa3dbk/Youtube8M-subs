00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.930
 difficult it is expensive but in a complicated 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:41.170
 time for another one second to 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.430
 another happens an act a thing 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.860
 unexpected exchange is involved in the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:57.100
 accident was a collision in the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:00.030
 run over when a solo solo fall 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.030
 literally 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.980
 it's difficult 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.750
 but at the end of the day everyone with 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.400
 I'm not in too much of a hurry. 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.400
 quiet catho 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.840
 but a second of inattention can not 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.620
 to be fatal 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.620
 only 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.350
 funny that he was the type for this 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.270
 this type of content is that virtually 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.920
 all the resident ways had at the time 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.619
 we started two years ago 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.340
 everyone talked about the importance of a 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.850
 good since it is always equipped is that 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.630
 armor is pretty cool mainly 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.940
 for the heat is not well refrigerated 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.940
 importance of using a good glove 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.400
 It was a cool time today. 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.140
 it's not so cool 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.459
 a lot has changed and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.459
 has public has 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.569
 for now because it implies both the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.110
 other aip smoking modes that filled the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.110

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.990
 to fill the bag 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.680
 It's because it was not better. 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.680
 What is doing better? 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.340

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.340

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.430

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.379

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.260

 in the end you are witness in the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.959
 my existence 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.219

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.219

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:18.430
 chu i can not 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.880
 I can use mask 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.390
 I can pretend to be who the ones I am. 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:30.550
 I'm not 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:36.070
 I can not create a character right? 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:40.000
 I just managed to be myself and it will be 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.820
 just me, maybe I do not like it anymore 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.130
 Look at the first thing I care about. 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:50.140
 really is 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:52.680
 I'm pleased with myself if I 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.110
 not satisfied with myself 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.070
 I will not create a character pretends that 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:03.320
 I'm someone else, I'm not going to create one. 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:09.419
 character so people love me 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:12.210
 not for what I'm really but me 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.530
 They love me because I'm a character because 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.530
 I mimic the voice of duck. 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.040
 because the giggling soundless because the 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.360
 I comment on time to ridicule some 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.420
 Some people say that 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.750
 they did not 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.940
 in relation to me there was 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.800
 commenting this ridiculous trying 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:42.460
 to ridicule giggling I do not know 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.460
 To do this, I'll be myself. 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.800
 that is why it implies the bogeyman in goal 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.319
 Many things 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.830
 everyone has the right to be who they want 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.569
 to be 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.569
 I'd rather be right, right? 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.950
 That's why I spent the couple with the 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.840
 other smoking modes 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.840
 that's why it also filled the bag 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:09.519
 Is not it 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.300
 bye bye I'm so 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:24.810
 I could go to the neighborhood 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:28.130

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.130
