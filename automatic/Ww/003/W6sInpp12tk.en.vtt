00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.939
 where went to two points 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.490
 the Swiss disappoint 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.490
 he had already been there 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.039
 Ducousso France in full turmoil 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.790
 we do all our 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.080
 the coach follows me why from hull 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 it's a team that likes to play 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.780
 I also know 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.020
 I told him about the match 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 the ceasefire just as good 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.170
 then we understand why 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.210
 at the German church she 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.210
 too shy 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 once again how could she confirm the spell 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 performance especially since the green light 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.820
 you have to be confident is at the lowest 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.540
 since several weeks 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.879
 his first basket of the first leg 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:17.999
 even if you were 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:18.829
 built 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.639
 he came out of the basilica I must say that it 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.829
 for him his current backwardness 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.059
 no 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.689
 I am aware of nothing 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.959
 but you have to think well because from the sky he helps his round ball 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.499
 however he changed 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.789
 but sure the bottom 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.789
 short stay in korea 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.799
 look carefully 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.939
 I'm screwed 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.039
 do you figure that what is his mandate 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.469
 if the Mediterranean club 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.010
 33 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.010
 what's the duration 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.550
 for the world there is new york 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.789
 we go right in the eye 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.139
 the world 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.129
 and lille 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.129

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:57.919
