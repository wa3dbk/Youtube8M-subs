okay<00:00:04.680> so<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.339> my<00:00:06.740> DIY<00:00:07.740> homemade

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
okay so this is my DIY homemade

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.110 
okay so this is my DIY homemade
what<00:00:09.630> if<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.870> call<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.230> LED<00:00:10.740> grow<00:00:10.920> light<00:00:11.690> it<00:00:12.690> is

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
what if you call it LED grow light it is

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.840 
what if you call it LED grow light it is
about<00:00:15.680> 147<00:00:17.690> individual<00:00:18.690> 10<00:00:19.650> millimeter<00:00:20.400> 10

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850

about 147 individual 10 millimeter 10
millimeter<00:00:22.130> LEDs<00:00:23.359> of<00:00:24.359> red<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.840> blue<00:00:25.820> together

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
millimeter LEDs of red and blue together

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.450 
millimeter LEDs of red and blue together
the<00:00:27.119> two<00:00:27.300> important<00:00:27.900> spectrums<00:00:31.250> few<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.340> them

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the two important spectrums few of them

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.299 
the two important spectrums few of them
aren't<00:00:32.820> working<00:00:33.559> but<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> haven't<00:00:35.010> they're

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
aren't working but I haven't they're

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.830 
aren't working but I haven't they're
just<00:00:35.520> kind<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> complete<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> circuit

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
just kind of to complete the circuit

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.040 
just kind of to complete the circuit
wash<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:37.980> skipped<00:00:38.219> them<00:00:38.840> widely<00:00:39.840> between

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
wash I have skipped them widely between

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.560 
wash I have skipped them widely between
them<00:00:40.320> -<00:00:40.440> they're<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:40.860> aesthetics<00:00:41.570> it's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
them - they're there for aesthetics it's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.840 
them - they're there for aesthetics it's
really<00:00:42.840> long<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.320> 22<00:00:43.890> inches<00:00:43.920> long<00:00:44.960> four<00:00:45.960> by

37 or four by 18 by plus eighteen the
guys<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> middle<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.690> blue<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.320> some

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
guys in the middle are blue for some

reason<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:54.320> use<00:00:55.320> white<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> backgrounds

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
reason I use white for the backgrounds

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.069 
reason I use white for the backgrounds
it's<00:00:56.910> reflective<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> didn't<00:00:57.930> use

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
it's reflective and I didn't use

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.290 
it's reflective and I didn't use
aluminum<00:00:58.590> cuz<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.430> didn't<00:00:59.730> accidentally

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
aluminum cuz I didn't accidentally

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.680 
aluminum cuz I didn't accidentally
conduct<00:01:01.940> probably<00:01:02.940> could<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> give<00:01:03.480> God

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
conduct probably could have you give God

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.719 
conduct probably could have you give God
sort<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.619> scraping<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.189> I've<00:01:05.309> been<00:01:05.430> having

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
sort of scraping that I've been having

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.200 
sort of scraping that I've been having
was<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.510> some<00:01:06.780> hand<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.580> backside<00:01:09.090> it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
was just some hand so the backside it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.250 
was just some hand so the backside it
all<00:01:09.299> my<00:01:09.479> wiring<00:01:09.720> maybe<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.680> cover<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> up

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
all my wiring maybe it's a cover it up

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.440 
all my wiring maybe it's a cover it up
it<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.100> relatively<00:01:14.729> simple<00:01:15.119> as

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it was all this all relatively simple as

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.060 
it was all this all relatively simple as
making<00:01:15.659> sure<00:01:15.900> everything<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.890> right

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
making sure everything was the right

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
making sure everything was the right
polar<00:01:18.500> clarity<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:20.240> wired<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> toggle<00:01:21.750> switch

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
polar clarity I wired in a toggle switch

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.350 
polar clarity I wired in a toggle switch
or<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.400> off<00:01:23.549> switch<00:01:23.820> from<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.150> case

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360

and<00:01:24.740> then<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.130> jack<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.240> power<00:01:27.990> both<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.920> this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and then a jack for power both like this

couple all of this some kind of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.010 
couple all of this some kind of

this is a focus energy each row four has

a 147 ohm resistor to just limit the

a 147 ohm resistor to just limit the
power<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.700> little<00:01:53.850> bit<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.360> don't<00:01:54.509> burn

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720

power a little bit so they don't burn
out<00:01:55.009> earlier<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.250> testing<00:01:56.640> an<00:01:57.000> LEDs<00:01:57.479> with

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
out earlier I was testing an LEDs with

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.690 
out earlier I was testing an LEDs with
nine<00:01:57.840> volt<00:01:58.110> batteries<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.310> found<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
nine volt batteries and I found that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.520 
nine volt batteries and I found that
they<00:01:59.850> were<00:01:59.880> actually<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.439> burning<00:02:01.439> out

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
they were actually just burning out

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.880 
they were actually just burning out
right<00:02:01.799> down<00:02:02.009> there<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.430> those<00:02:02.640> good<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
right down there and those good so this

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.059 
right down there and those good so this
is<00:02:05.070> pretty<00:02:05.670> bright<00:02:06.149> them<00:02:06.740> where<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
is pretty bright them where I got the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.880 
is pretty bright them where I got the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
alleles from claim that the LEDs

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.130

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
MCD but that's that's pretty much

hopefully<00:02:24.080> more<00:02:24.230> than<00:02:24.290> eight<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:24.980> what<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.130> was

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
hopefully more than eight so what I was

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.420 
hopefully more than eight so what I was
going<00:02:25.460> for<00:02:26.140> there<00:02:27.140> are<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.620> little<00:02:28.040> less<00:02:28.190> in<00:02:28.340> a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
going for there are a little less in a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.800 
going for there are a little less in a
lot<00:02:28.700> H<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:30.100> still<00:02:33.340> still<00:02:34.340> very<00:02:34.580> bright

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810

because<00:02:35.810> in<00:02:35.990> our<00:02:36.080> 10<00:02:36.290> millimeter<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:36.980> they

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
because in our 10 millimeter and they
