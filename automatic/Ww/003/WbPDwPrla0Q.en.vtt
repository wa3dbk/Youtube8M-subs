soft this right here though is hard I

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.650 
soft this right here though is hard I
think<00:04:15.520> this<00:04:15.730> is<00:04:15.850> probably<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.180> generation

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
think this is probably the generation

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.970 
think this is probably the generation
where<00:04:16.750> they<00:04:16.810> started<00:04:17.170> cutting<00:04:17.530> corners<00:04:17.830> a

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
where they started cutting corners a

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.130 
where they started cutting corners a
little<00:04:18.220> bit<00:04:18.489> but<00:04:18.790> it's<00:04:19.030> not<00:04:19.120> it's<00:04:19.780> not<00:04:19.930> as<00:04:20.020> bad

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
little bit but it's not it's not as bad

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.710 
little bit but it's not it's not as bad
as<00:04:20.200> like<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.530> current<00:04:20.830> record<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.580> mean<00:04:22.570> the

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
as like the current record I mean the

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.060 
as like the current record I mean the
car<00:04:22.840> look<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.230> carnal<00:04:23.500> core<00:04:23.620> it's<00:04:23.710> not<00:04:23.830> bad

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
car look the carnal core it's not bad

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.260 
car look the carnal core it's not bad
but<00:04:25.050> it's<00:04:26.050> not<00:04:26.200> it's<00:04:26.980> not<00:04:27.100> what<00:04:27.160> Honda<00:04:27.940> used<00:04:28.150> to

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
but it's not it's not what Honda used to

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.210
