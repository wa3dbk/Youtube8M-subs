00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.660
 I was giving talks guys who're talking 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.390
 what are all welcome to another 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.490
 video of bike box 2 and in today's video 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.189
 I bring you a match on the map. 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.869
 raid mode with the ant 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.910
 first video that comfort in the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.769
 I hope you enjoy the channel. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.230
 Damn, I really enjoyed that part. 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.239
 very cool and very frenetic china 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.780
 this map is very good very tasty 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.089
 play 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.160
 is one of the best maps of the black ops 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.660
 two in my opinion has so far 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.869
 that other map that I do not remember 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.040
 name is now 15 years old which is the second 

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:46.170
 video of the one I got one 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.540
 30/40 match and I ended up liking 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.159
 You guys, I've just gotten better at it, right? 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.839
 very different from my first video 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.180
 it was a total fiasco so give up 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:59.900
 shame after that video but anyway 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.850
 was doing part of the script is good staff 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.090
 in my last channel video about 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.280
 the pwc 57 rolled a small controversy and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.350
 she finished June that youtube is over 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 spoiling the game combination concern 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.030
 of four such a face in a way you 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.250
 You can even work out you are player 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 hardcore has also between starts to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.940
 discover all things and with that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.860
 You always end up taking a combination. 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.180
 class and ends up taking advantage of their 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.950
 opponents, right? 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.690
 using youtube whether or not they want 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.450
 end up trying to make these combinations 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.950
 tell the guys these tips for 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.440
 teacher more or less if you connect to 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.970
 person get play admits beneficial 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.700
 if it's inside you 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.800
 in the beginning gives the life of the game then 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.600
 The purpose is basically to show the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.460
 things in the game explain a class or 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.070
 Please, everyone, I do not want to stay. 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.040
 teaching them the face in a certain way or not 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.840
 was much higher than the others without 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.460
 intention of superiority this goes 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.710
 depending on the ability of each 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.540
 it will not be the class that youtube will 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.200
 It's talking on video how to leave the guy. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.909
 good or bad, then stay there in a small 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.310
 message I went a little 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.080
 anyway, what's happening is just 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.420
 a video with a legal class and the galley 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.660
 ended up almost swaying in the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.160
 comments but yes 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.110
 another thing I wanted to talk to 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.820
 you already enjoying the hook is that the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.660
 people are not worried about the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.430
 classes that other clubs pass because 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.530
 because black ops two have one by one 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.250
 set of waters very balanced 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.870
 folks 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.280
 all weapons of the two black ops are 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.290
 played are functional 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.810
 ones are a little better than the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.150
 others but in the general physique in the set 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.160
 Overall they are all very good if you play 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.130
 and that's proof with available for sale 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.660
 here you prove it and the proof of this is that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.520
 You can see me playing. 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.700
 follow with two weapons completely 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.310
 different from one another and is a 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.050
 this is a sum you will get a single click and 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.000
 I do not know now gave me a white made me 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.430
 Forgive me to imitate I do not know that with class 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.590
 But I think she 's an assault. 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.080
 life I think I've been talking silly 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.790
 Forgive me for god's sake, not playing. 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.760
 here with the imitate that is a very 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.240
 Fuck playing really good I'm really 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.610
 playing with a light machine gun ibbl 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.910
 sw galera are two areas completely 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.530
 different from one another and 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.880
 also different from what connects that 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.470
 video that I posted that the guys finished 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.600
 getting quite common brave 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.400
 so so personal in general all the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.440
 drec weapons the two are very 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.050
 depends very much on the combination of 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.730
 body attack and you will be 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.000
 using it you can both 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.920
 improve as average can leave bad there 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.090
 It's all a matter of combining 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.740
 for you to have an idea is to get 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.680
 make a combination of itapira 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.250
 I found it cool to confess mega and it was 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.290
 the flu 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.270
 I found it very cool, that combination. 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.500
 I used it three strikers that I am 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.110
 using three attackers in some 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.270
 I'm also liking areas because I 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.980
 I did not have any more points since we have 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.250
 only ten points to end the star of the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.750
 home the house is building the class 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.260
 entertain and to sacrifice comfort and 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.840
 you can use the overkill, but rather a 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.010
 primary weapon and a secondary weapon and 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.050
 such a tip when you have 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.000
 using two primary weapons a tip 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.200
 I give you is you're last game 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.360
 because two 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.130
 the fest hands man you can change 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.840
 from one weapon to another very fast as 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.739
 if you were using the money 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.750
 here is very fast aa to air exchange 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.910
 a primary to the secondary that you 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.920
 have a house here I have to imitate with 30 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.700
 shots suddenly have no more law than the 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.290
 Xingu is scolding the 75 guy shots is a lot 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.600
 You can do a good thing. 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.700
 back to black tears on black ops 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.860
 two are very good overall using 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.720
 I 'm looking, I'm using this 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.270
 I feel good here with her. 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.550
 enjoying a lot so people have guns 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.930
 good in blackout 25 were the good ones 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.540
 bad weapons 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.850
 man I do not think I have a bad and 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.890
 which type goal in the module was 37 weapons 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.440
 very bad even with the proficiencies 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.150
 to end up getting neither beautiful to play now 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.430
 in black ops 2 they are all very 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.790
 very playable characters iv then 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.320
 that's my little comment I hope 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.790
 that you have understood the message that 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.420
 Do not be angry, do not be 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.480
 complained about nobody 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.920
 and stayed there in that video debating that 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.180
 thought he was saying something about 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.100
 this appeal 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.300
 Anyway, I just wanted to pass on a tip that 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.500
 I find it cool that it's a class I 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.210
 I did very well 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.460
 I hope you can understand this 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.930
 little message in front of the schools have 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.630
 which use in this game 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.590
 always using the lowest scores 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.540
 possible 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.670
 the first is the eiv that is what if the 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.010
 escort strike has to get used to it yet 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.620
 talk so that I can see your 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.920
 opponents in the lively with this you 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.400
 gain assistance every enemy you 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.530
 ends every km that your opponents is 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.900
 that your team friends jenson button 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.940
 you will earn extra points that will 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.500
 adding then it is very important 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.570
 using always requires help 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.240
 gosh and chemistry was so nautical in the 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.860
 game is being delivered to both the 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.600
 according to hamm tequila that I like 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.340
 Holy shit and shipment that day 11 to 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.670
 up he goes looking for an opponent and falls 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.020
 on top of it straight from the slope and a 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.360
 Another cool thing is that if you have 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.160
 someone close to him kills something and 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.020
 Go two guys, I've already seen a video on the 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.420
 internet car killed five enemies 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.480
 Conran have to read is very good and finally 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.430
 as in itunes trike is a kind of 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.070
 Later humor you choose three points in the 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.140
 map and lance and face is very good it 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.000
 still doing great work you 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.960
 can impress and in a given 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.910
 map point passed 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.220

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.080
 what I wanted to do in that video there and 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.460
