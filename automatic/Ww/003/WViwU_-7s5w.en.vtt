00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
this like rocket cannon looking

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.650 
this like rocket cannon looking
thing<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:38.370> know<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.570> got

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
thing I don't know and then it's got

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.500 
thing I don't know and then it's got
these<00:00:39.809> Gatling<00:00:40.590> cannons<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.300> there

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
these Gatling cannons which can go there

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.940 
these Gatling cannons which can go there
as<00:00:42.660> well<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.260> basically<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.920> three

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
as well so you basically have three

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.959 
as well so you basically have three
different<00:00:44.430> options<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.440> four<00:00:46.980> places<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.730> put

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
different options and four places to put

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.490 
different options and four places to put
them<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.600> you're<00:00:48.719> always<00:00:49.079> gonna<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
them so you're always gonna have a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.020 
them so you're always gonna have a
little<00:00:49.620> bit<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.890> extra<00:00:50.219> something<00:00:50.760> laying

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
little bit of extra something laying

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.619 
little bit of extra something laying
around<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:52.190> once<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.730> kit<00:00:54.149> which

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
around now once this is on a kit which

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.939 
around now once this is on a kit which
it<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.020> fix<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.500> their<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:57.559> these<00:00:58.559> parts

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
it can fix to their back these parts

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.680 
it can fix to their back these parts
come<00:00:59.160> apart<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.649> become<00:01:01.649> arms<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> can

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
come apart and become arms what you can

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.580 
come apart and become arms what you can
toggle<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:05.540> swing<00:01:06.540> around<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.229> number<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
toggle and swing around in a number of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.740 
toggle and swing around in a number of
different<00:01:07.860> places<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.299> nice

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
different places and they have a nice

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.010 
different places and they have a nice
little<00:01:09.780> locking<00:01:10.710> mechanism<00:01:11.630> these<00:01:12.630> little

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
little locking mechanism these little

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.920 
little locking mechanism these little
nubs<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.820> they<00:01:14.820> don't<00:01:14.970> look<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.180> effective

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
nubs here they don't look very effective

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
nubs here they don't look very effective
but<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.409> are<00:01:16.830> once<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:17.310> snap

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
but they actually are once they snap

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.219 
but they actually are once they snap
into<00:01:18.000> place<00:01:18.210> they<00:01:18.689> are<00:01:18.720> fully<00:01:19.380> rigid<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
into place they are fully rigid and

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
into place they are fully rigid and
they're<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.830> around<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
they're not around so it's a

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
they're not around so it's a
pretty<00:01:24.659> tight<00:01:24.900> little<00:01:25.140> kit<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.130> you've

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
pretty tight little kit and then you've

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.140 
pretty tight little kit and then you've
got<00:01:26.810> these<00:01:27.810> arms<00:01:28.350> which<00:01:29.250> extend<00:01:29.670> whatever<00:01:30.000> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
got these arms which extend whatever it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.730 
got these arms which extend whatever it
is<00:01:30.329> above<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.049> head<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.040> kit<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:33.740> under

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
is above the head of the kit or under

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.270 
is above the head of the kit or under
the<00:01:34.890> arms<00:01:35.570> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.810> way<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> strike

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the arms in the way that the strike

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.620 
the arms in the way that the strike
freedoms<00:01:38.790> rail<00:01:39.240> guns<00:01:39.540> are<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:45.240> also<00:01:45.360> have

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
freedoms rail guns are you also have

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
freedoms rail guns are you also have
this<00:01:45.990> thing<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:48.470> which<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.920> believe

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
this thing right here which I believe

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.690 
this thing right here which I believe
takes<00:01:51.000> these<00:01:51.299> no<00:01:51.810> actually<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.439> doesn't

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
takes these no actually it doesn't

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.200 
takes these no actually it doesn't
just<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.149> tiny<00:01:54.299> gun<00:01:56.180> with<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> toggle<00:01:57.540> handle

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.760 

and<00:02:00.300> then<00:02:00.960> these<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:02.690> tiny<00:02:03.690> little<00:02:03.870> cannons<00:02:04.650> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and then these are tiny little cannons I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.820 
and then these are tiny little cannons I
don't<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.010> if<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.190> can<00:02:05.310> see<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.830> turrets

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
don't know if you can see the turrets

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.660 
don't know if you can see the turrets
there<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.550> there's<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:10.670> tri
