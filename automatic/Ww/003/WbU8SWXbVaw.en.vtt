forest<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:17.250> more<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
forest here go a little bit more to the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030 
forest here go a little bit more to the
left<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> beach<00:01:19.229> before<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.860> but

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
left there was a beach before here but

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
left there was a beach before here but
now<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.130> changed<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> forest<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
now I changed that and in the forest and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.399 
now I changed that and in the forest and
also<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.710> ground<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.159> 50%<00:01:23.580> sand<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.540> 50%

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
also the ground is 50% sand and 50%

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.340 
also the ground is 50% sand and 50%
grass<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:27.030> sand<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.720> more<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> dirt

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
grass not sand but it's more like a dirt

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.160 
grass not sand but it's more like a dirt
color<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.240> stained<00:01:30.509> clay<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:31.020> not

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
color but it is stained clay so it's not

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.679 
color but it is stained clay so it's not
dirt<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.560> sand<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> looks<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> closest<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
dirt or sand but it looks the closest to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.660 
dirt or sand but it looks the closest to
the<00:01:33.810> thing<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.229> game<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.680> there's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.369> little

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the thing in game and there's a little

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.390 
the thing in game and there's a little
gap<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.740> make<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.100> too

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
gap going in here so that make that too

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.760 
gap going in here so that make that too
and<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.090> getting<00:01:39.420> night<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.900> let's<00:01:40.200> set<00:01:40.590> my

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and it's getting night so let's set my

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.130 
and it's getting night so let's set my
time<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:42.380> time<00:01:43.380> day<00:01:44.119> there<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.390> there's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.280 
time to time day there you go there's
another<00:01:46.229> bob<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.950> another<00:01:47.460> bob<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.689> did

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
another bob and another bob so I did

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.960 
another bob and another bob so I did
it's<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> way<00:01:49.829> around<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.579> see<00:01:50.759> I

it's all the way around as you can see I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.719 
it's all the way around as you can see I
still<00:01:51.420> need<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> make<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:51.829> little<00:01:52.829> gaps<00:01:53.460> in

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
still need to make some little gaps in

floating island of buildings so I made

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.559 
floating island of buildings so I made
it<00:02:10.200> an<00:02:10.530> example<00:02:11.039> here<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.760> 15<00:02:12.360> by<00:02:12.510> 15

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
it an example here this is 15 by 15

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.640 
it an example here this is 15 by 15
which<00:02:13.110> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
which is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.990 
which is
three<00:02:14.159> by<00:02:14.489> three<00:02:14.790> blocks<00:02:15.090> as<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.720> can<00:02:15.870> show<00:02:16.049> you
