00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
seat belts I kind of have to do them at

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.190 
seat belts I kind of have to do them at
the<00:00:05.250> same<00:00:05.460> time<00:00:05.730> because<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.330> couple<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.990> the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
the same time because a couple of the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.810 
the same time because a couple of the
the<00:00:07.470> bolts<00:00:07.740> are<00:00:07.859> used<00:00:08.040> for<00:00:08.220> both<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.490> bracket

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
the bolts are used for both the bracket

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.790 
the bolts are used for both the bracket
and<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.090> seat<00:00:09.269> belts<00:00:09.540> we<00:00:10.110> want<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.410> start<00:00:10.650> with

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
and the seat belts we want to start with

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.820 
and the seat belts we want to start with
is<00:00:10.980> taking<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:12.139> seat<00:00:13.139> bracket<00:00:13.290> itself

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
is taking the seat bracket itself

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.760 
is taking the seat bracket itself
setting<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.790> into<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> floor<00:00:15.299> tub<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.560> side

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
setting it into the floor tub the side

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.070 
setting it into the floor tub the side
that<00:00:16.949> has<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.369> two<00:00:17.760> rectangular<00:00:18.300> slots<00:00:18.779> and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
that has the two rectangular slots and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.950 
that has the two rectangular slots and
then<00:00:19.170> all<00:00:19.350> these<00:00:19.590> holes<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.539> this<00:00:21.539> edge<00:00:21.779> this

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
then all these holes on this edge this

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.050 
then all these holes on this edge this
kind<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.230> rearward<00:00:22.710> facing<00:00:22.740> leg<00:00:23.310> that's<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
kind of rearward facing leg that's the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.000 
kind of rearward facing leg that's the
inside<00:00:24.480> there<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> left<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.740> right<00:00:25.769> side

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
inside there is a left and a right side

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.570 
inside there is a left and a right side
so<00:00:26.939> if<00:00:27.029> any<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.300> make<00:00:27.480> sure<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.720> 1/2<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.080> 2

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
so if any one make sure the 1/2 to 2

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.589 
so if any one make sure the 1/2 to 2
rectangles<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> middle<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:30.449> all

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
rectangles in the middle and then all

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.479 
rectangles in the middle and then all
the<00:00:30.720> circles<00:00:31.080> along<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> side<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:31.769> goes

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the circles along the side here goes

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.270 
the circles along the side here goes
towards<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> inside<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.860> would<00:00:35.130> make

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
towards the inside so that would make

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.410 
towards the inside so that would make
this<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> passenger<00:00:36.270> side

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
this one here the passenger side

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.340 
this one here the passenger side
obviously<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:39.079> before<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
obviously what you can do is before you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.250 
obviously what you can do is before you
set<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.710> down<00:00:40.860> into<00:00:41.070> position<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.300> drill

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
set it down into position you can drill

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
set it down into position you can drill
out<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.680> hole<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.610> rear<00:00:44.820> bracket

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.010 
transmission is on that side you cannot
get<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.550> drill<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:25.910> there<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.660> then<00:02:26.840> now

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
get the drill in there so then now

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.210 
get the drill in there so then now
you've<00:02:27.200> got<00:02:27.320> those<00:02:27.470> three<00:02:27.739> locks<00:02:28.070> into

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
you've got those three locks into

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.310 
you've got those three locks into
position<00:02:28.400> use<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.060> as<00:02:29.150> reference<00:02:29.330> drill<00:02:30.290> a
