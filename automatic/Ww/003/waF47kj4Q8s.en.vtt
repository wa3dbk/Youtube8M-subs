00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
would have to be because of the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.120 
would have to be because of the
opaqueness<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:14.240> would<00:01:14.750> say<00:01:14.930> two<00:01:14.990> coats<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.800> it

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
is definitely opaque now another thing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.130 
is definitely opaque now another thing
is<00:01:19.010> that<00:01:19.040> these<00:01:19.430> glide<00:01:19.820> on<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.360> buttery<00:01:20.630> smooth

is that these glide on so buttery smooth

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.289 
is that these glide on so buttery smooth
and<00:01:21.500> they<00:01:21.890> are<00:01:22.010> very<00:01:22.400> comfortable<00:01:23.030> on<00:01:23.119> the

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
and they are very comfortable on the

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.940 
and they are very comfortable on the
lips<00:01:23.330> they<00:01:24.049> do<00:01:24.260> have<00:01:24.440> a<00:01:24.470> little<00:01:24.650> bit<00:01:24.770> of

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
lips they do have a little bit of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.770 
lips they do have a little bit of
tackiness<00:01:25.369> but<00:01:25.820> it's<00:01:26.150> nice<00:01:26.390> that<00:01:26.420> they<00:01:26.750> have

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
tackiness but it's nice that they have

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.170 
tackiness but it's nice that they have
that<00:01:27.110> tackiness<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:27.799> at<00:01:27.890> least<00:01:28.100> it's<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.909> little

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
that tackiness so at least it's a little

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.940 
that tackiness so at least it's a little
bit<00:01:29.330> longer<00:01:29.659> wearing<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:30.470> would<00:01:30.619> say<00:01:30.799> the
