00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.769
 London will be greener , at least 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.540
 Hope to talk about the new project cycle 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.150
 you can hear more big cities with you 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.760
 a lot of traffic and increasing 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.960
 Environmental burden overwhelmed with the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.760
 Riding a bicycle is a lot of people 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.010
 but too dangerous because if you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.150
 Curve around the cars 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.369
 then it can happen 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.019
 that one or the other door or the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.240
 one or the other bonnet in the way and 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.380
 exactly london would like to start now 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 in the next years you want more 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.969
 as a billion euros in the bike 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.579
 infrastructure put the bicycles 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.860
 should have their own style bike 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.989
 Train get it similar highway only 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.680
 for bicycles then over the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.430
 tramway and busy roads 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.739
 lead a total of 220 kilometers sky cycle 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.949
 highways are to be built and over 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.539
 200 Additions even with this order shall 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.760
 then even be partially faster than 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.440
 By car one can understand well in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.489
 he is always jam in the city piccoli idea 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.260
 I think it does 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.960
 Cycling for a safer and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.920
 but also that drivers are there why 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.010
 They do not always end up in the dead 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.979
 watch if the cyclist with 180 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.540
 drives past and overtakes something on the right side 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.439
 Do you think of an idea of ​​such a sky? 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.840
 highway post as well as comments after 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.360
 a 29 year old student last week in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.580
 Schmalkalden has tried in his 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.049
 dorm to come and not 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.840
 he has decided 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.610
 a little offbeat way too 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.259
 choose at night in front of the door wanted 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.329
 Keys just do not work 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.400
 and also the roommate shines in 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.280
 his storm does not ring the bell 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.350
 only solution, of course, he grabs 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720
 The key from his car and drives 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.899
 just by the entrance door 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.780
 but then in his well deserved 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.060
 bed to fall a lot to the 29-year-old 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.729
 that he is not in this house 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.920
 But after all, he was almost living on 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.380
 arrived, he decided then 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.200
 but to stay in the corridor next to the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.369
 radiator fully extended relaxed 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.259
 first of all delicious animals from his 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.390
 well-deserved beauty sleep became 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.340
 but then 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.110
 nothing but a witness of the whole 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.970
 The police had called the police 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.830
 then of course, wake him up and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.610
 realized he was not drinking 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.370
 would have 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.730
 fact but he admitted to the day before so 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.720
 smoked little bit of crystal meth 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.459
 to have 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.320
 children children what do we learn from this 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.240
 Steer clear of the drugs and especially 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.620
 also from the car key then and before 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.600
 all of the car key if you do not have one 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.800
 driving license and especially from 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.700
 Exclusion from a father does not want one 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.600
 driver license and their small ones 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.430
 lamborghini has an unusual but 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.040
 but in the end very enjoyable 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.040
 Surprise experienced a man in the game 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.260
 because as the 81 year old sven olof 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.450
 yes, he really is his name 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.010
 newspaper in the morning, he marveled 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.170
 was not bad because in the newspaper 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.690
 his own death announcement he was before 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.730
 been in the hospital a short while ago 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.800
 the firm conviction that he did this 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.739
 then left alive after one 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.110
 he pinched a short check once 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.790
 Himself for living and decided 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.560
 to get to the bottom of the matter 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.959
 It quickly turned out that his 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.140
 sister who now also 90 years 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.690
 old is something to do with the thing 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.820
 because she had him when he was in 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.769
 Hospital was after a visit 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.590
 confusing entertainment with Vincent 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.989
 This doctor was convinced of it 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.640
 that her brother is dead in her 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.470
 she went straight to confusion 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.450
 newspaper and created a death announcement 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.380
 for her brother she believed in 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.510
 that he was dead 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.660
 what can get the move today 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.780
 not on tomorrow but he saw the whole 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.560
 with humor and quoted mark twain the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.680
 Rumors about a death are something 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.190
 exaggerated 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.440
 end well, everything goes right on 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.250
 with a computer after advertising ralf 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.560

 they are a computer too slow 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.219
 You may have to intervene 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.060

 you can do it all 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.299
 You can even write uppercase letters 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.879
 pay lowercase and if you do now 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.879

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.180
 Hard to imagine without these days 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.639
 But computers are constantly changing 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.610
 more powerful modern and faster 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.550
