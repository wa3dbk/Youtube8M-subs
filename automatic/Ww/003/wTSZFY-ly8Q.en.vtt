able to stay at Walmart six or seven

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.730 
able to stay at Walmart six or seven
days<00:02:08.070> at<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> time<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:10.320> it's<00:02:10.500> worked<00:02:10.649> out

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
days at a time and it's worked out

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.960 
days at a time and it's worked out
really<00:02:10.800> well<00:02:11.130> for<00:02:11.160> me<00:02:11.400> over<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.640> years<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.879> it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
really well for me over the years and it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.339 
really well for me over the years and it
saved<00:02:12.150> me<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> tremendous<00:02:12.510> amount<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.140> money

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
saved me a tremendous amount of money

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.930 
saved me a tremendous amount of money
and<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:14.099> thought<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.489> might<00:02:14.640> be<00:02:14.730> something

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and I thought that might be something

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.640 
and I thought that might be something
that<00:02:15.120> might<00:02:15.659> be<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.810> use<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.080> some<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.500> you

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
that might be of use to some of you

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.130 
that might be of use to some of you
you<00:02:17.299> obviously<00:02:18.299> it<00:02:18.360> wouldn't<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.659> abused<00:02:19.049> to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
you obviously it wouldn't be abused to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.089 
you obviously it wouldn't be abused to
you<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.439> didn't<00:02:19.709> even<00:02:19.799> know<00:02:19.950> what

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
you if you didn't even know what

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.670 
you if you didn't even know what
boondocking<00:02:20.519> was<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.970> begin<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.439> but<00:02:22.439> I<00:02:22.470> just

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
boondocking was to begin with but I just

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.960 
boondocking was to begin with but I just
thought<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:22.829> wanted<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.159> share<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
thought I wanted to share that with you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.569 
thought I wanted to share that with you
