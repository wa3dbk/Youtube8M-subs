00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.420
Hello, everyone!

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:09.080
In this video tutorial I’ll show you how to crochet a matching scarf to the beanie hat that I've made earlier.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.220
For the scarf I used a simple stitch that is easy to follow

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.580
and doesn't require any prior crocheting experience.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.540
For the scarf I already made

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.780
a foundation chain of thirty three chain stitches

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.700
or multiples of two chains plus one additional chain.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.980
And for the first row

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.600
I will work single crochet.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.740
So, I will insert my hook into the second chain

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.680
so, this is first second

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.060
Grab the yarn and pull it through 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.920
I have two chains stitches on my hook.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.960
Grab the yarn and pull it through.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.380
So, this is one single crochet

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.920
and just continue working single crochet to end

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.660
of the row.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.720
At the end of the first row work one returning chain

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.420
and turn.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.920
For the second row work in the second chain

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.440
again single crochet one.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.280
Then

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.820
in the following chain work one cluster for that yarn over

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.420
insert the hook into a chain, grab the yarn and pull it through.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.320
You have three stitches on your hook

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.060
Grab the yarn and pull it through the first two stitches on your hook.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.820
Now you have two stitches left.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.020
Again one more time.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.420
Yarn over in the same chain

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.220
insert the hook, grab the yarn and pull it through.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.440
You have four stitches on your hook.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.340
Yarn over and pull the yarn through the first two stitches on your hook.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.040
Now you have three stitches left.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.300
And last time yarn over in the same chain

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.280
grab the yarn and pull it through

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.240
and pull the yarn through the first two stitches on your hook.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.000
Four stitches left yarn over and pull the yarn through the four stitches on your hook.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.100
In the following chain work single crochet

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.680
and then just alternate

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.940
cluster - single crochet

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.340
cluster and so on 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.720
to end 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.560
of the row.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.140
At the end of the second row

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.540
you should have

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.940
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,  clusters.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.040
Work in the very last chain one single crochet,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.320
one chain

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.600
and then just work 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.900
again in the second chain

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.760
single crochet to end.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.760
At the end of the third row work one 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.940
returning chain and turn.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.420
In the second chain work one single crochet,

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.780
one cluster in the following chain.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.020
And then just alternate

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.580
cluster/single crochet – cluster/single crochet

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.380
to end of the row.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.100
At the end of each row work one returning chain.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.280
And alternate rows also

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.640
cluster row/single crochet row - cluster row/single crochet row

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.360
and so on until you reach the desire length of your scarf.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.840
After you crochet the desire length of the pattern

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680
cut the yarn and secure it.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.420
After that your scarf will be ready

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.340
and thank you for watching.
