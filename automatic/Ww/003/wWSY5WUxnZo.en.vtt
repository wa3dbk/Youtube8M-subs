00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
play and today we got a chance to go

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.390 
play and today we got a chance to go
hands-on<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.630> new<00:00:16.230> iPad<00:00:16.770> Mini<00:00:17.100> from

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
hands-on with the new iPad Mini from

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.390 
hands-on with the new iPad Mini from
Apple<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> ipad<00:00:19.380> mini<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
Apple so this is the ipad mini and the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.529 
Apple so this is the ipad mini and the
first<00:00:20.580> thing<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.820> noticed<00:00:21.060> when<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.180> picked<00:00:21.449> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
first thing we noticed when we picked it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.450 
first thing we noticed when we picked it
up<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.410> thing<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.680> incredibly

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
up was that this thing is incredibly

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.460 
up was that this thing is incredibly
light<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.570> little<00:00:24.660> bit<00:00:24.810> bigger<00:00:25.109> than<00:00:25.320> we

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
light it's a little bit bigger than we

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.550 
light it's a little bit bigger than we
were<00:00:25.560> expecting<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:26.670> screen<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.269> 7.9<00:00:28.170> inches

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
were expecting the screen is 7.9 inches

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.740 
were expecting the screen is 7.9 inches
and<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.429> still<00:00:29.640> got<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.910> bezel<00:00:30.390> around<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
and it still got that bezel around the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.380 
and it still got that bezel around the
edge<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.340> would<00:00:32.640> probably<00:00:33.000> take<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.239> little

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
edge so it would probably take a little

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.910 
edge so it would probably take a little
bit<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.600> dexterity<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.739> touch

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
bit of dexterity to actually touch

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.370 
bit of dexterity to actually touch
everything<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> screen<00:00:36.050> using<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.230> one

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
everything on the screen using just one

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.470 
everything on the screen using just one
hand<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.430> still<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> two-handed<00:00:39.180> device

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
hand so it's still a two-handed device

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.319 
hand so it's still a two-handed device
but<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.950> light<00:00:41.190> you're<00:00:41.850> able<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
but because it's so light you're able to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.549 
but because it's so light you're able to
hold<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> mobile<00:00:43.829> device<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.789> iphone

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
hold it like a mobile device like iphone

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
hold it like a mobile device like iphone
as<00:00:46.559> much<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.489> size<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.239> form

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
as much as we like the size and form

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.020 
as much as we like the size and form
factor<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.230> new<00:00:49.410> smaller<00:00:49.800> ipad<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.520> does

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
factor of this new smaller ipad it does

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.600 
factor of this new smaller ipad it does
come<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.390> some<00:00:51.780> trade-offs<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:53.399> it's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
come with some trade-offs for one it's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.340 
come with some trade-offs for one it's
going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.629> expensive<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
going to be a little bit expensive a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.450 
going to be a little bit expensive a
little<00:00:55.530> more<00:00:55.680> expensive<00:00:56.100> than<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.280> thought

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
little more expensive than we thought

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.090 
little more expensive than we thought
it's<00:00:56.910> 330<00:00:57.480> dollars<00:00:57.989> which<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.649> still<00:00:58.890> less

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
it's 330 dollars which is still less

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.150 
it's 330 dollars which is still less
than<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.609> newer<00:01:00.239> version<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> ipad<00:01:01.230> but

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
than a newer version of the ipad but

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.979 
than a newer version of the ipad but
more<00:01:02.699> than<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:03.120> were<00:01:03.239> expecting<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.899> it's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
more than we were expecting and it's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.050 
more than we were expecting and it's
definitely<00:01:04.290> more<00:01:04.589> than<00:01:04.650> competing<00:01:05.519> tablets

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
definitely more than competing tablets

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.690 
definitely more than competing tablets
like<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> nook<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.960> kindle<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.700> secondly

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
like the nook and kindle and secondly

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.789 
like the nook and kindle and secondly
the<00:01:08.970> ipad<00:01:09.299> mini<00:01:09.330> uses<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> exact<00:01:10.380> same<00:01:10.560> chip

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the ipad mini uses the exact same chip

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.130 
the ipad mini uses the exact same chip
is<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> ipad<00:01:11.430> 2<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> has<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> same<00:01:12.840> screen

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
is the ipad 2 and has the same screen

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.830 
is the ipad 2 and has the same screen
size<00:01:13.200> resolution<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> what<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> means<00:01:15.570> is

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
size resolution so what that means is

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.719 
size resolution so what that means is
you're<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> get<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> Retina<00:01:17.310> display

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you're not going to get a Retina display

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.640 
you're not going to get a Retina display
but<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> does<00:01:18.540> look<00:01:18.570> sharper<00:01:19.110> than<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> ipad

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
but it does look sharper than the ipad

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.190 
but it does look sharper than the ipad

mini and that's because it probably
won't<00:01:59.729> run<00:01:59.909> them<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.240> well<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.439> played

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
real racing to the game took a long time

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.139 
real racing to the game took a long time
to<00:02:03.689> load<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.500> when<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.250> did<00:02:05.399> load<00:02:05.579> up<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
to load up and when it did load up it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.510 
to load up and when it did load up it
looked<00:02:06.329> nice<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.590> not<00:02:07.590> nearly<00:02:07.829> as<00:02:07.950> nice<00:02:08.220> as

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
looked nice but not nearly as nice as

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.500 
looked nice but not nearly as nice as
the<00:02:08.789> real<00:02:09.270> racing<00:02:09.660> 3<00:02:09.690> trailers<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.649> Apple

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
the real racing 3 trailers that Apple

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.390 
the real racing 3 trailers that Apple
off<00:02:11.689> with<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.959> iphone<00:02:12.260> 5<00:02:12.530> just<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.069> few<00:02:13.280> months

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.479 
off with the iphone 5 just a few months
ago<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.959> our<00:02:15.170> take<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:15.769> if<00:02:16.189> you're<00:02:16.340> really

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.429 
ago so our take is that if you're really
