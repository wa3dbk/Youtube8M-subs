an eye i can't fuse with my two eyes and

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.029 
an eye i can't fuse with my two eyes and
so<00:00:25.980> my<00:00:26.580> mother<00:00:26.820> knew<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.330> my<00:00:27.990> rhythm<00:00:28.410> was

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
so my mother knew that my rhythm was

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.939 
so my mother knew that my rhythm was
very<00:00:29.840> developed<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.990> me<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> went<00:00:31.859> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
very developed in me and so I went to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.979 
very developed in me and so I went to
Dalcroze<00:00:32.309> Eurythmics<00:00:32.909> which<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.479> way<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
Dalcroze Eurythmics which is a way of

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.529 
Dalcroze Eurythmics which is a way of
learning<00:00:34.229> music<00:00:34.530> through<00:00:35.010> movement<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
learning music through movement and I

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.040 
learning music through movement and I
think<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.069> learning<00:00:38.149> music<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.629> movement

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
think that learning music and movement

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.779 
think that learning music and movement
at<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.739> same<00:00:40.920> time<00:00:41.190> was<00:00:41.399> something<00:00:41.699> that's

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
at the same time was something that's

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.879 
at the same time was something that's
always<00:00:42.059> been<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> part<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.289> how<00:00:43.440> I've<00:00:43.589> worked

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:43.889 
always been a part of how I've worked

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:45.649 
always been a part of how I've worked
and<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.339> in<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.670> sense<00:00:44.909> I<00:00:44.999> take<00:00:45.179> it<00:00:45.299> for<00:00:45.449> granted

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
and I in a sense I take it for granted

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.959 
and I in a sense I take it for granted
that<00:00:46.049> those<00:00:46.649> two<00:00:46.889> things<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.429> a<00:00:47.460> relation<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
that those two things have a relation to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:58.480 
that those two things have a relation to
each<00:00:48.149> other
