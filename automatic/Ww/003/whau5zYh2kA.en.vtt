00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
is very important so if you notice the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.790 
is very important so if you notice the
stairs<00:04:56.729> are<00:04:56.909> actually<00:04:57.270> upside-down<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:58.409> this

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
paintings are confusing they don't

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.119

actually exist in real life you know you
go<00:05:05.280> in<00:05:05.370> wrong<00:05:05.550> door<00:05:05.879> you<00:05:05.969> come<00:05:06.120> out<00:05:06.210> on

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
go in wrong door you come out on

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.510 
go in wrong door you come out on
different<00:05:06.599> area<00:05:07.139> and<00:05:07.379> everything's<00:05:08.129> upside

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
different area and everything's upside

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.860 
different area and everything's upside
down<00:05:08.699> it's<00:05:08.940> flipped<00:05:09.150> around<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.629> as<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.750> can

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
down it's flipped around and as you can

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.559 
down it's flipped around and as you can
see<00:05:09.930> here<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:11.090> initially<00:05:12.090> when<00:05:12.180> you<00:05:12.270> look<00:05:12.449> at

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
see here and initially when you look at

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:13.820 
see here and initially when you look at
it<00:05:12.659> you<00:05:12.750> think<00:05:12.780> it's<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.229> right<00:05:13.319> way<00:05:13.500> up<00:05:13.650> but

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
it you think it's the right way up but

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.709 
it you think it's the right way up but
apparently<00:05:13.919> this<00:05:14.580> is<00:05:14.819> actually<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:15.599> wrong

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
apparently this is actually the wrong

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.290 
apparently this is actually the wrong
way<00:05:15.930> up<00:05:16.080> so<00:05:16.319> perhaps<00:05:16.979> when<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.430> actually<00:05:17.819> walk

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
way up so perhaps when you actually walk

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.330 
way up so perhaps when you actually walk
on<00:05:18.479> certain<00:05:18.990> parts<00:05:19.139> of<00:05:19.409> the<00:05:19.530> Maps<00:05:19.740> certain

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
on certain parts of the Maps certain

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.490 
on certain parts of the Maps certain
stairs<00:05:20.699> certain<00:05:21.210> doors<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:22.020> map<00:05:22.199> sort<00:05:22.409> of

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
stairs certain doors the map sort of

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.800 
stairs certain doors the map sort of
flips<00:05:22.770> upside<00:05:23.190> down<00:05:23.460> that's<00:05:24.120> what<00:05:24.389> it<00:05:24.479> appears

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
flips upside down that's what it appears

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.089 
flips upside down that's what it appears
to<00:05:24.960> be<00:05:24.990> like<00:05:25.229> within<00:05:25.440> this<00:05:25.620> image<00:05:25.919> here<00:05:26.069> and

to be like within this image here and

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.260 
to be like within this image here and
you're<00:05:26.250> actually<00:05:26.340> just<00:05:26.610> crazy

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
you're actually just crazy

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.270 
you're actually just crazy

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
already we can see open spaces to get

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.589 
already we can see open spaces to get

hordes of zombies together which is very
exciting<00:05:31.259> the<00:05:31.680> more<00:05:31.889> room<00:05:32.099> the<00:05:32.310> better<00:05:32.490> for

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
exciting the more room the better for

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.820 
exciting the more room the better for
sure<00:05:33.150> looks<00:05:33.750> like<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:33.930> large<00:05:34.169> map<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.770> of

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
sure looks like a large map and of

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.290 
sure looks like a large map and of
course<00:05:35.039> you've<00:05:35.159> got<00:05:35.190> two<00:05:35.490> big<00:05:35.729> buildings<00:05:36.180> so

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
course you've got two big buildings so

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.969 
course you've got two big buildings so
I'm<00:05:36.360> really<00:05:36.719> really<00:05:36.870> excited<00:05:37.259> to<00:05:37.740> play<00:05:37.860> this

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
I'm really really excited to play this

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.350 
I'm really really excited to play this
map<00:05:38.190> can't<00:05:38.520> wait<00:05:38.639> to<00:05:38.729> get<00:05:38.819> my<00:05:38.909> hands<00:05:39.090> in<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.270> I'd

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
map can't wait to get my hands in it I'd

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.149 
map can't wait to get my hands in it I'd
assume<00:05:39.690> this<00:05:39.779> would<00:05:39.900> be<00:05:40.020> similar<00:05:40.259> to<00:05:40.349> the

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
assume this would be similar to the

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.370 
assume this would be similar to the
green<00:05:41.940> run<00:05:42.210> map<00:05:42.419> we've<00:05:42.599> already<00:05:42.719> seen<00:05:43.020> so<00:05:43.259> it's

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
green run map we've already seen so it's

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.350 
green run map we've already seen so it's
give<00:05:43.469> me<00:05:43.529> a<00:05:43.590> transit<00:05:44.039> option<00:05:44.370> even<00:05:44.909> smaller

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
give me a transit option even smaller

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.899 
give me a transit option even smaller
survival<00:05:46.430> options<00:05:47.430> which<00:05:47.580> are<00:05:47.699> basically

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
survival options which are basically

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.120 
survival options which are basically
smaller<00:05:48.270> parts<00:05:48.719> of<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.900> maps<00:05:49.139> and<00:05:49.409> so<00:05:49.979> that's

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
smaller parts of the maps and so that's

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
smaller parts of the maps and so that's
going<00:05:50.279> to<00:05:50.340> be<00:05:50.430> cool<00:05:50.580> lots<00:05:50.819> of<00:05:50.909> different

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
going to be cool lots of different

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.390 
going to be cool lots of different
options<00:05:51.240> after<00:05:51.599> the<00:05:51.659> zombies<00:05:51.960> map<00:05:52.139> as<00:05:52.979> well

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
options after the zombies map as well

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.070 
options after the zombies map as well
and<00:05:53.639> also<00:05:53.969> the<00:05:54.090> new<00:05:54.300> zombies<00:05:54.779> mode<00:05:54.960> now

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
and also the new zombies mode now

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.619 
and also the new zombies mode now
actually<00:05:55.590> this<00:05:56.580> was<00:05:56.759> kind<00:05:56.940> of<00:05:57.000> leaked<00:05:57.300> and

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:57.629 
actually this was kind of leaked and

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.269
