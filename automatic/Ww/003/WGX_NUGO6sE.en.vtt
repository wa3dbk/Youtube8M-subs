00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.360
 him for a weapon 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.270

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.270

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.500
 by myself 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.270

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.950
 watch him kill the taboo park or 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.680

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.920

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:43.700
 I don't want to become like this

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.170

 operations 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.290
 [music] 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.130
 what's new here 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.509
 the scouts we saw as a carnage killer 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.370
 hit ravencroft 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.139
 or whatever it is called, well, in my opinion, I 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.570
 correctly said a series of course 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.699
 It turned out very small there probably 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.800
 10 minutes no you're not sorry for that but 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.229
 you know what if the series turned out 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.199
 a little evening will be another 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.150
 series so wait by the way we are probably in 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.810
 This series will meet with a female cat 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.039
 so it will be very interesting and 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.870
 special group dependence they now generally 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.330
 on a very cool imagined think that 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.190
 on seeing Spider-Man well, we'll see 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.830
 who else who will win okay on this all 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.530

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.090
 carnage killer and delighted I do not know 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.500
