00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
some people out there my remember who

some people out there my remember who
wrestled<00:04:21.510> Italy<00:04:21.810> as<00:04:22.020> Festus<00:04:22.680> or<00:04:22.919> luke<00:04:23.100> gallows

wrestled Italy as Festus or luke gallows

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.210 
wrestled Italy as Festus or luke gallows
basically<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.740> feud<00:04:26.280> was<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.430> huge<00:04:26.669> bomb

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
basically that feud was a huge bomb

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.010 
basically that feud was a huge bomb
well<00:04:27.310> they<00:04:27.460> had<00:04:28.060> one<00:04:28.270> match<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.840> match

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
well they had one match and the match

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.650 
well they had one match and the match
was<00:04:29.170> so<00:04:29.380> bad<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:30.040> they<00:04:30.970> scrap<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.600> whole

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
was so bad that they scrap the whole

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.620 
was so bad that they scrap the whole
thing<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:33.730> this<00:04:33.880> is<00:04:34.060> definitely<00:04:34.270> not<00:04:34.480> a

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
thing and so this is definitely not a

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.150 
thing and so this is definitely not a
good<00:04:34.930> history<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.440> difference<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:35.980> that

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
good history the difference is is that

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.330 
good history the difference is is that
these<00:04:36.730> are<00:04:36.880> not<00:04:37.030> you<00:04:37.270> know<00:04:37.350> too<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:39.250> know

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
these are not you know too you know

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.010 
these are not you know too you know
seven<00:04:39.610> feet<00:04:39.850> tall<00:04:39.880> guys<00:04:40.330> were<00:04:40.570> wrestling<00:04:40.930> each

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
seven feet tall guys were wrestling each

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.800 
seven feet tall guys were wrestling each
other<00:04:41.140> these<00:04:41.320> are<00:04:41.440> we<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.710> Lucy<00:04:42.100> doors

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
other these are we to Lucy doors

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.610 
other these are we to Lucy doors
wrestling<00:04:43.810> each<00:04:43.900> other<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.200> the<00:04:44.290> match<00:04:44.440> is

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
wrestling each other so the match is

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.740 
wrestling each other so the match is
probably<00:04:44.950> pretty<00:04:45.160> good<00:04:45.460> in<00:04:45.610> Sin<00:04:45.820> Cara<00:04:46.030> the
