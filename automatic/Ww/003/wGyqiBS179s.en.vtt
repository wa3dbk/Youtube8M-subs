00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
it's the embryonic stage that that God

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.279 
it's the embryonic stage that that God
is<00:05:54.710> talking<00:05:54.889> about<00:05:55.159> in<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.550> Quran

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
is talking about in the Quran

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.659 
is talking about in the Quran
Jamal<00:05:57.979> bodily<00:05:58.430> says<00:06:00.039> that<00:06:01.039> there<00:06:01.279> is<00:06:01.370> a<00:06:01.400> fluid

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
Jamal bodily says that there is a fluid

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.209 
Jamal bodily says that there is a fluid
gushing<00:06:02.089> in<00:06:02.479> poured<00:06:02.810> forth<00:06:03.169> which<00:06:03.800> refers<00:06:04.189> to

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
gushing in poured forth which refers to

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:07.360 
gushing in poured forth which refers to
the<00:06:05.180> aorta<00:06:05.750> and<00:06:05.960> the<00:06:06.379> aorta<00:06:06.949> of<00:06:07.069> course

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
the aorta and the aorta of course

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.959 
the aorta and the aorta of course
supplies<00:06:08.650> the<00:06:09.650> testes<00:06:10.159> and<00:06:10.189> the<00:06:10.400> ovaries<00:06:10.819> and

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
supplies the testes and the ovaries and

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.999 
supplies the testes and the ovaries and
therefore<00:06:11.779> that<00:06:12.199> is<00:06:12.379> what<00:06:12.529> God<00:06:12.680> is<00:06:12.830> talking

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
therefore that is what God is talking

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.309 
therefore that is what God is talking
about<00:06:14.139> all<00:06:15.139> these<00:06:15.439> different<00:06:15.819> attempts<00:06:16.819> to

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
about all these different attempts to

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.510 
about all these different attempts to
defend<00:06:18.319> what<00:06:18.500> the<00:06:18.589> Quran<00:06:18.800> is<00:06:18.949> saying<00:06:19.159> really

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
defend what the Quran is saying really

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.360 
defend what the Quran is saying really

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
ignores the wording of the Quran it

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.760 
ignores the wording of the Quran it
tries<00:06:22.819> to<00:06:22.849> do<00:06:23.210> some<00:06:23.509> acrobatics<00:06:23.930> in<00:06:24.500> order<00:06:24.680> to
