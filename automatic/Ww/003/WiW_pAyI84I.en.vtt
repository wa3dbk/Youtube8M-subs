 and if I do not show up for you in this 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.460
 occasion because of the emails that I've 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.590
 been receiving and some tweets I'm going to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.930
 teach them some simple steps of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.420
 dance are only steps are very 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.760
 simple and are from a class of rhythms 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.830
 Latinos so we can build a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.960
 videoblog a week for you 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 they are catching up regardless of the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.219
 schedule in the schedule that you have 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.110
 free after work before the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.879
 school after school after 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.910
 fix children blah blah blah blah 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.300
 we have many, many, many excuses 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.039
 not to exercise sometimes by 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.440
 what not you would not do them the dance is the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.600
 better therapy and apart is also a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.640
 Exercise because burning and burns 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.710
 then let's start with these 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.520
 simple steps on this occasion the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.129
 salsa rhythm and then we started the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.340
 first step is 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.219
 forward left back right 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.200
 forward left back like this 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.500
 simple then you guys are going 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.560
 getting his rhythm to the right 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.320
 left left right as you will see 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.319
 all this is handled in times of 8 is 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.539
 say 8 after here we're going towards 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.000
 the right side and to the left is 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.270
 right left doing the same 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.729
 game of hips for eight times and 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.259
 we finished in eight after here we go 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.110
 to put a turn with the right hand 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.970
 down and left up and we do 1 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.270
 2 3 4 5 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.310
 78 we finish the return until 8 of 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.620
 there we are going to make another little step 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.520
 simple that is backwards but the 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:00.260
 double as if it were chachachÃ¡ is 1 2 3 4 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.360
 and we go back 5 6 7 8 ok we go from the 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:10.160
 beginning and so we are moving forward with 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:16.820
 to clarify is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 of elche 1 2 3 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:20.810

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.840
 back 6 7 8 up there we are already well 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 until I am already sweating imagine yourself 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.610
 this in house and all this although not what 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.820
 believe you are burning fat plus you 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.070
 it removes stress puts a little more 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.230
 happy and when you finish studying it 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.210
 do everything that all those vibes 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.150
 negative so you 're going to do 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.190
 over and over and over and as they go by 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.290
 the videoblogs are passing the time 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.830
 they are going to realize that they are dancing 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.660
 clarifies 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.060
 this videoblog is only for 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.610
 beginners because there are going to be those 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.620
 you get this super easy and there are those who 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.890
 They can not do it, I hope they were 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.960
 liked this little fragment of dance 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.540
 and we look to the next one and I hope 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.540
 that are much more advanced
