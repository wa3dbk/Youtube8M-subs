00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
I just think doesn't really seem fitting

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.470 
I just think doesn't really seem fitting
in<00:03:34.350> with<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.650> essence<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.160> Troy<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.670> think<00:03:36.390> they

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
in with the essence of Troy I think they

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.699 
in with the essence of Troy I think they
should<00:03:36.630> be<00:03:36.660> more<00:03:36.840> focused<00:03:37.019> on<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> Aegean

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
should be more focused on the Aegean

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.500 
should be more focused on the Aegean
areas<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.400> then<00:03:38.489> look<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.850> expanding<00:03:39.269> East

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
areas and then look to expanding East

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.449 
areas and then look to expanding East

I'm<00:03:43.829> not<00:03:43.859> sure<00:03:44.010> if<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.400> campaign<00:03:44.700> can<00:03:44.850> even

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
I'm not sure if the campaign can even

thing<00:04:13.079> I<00:04:13.169> did<00:04:13.350> notice<00:04:13.530> however<00:04:13.799> was<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
thing I did notice however was that the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.060 
thing I did notice however was that the
Trojan<00:04:14.850> archers<00:04:15.269> don't<00:04:15.600> carry<00:04:15.900> swords<00:04:16.229> so<00:04:16.949> in

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
Trojan archers don't carry swords so in

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.110 
Trojan archers don't carry swords so in

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
melee combat there

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.159 
melee combat there
seeing<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.359> sword<00:04:18.600> so<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.870> looks<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.139> bit

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
seeing a sword so it looks a bit

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.379 
seeing a sword so it looks a bit
ridiculous<00:04:19.799> but<00:04:20.579> honestly<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.940> didn't<00:04:21.180> notice

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
ridiculous but honestly I didn't notice

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.700 
ridiculous but honestly I didn't notice
that<00:04:21.419> until<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.810> had<00:04:21.959> conquered<00:04:22.320> all<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
that until I had conquered all of the

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.140 
that until I had conquered all of the
Aegean<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.280> started<00:04:23.639> looking<00:04:23.970> at<00:04:24.060> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
Aegean and started looking at the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.850 
Aegean and started looking at the
replays<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:25.139> it<00:04:25.199> doesn't<00:04:25.380> really<00:04:25.440> bother<00:04:25.710> me

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
replays so it doesn't really bother me

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.370 
replays so it doesn't really bother me
that<00:04:25.949> much<00:04:26.720> lastly<00:04:27.720> we<00:04:27.870> have<00:04:28.020> some<00:04:28.169> really

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
that much lastly we have some really

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
disappointing was that the Trojans don't

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.260 
disappointing was that the Trojans don't
really<00:04:44.190> look<00:04:44.340> anything<00:04:44.610> like<00:04:44.760> they<00:04:45.000> did<00:04:45.150> in

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
really look anything like they did in

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.689
