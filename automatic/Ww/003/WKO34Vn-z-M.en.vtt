around you operate no it actually

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.499 
around you operate no it actually
doesn't<00:00:14.309> shock<00:00:14.549> they'll<00:00:14.849> be<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> first<00:00:15.269> acts

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
doesn't shock they'll be the first acts

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.670 
doesn't shock they'll be the first acts
I'm<00:00:15.750> sure<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.080> they<00:00:16.170> probably<00:00:16.440> get

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
I'm sure that they probably get

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.560 
I'm sure that they probably get
overlooked<00:00:17.130> all<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> time<00:00:17.640> there<00:00:18.390> are

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
overlooked all the time there are

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.359 
overlooked all the time there are
sitting<00:00:18.960> off<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.289> side<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.890> i<00:00:19.949> guess<00:00:20.160> no

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
sitting off to the side so i guess no

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.470 
sitting off to the side so i guess no
one's<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.699> paying<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.300> much

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
one's really paying on that much

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.410 
one's really paying on that much
attention<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.140> i<00:00:23.070> guess<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.090> could<00:00:24.240> say<00:00:24.390> I'm

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
attention and i guess you could say I'm
