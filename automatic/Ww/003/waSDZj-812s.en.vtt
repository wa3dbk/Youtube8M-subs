00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.370
 There is none 

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:10.750
 There is water in the water near the frog, so this is that 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:14.350
 I can see the process right now so I can do amazing things 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.280
 If there is a little roof there will be a wind that does n't get wet underneath that 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.779
 heavy 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:25.210
 I will try to realize such a living world as much as possible 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:30.000
 I technology members that now is or was確中with a letter 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.000
 Ha ha ha he will give me 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:39.789
 I've been able to operate now at hand, but this is true 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 Normally it stopped raining and after a while he said that it would go up a little more slowly 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:50.430
 I'm happens I'm what now law entered has now amazing high-speed mode 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.550
 Let's see the character once again, I'm sure it's sunny and the clothes aren't getting wet anymore 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.240
 Right 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:01.480
 It might Naikamo Wakan subtly too I'm hair was also I have cute I Nee 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:05.379
 It is too thin and it doesn't reach, but it takes other characters that it takes 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:12.820
 I certainly did that kidding 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:13.149
 In the same location of the gameplay that was released in the fifth place last year in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.750
 so 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:22.330
 I fought against something that seems like a princess, but it is now more advanced than the environment at that time and now 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.130
 It is and that Luminous 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.750
 Fifteen we read in the style of ebony we used at the time of the rush 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.450
 And of the original environment integration 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:39.310
 Since the game is moving in the production environment, the development will greatly progress from now on 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.310
 I think I will go ahead 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.750
 Well, I think it's actually 8 days so please take a look at everyone 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.659
 It was ui- 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.580
 so 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.900
 It looks like a little light around here 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.900
 Rotate or trying to get a look 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.049
 here 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:18.930
 As I said earlier, it was a place where I was fighting with Behemoth at the last three days 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:19.470
 So now I can change the time at hand , but I really know in the game 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.920
 but 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.920
 24hours 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.170
 Please write more and more 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:36.360
 It switched to a darkened and is likely to have it naturally at night as it is 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 And then in the world where time will continue to flow so much when morning comes again 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.640
 Japan has become the wind that say go in progress degree as the go elapsed indeed 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.720
 Cormorants that the three had last year 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:52.790
 I'm new to the battle trailer but at that time 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.069
 As I said, I could not make it by tuning for a few days or so. 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.939
 Is the morning sun 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.660
 We went to a place so that rain water naturally in the world 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:05.230
 Well then a little battle 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:11.530
 The will want a high concentration look 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:16.030
 It's a bit scary, it 's so expensive It looks like it's like looking from above 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.490
 It's about 70 to 80 percent quality right now . 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.800
 Trial version that's delivered to the timing a little 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.800
 I think that the quality has risen 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.480
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.480
 So do let's go battle 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.120
 After all here 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.069
 If you want to fight 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.209
 It is now saying that this guy 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.209
 Heroes Masu Yes 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.230
 Pouch Chae If the bridge I cans 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.480
 The rubber of this time 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.769
 This afternoon the performer is this monster 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.100
 I laughed for a while, I guess it 's a little bit ahead 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.800
 When I go into a cave, I say the waist is pretty 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:08.060
 I have always avoided it 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:12.080
 This is this is that Well 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:17.269
 I will avoid this red game system for a while 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:21.799
 If you keep pressing the button for a long time, it will keep on coming and going 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.130
 It would have been such a system , yes Yes, only attack is pressing the attack button 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.740
 Ne 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.320
 It will freely attack 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.640
 It is an apartment but it is so easy 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.640
 Red is coming out 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:46.260
 It seems that there was a group opinion that I did not have two e 3s last year 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:51.060
 I just don't hold it I just said that a little while ago 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:56.880
 The next time I was still developing in that other temporary environment, right? 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.450
 In the environment I bought , I decided to finish the game like this by raising the degree of completion at once . 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.680
 I 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:09.540
 And something yet fully motion with the stage that you are migrating to a production environment even now that 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.139
 The boober who can not get to 100% condition will improve from now on 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.810
 Hmm 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:18.150
 Here the time will come true or the other say becoming more and more lost 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.530
 Can you beat the head or ceria? 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.530
 It There 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.820
 But I think that has been or powerful attacks and Ignis from a little while ago 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:36.030
 that 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:39.340
 This is also a special operation is a fellow in the vicinity without need that time Selle 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.270
 Joint techniques come out automatically 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.270
 is inside 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:53.370
 Also please sorry understanding partner will do little I heard not a little bit unreasonable time 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.370
 Even if I did, I remembered 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.870
 It was overcast 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.870
 Yes Yes 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.280
 Thank you very much because it was real machine play by now 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:13.480
 If you understand that it is not a pv fraud 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:18.490
 It is half an hour in a word 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:21.790
 It was a little too awkward time too short, I guess there's also that 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.500
 I want to go see this long version with square enix presents or something 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.500
 It's of course that'm not at all good
