 To be honest with the gender when this happens, 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.420
 I'm bouncing back to personality. 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:29.460
 I do not have anyone in here. 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.480
 And now, in the title of a very systematic, 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.540
 Actually, there were a lot of problems at the time. 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.729
 Looks like there's no connecting link . 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.300
 There was a lot of scams, a lot of them. 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.200

 So, on the Chinese side , we have some pure Korean stars on stage. 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.780
 I wanted to invite you. 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.860
 As if everything was connected, 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.780
 There are many people who leave , and I am sure that I will be able to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.050
 There are a lot of injuries 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.640
 In the past, we banned the entry of Korean singers in China. 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:19.590
 So the minister of culture was contacting me about the issuance of the visa .

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.489
 I just saw it on the spot. 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.670
 For a little and go back and own it 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.930
 Some things can be blessed by Devon himself 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.849
 What I'm talking about now the Moon Ik-chum styles go before me in Shanghai Provisional Government 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.549
 I'm a detailed person. 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.540

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.599
 Tell us what it is. 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:22.129
 I did not want to hang up with the Patriot branch . 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:27.859
 2 Look Have Another feature of the aid entertainers right 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:31.879
 I'll take Ing mold . I'll stop the bread . 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:38.000
 The album was originally planned now, but the role of the singer in the drama ah 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:42.049
 While the last scene of the arrival of the song Forever also listed 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.150
 The ones you use now run with the ost album 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:52.099
 So at that time , you will not be fooled to miss that chance . 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:56.569
 Frankly, it would be better to rush the album release at this time. 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.739
 Yeah I think boldly say no in order to receive the decision that makes sense 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.250
 I can not. 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.250
 For outgoing and like to have after such entry in the first week, 15 weeks consecutive perfect 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.200
 You wanted five more than you expected. 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.209
 I majored in musicals . 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:20.799
 Acting and singing . Oh yes, but at that time , 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.770
 The distinction of the singers is still small, but it is very serious. 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.400
 Oh, well, then come out and go down . 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:31.270
 So what should a singer who did Feelin 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.960
 I was preparing for my weight to the No. 1 candidate out of a sudden the song book 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:38.169
 It 's tough, and it's now strict. 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.580
 Yes, it's been a few years and Mr. Uhm Junghwa is talking to me. 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.110
 It's not like this . 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.930
 At the time of payment or after the third party, the topic goes out this week 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.790
 How did you get over Newton? 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:55.690
 I'm sorry , I'm sorry. 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:05:00.190
 So there is no way I can witch this up so I keep steady 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:04.979
 As I continue to make more albums, I continue to publish more albums 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.979
 It's the only way I can be honored some day .
