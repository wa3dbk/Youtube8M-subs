00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.259

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.960
 for intimates as you want I 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:36.219
 24 years old I started playing in Calais 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.469
 since mw2 so i started on pc 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.760
 I then left on ps3 for 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.039
 join a friend i left on xbox 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.570
 and I came back to ps3 not long ago and 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.260
 so I told you I started on 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.329
 mw2 and not that the cats 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.670
 I played in kotka after you are good you 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.090
 do not forget that I played 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.640
 a lot to the snipe at the beginning then my 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.600
 vocation to change we will say I want 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.409
 now only to the white army 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.450
 since the black accent speaking 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.710
 blackops let's go a little bit on 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.630
 the gameplay i will introduce you all 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.869
 this then i'm on the grid map 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.940
 as you could see I play I 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.250
 plays with the white army so knife 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.170
 ballistics and tomac my trumps are 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.299
 eyelid stone to pick up the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.399
 tomatoes on ammunition forgiveness 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.039
 so the tomahawks also on the enemies 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.539
 or the dead allies 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.450
 second to any pro warlord 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.580
 so to have two tomahawks and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.300
 third marathon asset to search 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.130
 a maximum then as an accessory I 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.020
 the fog that's why the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.509
 fog but just before 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.700
 back in a building I put it to 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.130
 side of the building is like that it burns 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.960
 and clement so I can more easily 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.679
 enter the building seems to do 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.170
 his hole and there are not exposed the 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.149
 mouth by a punk the dead - ghosts 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.299
 in a case like that it makes them 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.590
 stress a little bit then so I 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:14.280
 the paralyzing tactical grenade so 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.260
 for example I paralyze yes but not 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.049
 really to paralyze that actually 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.250
 lets know where are the 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.489
 responsible is your red is throws a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.890
 parade towards respect and I know if I 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.609
 know if that if people if friends have 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.440
 appeared the up 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.510
 so it allows me to know where 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.989
 are the enemies 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.349
 then as killstreaks g planes 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.760
 whole plane spies hope find 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:46.049
 to be a most discreet maximum by a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.110
 tribe stupidly on the map in 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.760
 third trump a g I know more I 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.709
 believe what I think is the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.299
 blackbird kills not sure yes because 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.069
 I had not seen the unhappy dogs 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.670
 it's too bad because I 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:03.840
 will have them unlocked and also in this 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.709
 part I was playing with the bmw k this is where 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.060
 he tomahawk 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.670
 it's a team that I created and 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.790
 registered he convince and I created 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.970
 this team with a friend of mine 'i stock 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.440
 62 I would put you the address of his 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.120
 string in the description so we have 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.489
 created this hymn but there is now a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.870
 little moment 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.780
 it must be maybe two years I 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.829
 think something like that I do not know too much 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.240
 short and so in the beginning we were just 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.190
 we told a 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.290
 a guy on on the psn who plays and who 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.910
 play only armed only 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.560
 white 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.420
 so we told him go play well with 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.810
 we suddenly come he is still there 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.420
 besides and 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.810

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.510

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.440
