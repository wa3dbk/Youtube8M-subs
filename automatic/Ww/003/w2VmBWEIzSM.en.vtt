00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
pressure around the edge like that yeah

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.429 
pressure around the edge like that yeah
and<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:53.030> like<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.179> not<00:01:54.929> quite<00:01:55.079> all<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> way

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
so that you don't damage that edge there

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.660 
so that you don't damage that edge there
and<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.439> roll<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.829> up<00:02:04.979> we

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.340 

again<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> other<00:02:18.090> side<00:02:19.730> okay<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.760> they<00:02:21.000> go

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
again on the other side okay so they go

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.080 
again on the other side okay so they go
each<00:02:22.350> time<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.890> four<00:02:23.100> little<00:02:23.310> roses<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.910> could

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
each time in four little roses you could

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.210 
each time in four little roses you could
stop<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:25.260> quite<00:02:25.440> fat<00:02:25.650> at<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.860> moment

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
stop there it's quite fat at the moment

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.410 
stop there it's quite fat at the moment
but<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.430> will<00:02:26.460> squeeze<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.480> clean<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.320> okay

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
but we will squeeze it and clean it okay

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.910 
but we will squeeze it and clean it okay
because<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.600> looks<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:31.140> intimidating<00:02:31.380> to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
because it looks really intimidating to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.600 
because it looks really intimidating to
do<00:02:32.210> doing<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.300> myself<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:33.830> really<00:02:34.830> easy<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
do doing in myself is really easy and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:45.020 
do doing in myself is really easy and
then<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.940> final<00:02:36.330> three<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:43.880> keep<00:02:44.880> them

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
then the final three you just keep them

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.760 
then the final three you just keep them
in<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.270> Tupperware<00:02:45.720> box<00:02:45.990> make<00:02:46.440> sure<00:02:46.470> that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
there's nothing damp that's going to get

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.750 
there's nothing damp that's going to get

acrylic<00:03:17.430> matte<00:03:17.760> which<00:03:18.060> stops<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.870> from

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
acrylic matte which stops it from

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.460 
acrylic matte which stops it from
sticking

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470

you're trying to cover a cage that is
big<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:55.170> would<00:03:55.350> have<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.709> kilo<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.489> half<00:03:56.519> of

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
big you would have a kilo and a half of

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.240 
big you would have a kilo and a half of
the<00:03:57.120> staff<00:03:57.360> if<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.870> had<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.080> great<00:03:58.560> big<00:03:58.950> piece

the staff if you had a great big piece

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.920 
the staff if you had a great big piece

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
if she could pace the way to check

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.150 
if she could pace the way to check
whether<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.350> color<00:04:01.560> has<00:04:01.769> gone<00:04:01.920> all<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.100> way

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
whether the color has gone all the way

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.520 
whether the color has gone all the way
to<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.519> middle<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.150> cut<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.930> half<00:04:04.170> and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
to the middle is to cut it in half and

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.670 
to the middle is to cut it in half and
you<00:04:04.560> can<00:04:04.860> see<00:04:05.370> what<00:04:05.820> it's<00:04:06.000> like<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.390> size<00:04:06.690> that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
you can see what it's like in size that

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.390 
you can see what it's like in size that
has<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:08.070> rolling<00:04:08.459> pin<00:04:08.720> yeah<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.750> think<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:10.950> yes

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
has a rolling pin yeah I think it is yes

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.280 
has a rolling pin yeah I think it is yes
because<00:04:11.580> it<00:04:11.820> won't<00:04:12.180> because<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.480> wooden<00:04:12.840> one<00:04:13.080> it

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
because it won't because a wooden one it

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.570 
because it won't because a wooden one it
with<00:04:13.440> yeah

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
with yeah

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.310 
with yeah
whereas<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.450> something<00:04:15.840> that's<00:04:15.959> great

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
whereas this is something that's great

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.060 
whereas this is something that's great
like<00:04:16.950> acrylic<00:04:17.310> stuff<00:04:18.590> normally<00:04:19.590> if<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.890> was

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
like acrylic stuff normally if I was

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.880 
like acrylic stuff normally if I was
going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.700> putting<00:04:21.320> icing<00:04:22.320> on<00:04:22.470> top<00:04:22.710> of

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
going to be putting icing on top of

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.550 
going to be putting icing on top of
cakes<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.340> would<00:04:23.520> be<00:04:23.729> fixing<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.479> down<00:04:24.750> with

cakes I would be fixing it down with
royal<00:04:25.860> icing<00:04:26.039> but<00:04:26.550> because<00:04:26.849> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
royal icing but because the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.270

Freeport shop cakes are quite sticky
anyway<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.820> think<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.449> actually<00:04:31.230> we're<00:04:31.380> going

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
anyway I think that actually we're going

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.629 
anyway I think that actually we're going
to<00:04:31.560> get<00:04:31.680> away<00:04:31.770> with<00:04:32.040> this<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:32.280> we<00:04:32.370> just<00:04:34.610> pop<00:04:35.610> one

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
to get away with this so we just pop one

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.700 
to get away with this so we just pop one
of<00:04:36.060> these<00:04:36.240> on<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.690> top<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.320> again<00:04:37.380> because

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
of these on the top and again because

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.430 
of these on the top and again because
this<00:04:37.979> icing<00:04:38.460> is<00:04:38.610> quite<00:04:38.850> sticky<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.810> think

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
this icing is quite sticky I think

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.379 
this icing is quite sticky I think
that's<00:04:40.830> actually<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.220> bit<00:04:41.490> too<00:04:41.790> big<00:04:42.060> for<00:04:42.090> this

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
that's actually a bit too big for this

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.300 
that's actually a bit too big for this
sort<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.780> cake<00:04:42.960> isn't<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.470> what<00:04:43.770> we've<00:04:43.949> got<00:04:44.130> as
