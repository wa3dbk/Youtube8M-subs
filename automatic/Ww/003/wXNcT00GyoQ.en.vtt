00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
fully maxed out Town Hall 10 yes it is a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.630 
fully maxed out Town Hall 10 yes it is a
supermax<00:02:02.509> base<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.140> I'm<00:02:03.229> coming<00:02:03.649> with<00:02:03.979> not

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
supermax base and I'm coming with not

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.710 
supermax base and I'm coming with not
five<00:02:05.000> not<00:02:05.390> six<00:02:05.990> but<00:02:06.409> seven<00:02:07.280> monstrous<00:02:08.270> golems

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
five not six but seven monstrous golems

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.359 
five not six but seven monstrous golems
moving<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.320> from<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.619> bottom<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.100> base

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
moving in from the bottom of this base

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.520 
moving in from the bottom of this base
so<00:02:10.670> really<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.480> triple<00:02:11.900> jump<00:02:12.200> or<00:02:12.470> a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
so really the triple jump or a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.560 
so really the triple jump or a
combination<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.580> some<00:02:13.760> earthquake<00:02:14.240> spells

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
combination of some earthquake spells

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.900 
combination of some earthquake spells
works<00:02:14.900> really<00:02:15.170> well<00:02:15.290> gets<00:02:16.010> rid<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.550> wall

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
works really well gets rid of the wall

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.660 
works really well gets rid of the wall
factor<00:02:17.510> opening<00:02:18.230> up<00:02:18.380> in<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.740> case<00:02:19.070> if<00:02:19.280> you

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
factor opening up in this case if you

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.670 
factor opening up in this case if you
think<00:02:19.970> about<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.300> like<00:02:20.630> eighty<00:02:21.020> percent<00:02:21.350> of

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
think about it like eighty percent of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.980 
think about it like eighty percent of
the<00:02:21.800> base<00:02:22.040> it's<00:02:22.400> no<00:02:22.850> longer<00:02:22.880> enclosed<00:02:23.750> by

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
the base it's no longer enclosed by

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.320 
the base it's no longer enclosed by
walls<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.040> makes<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.730> huge<00:02:26.000> difference

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
walls so that makes a huge difference

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.240 
walls so that makes a huge difference
for<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.780> golems<00:02:27.170> because<00:02:27.530> obviously<00:02:27.710> they

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
for the golems because obviously they

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.040 
for the golems because obviously they
are<00:02:28.370> terrible<00:02:28.879> at<00:02:29.090> getting<00:02:29.629> through<00:02:29.750> walls

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
are terrible at getting through walls

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.869 
are terrible at getting through walls
you<00:02:30.349> don't<00:02:30.560> need<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.830> use<00:02:30.980> any<00:02:31.010> space<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.670> your

them isn't really a bad thing in most
instances<00:03:29.739> here<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.939> the<00:03:31.209> attack<00:03:31.540> wraps<00:03:31.989> up

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
instances here so the attack wraps up

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.970 
instances here so the attack wraps up
just<00:03:33.159> above<00:03:33.549> sixty<00:03:34.269> percent<00:03:34.420> damage<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.439> I

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
will be up eight trophies so moving on

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
like a different layout but when you

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.629 
like a different layout but when you
really<00:03:47.620> think<00:03:47.650> about<00:03:47.949> it<00:03:48.129> it's<00:03:48.370> pretty

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
really think about it it's pretty

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.759 
really think about it it's pretty
similar<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.180> what<00:03:49.419> we<00:03:49.540> keep<00:03:49.780> seeing<00:03:50.109> again<00:03:50.470> and

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
similar to what we keep seeing again and

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.610 
similar to what we keep seeing again and
again<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:51.970> he's<00:03:52.150> moving<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.659> with<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:53.199> very

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
again and so he's moving in with a very

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.439 
again and so he's moving in with a very
similar<00:03:53.949> spell<00:03:54.370> composition<00:03:54.940> but<00:03:55.060> he<00:03:55.180> has

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
similar spell composition but he has

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.009 
similar spell composition but he has
brought<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.470> critical<00:03:57.129> freeze<00:03:57.609> spell

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
brought the critical freeze spell

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.020 
brought the critical freeze spell
everybody's<00:03:59.019> seeming<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.709> have<00:04:00.010> switched<00:04:00.489> one

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
everybody's seeming to have switched one

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.879 
everybody's seeming to have switched one
of<00:04:01.150> their<00:04:01.299> infernos<00:04:01.780> recently<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.409> single

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
of their infernos recently to single

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.920 
of their infernos recently to single
because<00:04:03.549> of<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.790> update<00:04:04.030> allowing<00:04:04.810> that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
because of the update allowing that

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.780 
because of the update allowing that
single<00:04:05.319> target<00:04:05.620> inferno<00:04:05.889> to<00:04:06.099> accelerate

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
single target inferno to accelerate

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.990 
single target inferno to accelerate
expand<00:04:07.180> much<00:04:07.359> so<00:04:07.989> much<00:04:08.019> more<00:04:08.560> quickly<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.190> so

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
expand much so much more quickly and so

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.149 
expand much so much more quickly and so
really<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.359> freeze<00:04:10.720> spell<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.019> good<00:04:11.319> idea<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.889> am

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
really a freeze spell a good idea I am

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.949 
really a freeze spell a good idea I am
certainly<00:04:12.699> thinking<00:04:13.060> about<00:04:13.299> adding<00:04:13.479> one<00:04:13.840> in

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
certainly thinking about adding one in

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.050 
certainly thinking about adding one in
the<00:04:14.019> future<00:04:14.379> so<00:04:14.889> we<00:04:15.069> will<00:04:15.220> watch<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:15.400> dunster

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
the future so we will watch it dunster

another golem and that is exactly what

you want to see in this case I think

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.440 
you want to see in this case I think
that<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.650> ideal<00:04:51.130> use<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.580> that<00:04:51.700> free<00:04:51.970> spell<00:04:52.270> is

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
that the ideal use of that free spell is

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.140 
that the ideal use of that free spell is
to<00:04:52.870> wait<00:04:53.110> until<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.770> focuses<00:04:54.340> on<00:04:54.550> one<00:04:54.850> of<00:04:54.970> your
