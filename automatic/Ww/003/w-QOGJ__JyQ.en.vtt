00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
in the game that that 90 pace is is a

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.680 
in the game that that 90 pace is is a
key<00:05:44.870> stat<00:05:45.550> it's<00:05:46.550> not<00:05:46.850> I<00:05:47.000> don't<00:05:47.240> think<00:05:47.300> there's

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
key stat it's not I don't think there's

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
key stat it's not I don't think there's
too<00:05:47.960> many<00:05:49.840> strikers<00:05:50.840> fast<00:05:51.110> of<00:05:51.320> them<00:05:51.470> in<00:05:51.620> the
