00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.780
 and so our games have started 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.600
 relay we see hostile and sinister 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.730
 also towards the recovery of the ball 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.580
 parity it gave correctly reported 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.980
 Apart from the s as an example in the recovery 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.930
 fast for the different group is the group 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.240
 blue compared to red but be careful 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.460
 because the intent is very fast 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.130
 michele can not recover the field on 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.630
 very small instead takes part for 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.170
 last and despite the size 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.600
 on average it runs very fast and reports 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.940
 at the top station the ball 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.949
 fast fast so this fast 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.629
 relay is known if the left is on 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.640
 right slightly more favored and 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.140
 finally the interest station 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.350
 think of starting the first relay 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.510
 who saw a net dominance of the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.829
 team that not a blue box the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.500
 team closer to ours 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.039
 very fast and fast posting 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.039
 we talked first 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.180
 without that it does not exist it is neither 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.100
 neither life nor particularly great a race 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.960
 you can golden has seen it and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.670
 three-month wealth of this year's 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 this motif is passage and catherine 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.660
 very much in size 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.880
 small compared to previous years 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.770
 despite these they were so much that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.770
 a great and graceful test 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.170
 you are still preparing us 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.140
 we remain silent to be able to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.030
 allow concentration a little 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.280
 all those in the center 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.990
 of our honor rings that soon 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.330
 we're going to bet again what 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.330
 will happen in the heart of the honor ring 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.180
 put it before the start everyone had to 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:09.330
 be ready and looks personal to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.160
 center that ascertains the situation 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.480
 then check that the groups enter 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.820
 they are ready to stand out alone 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.950
 In the affirmative, we then proceed to 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.950
 he sings and from the official bio 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.909
 then the second relay of the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.379
 transfer also in this case with now 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.150
 don't let yourself win sooner or later 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.040
 they reject the left but also immediately 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.010
 speed recovered also i 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.909
 seconds to examine the exact recovery for 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.390
 both teams back is the third 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.870
 and then starting misseri does not face 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.629
 up close, just complaining 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.849
 very fast indeed even a smile 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.060
 a little bit of history this speed 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.549
 little boy who goes concludes wins lead 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.950
 the victory is back in the case of the 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:28.900
 own big team maybe for them 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.139
 now we're going to find out together 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.239
 how many do you know we're going to taste for ourselves from 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.239
 them to follow because technically 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.519
 We are actually the last legs 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.810
 because on average we go to hear the 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.430
 voice of one of the protagonists of the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:02.319
 fourth evening no who says this win 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.230
 everything is fine as at the oratory 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.970
 this is the good thing to say here 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.120
 that canvas jute up to this moment 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.310
 they were a little rehearsal sir and 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.160
 gentlemen, be careful with me 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.769
 this is the beauty as they say 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.229
 of the other great sports disciplines 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.380
 preparation lacks very little to 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:28.090
 away we see that they are already positions 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.460
 who then will follow to send them 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.130
 official then the beginning of this how 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.680
 therefore catan can at this moment 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.650
 the official route is recovered 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.289
 that moment the ball brought and 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.539
 absolutely good way back 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.539
 the teams glazed these difficulties 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.650
 then carried out an internship are his 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:55.230
 evidence on the right beard a lost on 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.170
 third dog will leave with a little delay 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.660
 then of the little one he will look for 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.290
 to close to recover some in league 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.210
 the delay but despite the ride 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.670
 from china it seems not to make it and to have 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.140
 seized was I must say that ours 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.670
 red team then the team a 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.370
 left had the better the previous one 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.140
 he reads that blue in short, that he is looking 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.150
 August certainly the important thing is the 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.520
 great fun and this combination 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.590
 this love that is denoted that is seen 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.140
 also in this discipline precisely the 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.520
 flyball with which we will go to 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.700
 tell other emotions than others 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.250
 stories in a little bit now let's return a 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.170
 step back and talk one more 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.900
 dog dance time 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.840
 thanks so the sentence to our friends 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.960
 of flai bubbles thanks therefore to the echo 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.730
 at the iron crown dog group 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.200
 monzese to all the fantastic dogs 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.720
 the other sectors that have this 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.670
 colored this ring to pain 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.090
 now space to music from the pre tournament 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.090
 toto
