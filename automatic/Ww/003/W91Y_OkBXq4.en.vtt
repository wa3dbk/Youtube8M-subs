00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.540 
because our leading receivers only have
11<00:05:25.400> catches<00:05:25.610> each<00:05:26.440> most<00:05:27.440> teams<00:05:27.770> have<00:05:28.040> at<00:05:28.280> least

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
11 catches each most teams have at least

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.160 
11 catches each most teams have at least
two<00:05:28.880> players<00:05:29.150> higher<00:05:29.420> than<00:05:29.660> that<00:05:29.780> it<00:05:29.930> seems

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
two players higher than that it seems

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.200 
two players higher than that it seems
like<00:05:30.380> so<00:05:31.100> hopefully<00:05:31.460> we<00:05:31.610> can<00:05:31.730> improve<00:05:31.970> that<00:05:32.060> a

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
like so hopefully we can improve that a

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.910 
like so hopefully we can improve that a
little<00:05:32.450> bit<00:05:32.540> I<00:05:32.600> think<00:05:32.690> we<00:05:32.990> did<00:05:33.230> that<00:05:33.290> last<00:05:33.470> game

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
little bit I think we did that last game

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.890 
little bit I think we did that last game
the<00:05:34.100> first<00:05:34.280> game<00:05:34.550> really<00:05:34.760> kind<00:05:35.030> of<00:05:35.120> took<00:05:35.390> a<00:05:35.450> hit

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
the first game really kind of took a hit

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.410

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
10 doing a great job so far this season

for<00:06:17.780> him<00:06:18.020> kick<00:06:18.950> returns<00:06:19.400> it<00:06:19.640> does<00:06:19.820> not<00:06:19.970> look

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
for him kick returns it does not look

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.880 
for him kick returns it does not look
like<00:06:20.240> anybody<00:06:20.810> has<00:06:20.960> a<00:06:20.990> kick<00:06:21.320> return<00:06:21.590> for<00:06:21.860> a

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
like anybody has a kick return for a

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.260 
like anybody has a kick return for a
touchdown<00:06:22.190> yet<00:06:22.640> they<00:06:22.760> would<00:06:22.910> definitely

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
touchdown yet they would definitely

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.580 
touchdown yet they would definitely
appear<00:06:23.540> high<00:06:23.750> up<00:06:23.960> because<00:06:24.230> of<00:06:24.350> the<00:06:24.440> average

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
appear high up because of the average

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.580 
appear high up because of the average
and<00:06:25.010> stuff<00:06:25.160> like<00:06:25.280> that<00:06:25.570> so<00:06:26.570> i<00:06:26.900> think<00:06:27.020> i'll

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
and stuff like that so i think i'll

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.070 
and stuff like that so i think i'll
double<00:06:27.920> check<00:06:27.950> but<00:06:28.520> because<00:06:29.450> i<00:06:29.630> guess<00:06:29.810> if<00:06:29.930> it's

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
double check but because i guess if it's

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.530 
double check but because i guess if it's
going<00:06:30.230> by<00:06:30.380> kick<00:06:30.590> returns<00:06:31.010> and<00:06:31.310> not<00:06:31.460> yards<00:06:32.000> all

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
going by kick returns and not yards all

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.530 
going by kick returns and not yards all
right<00:06:32.690> yeah<00:06:32.930> nothing<00:06:33.410> there<00:06:33.560> yet<00:06:33.590> so<00:06:33.950> far

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
right yeah nothing there yet so far

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.600 
right yeah nothing there yet so far
