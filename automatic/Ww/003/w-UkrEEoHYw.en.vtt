00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.199 
and fell in love immediately there's a
couple<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.400> reasons<00:02:47.520> why<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.820> think<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.150> is

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
couple of reasons why I think this is

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.360 
couple of reasons why I think this is
the<00:02:48.450> best<00:02:48.570> brow<00:02:48.840> product<00:02:49.320> ever<00:02:49.500> first<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.280> all

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
it has a really really thin tip so you

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.490 
it has a really really thin tip so you
never<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.120> sharpen<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.870> twists<00:02:55.320> out

never have to sharpen it it twists out

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.440 
never have to sharpen it it twists out
and<00:02:55.890> because<00:02:56.160> it's<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.459> small<00:02:56.489> it's<00:02:57.090> easy<00:02:57.269> to
