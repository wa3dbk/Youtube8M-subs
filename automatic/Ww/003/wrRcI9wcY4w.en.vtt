00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
basically like the under 25th

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.490 
basically like the under 25th
anniversary<00:01:22.590> except<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.080> X<00:01:25.290> with

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
anniversary except I this is the X with

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.760 
anniversary except I this is the X with
that<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.070> they<00:01:26.990> were<00:01:27.990> meant<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:28.650> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
that I think they were meant to use this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.219 
that I think they were meant to use this
one<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.070> 100<00:01:29.430> 25th<00:01:29.790> anniversary<00:01:30.240> decks<00:01:30.479> but

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
one for 100 25th anniversary decks but

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.090 
one for 100 25th anniversary decks but
they<00:01:31.350> ended<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.619> using<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.390> fan<00:01:33.390> back<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.979> my

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
they ended up using the fan back to my

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.520 
they ended up using the fan back to my
understanding<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.729> very<00:01:36.479> very<00:01:36.750> similar<00:01:36.990> but

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
understanding it's very very similar but

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.300 
understanding it's very very similar but
it's<00:01:37.770> different<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> top<00:01:40.040> there<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.159> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
it's different it on the top there is a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
it's different it on the top there is a
seal<00:01:42.380> standard<00:01:43.380> seal<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:43.770> flap<00:01:44.689> trademark

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
seal standard seal then flap trademark

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.899 
seal standard seal then flap trademark
stuff<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.100> whole<00:01:47.280> box<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
stuff and you can see the whole box is

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.490 
stuff and you can see the whole box is
very<00:01:48.420> dirty<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.290> out<00:01:49.470> looking<00:01:50.220> distressed
