00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello in this eighth episode I 'm going 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.799
 present you the realization and the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.240
 mold design as well as means 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.900
 cereals that will allow 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.160
 make the laminated glue the mold is 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.850
 entirely realized in 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.560
 18mm low-end plywood for 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.470
 plot the first piece I'm improvising a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.810
 compact 5 meter 80 with a string game 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.910
 the jigsaw cutting game the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.980
 thin skin with a plane of which I 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.980
 go out excessively the blade with no 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 no planer with complex sole 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.920
 this first room own hands of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.640
 serve twice on the one hand to trace 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.040
 following ones but also of caliber for 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.170
 the switch to the top I'm going to gather 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.840
 all the pieces simply levis ans 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.850
 and I'm going to put everything on the top 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.710
 with a novel and a Gobball 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.780
 mold will undergo strong constraints at 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.489
 glue time so prefers glued 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.300
 neatly all these pieces with a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.550
 whistle here there is no problem of 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.960
 cleanliness or solid wood can so 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.519
 use the cloud hours to prevent 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.060
 the sliding of parts by 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.060
 compared to others 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.859
 Once 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.420
 seck I realize at the jigsaw of 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:21.920
 cuts that will allow you to slide 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.920
 the different press 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.969
 it's now time for assembly 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.469
 of all one precaution he 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.490
 must be decker otherwise mapou 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.490
 find to be all shine 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.330
 now find different ideas 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.310
 for the clamping means I have to my 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.140
 provision a good thirty greenhouse 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.750
 joint is quite insufficient 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.640
 so I'm going to prepare some sort of 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.680
 parallel press with woods that I 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.950
 disengaged or that I gauchy to the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.880
 jointer by inserting at the level of the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.110
 heel a small veneer 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.600
 expects this piece has a double 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.640
 advantage on the one hand with this form there 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.670
 she will first press at the center so 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.080
 evacuate the glue then when she goes 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.090
 deform under duress 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.070
 I will maintain a clamping pressure 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.030
 homogeneously distributed over all 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.030
 the width of the beam 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.020
 I have two block nuts are mixed 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.820
 threaded this will allow me not to 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.220
 tighten with a wrench but with the 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.690
 screwdriver have always in the idea of 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.690
 save time at the time of collage 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.690
 the hour of truth is approaching 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.690
 tomorrow I am sticking
