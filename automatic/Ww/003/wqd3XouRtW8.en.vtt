Broadwell based altra books I'm using
the<00:00:14.870> 4156<00:00:15.870> drivers<00:00:16.560> which<00:00:16.980> I'm<00:00:17.279> going<00:00:17.400> to

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the 4156 drivers which I'm going to

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.220 
the 4156 drivers which I'm going to
point<00:00:17.609> out<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.119> reasons<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.600> should<00:00:18.720> quite

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
point out for reasons that should quite

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.630 
point out for reasons that should quite
quickly<00:00:19.560> become<00:00:20.039> apparent<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:21.350> basically

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
quickly become apparent and basically

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
quickly become apparent and basically

performance and some of issues with the
title<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:35.280> bit<00:00:35.579> disappointing<00:00:36.300> in

this<00:00:36.600> recording<00:00:37.230> run<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.219> Broadwell<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.719> it's

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
this recording run on Broadwell now it's

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.380 
this recording run on Broadwell now it's
possible<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:40.980> well<00:00:41.969> quite

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
possible that this is well quite

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.080 
possible that this is well quite
probable<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.010> simply<00:00:44.460> down<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
probable that this is simply down to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.850 
probable that this is simply down to
save<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.690> Broadwell<00:00:46.170> section<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
save the Broadwell section of the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.850 
save the Broadwell section of the
drivers<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.700> perhaps<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:49.079> being<00:00:49.350> quite

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
drivers and perhaps not being quite

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.389 
drivers and perhaps not being quite
ready<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.219> GTA<00:00:50.760> 5<00:00:51.210> yet<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:53.010> will<00:00:53.190> revisit

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
ready for GTA 5 yet and I will revisit

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.619 
ready for GTA 5 yet and I will revisit
this<00:00:53.879> title<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.629> later<00:00:54.930> driver<00:00:55.379> releases<00:00:56.629> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
this title with later driver releases to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
this title with later driver releases to
see<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:57.960> these<00:00:58.170> issues<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:59.010> been<00:00:59.219> resolved

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
see if these issues have been resolved

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.889 
see if these issues have been resolved
and<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.320> first<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.859> said<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
and so first of all as I said and

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.429 
and so first of all as I said and
performance<00:01:03.899> isn't<00:01:04.049> great

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
performance isn't great

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.609 
performance isn't great
generally<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.250> actually<00:01:05.580> lower<00:01:05.820> than<00:01:06.090> HD

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
generally it's actually lower than HD

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.490 
generally it's actually lower than HD
5000<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.729> generally<00:01:09.630> expect<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> be

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
5000 and I generally expect it to be

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.920 
5000 and I generally expect it to be
higher<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:11.640> are<00:01:11.790> also<00:01:11.970> some<00:01:12.450> rendering

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
higher there are also some rendering

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
higher there are also some rendering
issues<00:01:13.049> which<00:01:13.650> we're<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.040> seeing<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.610> this

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
issues which we're not seeing in this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
issues which we're not seeing in this
initial<00:01:15.240> part<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.140> into<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> next

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
initial part but as we go into the next

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.660 
initial part but as we go into the next
phase<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:18.830> we'll<00:01:19.830> see<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.509> sky

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
phase here we'll see that with the sky

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.789 
phase here we'll see that with the sky
that<00:01:23.670> starts<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.450> drop<00:01:24.720> out<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.560> losing

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
that starts to drop out and we're losing

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.319 
that starts to drop out and we're losing
the<00:01:26.250> skybox<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.829> so<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:29.729> we've<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.180> got

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the skybox and so as we've just got

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.359 
the skybox and so as we've just got
plain<00:01:30.689> black<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.650> opposed<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> sort<00:01:32.310> of

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
plain black there as opposed to sort of

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.880 
plain black there as opposed to sort of
the<00:01:32.490> blue<00:01:32.640> sky<00:01:32.970> being<00:01:33.329> drawn<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the blue sky being drawn in and that

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.789 
the blue sky being drawn in and that
drops<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.970> did<00:01:36.659> notice<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
drops in and out I did notice that the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.980 
drops in and out I did notice that the
game<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.159> also<00:01:38.400> only<00:01:39.270> picking<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
game was also only picking up the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.210 
game was also only picking up the
maximum<00:01:40.439> video<00:01:40.650> memory<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.689> being<00:01:43.100> sort<00:01:44.100> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
maximum video memory as being sort of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.120 
maximum video memory as being sort of
one<00:01:44.399> gigabyte<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:45.119> opposed<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.689> 1.7<00:01:46.560> gigabytes

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
one gigabyte as opposed to 1.7 gigabytes

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.190 
one gigabyte as opposed to 1.7 gigabytes
as<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> typically<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> other

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
as you typically get with all the other

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
as you typically get with all the other
integrated<00:01:49.680> graphics<00:01:49.979> solutions<00:01:50.700> I've

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
integrated graphics solutions I've

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.920 
integrated graphics solutions I've
tested<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.750> game<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.380> far<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.930> it's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
tested this game with so far and it's

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.859 
tested this game with so far and it's
possible<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.399> firmware<00:01:57.149> issue

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
possible that this is a firmware issue

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.929 
possible that this is a firmware issue
