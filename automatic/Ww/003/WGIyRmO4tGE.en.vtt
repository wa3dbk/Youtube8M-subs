00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
do a chasin everywhere

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.310 
do a chasin everywhere
it's<00:01:19.370> a<00:01:19.490> little<00:01:19.730> bit<00:01:19.820> harder<00:01:20.090> hunting<00:01:20.390> because

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
it's a little bit harder hunting because

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.900 
it's a little bit harder hunting because
you<00:01:21.740> can't<00:01:21.950> really<00:01:22.070> pad<00:01:22.310> their<00:01:22.460> deer<00:01:22.640> as<00:01:22.730> much

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
you can't really pad their deer as much

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.580 
you can't really pad their deer as much
but<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:26.090> more<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.360> risk<00:01:26.540> reward<00:01:26.780> think<00:01:27.230> you

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
but it's more of a risk reward think you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.010 
but it's more of a risk reward think you
could<00:01:27.740> get<00:01:27.890> big<00:01:28.670> buckshot<00:01:29.180> that<00:01:29.390> week<00:01:30.160> forth

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
could get big buckshot that week forth

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.870 
could get big buckshot that week forth
get<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:33.200> get<00:01:33.320> still<00:01:33.650> rut<00:01:33.950> starting<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.670> close

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
get you get still rut starting to close

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.750 
get you get still rut starting to close
down<00:01:35.260> and<00:01:36.260> still<00:01:36.860> get<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.010> be<00:01:37.280> in<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.400> week<00:01:37.550> some

of the some of the DOE still chasing and
stuff<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.420> then<00:01:42.160> then<00:01:43.160> they're<00:01:43.400> starting<00:01:43.700> to

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.210 
stuff and then then they're starting to
tire<00:01:43.940> out<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.270> box<00:01:44.540> then<00:01:45.260> come<00:01:45.590> back<00:01:45.620> the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
tire out of the box then come back the

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.350 
tire out of the box then come back the
other<00:01:46.250> week<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.580> hit<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.000> baits

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
other week to hit the baits

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.300 
other week to hit the baits
then<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:47.870> get<00:01:48.020> energy<00:01:48.229> back<00:01:48.590> up<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:49.010> survive

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
then you get energy back up to survive

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.980 
then you get energy back up to survive
the<00:01:49.460> winter

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.299 

and<00:01:52.380> that's<00:01:52.560> what<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.830> can<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.460> lots<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.850> bucks
