00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
at least loose enough to let the energy

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:27.349 
at least loose enough to let the energy
flow<00:01:17.590> through<00:01:17.619> so<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.630> right<00:01:26.200> when<00:01:26.469> I<00:01:26.499> release

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359

flow through so and right when I release
right<00:01:28.359> right<00:01:28.899> after<00:01:29.259> you<00:01:29.350> play<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.619> note<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
right right after you play a note and

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.889 
right right after you play a note and
you<00:01:31.479> release<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.429> you<00:01:33.429> you<00:01:33.880> pretty<00:01:34.390> much<00:01:34.539> want

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
you release it you you pretty much want

relaxed actually I'm not really that
relaxed<00:01:52.929> when<00:01:53.079> I<00:01:53.109> plan<00:01:53.409> I'm<00:01:53.710> very<00:01:53.950> firm<00:01:54.249> here

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
relaxed when I plan I'm very firm here

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:06.530 
relaxed when I plan I'm very firm here
in<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.639> fingers

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.480 

okay<00:02:07.540> let's<00:02:07.750> get<00:02:07.870> started<00:02:08.160> we're<00:02:09.160> going<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.399> go

okay let's get started we're going to go

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.340 
okay let's get started we're going to go
through<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.910> left<00:02:10.119> hand<00:02:10.390> at<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.960> slow<00:02:11.320> tempo

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
through the left hand at a slow tempo

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.110 
through the left hand at a slow tempo
and<00:02:11.920> I'm<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.460> to<00:02:12.490> point<00:02:12.730> some<00:02:13.090> things

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and I'm just going to point some things

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.730 
and I'm just going to point some things
out<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.050> let's<00:02:14.290> start<00:02:14.650> here<00:02:15.210> let's<00:02:16.500> take<00:02:17.500> the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
out so let's start here let's take the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.449 
out so let's start here let's take the
metronome<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:19.170> find<00:02:20.170> sixty-three<00:02:23.010> dum<00:02:24.010> bum

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
metronome and find sixty-three dum bum

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.400 
metronome and find sixty-three dum bum
bum<00:02:25.420> bum<00:02:25.900> delbr

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
bum bum delbr

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.670 
bum bum delbr
kind<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.860> tempo<00:02:27.190> here<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.030> think<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.990> optimal

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
kind of tempo here I think the optimal

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.000 
kind of tempo here I think the optimal
tempo<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.880> Mabley<00:02:31.240> rag<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.690> 96<00:02:32.320> beats<00:02:32.770> per

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
tempo and Mabley rag is 96 beats per

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.120 
tempo and Mabley rag is 96 beats per
minute<00:02:33.280> we'll<00:02:34.090> slow<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.540> down<00:02:35.130> considerably

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
minute we'll slow it down considerably

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.729 
minute we'll slow it down considerably
to<00:02:36.580> at<00:02:36.700> 63<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:42.000> here<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.720> can<00:02:43.900> play<00:02:44.050> two<00:02:44.110> four

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
to at 63 so here you can play two four

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.960 
to at 63 so here you can play two four
or<00:02:45.370> even<00:02:45.400> play<00:02:46.000> three<00:02:46.239> five<00:02:46.450> or<00:02:50.970> doesn't

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
or even play three five or doesn't

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.940 
or even play three five or doesn't
matter<00:02:52.150> which<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.690> whichever<00:02:53.680> feels

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
matter which one whichever feels

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.199 
matter which one whichever feels
comfortable<00:02:54.370> actually<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.760> should<00:02:55.000> be<00:02:55.120> able

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
comfortable actually you should be able

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:08.460 
comfortable actually you should be able
to<00:02:55.330> do<00:02:55.480> both

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
give this F flat I play five and then I

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.320 
give this F flat I play five and then I
sort<00:03:17.110> of<00:03:17.170> connect<00:03:17.620> this<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:18.040> four<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:22.060> then

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
sort of connect this to four and then

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.580 
sort of connect this to four and then
come<00:03:22.570> off<00:03:22.750> like<00:03:22.990> that<00:03:23.050> and<00:03:23.470> then<00:03:24.720> short<00:03:25.720> short

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
come off like that and then short short

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.920 
come off like that and then short short
short<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:27.730> use<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.970> second<00:03:28.360> finger<00:03:28.630> on<00:03:28.660> those

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
short I use the second finger on those

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:37.650 
short I use the second finger on those
very<00:03:29.770> short<00:03:34.890> here<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.160> can<00:03:36.340> use<00:03:36.520> either<00:03:36.760> 5<00:03:37.300> to

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
very short here you can use either 5 to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:56.970 
very short here you can use either 5 to
1<00:03:37.960> or<00:03:38.920> 4<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.550> 1<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.840> that's<00:03:56.020> repeated<00:03:56.620> let's<00:03:56.830> go

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
1 or 4 to 1 and that's repeated let's go

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:09.630 
1 or 4 to 1 and that's repeated let's go
on<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.280> B<00:03:57.460> section<00:03:57.990> b<00:03:58.990> section<00:03:59.550> I<00:04:08.640> would

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
on to the B section b section I would

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.780 
on to the B section b section I would
bring<00:04:09.850> these<00:04:10.060> out<00:04:10.210> a<00:04:10.270> little<00:04:11.400> bring<00:04:12.400> those<00:04:12.580> out

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
bring these out a little bring those out

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:37.540 
bring these out a little bring those out
a<00:04:12.850> little<00:04:13.239> bit<00:04:13.480> more<00:04:13.690> than<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:13.989> other<00:04:14.140> octaves

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:49.130 

these<00:04:38.550> two<00:04:40.910> remark<00:04:41.910> on<00:04:42.060> homestyle<00:04:43.640> I<00:04:48.140> would

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
these two remark on homestyle I would

00:04:49.140 --> 00:05:01.250 
these two remark on homestyle I would
use<00:04:49.260> five<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.800> one<00:04:50.010> here<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:59.220> repeat<00:04:59.670> and<00:05:00.260> the

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
use five to one here and repeat and the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.400 
use five to one here and repeat and the
a<00:05:01.290> section<00:05:02.130> is<00:05:03.000> repeated<00:05:03.330> we<00:05:03.990> don't<00:05:04.140> need<00:05:04.260> to

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
a section is repeated we don't need to

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.510 
a section is repeated we don't need to
go<00:05:04.500> over<00:05:04.620> that<00:05:04.680> again<00:05:04.800> let's<00:05:05.190> go<00:05:05.310> over<00:05:05.430> the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
go over that again let's go over the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.970 
go over that again let's go over the
hard<00:05:05.700> part<00:05:06.000> this<00:05:06.630> is<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.930> c-section

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
hard part this is the c-section

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.640 
hard part this is the c-section
which<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.460> most<00:05:08.610> difficult<00:05:09.230> try<00:05:10.230> this<00:05:10.290> one

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
which is the most difficult try this one

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.910 
which is the most difficult try this one
here<00:05:11.060> we<00:05:12.060> change<00:05:12.330> keys<00:05:12.690> now<00:05:12.960> we<00:05:13.020> have<00:05:13.260> five

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
here we change keys now we have five

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:21.260 
here we change keys now we have five
flats<00:05:14.310> do<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.150> little<00:05:15.450> slower<00:05:15.660> on<00:05:18.890> this<00:05:19.890> I<00:05:20.310> use

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
flats do a little slower on this I use

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:47.410 
flats do a little slower on this I use
four<00:05:21.750> two<00:05:21.990> one

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:54.850 

or<00:05:47.510> two<00:05:47.720> one<00:05:47.930> here<00:05:52.600> you<00:05:53.600> can<00:05:53.630> either<00:05:53.900> use<00:05:54.230> 4<00:05:54.590> 2<00:05:54.830> 1

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
or two one here you can either use 4 2 1

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.470 
or two one here you can either use 4 2 1
here<00:05:55.430> or<00:05:55.670> 5<00:05:55.940> 2<00:05:56.210> 1

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
here or 5 2 1

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:10.900 
here or 5 2 1
either<00:05:56.960> way<00:06:08.770> this<00:06:09.770> is<00:06:09.830> the<00:06:10.040> hardest<00:06:10.340> part<00:06:10.460> so<00:06:10.850> I

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
either way this is the hardest part so I

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.730 
either way this is the hardest part so I
would<00:06:11.060> suggest<00:06:11.210> practicing<00:06:11.600> this<00:06:12.110> more<00:06:12.470> you

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
would suggest practicing this more you

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.600 
would suggest practicing this more you
want<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.460> feeling<00:06:14.440> like<00:06:15.440> it's<00:06:16.190> sort<00:06:16.460> of<00:06:16.490> like

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
want the feeling like it's sort of like

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.770 
want the feeling like it's sort of like
a<00:06:16.670> rainbow<00:06:17.320> think<00:06:18.320> of<00:06:18.470> moving<00:06:18.710> moving<00:06:19.700> in<00:06:19.940> a

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
a rainbow think of moving moving in a

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:30.270 
a rainbow think of moving moving in a
rainbow<00:06:21.130> fashion<00:06:22.130> like<00:06:22.430> this<00:06:22.730> slow<00:06:23.510> motion

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.770 

you<00:06:31.280> want<00:06:31.460> to<00:06:31.550> just<00:06:31.670> levitate<00:06:32.510> in<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:32.990> air

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
you want to just levitate in the air

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:41.200 
you want to just levitate in the air
that's<00:06:35.780> the<00:06:35.990> biggest<00:06:36.260> jump<00:06:36.680> of<00:06:36.800> all<00:06:40.060> with<00:06:41.060> that

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
that's the biggest jump of all with that

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.940 
that's the biggest jump of all with that
rainbow<00:06:41.480> movement<00:06:42.200> let's<00:06:42.380> go<00:06:42.500> to<00:06:42.590> the<00:06:42.680> fourth

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
rainbow movement let's go to the fourth

00:06:42.950 --> 00:07:19.870 
rainbow movement let's go to the fourth
section<00:06:43.250> D<00:06:43.730> section<00:07:18.340> and<00:07:19.340> I'm<00:07:19.460> taking<00:07:19.790> the

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
section D section and I'm taking the

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.960 
section D section and I'm taking the
second<00:07:20.240> ending<00:07:20.540> remember<00:07:21.410> that<00:07:21.650> almost<00:07:22.430> all

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
second ending remember that almost all

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.860 
second ending remember that almost all
rags<00:07:23.480> in<00:07:24.050> fact<00:07:24.320> all<00:07:24.860> rounds<00:07:25.550> really<00:07:26.030> are<00:07:26.390> based

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:26.870 
rags in fact all rounds really are based

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.320 
rags in fact all rounds really are based
on<00:07:27.080> marches<00:07:27.590> so<00:07:28.190> it's<00:07:28.310> very<00:07:28.730> important<00:07:29.270> that

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
on marches so it's very important that

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.440 
on marches so it's very important that
you<00:07:29.540> keep<00:07:29.840> a<00:07:30.020> very<00:07:30.230> strict<00:07:30.680> beat<00:07:31.450> although

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:32.450 
you keep a very strict beat although

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.960 
you keep a very strict beat although
there<00:07:33.020> are<00:07:33.170> rags<00:07:33.470> that<00:07:33.650> I<00:07:33.800> do<00:07:33.860> take<00:07:34.160> retard<00:07:34.820> on

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.970 
there are rags that I do take retard on

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.420 
there are rags that I do take retard on
those<00:07:35.210> I<00:07:35.420> slope<00:07:35.750> slightly<00:07:36.410> down<00:07:36.590> between

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.430 
those I slope slightly down between

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.990 
those I slope slightly down between
sections<00:07:38.030> maybe<00:07:38.300> at<00:07:38.480> the<00:07:38.570> end<00:07:38.720> of<00:07:38.870> sections

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 
sections maybe at the end of sections

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.310 
sections maybe at the end of sections
you<00:07:41.000> know<00:07:41.090> I<00:07:41.120> do<00:07:41.210> that<00:07:41.450> occasionally<00:07:41.780> but

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.320 
you know I do that occasionally but

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.830 
you know I do that occasionally but
generally<00:07:42.950> speaking<00:07:42.980> you<00:07:43.820> need<00:07:43.970> to<00:07:44.180> remain

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 
generally speaking you need to remain

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.760 
generally speaking you need to remain
very<00:07:45.140> strict<00:07:45.910> with<00:07:46.910> your<00:07:47.060> tempo<00:07:47.510> and<00:07:47.810> I<00:07:48.620> would

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:48.770 
very strict with your tempo and I would

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.490 
very strict with your tempo and I would
suggest<00:07:48.950> practicing<00:07:49.700> with<00:07:50.240> a<00:07:50.270> metronome<00:07:50.500> but

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:51.500 
suggest practicing with a metronome but

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.260 
suggest practicing with a metronome but
don't<00:07:51.770> let<00:07:52.040> that<00:07:52.310> affect<00:07:53.380> your<00:07:54.380> playing<00:07:55.270> don't

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:56.270 
don't let that affect your playing don't

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.510 
don't let that affect your playing don't
don't<00:07:56.600> make<00:07:56.810> it<00:07:56.990> sound<00:07:57.410> mechanical<00:07:57.890> so<00:07:58.460> you

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.520 
don't make it sound mechanical so you

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.060 
don't make it sound mechanical so you
want<00:07:58.790> to<00:07:58.850> bring<00:07:59.090> certain<00:07:59.540> things

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.070 
want to bring certain things

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:10.890 
want to bring certain things
out<00:08:00.160> as<00:08:00.640> I<00:08:00.790> was<00:08:01.000> mentioning<00:08:01.600> to<00:08:01.930> you<00:08:03.330> like<00:08:09.900> some

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:10.900 
out as I was mentioning to you like some

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.110 
out as I was mentioning to you like some
octaves<00:08:11.380> I'd<00:08:11.560> like<00:08:12.160> to<00:08:12.310> bring<00:08:12.460> out<00:08:12.610> slightly

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 
octaves I'd like to bring out slightly

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.060
