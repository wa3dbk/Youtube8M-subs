00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 yes hello people what is going on and warm 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.660
 Welcome here for the second part of the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.150
 driven by youtube networks 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.790
 I was often contacted by the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.559
 story with tgn on whether I am there now 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.820
 came out and how I got out 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.980
 come that many have seen I am 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.199
 on the wild card de-side as 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.199
 registered partner noted 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.250
 the whole thing is correct too i am off 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.260
 tgn outside and am in white cast de 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.090
 inside as I could have done 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.230
 I now or will I become one now 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.630
 own protection also in this video 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.280
 not necessarily but the people say that 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.600
 it really interests this 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.980
 maybe she cares too 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.260
 I can have the same problem 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.960
 send a private message and then 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.090
 I'll ask you this question 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.770
 give answer so yes as I said I am 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.320
 take off now is orphaned 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.510
 I am very satisfied with it so far 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.820
 So everything actually goes so far 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.770
 you can not complain 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.140
 but that's what I'll do anyway 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.640
 have asked or what I have about what 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.250
 I talked to many people 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.990
 is seen rewarding himself over aust and 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.790
 actually tells for me and yes 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.770
 in principle, if you do that now 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.930
 generalized is the answer if 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.270
 you have a microsoft channel and only 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.550
 minecraft for example makes videos and 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.050
 who actually makes it is not worth it 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.270
 if you already have enough 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.979
 have contacts to other youtube on if 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.050
 you do not need legal protection because 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.790
 you know what you know on your channel 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.150
 plans and also no licenses 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.460
 Everyday games or music needed 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.850
 then it is not really worth it 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.369
 yes, because without network you do not deserve 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.990
 more and more money but often more money because 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.850
 There you do not have to pay the money 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.890
 Sharing the network I say 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.650
 and just deserves it in a sense 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.570
 full amount with the deductions already 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.479
 Google then gets it effectively 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.070
 So out I do not know how the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.450
 so that the premium advertising hats 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.470
 not seen and him via website 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.030
 can be switched 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.729
 I do not want it that way either 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.110
 exactly if you are there now 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.450
 in principle it is so with you 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.399
 adsense in a sense actually more 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.380
 for the good as my powers you need 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.600
 also no licenses at the game not around 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.519
 licenses to music and if you already 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.870
 contacts to other youtube one has it 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.940
 yes okay so why am I 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.830
 actually the time in there so me 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.670
 do not like it so much alone 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.310
 to stand 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.540
 many things that means somehow if 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.370
 one stops in no network one has 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.200
 only yourself then you are too 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.450
 the channel-stop times for whatever reasons 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.890
 also always locked deleted videos 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.280
 deleted why no idea 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.610
 strikes cashed then you stand without 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.660
 network really alone there and that is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.459
 a stupid thing is definitely one 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.720
 really stupid thing if then something 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.430
 is and you are just alone 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.050
 none of you there somehow from the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.760
 shit rausholt I say times 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.950
 or could always appeal to the essence 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.019
 That's why I'm personally at risk 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.330
 or sometimes a bit too high like that 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.709
 because there are also differences there are 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.300
 different types of networks 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.190
 partner to say yes at ibm I was him 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.450
 previously a partner received that is me 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.610
 actually had no licenses and 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.290
 Rights more of the network to play games 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.090
 I was also displaying and motorizing 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.560
 not protected from strikes that is one 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.019
 conversion of youtube was also times 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.299
 I think differently now but I am 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.040
 in wild card manages that is if 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.080
 I get strikes then I get 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.299
 no strikes but the network 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.769
 even that means the network can become 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.180
 then deal with it from one 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.160
 certain number please also something 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.510
 but does not lock the slawski anymore 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.400
 me that the strikes go directly to 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.190
 You can manage network too 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.810
 rights get yes but the network has 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.060
 Also do more about your channel 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.890
 that means it could be in the worst of all 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.660
 even upload videos yourself 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.280
 the channel does not belong anymore 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.739
 completely the youtuber but also still 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.540
 a part of the network to the principle 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.130
 if the network de nothing bad will 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.209
 the whole thing is not bad though 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.890
 you should go to one before 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.590
 transparent contract 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.510
 and on a permanent one 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.650
 contact person for something like that and 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.120
 also before with other people 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.790
 have spoken from the network 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.109
 maybe everything is in the right one 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.609
 That's why you should stop 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.950
 a bit careful but in principle 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.420
 in my opinion is the girl 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.819
 of course, is much better because 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.650
 just have an all-round protection I say 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.150
 seriously what we, of course, too 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.010
 hopefully everyone has learned through 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.440
 these two videos are not that one 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.329
 to crowd networks like for example 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.130
 tgn or should go media powerful aliens 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.900
 I advise you completely from it 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.060
 So that's absolute nonsense then 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.130
 base dear to her just one 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.300
 larger size have reached around then 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.950
 then make a real network 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.050
 to enter because what synonymous first 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.240
 Video evening has said can also 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.950
 Newest video only recommend it is 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.440
 Just making these channels like media 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.920
 force 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.510
 for example, I just know everything 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.790
 how many channels partners around them then 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.410
 watch how they evolve 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.240
 They make a big development fast 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.840
 growth and when you are so fast 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.250
 to grow 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.720
 or if they then grew fast 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.280
 Then we take the right view 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.260
 in that indicates that is that 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.520
 traction control network so the are 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.720
 Already two years with us if you 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.860
 the two years, what reached and then 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.290
 let's just take it in that's it 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.970
 really but then in the end effectively one 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.630
 handful and that's why you have to completely 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.310
 be really great thing that concerns really 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.680
 You can guess networks by now 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.420
 not even every network here and there 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.700
 I 'll tell you his quirks 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.770
 At the moment I am still quite my time 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.860
 Satisfied and I hope that stays that way 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.450
 first of all then thank me in this 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.100
 Sincerely think that you have the video 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.810
 and whether I am his or her 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.810
 networks are evil take care of you
