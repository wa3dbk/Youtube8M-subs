00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
Marseilles too hot because I do use the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.610

I<00:00:36.620> do<00:00:36.859> wrap<00:00:37.429> them<00:00:37.699> up<00:00:37.910> in<00:00:38.269> a<00:00:38.539> towel<00:00:38.929> so<00:00:39.769> go<00:00:39.949> ahead

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
I do wrap them up in a towel so go ahead

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.450 
I do wrap them up in a towel so go ahead
and<00:00:40.370> get<00:00:40.550> them<00:00:41.199> to<00:00:42.199> cool<00:00:42.469> down<00:00:42.739> just<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.190> little

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
and get them to cool down just a little

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.880 
and get them to cool down just a little
bit<00:00:43.609> so<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.570> towel<00:00:44.839> kind<00:00:45.109> of<00:00:45.260> helps<00:00:45.589> it<00:00:45.710> to

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
bit so the towel kind of helps it to

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.590 
bit so the towel kind of helps it to
tone<00:00:46.129> down<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:46.640> heat<00:00:46.850> on<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.269> don't<00:00:47.449> want

tone down the heat on it you don't want

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.410

to<00:00:47.659> burn<00:00:47.870> your<00:00:48.019> hair<00:00:48.399> so<00:00:49.399> that's<00:00:50.059> what<00:00:50.179> I<00:00:50.210> was

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420

doing just a standard curl with the
Marseilles<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.350> would<00:00:57.559> hold<00:00:57.769> it

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
Marseilles and you would hold it

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.680 
Marseilles and you would hold it

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
another standard curl but you would do

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.660 
another standard curl but you would do
it<00:02:35.300> like<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.930> would<00:02:36.050> be<00:02:36.260> doing<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.890> wand<00:02:37.220> curl

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
it like you would be doing a wand curl

and that is how it looks it looks like

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.710 
and that is how it looks it looks like
it's<00:04:21.350> all<00:04:21.859> intact<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.759> when<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.060> comb<00:04:23.419> it<00:04:23.600> out

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
it's all intact and when you comb it out

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.950 
it's all intact and when you comb it out
is<00:04:24.080> gonna<00:04:24.320> give<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.830> pretty<00:04:25.479> one

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
is gonna give a pretty one

wave as if you use your wand curlers so

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.430 
wave as if you use your wand curlers so
you<00:04:31.190> can<00:04:31.400> tell<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.729> difference<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.440> you

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
you can tell the difference in you

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.200 
you can tell the difference in you
