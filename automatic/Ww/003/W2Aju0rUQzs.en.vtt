00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 we are seeing the times more than 30 years ago possibly 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.470
 it is a crisis similar to the Great Depression 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.460
 so 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.630
 this is a moment 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.960
 nike 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.500
 in Spain 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.060
 our fundamental challenge is to expand abroad the mercat this dye vior 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.640
 pretty flat for the next possibly 7 10 years 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.360
 then any company that wants to survive 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.270
 kinect and become 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.710
 in a multinational 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.470
 a small multinational pocket like me and multinationals 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.620
 all of them how many big companies that advertise the old monopolies 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.650
 who have achieved it as a telephone as repsol 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.120
 and behind them we have to focus 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.050
 these next few years and who this writes 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.720
 of the transformation of the economy 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.800
 Spanish in absolutely international competitive 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.950
 as far 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.460
 that we achieve it by showing crisis 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.710
 because the current managers the just economy current government is not 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.880
 doing things right 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.170
 but simple we have a publication 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.890
 piqué although it is not also outside exit and to obtain it and it is that those 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.799
 challenges next years but the most affected are those of construction 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.430
 because they had because they had an excess production in the past 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.380
 ten years the madness 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 since it was crazy 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.090
 the textile one more we did not know how all maybe martin 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.700
 of course macphail the feed for example is the cyclical in 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.069
 moments that the bad only suffers because we have to eat continue with the process 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.719
 in the textile you can do without we look well without any doubt that I found 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.560
 my first husband so maybe I suffer more chance more clear feeding 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.410
 but like many other many others such as leisure and as 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.319
 we're suffering 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.719
 but a flight of films from a crisis we live a problem rather company 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.719
 an opportunity unfortunately 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.439
 from this group are five or ten years 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.010
 let's say the crisis feels an international cuisine that they study that 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.869
 it was things 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.829
 the Spanish one that is even harder because we have done 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.729
 everything possible so that out of china we have become indebted we are the second 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:56.769
 most indebted country in the world above below Japan but capcom 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:57.579
 it's something else 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.959
 impotent the pole 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.589
 impotence to export for machinery to high-tech objects 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.589
 in this we do not have then we 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.999
 Maybe we are 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.319
 one of the most affected countries in the world perhaps the most 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.519
 then efe 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.510
 that we have borrowed too much and the next ten years we have to 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.769
 return the debts 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.130
 the debts that we have 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.600
 what does that mean the earliest growth we've eaten the debut 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.480
 of the money of the bills of the next ten years or that the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.120
 next ten years it will be very hard to make it change if we do not do what 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.329
 we have to do 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.459
 We will make failures we have attended payments with Argentine visa a few years ago 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.779
 and how did Spain in its history several times 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.909
 I think we will not reach that point happily we belong to the euro zone 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.249
 the wedge c chronic european until forcing to do what we did not want 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.530
 do for our 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.809
 own will 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:56.629
 but I think the things I love have German governments if we 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.629
 we are able to govern 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.019
 the company today can not no longer be sustainable, it has to have a 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.300
 sustainable behavior that means that 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.879
 because it has to produce in a sustainable way 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.820
 has to distribute in a sustainable way and it has to strengthen all 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.129
 its structures a sustainable way and puppets and sustainable 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.629
 that attaches the least possible to the environment and why 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.969
 because 150 years ago we were a billion people on the planet 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.999
 and today only 7 thousand we cover toto 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:34.849
 I actually today that the human being that form with a cancer in a metastasis 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:36.530
 of the biosphere 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.789
 and he has to control 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.580
 his behavior and in addition to being human has developed a technology 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.629
 tremendous 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.990
 that can attack death to nature 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.610
 we have to have a behavior 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.520
 assoluta mind susceptible let's say we have to reissue ethical standards 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.749
 that were once only with humans 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.110
 now it has to encompass the biosphere 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.249
 miyagi in the biosphere are the vegetables and the animals sos at the head 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:08.369
 crist all the tricks kast behavior now was relentless with the 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:09.170
 nature 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.000
 It has to change because we are children of the earth 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.319
 and we are not his beaches wears suit that I bring 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.430
 is a cotton blend telcel that ticket the profile that is punished more 

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:22.839
 sustainable because sustainable because it's from cellulose 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.629
 and cellulose before being 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:28.120
 this garment that he wore 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.820
 It has been a tree that is going through fifteen or twenty or twenty-five years 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.500
 absorbing others and after forming the cellulose and that dangerous was transformed 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.120
 in this fiber of what is a hundred what has already arrived and is that the city took 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.620
 eco-friendly cotton 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.380
 now the problem of the logical economic is that the ecological fertilizer soles in 1 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.839
 percent of production consumption 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:54.519
 world is cotton sanchez anecdote the rest of the cotton that 99% 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.409
 consumes 30 percent 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.419
 the insecticides that cataño are used the planet for that reason I prefer linen that 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.610
 lake the anthem as its cultivation of cold climates needs many less 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.580
 insecticides 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.930
 and that's why it's so much more sustainable then 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.620
 as support to make sustainable post choose subjects 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.400
 and add - little olazábal pop the environment 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.230
 the least aggressive in cancer 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.259
 everything that comes from cellulose 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.259
 strict the least has grown the most aggressive 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:28.759
 animal derivatives for example when they will do very aggressive acts where there 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.490
 parts where there are herds 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.199
 Maya 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.809
 and the trees and we need them absolutely in need but Peru 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:39.540
 peremptory to transform ciolos in 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.729
 in cellulose 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.550
 and for example to avoid to the maximum 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.330
 natural skins 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.080
 simply because the animals emit a lot of methane which is even much worse the 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.490
 c2 this is why I took advantage 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.599
 I promote the luso deco dd it has synthetic constantly
