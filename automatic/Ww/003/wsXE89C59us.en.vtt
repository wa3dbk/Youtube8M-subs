 I managed to achieve with these videos and 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.829
 not visualization much mouth did not grow 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.870

 very fucking group that got here at home 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.740
 I remember that a month and a half ago 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.150
 more or less in the bgs season when 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.770
 was going on bgs 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.810
 I brought a video that the talking channel 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.090
 about the book that tells the story of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.070
 gta but it's a game story to 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.510
 story behind the game you remember 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.860
 because that's the end of that video because I 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.420
 I find it advertises relevant 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.670
 I found it interesting to bring these 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.260
 blogs like tell you and you 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.020
 They like hell is to have a feedback 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.180
 very good the situation very nice and looks 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.790
 how cool, what happened now the staff 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.030
 of the art site when I read the book 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.740
 Look what the fuck they saw the video. 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.400
 They enjoyed and sent me a video to 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.299
 book the video is lombok w already open as 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.460
 and you can imagine is here and it looks 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.680
 wonder was fuck 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.060
 the pitch is that the writer 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.810
 great outlaw 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.580
 of human origin which is gta fuck 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.409
 Fuck, really, guys. 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.389
 as I told you that I do not video 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.969
 I'm that guy who's reading that guy. 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.890
 They take the books that were super 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.930
 knowledgeable 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.550
 writing type I am a person like 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.530
 conventional but I think a lot 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.569
 important to read is to improve the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.650
 vocabulary to improve writing law 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.510
 it's very important 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.890
 As I said, there are always those books. 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.020
 that the school recommends I always hated 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.090
 That's because the book I wanted never 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.310
 read when I was municipal school 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.560
 there was the book you went to the library 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.990
 I wanted to read and then do the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.130
 your proof your matter about but to force 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.920
 we read things we do not 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.080
 It gets boring so reading is not 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.300
 boring boring is a book that you do not 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.340
 want to read then find the legal book 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.989
 Nice thing you want to read, you'll have it. 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.790
 very easy to devour the book 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.380
 Why are you entertaining just wanting? 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.880
 to seek more knowledge about it is 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.860
 Good to study, I never had much study 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.330
 when I was there in high school but 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.709
 now how to have a channel I have to 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.970
 study the subject I'm going to bring to 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.100
 Are you willing or not studying? 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.380
 every moment every day search the script 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.610
 researching this to study only that I 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.019
 I like what I'm doing because I 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.450
 interested in the game wants to 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.250
 search kara then read and study is 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.280
