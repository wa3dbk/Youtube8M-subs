kind of high to get up here bit of a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:16.130 
kind of high to get up here bit of a
struggle<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:04.280> think<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.640> neutral

which I know is just placed there lots

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.590 
which I know is just placed there lots
of<00:01:24.070> legroom<00:01:24.399> but<00:01:24.549> it's<00:01:24.700> going<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:24.939> be<00:01:25.119> awful

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600

of engine this thing has an e brake is
on<00:02:03.770> let's<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.829> if<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.070> take<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.220> look<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
on let's see if I can take a look at the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:41.789 
on let's see if I can take a look at the
engine

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.229 

we're<00:02:42.799> good<00:02:43.040> at<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> Ford<00:02:44.030> engine

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.850 

the<00:02:51.480> port<00:02:51.750> engine<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.350> know<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.650> could<00:02:52.830> be

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
the port engine I don't know it could be

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.809 
the port engine I don't know it could be
the<00:02:53.040> 302<00:02:53.520> not<00:02:54.150> sure

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.360 

yeah<00:03:01.819> this<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.900> aah

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.240 

believe<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.459> or<00:03:08.489> not<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.209> such<00:03:09.540> an<00:03:09.690> early

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
believe it or not this is such an early

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.839 
believe it or not this is such an early
version<00:03:12.500> but<00:03:13.500> possibly<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.099> five<00:03:14.400> liters<00:03:14.730> and

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
version but possibly the five liters and

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.309 
version but possibly the five liters and
the<00:03:15.390> Explorer<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.349> we<00:03:16.470> have<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.049> just<00:03:19.080> a

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
the Explorer that we have this is just a

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.699 
the Explorer that we have this is just a
much<00:03:19.500> poorer<00:03:19.769> version<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.430> engine<00:03:20.790> of

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
much poorer version of that engine of

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:39.480 
much poorer version of that engine of
course<00:03:22.709> as<00:03:22.830> many<00:03:23.010> other<00:03:23.129> differences

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:49.160 

yeah<00:03:40.030> 302<00:03:40.540> v8<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:40.990> yeah<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.380> five-o

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:04:00.050 

attack

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.280 

it<00:04:01.060> sounds<00:04:01.360> similar<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.780> Explorer<00:04:02.170> that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
it sounds similar to the Explorer that

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:24.350 
it sounds similar to the Explorer that
we<00:04:02.410> have

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.920 

I<00:04:26.240> don't<00:04:27.240> want<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.419> rev<00:04:27.509> it<00:04:27.629> any<00:04:27.750> higher

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
I don't want to rev it any higher

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.830 
I don't want to rev it any higher
because<00:04:28.199> this<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:28.889> so<00:04:29.069> obvious<00:04:29.520> here<00:04:29.780> it's<00:04:30.780> a

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
because this is so obvious here it's a

00:04:30.840 --> 00:05:01.740 
because this is so obvious here it's a
lot<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.110> car

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.110 

that<00:05:02.750> was<00:05:02.840> interesting
