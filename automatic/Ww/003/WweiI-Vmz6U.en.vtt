00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.920 
feels good it feels
it<00:01:43.920> doesn't<00:01:44.220> feel<00:01:44.310> obviously<00:01:44.939> great<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.630> got

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
it doesn't feel obviously great it's got

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.370 
it doesn't feel obviously great it's got
no<00:01:46.170> suspension<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.920> all<00:01:47.570> but<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.840> exactly

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
no suspension at all but it's exactly

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.020 
no suspension at all but it's exactly
what<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.710> would<00:01:49.799> expect<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.250> big-ass<00:01:50.549> dump

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
what you would expect a big-ass dump

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.859 
what you would expect a big-ass dump
truck<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:52.770> don't<00:01:53.759> know<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
truck to be I don't know I like it

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990 
truck to be I don't know I like it
I<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.070> little<00:01:56.460> overkill

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
I just think it's a little overkill

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.899 
I just think it's a little overkill
because<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:58.399> break<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.700> game

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
because you can just break the game

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
because you can just break the game
essentially<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:01.049> didn't<00:02:01.439> even<00:02:01.590> know

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
essentially like I didn't even know

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
essentially like I didn't even know
those<00:02:02.280> trees<00:02:02.640> were<00:02:02.790> able<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.540> break<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
those trees were able to break and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.539 
those trees were able to break and
that's<00:02:04.259> kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.500> interesting<00:02:04.799> because<00:02:05.219> I

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that's kind of interesting because I

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.389 
that's kind of interesting because I
felt<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.719> before<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> could<00:02:07.920> almost

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
felt like before that I could almost

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.690 
felt like before that I could almost
break<00:02:08.670> them<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.800> now<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.670> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
break them but now that I know I can I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.610 
break them but now that I know I can I
might<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.209> into<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> situation<00:02:12.629> where<00:02:13.110> I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
might get into a situation where I

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.600 
might get into a situation where I
trying<00:02:13.890> Ram<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.670> tree<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.780> break<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.610> now

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
trying Ram a tree just to break it now

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.710 
trying Ram a tree just to break it now
I'm<00:02:17.730> curious<00:02:17.909> can<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.239> just<00:02:18.450> walk<00:02:18.690> right

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
I'm curious can I just walk right

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.690 
I'm curious can I just walk right
through<00:02:18.989> this<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.470> as<00:02:19.650> let's<00:02:19.860> see<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> bet<00:02:20.519> you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
dangerous water level actually that's

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.550 
dangerous water level actually that's
kind<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.650> interesting<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:38.190> sitting<00:02:39.560> how

high we are off the ground this is
stupid<00:02:44.930> but<00:02:45.930> hilarious<00:02:46.440> at<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:46.920> same<00:02:47.099> time<00:02:47.310> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
supposed to get to but because you can

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.009 
supposed to get to but because you can
just<00:02:53.340> break<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.030> many<00:02:54.180> trees<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.720> everything

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
just break so many trees and everything

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.940 
just break so many trees and everything
you<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.170> walk<00:02:55.620> right<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:56.129> it<00:02:56.280> essentially

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
you just walk right to it essentially

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.300 
you just walk right to it essentially
obviously<00:02:59.900> not<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.109> be<00:03:01.200> taken<00:03:01.590> seriously<00:03:01.620> this

no effort at all let's keep going for a
little<00:03:25.889> more<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.099> guess<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:26.609> kind<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.000> fun<00:03:27.239> I

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
little more I guess it's kind of fun I

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.280 
little more I guess it's kind of fun I
don't<00:03:29.639> know<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.120> would<00:03:30.299> like<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.629> see<00:03:30.810> like<00:03:31.079> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
don't know I would like to see like a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.920 
don't know I would like to see like a
realistic<00:03:32.129> dump<00:03:32.910> truck<00:03:33.180> mod<00:03:33.389> that<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.720> can

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
realistic dump truck mod that I can

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.240 
realistic dump truck mod that I can
actually<00:03:34.230> like<00:03:34.410> dump<00:03:34.680> with<00:03:34.859> I<00:03:34.950> don't<00:03:35.099> think

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
actually like dump with I don't think

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.610 
actually like dump with I don't think
you<00:03:35.310> can<00:03:35.430> dump<00:03:35.609> with<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.849> no<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.620> you

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
you can dump with this no you can you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.619 
you can dump with this no you can you
don't<00:03:37.829> have<00:03:38.099> any<00:03:38.250> sort<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.669> modifications<00:03:39.120> for

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
don't have any sort of modifications for

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:40.069 
don't have any sort of modifications for
this<00:03:39.750> either

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
this either

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.559 
this either
obviously<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:41.400> being<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.819> big-ass<00:03:42.060> dump<00:03:42.359> truck

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
obviously it being a big-ass dump truck

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.930 
obviously it being a big-ass dump truck
I<00:03:42.690> don't<00:03:42.750> think<00:03:43.049> there<00:03:43.169> would<00:03:43.319> be<00:03:43.379> anything

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
I don't think there would be anything

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.069 
I don't think there would be anything
I'm<00:03:44.940> actually<00:03:45.180> slowing<00:03:45.540> down<00:03:45.750> though<00:03:45.959> I'm

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
I'm actually slowing down though I'm

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.449 
I'm actually slowing down though I'm
kind<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.319> having<00:03:46.440> struggles<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.160> get<00:03:47.250> through

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
kind of having struggles to get through

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:47.900 
kind of having struggles to get through
here

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
here

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.479 
here
but<00:03:48.660> now<00:03:49.199> that<00:03:49.440> I'm<00:03:49.560> going<00:03:50.129> a<00:03:50.190> little<00:03:50.220> bit

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
but now that I'm going a little bit

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.849 
but now that I'm going a little bit
downhill<00:03:50.669> no<00:03:51.299> problem<00:03:51.690> at<00:03:51.780> all<00:03:52.280> just

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
downhill no problem at all just

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.580 
downhill no problem at all just
essentially<00:03:55.859> breaking<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.489> game<00:03:57.410> mods<00:03:58.410> like

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
essentially breaking the game mods like

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.170 
essentially breaking the game mods like
this<00:03:58.769> are<00:03:58.919> obviously<00:03:59.370> very<00:03:59.639> fun<00:03:59.879> though<00:04:00.030> how

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
this are obviously very fun though how

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.650 
this are obviously very fun though how
much<00:04:00.269> damn<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.690> has<00:04:00.840> six<00:04:01.230> thousand<00:04:01.739> oh<00:04:02.660> nothing

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
much damn it has six thousand oh nothing

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.909 
much damn it has six thousand oh nothing
is<00:04:03.810> going<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.169> break<00:04:04.319> this<00:04:04.410> out<00:04:04.560> look<00:04:04.709> it's<00:04:04.829> her

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
is going to break this out look it's her

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.229 
is going to break this out look it's her
Nadeau<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.280> wonder<00:04:05.489> if<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.609> can<00:04:05.730> climb<00:04:05.879> this<00:04:06.060> hill

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
Nadeau I wonder if I can climb this hill

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.839 
Nadeau I wonder if I can climb this hill
though<00:04:06.389> I'm<00:04:06.569> curious<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.530> see<00:04:07.560> how<00:04:08.519> powerful

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
though I'm curious to see how powerful

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.059 
though I'm curious to see how powerful
these<00:04:09.389> engines<00:04:09.840> are<00:04:12.139> it's<00:04:13.139> kind<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.709> doing<00:04:13.949> it

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
these engines are it's kind of doing it

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.680 
these engines are it's kind of doing it
it's<00:04:14.220> sliding<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.819> bit<00:04:14.849> though<00:04:15.180> it's<00:04:15.359> actually

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
it's sliding a bit though it's actually

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.599 
it's sliding a bit though it's actually
oh<00:04:15.720> there<00:04:16.139> we<00:04:16.260> go

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
oh there we go

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.900 
oh there we go
the<00:04:17.609> thing<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:17.970> it's<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.389> powerful<00:04:18.660> it's<00:04:19.169> not

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
the thing is it's so powerful it's not

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.959 
the thing is it's so powerful it's not
the<00:04:20.910> engine<00:04:21.389> that's<00:04:22.099> peaking<00:04:23.099> it's<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.640> its

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
the engine that's peaking it's just its

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.620 
the engine that's peaking it's just its
grip<00:04:24.330> on<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:25.260> hunt<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.710> actual<00:04:26.130> ground

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
grip on a hunt the actual ground

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.410 
grip on a hunt the actual ground
that<00:04:28.630> is<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:29.170> making<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.710> having<00:04:30.040> issues<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:31.060> I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
that is it making it having issues so I

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.690 
that is it making it having issues so I
think<00:04:31.780> they<00:04:32.050> pretty<00:04:32.260> much<00:04:32.500> up<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.250> engine<00:04:33.580> as

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
think they pretty much up the engine as

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.120 
think they pretty much up the engine as
much<00:04:33.970> as<00:04:34.150> possible<00:04:34.360> in<00:04:34.720> this<00:04:34.810> game<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:35.980> has

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
much as possible in this game so it has

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.890 
much as possible in this game so it has
as<00:04:36.340> much<00:04:36.490> torque<00:04:36.850> as<00:04:37.030> possible<00:04:37.480> so<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.630> can

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
as much torque as possible so I can

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.180 
as much torque as possible so I can
essentially<00:04:38.560> be<00:04:38.770> stopped<00:04:39.160> by<00:04:39.430> nothing<00:04:41.010> fun<00:04:42.010> to

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
essentially be stopped by nothing fun to

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.530 
essentially be stopped by nothing fun to
experience<00:04:42.580> that's<00:04:42.910> for<00:04:43.090> sure<00:04:43.270> but<00:04:43.510> I

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
experience that's for sure but I

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.660 
experience that's for sure but I
wouldn't<00:04:44.290> be<00:04:44.350> playing<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:44.770> mod<00:04:44.980> very<00:04:45.370> long

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
wouldn't be playing this mod very long

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.340 
wouldn't be playing this mod very long
because<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.060> kind<00:04:46.270> of<00:04:46.390> ruins<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.930> fun<00:04:47.170> of<00:04:47.290> the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
because it kind of ruins the fun of the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.650 
because it kind of ruins the fun of the
game<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:48.190> don't<00:04:48.220> think<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.850> mud<00:04:49.120> mechanics

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
game and I don't think the mud mechanics

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.530 
game and I don't think the mud mechanics
are<00:04:49.810> there<00:04:50.050> honestly<00:04:50.350> I<00:04:51.190> haven't<00:04:52.120> felt<00:04:52.450> like

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
are there honestly I haven't felt like

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.610 
are there honestly I haven't felt like
these<00:04:52.750> wheels<00:04:53.080> get<00:04:53.350> into<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.430> mud<00:04:54.640> at<00:04:54.850> all<00:04:55.620> if

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
these wheels get into the mud at all if

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.050 
these wheels get into the mud at all if
we<00:04:56.770> can<00:04:56.920> get<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.160> mud<00:04:57.430> pit<00:04:57.550> it'd<00:04:57.670> be<00:04:57.760> nice<00:04:57.910> to

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
we can get to a mud pit it'd be nice to

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.390 
we can get to a mud pit it'd be nice to
see<00:04:58.300> cuz<00:04:59.230> I<00:04:59.350> wasn't<00:04:59.650> really<00:04:59.740> paying<00:04:59.980> attention

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
see cuz I wasn't really paying attention

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.490 
see cuz I wasn't really paying attention
that<00:05:00.430> I'm<00:05:00.610> kind<00:05:00.820> of<00:05:00.850> just<00:05:01.060> breaking<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.110> Force

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
that I'm kind of just breaking the Force

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.260 
that I'm kind of just breaking the Force
oh<00:05:02.730> okay<00:05:03.730> so<00:05:04.380> Street<00:05:05.380> polls<00:05:05.680> are<00:05:06.270> evidently

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
oh okay so Street polls are evidently

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.960 
oh okay so Street polls are evidently
stronger<00:05:07.870> than<00:05:08.080> strees<00:05:08.500> than<00:05:09.040> trees<00:05:09.340> in<00:05:09.640> this

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
stronger than strees than trees in this

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.870 
stronger than strees than trees in this
game<00:05:10.180> cool<00:05:10.570> I<00:05:10.980> want<00:05:11.980> to<00:05:12.040> go<00:05:12.130> down<00:05:12.280> here<00:05:12.310> just<00:05:12.760> to

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
game cool I want to go down here just to

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.250 
game cool I want to go down here just to
see<00:05:13.120> if<00:05:13.180> there's<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.420> mud<00:05:13.600> pit<00:05:13.780> but<00:05:14.050> yeah<00:05:14.230> I

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
see if there's a mud pit but yeah I

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.020 
see if there's a mud pit but yeah I
think<00:05:14.530> you<00:05:14.920> guys<00:05:15.070> get<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.370> idea<00:05:15.700> with<00:05:15.880> this

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
think you guys get the idea with this

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.710 
think you guys get the idea with this
mod<00:05:16.270> kind<00:05:17.170> of<00:05:17.260> over<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.530> top<00:05:17.560> kind<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.640> fun<00:05:18.850> but

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
mod kind of over the top kind of fun but

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
mod kind of over the top kind of fun but
yeah<00:05:20.410> it's<00:05:20.920> it's<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.700> big-ass<00:05:22.000> dump<00:05:22.360> truck

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
yeah it's it's a big-ass dump truck

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.500 
yeah it's it's a big-ass dump truck
we're<00:05:23.740> going<00:05:23.920> back<00:05:24.070> into<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.400> forest<00:05:24.850> I<00:05:25.030> don't

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
we're going back into the forest I don't

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.150 
we're going back into the forest I don't
think<00:05:25.780> I'm<00:05:25.870> gonna<00:05:25.990> find<00:05:26.320> any<00:05:26.500> mud<00:05:26.710> but<00:05:27.010> yeah<00:05:27.130> I

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
think I'm gonna find any mud but yeah I

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.770
