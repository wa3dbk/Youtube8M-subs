00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 welcome be unboxing today I come to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.960
 show you how to install google apps 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.360
 in the nubia z7 mini good for 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.880
 those who watched the zte video 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.590
 nubia z7 mini you know that factory 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.179
 it does not bring the google apps but I told you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.430
 it's very easy to install it so 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
 install the process is quite simple 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 It consists of three steps 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.680
 the first thing is to root the terminal what 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.029
 second is to install a custom recovery and 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.340
 the third thing is to install ya the google 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.260
 apps from this record in recovery the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 process is simple and it is done 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.590
 in about five minutes so 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.690
 do not worry it's nothing 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.850
 complicated in addition in this tutorial os what 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.440
 I will explain everything step by step I 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.570
 I would also like to emphasize that if 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.090
 buy your zte nubia zetas 7 mini 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.610
 in techno spain you can choose the option 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 that you come installed factory with 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.430
 the google apps you just have to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.539
 authorize the manipulation of 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.820
 device so that they can 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.530
 configure it but you know that it fits 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.740
 that possibility and you do not have to do the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.290
 procedure you 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.970
 good to rotate the nubia z 7 min and what 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.190
 first thing we're going to have to do is 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.750
 download the two files that I'm going to 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.670
 leave in the description of the video that 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.590
 I will also leave you in the forum I leave you the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.420
 link simply download the two 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.980
 files and once we have it 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.870
 you will have exactly the same as I have 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.790
 here the first thing to do is 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.320
 unzip this folder is so 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.360
 simple as obviously double 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.810
 click and drag out for example here 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.830
 same and we already have all these files 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.240
 unzipped this same I'm going to erase 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.369
 so as not to be wrong 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.090
 Well the next step is to connect 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:37.070
 our zte nubia to the pc for it we go 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.070
 to use our usb micro usb cable 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.570
 and there we have it connected once 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.170
 connected to the pc what we are going to do is 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.050
 here unfold the bar and give it to usb 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.230
 connectic and we have to put it in the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.230
 usb + storage mode we click 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.840
 and as soon as we make these fixes as in 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.850
 the pc appears this little window that already 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.670
 lets us open the folder to see everything 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.350
 the contents of this phone once 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.979
 done this the next step would be 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.740
 copy supersur towell root file and 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.030
 the tablet here are the google 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.210
 apps 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.160
 we give him right button we give him to copy 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.960
 and in the root of the device where here 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.030
 we have all you see that this content 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.780
 of all the phone we give you button 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.760
 right and paste 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.630
 we already have the phone ready for 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.820
 process 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.340
 the next step would be to unplug the 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.540
 phone already from the pc and once removed we 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.730
 let's come here to the explorer of 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.290
 files that are called my file and what 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.330
 let's open let's click on 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.980
 phone storage we go downstairs 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.810
 where we have all the files that 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.190
 we just copied and we are going to install 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.110
 all root install very simple and open 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.760
 Once it is open, we have you 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.380
 to give the button make it rain this 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.740
 is what is going to make our 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.740
 phone 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.460
 and as you can see, they do not come out directly 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.400
 the phone is surrounded and that 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.290
 we need to restart once it is 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.600
 already installed all the root and rooted the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.610
 phone we can install the application 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.410
 supersur that will allow us to manage 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.690
 then all the root permissions as 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.220
 You see it's already installed I open it and they say 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.380
 that the root endings have to be 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.980
 updated we tell you to continue in the 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.420
 normal method 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.250
 as you see once finished the 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.080
 procedure if we enter settings 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.330
 already we get here in alt of superior or 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.349
 whether the root is already activated in case 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.550
 that I give you any kind of error 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.020
 you just have to restart and ready 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.910
 well we have our phone 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.370
 rooted and the next step is to install 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.750
 wr's recovery to do it is very 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.900
 simple the first thing we have to 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.030
 have is the zte driver installed if 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.170
 we do not have it so double click here on the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.210
 file that we have downloaded and 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.450
 decompressed before we give it to execute 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.610
 in Spanish and when this window is 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.130
 here open let's proceed to connect 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.500
 the phone to the computer again 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.980
 we use the usb micro usb cable what 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.980
 plugged in 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.160
 we give the next following install 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.750
 once finished installing the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.600
 driver the next step is to come 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.850
 here to settings we are going to come here 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.650
 below where it says about font and we're going 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.840
 to click here where william say see 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.940
 several times until he tells us that 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.040
 we are the developer once we have 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.680
 done this when entering here in the section 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.850
 end of moore you will see that they come out of 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.530
 broker options options 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.190
 development and here we will have to activate 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.770
 the debugging usb 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.450
 we give it to ok and it is already activated 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.700
 next step we will do with this 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.650
 file from here there would be no more mini tw 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.200
 rpg version 2 what we are going to do is 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.010
 all the contents of this file what 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.010
 let's unzip 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.350
 you see what we have here recovery tools and 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.960
 a couple of files once connected already 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.240
 the phone in the booking mode the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.979
 usb debugging mode we will give ok 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.410
 when we get this message we say 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.389
 ok and we're going to open the permanent room if 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.009
 the message does not come directly to us 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.470
 do not worry, it will come out safely 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:05.090
 when executing this program law we get 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.090
 here the message we give to ok 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.120
 and the attribute restarts the phone and 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.120
 is going to install the new recovery 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.119
 As you can see, it has finally ended 

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:19.420
 says that we press a key to 

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:21.340
 continue we give to enter 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.840
 once the phone restarts and 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.120
 only the last step that is missing 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.460
 install the google apps for that we're going 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.200
 to pay first the phone that we are going to 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.200
 unplug from the pc we turn it off 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.580
 and once it's completely turned off 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.070
 let's start it again by pressing the 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.360
 Power key and volume up with this 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.919
 key combination what are we going to 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.310
 get is to start in mode 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.310
 recovery 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.639
 next what we are going to do is 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.639
 give here to the top option to the 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.919
 left install and we will choose the 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.680
 Popped file at first that it 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.360
 called kaka gaps that this kit kat 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.560
 says to continue with the 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.280
 installation we have to slide 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.280
 we slide 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.419
 good once the process is finished 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.909
 we just have to click on the button 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.599
 of reboot to reboot the system and 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.599
 we give power 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.980
 well once you have restarted the 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.470
 phone we can check that already 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.520
 we have installed the Google apps here 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.930

 it's quite simple but you have to 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.680
 do several things are three processes 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.020
