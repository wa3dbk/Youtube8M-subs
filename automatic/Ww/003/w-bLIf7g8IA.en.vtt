totally makes sense and one being I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.590 
totally makes sense and one being I
don't<00:02:15.880> get<00:02:16.120> it

so missus good girl bad girl gets a 5

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.150 
so missus good girl bad girl gets a 5
out<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.290> 5

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
out of 5

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.400 
out of 5
so<00:02:24.370> definitely<00:02:24.820> 5<00:02:25.180> points<00:02:25.540> out<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.720> 5<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410
