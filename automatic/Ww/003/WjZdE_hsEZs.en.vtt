what<00:01:09.000> people<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> they'll<00:01:09.990> step<00:01:10.560> back

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
what people will do is they'll step back

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and say i'm just going to watch for a

and say i'm just going to watch for a
while<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.200> that's<00:01:13.680> fatal<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.580> need<00:01:14.850> momentum

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
while and that's fatal you need momentum

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.310 
while and that's fatal you need momentum
and<00:01:16.009> how<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.220> create<00:01:17.400> momentum<00:01:17.850> because

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
and how do you create momentum because

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.950 
and how do you create momentum because
nobody<00:01:19.320> gives<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> need<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.939> big<00:01:21.240> ways<00:01:21.450> they

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
nobody gives to need in big ways they

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.600 
nobody gives to need in big ways they
like<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> give<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.590> success<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.310> how<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
like to give to success and how do you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.940 
like to give to success and how do you
create<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.060> momentum<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:25.409> some<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
create the momentum well some of it is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.800 
create the momentum well some of it is
luck<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.700> course<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.299> think<00:01:27.360> there<00:01:27.720> are

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
luck of course but I think there are

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.920 
luck of course but I think there are
some<00:01:27.960> things<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:29.119> first<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.720> need<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
some things you can do first you need a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.830 
some things you can do first you need a
plan<00:01:31.170> has<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> realistic<00:01:32.369> plan<00:01:32.840> people

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
plan has to be a realistic plan people

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
plan has to be a realistic plan people
have<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.380> signed<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
have to have signed off on it and you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
have to have signed off on it and you
have<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> stick<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.439> execute

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
have to stick to it you have to execute

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.789 
have to stick to it you have to execute
it<00:01:38.130> step<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.240> step<00:01:39.420> two<00:01:39.600> step<00:01:40.110> three<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.530> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it step one step two step three as you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.399 
it step one step two step three as you
go<00:01:41.009> through<00:01:41.040> those<00:01:41.549> steps<00:01:42.140> people<00:01:43.140> gain

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
go through those steps people gain

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.310 
go through those steps people gain
confidence<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.850> gain<00:01:45.090> momentum<00:01:45.570> so

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
confidence and you gain momentum so

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.999 
confidence and you gain momentum so
that's<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.640> front<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.750> say<00:01:48.869> also<00:01:49.079> no

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that's up front I would say also no

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.130 
that's up front I would say also no
failures<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:51.360> let's<00:01:51.570> say<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.049> an

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
failures all right let's say you have an

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.859 
failures all right let's say you have an
event<00:01:52.350> coming<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.220> ticket<00:01:53.820> sales<00:01:54.060> aren't

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
event coming up the ticket sales aren't

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.510 
event coming up the ticket sales aren't
going<00:01:55.140> particularly<00:01:55.500> well<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.130> looks<00:01:56.369> like

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
going particularly well it looks like

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.149 
going particularly well it looks like
it's<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> flop<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:58.469> need<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.950> move

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it's going to be a flop you need to move

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.030 
it's going to be a flop you need to move
heaven<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.090> earth<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.530> thing<00:02:01.799> does<00:02:02.009> not

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
heaven and earth so this thing does not

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.359 
heaven and earth so this thing does not
fail<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:03.270> even<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.079> minor<00:02:04.469> event<00:02:04.920> not

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
fail because even a minor event not

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.050 
fail because even a minor event not
doing<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:05.880> kills<00:02:06.450> momentum<00:02:07.320> no<00:02:08.009> failures<00:02:08.429> in

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
doing well kills momentum no failures in

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.880 
doing well kills momentum no failures in
the<00:02:09.450> final<00:02:09.750> point<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.080> would<00:02:10.140> make<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.649> is

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the final point I would make here is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.520 
the final point I would make here is
attitude<00:02:11.879> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
attitude it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.250 
attitude it
has<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:13.920> fun<00:02:14.660> look<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:15.990> one<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
has to be fun look we have one of the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.230 
has to be fun look we have one of the

best ballet companies in the world and

dancers dance they're having fun you can

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.870 
dancers dance they're having fun you can
tell<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:26.010> board<00:02:26.250> ought<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.490> have<00:02:26.610> fun

too<00:02:27.090> needs<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.660> be<00:02:27.780> fun<00:02:28.640> that's<00:02:29.640> great<00:02:29.940> because

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
too needs to be fun that's great because

too needs to be fun that's great because
this<00:02:30.360> sounds<00:02:30.690> very<00:02:30.840> entrepreneurial<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.650> me

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
this sounds very entrepreneurial to me

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.770 
this sounds very entrepreneurial to me

control and that requires momentum but

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.670 
control and that requires momentum but
what<00:02:38.459> are<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.760> other<00:02:38.910> differences<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:40.470> you

what are the other differences that you

see well if I'd list another it's

see well if I'd list another it's
there's<00:02:45.090> little<00:02:45.660> doubt<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.560> hard<00:02:47.100> to

there's little doubt that it is hard to

there's little doubt that it is hard to

get the same level of intensity and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
the not-for-profit world and so you

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.040 
the not-for-profit world and so you

don't get the same motivating factor to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.040 
don't get the same motivating factor to
some<00:03:07.319> degree<00:03:07.470> there's<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.190> work<00:03:08.670> ethic<00:03:09.090> issue<00:03:09.660> a

some degree there's a work ethic issue a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.320 
some degree there's a work ethic issue a
lot<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.010> people<00:03:11.250> who<00:03:11.370> join<00:03:11.790> work<00:03:12.120> for

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
lot of people who join work for

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.360 
lot of people who join work for
not-for-profits<00:03:13.050> have<00:03:13.380> quite<00:03:13.860> consciously

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
not-for-profits have quite consciously

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.520 
not-for-profits have quite consciously
decided<00:03:14.970> when<00:03:15.750> reason<00:03:16.080> they're<00:03:16.200> doing<00:03:16.440> this

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
decided when reason they're doing this

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.740 
decided when reason they're doing this
is<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.920> they<00:03:17.010> don't<00:03:17.310> want<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.579> work<00:03:17.760> 80-hour

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
is that they don't want to work 80-hour

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.440 
is that they don't want to work 80-hour
weeks<00:03:19.070> which<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.250> fine<00:03:20.549> now<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.120> want<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.329> be

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
weeks which is fine now I want to be

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.660 
weeks which is fine now I want to be
clear<00:03:21.570> here<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.110> think<00:03:22.799> we've<00:03:22.950> gotten<00:03:23.190> beyond

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
clear here I think we've gotten beyond

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.930 
clear here I think we've gotten beyond
that<00:03:23.940> with<00:03:24.630> boston<00:03:25.079> ballet<00:03:25.549> barre<00:03:26.549> houston

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
that with boston ballet barre houston

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.880 
that with boston ballet barre houston
new<00:03:27.090> executive<00:03:27.600> director<00:03:27.660> has<00:03:28.260> turned<00:03:28.769> the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
new executive director has turned the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.490 
new executive director has turned the
ballet<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.700> pretty<00:03:30.060> lean<00:03:30.510> mean<00:03:30.870> machine

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
ballet in to a pretty lean mean machine

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.380 
ballet in to a pretty lean mean machine
so<00:03:32.400> i<00:03:32.430> think<00:03:32.640> we've<00:03:32.910> made<00:03:33.030> good<00:03:33.209> progress

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
so i think we've made good progress

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.840 
so i think we've made good progress
there<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.160> both<00:03:35.190> had<00:03:35.579> a<00:03:35.610> little

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
there you and I both had a little

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.479 
there you and I both had a little
experience<00:03:36.120> at<00:03:36.480> Harvard<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.160> trying<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.250> turn

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
experience at Harvard and trying to turn

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.940 
experience at Harvard and trying to turn
a<00:03:38.690> not-for-profits<00:03:39.690> attention<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.620> being

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
a not-for-profits attention to being

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.490 
a not-for-profits attention to being
lean<00:03:41.160> mean<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.730> efficient<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.780> not<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
lean mean and efficient is not the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.750 
lean mean and efficient is not the
easiest<00:03:43.769> thing<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.160> world<00:03:44.220> what<00:03:44.579> have<00:03:44.670> you

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
easiest thing in the world what have you

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.780 
easiest thing in the world what have you
done<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.150> try<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.510> help<00:03:46.040> make<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.220> attitude

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
done to try to help make that attitude

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.610 
done to try to help make that attitude
adjustment<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.510> way<00:03:48.600> they<00:03:48.780> talk<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.320> it

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
adjustment is the way they talk about it

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.050 
adjustment is the way they talk about it
well<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.190> think<00:03:50.280> one<00:03:50.549> of<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.730> things<00:03:50.790> that

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
well I think one of the things that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.870 
well I think one of the things that
helps<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.630> it's<00:03:52.200> pretty<00:03:52.440> simple<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.670> need

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
helps is it's pretty simple is you need

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.630 
helps is it's pretty simple is you need
to<00:03:54.030> set<00:03:54.239> up<00:03:54.450> clear<00:03:55.140> benchmarks<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.920> have

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
to set up clear benchmarks and have

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.880 
to set up clear benchmarks and have
clear<00:03:57.000> reporting<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:58.200> sort<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.470> clear

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
clear reporting this sort of clear

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.530 
clear reporting this sort of clear
consistent<00:03:59.280> reporting<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.030> everybody<00:04:00.450> in

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
consistent reporting that everybody in

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.110 
consistent reporting that everybody in
the<00:04:00.630> board<00:04:00.870> can<00:04:01.049> see<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.470> know<00:04:01.680> exactly

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
the board can see so you know exactly

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.970 
the board can see so you know exactly
what's<00:04:03.120> working<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.660> what's<00:04:04.170> not<00:04:04.290> working

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
what's working and what's not working

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.699 
what's working and what's not working
and<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.760> goes<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> long<00:04:06.120> way<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.720> would<00:04:07.590> also

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
and that goes a long way I would also

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.310 
and that goes a long way I would also
say<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.390> personally<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.420> try<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.810> set<00:04:10.109> an

say that personally I try to set an

say that personally I try to set an
example<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:11.310> terms<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.380> intensity<00:04:13.380> and

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
example in terms of intensity and

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.130 
example in terms of intensity and
efficiency<00:04:14.220> if<00:04:14.579> I<00:04:15.090> get<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.299> call<00:04:15.570> or<00:04:15.870> an<00:04:16.079> email

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
efficiency if I get a call or an email

from<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.799> ballet<00:04:16.979> I<00:04:17.340> try<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.729> respond<00:04:18.209> quickly

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
from the ballet I try to respond quickly

from the ballet I try to respond quickly
almost<00:04:19.350> me<00:04:19.950> late<00:04:20.130> too<00:04:20.519> but<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.180> idea<00:04:21.450> that

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
almost me late too but the idea that

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.010 
almost me late too but the idea that
they<00:04:22.440> would<00:04:22.620> pick<00:04:22.860> up<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.280> habit<00:04:23.700> there's<00:04:24.690> as

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
they would pick up that habit there's as

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.520 
they would pick up that habit there's as
a<00:04:25.110> corollary<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.770> that

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
a corollary to that

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.870 
a corollary to that
a<00:04:26.680> lot<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.310> times<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:28.389> have<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.600> problem<00:04:28.900> and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
a lot of times you have a problem and

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.190 
a lot of times you have a problem and
you<00:04:30.880> talk<00:04:31.090> about<00:04:31.120> what<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.720> problem<00:04:32.050> is<00:04:32.139> and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
you talk about what the problem is and

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.110 
you talk about what the problem is and
you<00:04:32.530> have<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:32.650> big<00:04:32.889> idea<00:04:33.040> of<00:04:33.460> how<00:04:33.670> you<00:04:33.730> might

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
you have a big idea of how you might

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.050 
you have a big idea of how you might
solve<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.160> but<00:04:36.160> in<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.370> nonprofit<00:04:36.550> world

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
solve it but in the nonprofit world

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.030 
solve it but in the nonprofit world
maybe<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.720> committee<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.200> working<00:04:38.260> on<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.830> so

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
issue there is an expression i like a

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.140 
issue there is an expression i like a
lot<00:05:29.020> I<00:05:29.229> think<00:05:29.500> alex<00:05:29.860> haley<00:05:30.130> said<00:05:30.430> this<00:05:30.669> it's

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
lot I think alex haley said this it's

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.650 
lot I think alex haley said this it's
fine<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.320> good<00:05:32.500> and<00:05:32.770> praised<00:05:33.130> it<00:05:33.340> so<00:05:34.270> when

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.460

but i'd be curious what you've seen well
first<00:05:59.890> is<00:06:00.130> obviously<00:06:00.580> you<00:06:00.789> came<00:06:01.000> in<00:06:01.240> during<00:06:01.510> a

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
first is obviously you came in during a

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.469 
first is obviously you came in during a
financial<00:06:02.050> crisis<00:06:02.500> and<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:03.850> stability<00:06:04.450> that

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
financial crisis and the stability that

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.390 
financial crisis and the stability that
I<00:06:05.130> see<00:06:06.130> is<00:06:06.930> fantastic<00:06:07.930> I<00:06:08.140> think<00:06:08.919> the<00:06:09.010> move<00:06:09.190> from

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
I see is fantastic I think the move from

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.940 
I see is fantastic I think the move from
the<00:06:09.520> Wang<00:06:09.729> to<00:06:09.970> the<00:06:10.090> upper<00:06:10.360> house<00:06:10.510> was<00:06:10.950> very

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
the Wang to the upper house was very

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.409 
the Wang to the upper house was very
important<00:06:12.370> because<00:06:12.430> it<00:06:12.789> created<00:06:13.060> a<00:06:13.240> more

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
important because it created a more

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:14.790 
important because it created a more
intimate<00:06:13.630> setting<00:06:13.780> where<00:06:14.260> you<00:06:14.380> really<00:06:14.620> could

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
intimate setting where you really could

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.730 
intimate setting where you really could
joy<00:06:15.039> enjoy<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.820> art<00:06:16.390> of<00:06:16.630> ballet<00:06:16.780> in<00:06:17.350> a<00:06:17.500> very

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
joy enjoy the art of ballet in a very

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.279 
joy enjoy the art of ballet in a very
different<00:06:18.010> way<00:06:18.370> than<00:06:19.060> it<00:06:19.240> was<00:06:19.419> in<00:06:19.450> a<00:06:19.720> 4,000

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289

seat<00:06:20.530> theater<00:06:21.190> I<00:06:21.479> guess<00:06:22.479> Miko<00:06:22.960> is<00:06:23.070> obviously

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
seat theater I guess Miko is obviously

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.650 
seat theater I guess Miko is obviously
one<00:06:24.310> of<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.460> great<00:06:24.610> things<00:06:24.640> i<00:06:25.150> mean<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.450> last

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
one of the great things i mean the last

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.080 
one of the great things i mean the last
two<00:06:25.930> ballets<00:06:26.289> i've<00:06:26.470> attended<00:06:26.740> two<00:06:27.070> are<00:06:27.340> the

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
two ballets i've attended two are the

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.900 
two ballets i've attended two are the
best<00:06:28.660> that<00:06:28.990> i've<00:06:29.110> seen<00:06:29.380> in<00:06:29.500> my<00:06:29.620> life<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.160> then

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
best that i've seen in my life and then

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.790 
best that i've seen in my life and then
i<00:06:31.060> guess<00:06:31.270> it's<00:06:31.570> the<00:06:31.870> schools<00:06:32.320> in<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:32.500> average

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
i guess it's the schools in the average

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.820 
i guess it's the schools in the average
program<00:06:33.190> are<00:06:33.340> doing<00:06:33.610> more<00:06:33.990> but<00:06:34.990> how<00:06:35.590> did<00:06:35.650> you

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
program are doing more but how did you

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.399 
program are doing more but how did you
do<00:06:36.010> this<00:06:36.220> how<00:06:36.490> do<00:06:36.849> you<00:06:36.940> accomplish<00:06:37.210> this<00:06:37.690> bring

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
do this how do you accomplish this bring

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.050 
do this how do you accomplish this bring

ization Boston Ballet it's a case study

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.510 
ization Boston Ballet it's a case study
I<00:06:43.150> think<00:06:43.780> it's<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:44.139> very<00:06:44.380> important<00:06:44.889> case<00:06:45.190> study

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
I think it's a very important case study

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.090 
I think it's a very important case study
and<00:06:47.130> like<00:06:48.130> many<00:06:48.510> performing<00:06:49.510> arts

institutions<00:06:51.100> three<00:06:51.310> years<00:06:51.520> ago<00:06:51.669> it<00:06:52.330> was

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
institutions three years ago it was

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.450 
institutions three years ago it was
going<00:06:52.720> through<00:06:52.930> a<00:06:52.960> tough<00:06:53.230> time<00:06:53.260> it<00:06:54.010> was<00:06:54.160> pretty

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
going through a tough time it was pretty

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.659 
going through a tough time it was pretty
close<00:06:54.669> to<00:06:54.940> the<00:06:54.970> edge<00:06:55.210> so<00:06:56.110> the<00:06:56.200> question<00:06:56.590> is<00:06:56.830> the

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 
close to the edge so the question is the

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.000 
close to the edge so the question is the
question<00:06:58.000> in<00:06:58.120> the<00:06:58.210> case<00:06:58.360> is<00:06:58.720> how<00:06:59.380> do<00:06:59.440> we<00:06:59.590> fix<00:06:59.770> it

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
question in the case is how do we fix it

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.540
