00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.790
 back and let us get out of this 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.250
 cumbersome advertising 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.340
 orange tree and we left directly and 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.980
 I have selected the screen block 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.840
 own galaxy s 6 after we had 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.950
 to select the default launcher 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.110
 and the default wallpaper we're going to go to 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.510
 start 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.500
 and we will select as a screen 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.500

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.120
 start and where you start from I'll 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.610
 select the that launcher 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.209
 As you can see I already have the extract the post 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.250
 and the samsung galaxy s widget that's 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.269
 the new widget this new widget what 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.480
 we are gonna get 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.090
 simply by clicking on widgets and with the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.280
 application x widget that will leave us 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.170
 here at the end you owe what we have 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.340
 many widgets available from x gÃ¼icho 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.430
 we are going to select that we 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.579
 we just want to drag it 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.650
 to the screen to a new one for example and 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.340
 here once put 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.170
 we can lower the theme of samsung that 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.340
 I want I have chosen this here that 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.340
 puts faces and s 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.390
 which role this widget here as you see 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.640
 this would be the galaxy s 6 widget like 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.829
 you see the interface is the own tom with 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.560
 It is very similar to these guys from Samsung 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:09.879
 it's worth it with the only peculiarity that if 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.290
 we drag that if we drag the bar 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.030
 side times out a stick and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.609
 tiny as it comes out on the samsung galaxy 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.640
 s 5 samsung galaxy s 6 is going to come out 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.620
 more extensive with the three accesses 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.840
 direct the latest applications and 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.730
 favorite applications or the cleaner 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.280
 ram memory the truth is that this car 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.829
 it's sensational now finally let's 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.299
 select your own wallpaper 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:37.599
 from samsung galaxy s 65 I was wrong 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:41.590
 me from widgets we do not go to funds and in the 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.109
 option of animated backgrounds we have to 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.970
 look for the animated background option to 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.419
 Sometimes I find for wallpapers 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.419
 here is crystal s5 as you see here 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.700
 we have the wallpaper where if we give 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.250
 edit we will be able to select between 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.480
 the funds that we already have predefined 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.810
 in blue purple black 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.120
 1 s 2 if we go back 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.450
 let's see how the background changes here what 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.400
 you see and we have the wave of the own 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.739
 samsung galaxy s 6 wallpaper or 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.140
 samsung galaxy s 5 now simply you 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.769
 we would explain and we already have the 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.889
 achieved interface of samsung in any 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.260
 Android terminal are just like os 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.970
 I said with four applications x 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.620
 widget to select the widget of the 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.620
 samsung faces and 6 clock 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.300
 or the animated paper of samsung galaxy s 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.300
 that would be another application the launcher 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.320
 the default launcher that would be the 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.320
 that launcher and finally 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.470
 the screen block let's see what 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.070
 is they believe that I have not taught it I am going to 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.070
 lock the phone 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.129
 blocked the phone and unlock it 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.169
 you're going 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.819
 own what they write on samsung 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.189
 galaxy s as it says here we have it 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.210
 simply doing a whip or a 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:05.199
 swype we're going 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:09.110
 let's go out this let's unlock 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.270
 As you can see, it's a very good option 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.220
 all the most handsome of all is the launcher 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.610
 is a very spectacular launcher with this 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.080
 bar here with this panel that we get 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.240
 from any screen simply if 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.479
 we drag the panel will come out and 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.270
 keeps the torture the appearance of the 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.280
 samsung touchwiz interface except 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.349
 this bar that as I say this does not 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.960
 exists in the terminals to the superior 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.810
 I say that with the wallpaper the 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.349
 clock widget and in that launcher and the 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.440
 block screen you are going to get an effect 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:47.380
 very very similar to what the 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.380
 samsung in his samsung galaxy series
