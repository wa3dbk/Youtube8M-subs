 chipotles in marinade that depends on how 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.579
 you like it if you like that it stings 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.440
 little bit puts you less and if you like that 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.590
 come out more spicy you can put more 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.820
 chile chipotle and we're also going to use 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:11.440
 ground pepper salt and we need a 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.140
 can of vegetable broth oil let's go 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.070
 to need like a tablespoon of oil 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.680
 and we also need the pasta or the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.960
 spaghetti you can use the brand 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.300
 that you like so these are the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.820
 ingredients that we are going to use first 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.680
 what we are going to do is put as 2 liters 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.440
 of water to boil so we can 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.140
 cook our spaghetti as always 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.650
 as the box marks it so we're going to 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.390
 cover it to boil the water and 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.810
 then we will add the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.640
 spaghetti and in another container we are going to 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.640
 cook the tomatoes 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:58.799
 the onion and the two cloves of garlic 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.799
 here I have the ground meat 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.500
 to this we are going to add the mint 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.550
 dry is about half a spoonful 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.550
 is what we are going to need 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.440
 and we're also going to put a little bit of 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.440
 ground pepper pepper 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.810
 and a little salt 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.660
 and we are going to stir everything 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.489
 yes 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.840
 we add another little salt salt 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.470
 it's to your liking and we're also going to put it 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.470
 the egg 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.230
 and this we are going to stir everything 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.310
 now let's make the balls 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.650
 the balls can not be the size that 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.569
 you like 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.569
 but we 're going to leave it this size 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.810
 here we have another and in this way what 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.810
 let's do all of them until we finish 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.739
 here I have all the meatballs ready 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.040
 well we already have our water 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.810
 boiling for spaghetti 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.810
 and we are going to add everything 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.940
 and we are going to add a little salt 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.280
 but with another tone 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.450
 and we 're going to leave it for about 12 minutes 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.670
 until the spaghetti is soft and here 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.290
 the tomatoes are already cooked so 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.599
 we are going to liquefy this 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.939
 and we are going to put this same water 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.780
 where we boil the tomatoes as until the 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:14.100
 number three of the blender 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:17.540
 and then add the chipotle peppers and 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.540
 this is going to liquefy everything 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.490
 now we need to warm our 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.850
 pan and we will add a little 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.850
 of oil 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.310
 more or less like a tablespoon of oil 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.730
 and we're going to strain our sauce that we've 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.730
 fact 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.370
 ah 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:54.300
 Here I already have the sauce and now I'm going to 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.300
 add can of vegetable broth 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.790
 and now let's add the meatballs 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.300
 so that it cooks together with the 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.300
 sauce 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.870
 and in case you need a little bit 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.330
 of salt because it already adds and if not then 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.360
 so we're going to leave it and let's wait 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.259
 that this is cooked let's put a 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.900
 little bit more salt so it's very 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.060
 well the taste and we will expect it to 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.120
 cook very well this does not take long 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.310
 more than about 15 minutes in what 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.460
 the meatballs are cooked so this 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.380
 it's a very easy and very quick recipe 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.199
 prepare it at least takes you as 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.990
 one hour cooking the spaghetti and 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.970
 meatballs so this can you 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.030
 prepare when moms do not have 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.120
 a lot of time to be cooking is like that 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.090
 that this is nothing more than cooking ideas 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.569
 a little bit faster than normal so 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.909
 what 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:01.789
 let's hope this is over 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:05.149
 cooking here we have our ready 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:07.309
 spaghetti and they were cooked now what 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:10.729
 we are going to remove and we are going to drain the 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:13.699
 water and we will wash it with cold water 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.149
 Well, I already have the spaghetti ready 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:19.039
 we drain and we wash it with cold water 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:22.069
 and also our 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.869
 meatballs here in the red sauce nothing 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.969
 more than here I left it a little briny 

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:29.270
 because I like it to be like that with 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:32.119
 much broth for when I serve it 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.270
 can bathe the spaghetti well so 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:36.949
 this is already done we have finished with 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.430
 our recipe spaghetti with meatballs 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.289
 and well that's how we are left and here 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.830
 as you can see it has enough of 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:48.139
 broth and that's how I like it and good 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.059
