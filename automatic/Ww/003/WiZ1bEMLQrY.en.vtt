most other Android wear devices I found

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.090 
most other Android wear devices I found
that<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.510> can<00:03:24.690> be<00:03:24.870> fast<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:25.620> as<00:03:25.769> with<00:03:26.010> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
that it can be fast but as with the

that it can be fast but as with the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
flashback I just showed you it's kind of

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.740 
flashback I just showed you it's kind of
all<00:03:28.680> over<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.920> place<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.459> those<00:03:30.150> are<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.480> pros

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
all over the place so those are the pros

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.320 
all over the place so those are the pros
and<00:03:30.810> cons<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.530> found<00:03:31.860> for<00:03:32.160> $200<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.120> can

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
and cons that I found for $200 I can

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.509 
and cons that I found for $200 I can
expect<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:33.840> watch<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.320> be<00:03:34.410> perfect<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.070> it's

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
expect this watch to be perfect and it's

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.340 
expect this watch to be perfect and it's
obviously<00:03:35.850> not<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.810> doesn't<00:03:37.049> mean<00:03:37.140> it

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
obviously not but that doesn't mean it

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.560 
obviously not but that doesn't mean it
is<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> bad<00:03:37.709> SmartWatch<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.549> you're<00:03:39.299> looking

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
is a bad SmartWatch if you're looking

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.420 
is a bad SmartWatch if you're looking
for<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.810> budget<00:03:40.080> SmartWatch<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.980> won't<00:03:41.190> break

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
for a budget SmartWatch that won't break

the<00:03:41.610> bank<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:42.120> have<00:03:42.299> an<00:03:42.420> Android<00:03:42.780> device<00:03:42.810> and

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
the bank you have an Android device and

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.810 
the bank you have an Android device and
you<00:03:43.500> prefer<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.040> design<00:03:44.400> over<00:03:44.640> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
you prefer the design over the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.479 
you prefer the design over the
functionality<00:03:45.720> then<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.410> think<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.769> Asus<00:03:47.190> Zen

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
functionality then I think the Asus Zen

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.940 
functionality then I think the Asus Zen
is<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.209> one<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.750> beat<00:03:48.989> it's<00:03:49.680> very

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
is the one to beat it's very

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.949 
is the one to beat it's very
customizable<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.880> can<00:03:51.030> swap<00:03:51.299> out<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.630> straps

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
customizable you can swap out the straps

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.660 
customizable you can swap out the straps
and<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.500> customize<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.100> watch<00:03:53.310> face

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
and you can customize the watch face

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.390 
and you can customize the watch face
with<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.180> freeze<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:54.870> watch<00:03:55.049> manager<00:03:55.620> app<00:03:55.799> if

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
with the freeze and watch manager app if

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.830 
with the freeze and watch manager app if
you<00:03:56.549> plan<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.760> using<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.090> watch<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.570> send<00:03:57.780> a

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
you plan on using this watch to send a

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.420 
you plan on using this watch to send a
ton<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.019> voice<00:03:58.230> messages<00:03:58.860> or<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.310> know

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
ton of voice messages or you know

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.190 
ton of voice messages or you know
significantly<00:04:00.120> reduce<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.750> amount<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:00.989> time

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
significantly reduce the amount of time

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.479 
significantly reduce the amount of time
you<00:04:01.410> pull<00:04:01.680> your<00:04:01.830> phone<00:04:02.010> out<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.250> your<00:04:02.310> pocket

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
you pull your phone out of your pocket

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.789 
you pull your phone out of your pocket
then<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.660> probably<00:04:04.110> won't<00:04:04.290> be<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.590> best

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
then this probably won't be the best

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.610 
then this probably won't be the best
option<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:06.450> with<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.930> said<00:04:07.230> let<00:04:07.590> me
