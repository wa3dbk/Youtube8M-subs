 for that conference ok 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.240
 that's something that many have seen that for 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.920
 over the years they think that they think 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.470
 that in a conference they will release the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.630
 jailbreak and it does not happen like that guys in this 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.640
 conference I never has happened 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.350
 although it may happen that everyone knows that 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.020
 We are waiting for the boil who yesterday 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.080

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.970
 good only for you and are the ones that 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.110
 they are working on the jailbreak of 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.820
 ajove 7.1 so I do not want them to wait 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.310
 that grass will come out in that conference 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.560
 although it can happen, I'm going to 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.320
 keep informed about the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.630
 jailbreak in the 7.1 I put that title 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.150
 because I want you to come and see the 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.010
 news there is no jailbreak currently 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.230
 and that's the news there's no jailbreak ok 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.700
 I'm not playing is that they are always 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.860
 asking and they thought brutal and they are 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.810
 sending the videos that are false and the 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.260
 person who sends it to me knows that those 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.760
 videos are fake so these are bone 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.099
 those who are going to be gathering here are 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.319
 those who the only ones who know about 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.669
 jailbreak there is no other entity that 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.829
 is working on it gebre so 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.130
 all the videos that you send me 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.560
 there is no jailbreak currently for 7.1 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.870
 aires has not published that yes 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.639
 has always but I have already spoken with 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.889
 he and he told me he is not going to publish that 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.500
 gervais so on his part not 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.080
 wait for that game for ios 7.1 ok 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.650

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.449
 hackers that are going to bring us the grass ok 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.610
 of them is that we should wait for the gebre 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.820
 because yesterday is he did not say no to me 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.160
 what's going to do ok guys that's me I know 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.410
 two weeks or two weeks before I said 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.419
 maybe in two weeks it comes out 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.509
 jailbreak that I expected it I was 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.639
 doing well optimistic but it did not come out 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.680
 and that's why I'm making another video for 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.289
 tell them not that we are all in 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.820
 the wait for that herb many must 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.050
 be counting if the book is not going to come out 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.729
 until yesterday 8 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.010
 I do not think those guys I think we're going to 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.080
 have the jailbreak before but I do not know 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.940
 tell him that so much is missing too much 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.250
 time for it is 8 so it's not 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.310
 but for that it's 8 but I can not either 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.380
