00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.700
 and 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.680
 Hello dear friends and you are watching 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.480
 The first issue of a noble photographer is not necessary 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.790
 only ask stupid questions who is it 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.860
 Something is going on here I am usually 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.780
 photographer like most of you is 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.989
 I walked invented to show 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.250
 do you have any masterpieces of photo art 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.610
 beginners or professional 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.650
 photographer and try them somehow like 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.070
 you already understand the photos we select 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.019
 we will be unusual magic more likely we will 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:22.960
 discuss not the photos themselves but their 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:25.240
 handling well, that went just say 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.000
 that nothing against people what decided 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.820
 take a photo and I don't have just 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.840
 discuss some of their work 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.149
 VKontakte there are many groups on 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.550
 photographer as they need photo processing and 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.890
 for seasoned photo shoppers what these and 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.700
 engaged in these groups today we 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.060
 let's go 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.110
 so here we have who can draw 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.740
 wash another where I responded to 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.509
 see this request as she drew 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.020
 I seem to understand what the problem is 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.740
 each of us passed the first inclusion 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.459
 came up and what kind of filters yes it is to me 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.530
 like need more filters 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:08.500
 well she signed it what exactly you 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.170
 I wanted but I came out only photos 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.000
 spoiled 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.959
 what the shit did we go on girl 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.310
 she asks 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.410
 process and change the background 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.750
 what do we provide our craftsmen 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:29.209
 scored first processed milano 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.120
 I do not understand something that it was necessary 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.640
 do with photography to achieve 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.800
 such an effect but if this photo 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.800
 We are taken and smeared by shit but would 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.840
 attractive and looked 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.349
 let's start of course with this magnificent 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.349
 background 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.110
 This is she background so changed why in such 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.900
 quality it how many times is there a squeeze 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.690
 what is this square and ended 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.140
 blur sorry of course that's so rude 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.390
 but how on it also here present that 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.030
 you see this photo for the first time 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:07.069
 what is your feeling a little 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.290
 puke wanted really well 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.560
 let's see what we have been given further 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.690
 young photographer and here I am purely by chance 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.620
 stumbled upon such a message 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.170
 listen carefully tell me good 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.109
 program to make avatars for 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.730
 group photo juice probably say the name 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.880
 will call need 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.540
 Proven programs are needed so that you can 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.819
 it was blur and so on so cherish 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.519
 asked what program is needed for this 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.299
 to make avatars for groups right away 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.859
 replied that photoshop was needed and 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.799
 then again asked the name 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.920
 photoshop that is, said to herself that 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.519
 need photoshop and immediately forgot i didn't 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.430
 I see a logical explanation for this okay 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.680
 this is not our topic go further so Sergey 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.959
 ask to put a tiger's face instead of a face 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.799
 or a wolf as I understand it when he wrote 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.760
 this request 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:09.350
 he meant something like this but him 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.510
 have done this and this 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.060
 I think there is nothing to comment here. 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.830
 everything is clear what perhaps it is time to 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.050
 this finish for the first time 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.080
 enough your we are not enough 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.090
 strengthened and not yet developed immunity to 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.230
 similar things if you liked it 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.880
