some stuff I'm working a book and
neither<00:00:07.290> do<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.589> longhand<00:00:08.160> or<00:00:08.400> Peck<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.760> out<00:00:08.880> on

neither do it longhand or Peck it out on
a<00:00:09.090> typewriter<00:00:09.660> but<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.679> would<00:00:10.830> be<00:00:10.950> great<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.250> be

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
a typewriter but it would be great to be

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.580 
a typewriter but it would be great to be
able<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.940> do<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> computer<00:00:12.780> because<00:00:13.440> you

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
able to do it on a computer because you

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.049 
able to do it on a computer because you
you<00:00:13.830> know<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:13.980> mean<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.250> there<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.880> goes

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
you know I mean it's there and it goes

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.120 
you know I mean it's there and it goes
onto<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> little<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.529> they<00:00:16.590> call<00:00:16.619> floppy

onto the little what they call floppy

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.170 
onto the little what they call floppy
disks<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.880> quality<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:19.789> would<00:00:20.789> be<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
disks this quality that would be that

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.779 
disks this quality that would be that
I'd<00:00:21.960> like<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.100> you're<00:00:23.279> ready<00:00:23.519> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the tapes seem to really work well why

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.630 
the tapes seem to really work well why
is<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.140> why<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.500> people<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.219> them<00:00:44.460> so

roles we put him on camera to explain

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.160 
roles we put him on camera to explain
this<00:00:58.079> why<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.649> works<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.100> well<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> I'd<00:01:01.020> like

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this why it works so well so I'd like

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.689 
this why it works so well so I'd like
you<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> watch<00:01:01.500> this

hi I'm chip Hopkins producer the video
professor<00:01:08.030> learning<00:01:08.360> tapes<00:01:08.570> now<00:01:09.259> I<00:01:09.289> think<00:01:09.590> the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
professor learning tapes now I think the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.319 
professor learning tapes now I think the
best<00:01:09.890> way<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.159> show<00:01:10.579> you<00:01:10.640> why<00:01:10.880> these<00:01:10.939> tapes

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
best way to show you why these tapes

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.959 
best way to show you why these tapes
work<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:11.780> well<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.530> look<00:01:12.649> at<00:01:12.829> one<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:13.759> is

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
work so well is to look at one this is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.240 
work so well is to look at one this is
just<00:01:14.210> one<00:01:14.509> of<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.990> many<00:01:15.170> visual<00:01:15.799> techniques

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
just one of the many visual techniques

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.069 
just one of the many visual techniques
we<00:01:16.490> use<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.939> make<00:01:17.090> learning<00:01:17.299> easy

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
we use to make learning easy

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.340 
we use to make learning easy
you<00:01:18.710> can't<00:01:19.009> miss<00:01:19.250> on<00:01:19.490> what's<00:01:20.119> going<00:01:20.479> on<00:01:20.720> when

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
you can't miss on what's going on when

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.139 
you can't miss on what's going on when
you<00:01:21.470> see<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.860> hands<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.429> keyboard<00:01:22.909> and

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
you see the hands on the keyboard and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.330 
you see the hands on the keyboard and
the<00:01:23.810> results<00:01:24.259> of<00:01:24.380> what<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.649> computers<00:01:25.159> doing

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
the results of what the computers doing

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.209 
the results of what the computers doing
all<00:01:25.970> on<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.569> same<00:01:26.780> screen<00:01:27.079> we<00:01:27.710> also<00:01:27.740> use

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
all on the same screen we also use

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.340 
all on the same screen we also use
animation<00:01:28.909> extensively<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.840> demonstrate

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
animation extensively to demonstrate

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.529 
animation extensively to demonstrate
concepts<00:01:31.009> that<00:01:31.219> are<00:01:31.369> hard<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.759> conceive<00:01:32.179> when

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
concepts that are hard to conceive when

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.020 
concepts that are hard to conceive when
you<00:01:32.630> hear<00:01:32.899> only<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.409> words<00:01:33.880> here's<00:01:34.880> an

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
you hear only the words here's an

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.880 
you hear only the words here's an
example<00:01:35.509> of<00:01:35.569> how<00:01:35.719> a<00:01:35.750> mouse<00:01:36.020> works<00:01:36.380> when

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
example of how a mouse works when

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.480 
example of how a mouse works when
scrolling<00:01:37.280> through<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.729> document<00:01:39.490> another

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
scrolling through a document another

scrolling through a document another
reason<00:01:40.880> why<00:01:41.000> these<00:01:41.060> tapes<00:01:41.539> work<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.020> well<00:01:42.229> is

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
reason why these tapes work so well is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.410 
reason why these tapes work so well is
when<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.009> first<00:01:43.310> started<00:01:43.640> producing<00:01:43.909> them<00:01:44.240> I

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
when I first started producing them I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.999 
when I first started producing them I
knew<00:01:44.569> nothing<00:01:44.840> about<00:01:45.110> computers

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
knew nothing about computers

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.980 
knew nothing about computers
so<00:01:46.369> therefore<00:01:46.759> I<00:01:46.819> had<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.030> work<00:01:47.270> real<00:01:47.569> hard<00:01:47.599> to

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
so therefore I had to work real hard to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.319 
so therefore I had to work real hard to
understand<00:01:48.560> this<00:01:48.709> computer<00:01:49.099> myself<00:01:49.520> but<00:01:50.149> once

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
understand this computer myself but once

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.210 
understand this computer myself but once
I<00:01:50.479> did<00:01:50.539> I<00:01:50.750> could<00:01:51.380> put<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:51.709> terms<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:52.099> you

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
I did I could put it in terms that you

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.669 
I did I could put it in terms that you
would<00:01:52.489> understand<00:01:53.000> now<00:01:53.959> let's<00:01:54.200> check<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:54.590> see

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
would understand now let's check and see

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.760 
would understand now let's check and see
how<00:01:54.770> John<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.340> Jeff<00:01:55.489> are<00:01:55.640> doing<00:01:56.770> something

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
how John and Jeff are doing something

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.100 
how John and Jeff are doing something
tells<00:01:58.099> me<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:58.729> is<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:58.939> place<00:01:59.149> price<00:01:59.479> that

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
tells me this is the place price that

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.410 
tells me this is the place price that
really<00:02:00.380> works<00:02:00.590> imagine<00:02:01.099> you're<00:02:01.640> right<00:02:01.819> we<00:02:02.209> set

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
really works imagine you're right we set

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.139 
really works imagine you're right we set
up<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:02.689> little<00:02:02.959> demonstration<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.880> show<00:02:04.909> you

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
up this little demonstration to show you
