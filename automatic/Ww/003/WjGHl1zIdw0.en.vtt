00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269 
to the Galaxy Note one I'm pretty sure

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.759 
to the Galaxy Note one I'm pretty sure
that<00:00:28.449> that<00:00:28.509> was<00:00:28.839> obvious<00:00:29.140> but<00:00:29.529> throughout

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
that that was obvious but throughout

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.810 
that that was obvious but throughout
this<00:00:29.949> video<00:00:30.189> you'll<00:00:30.339> be<00:00:30.369> saying<00:00:30.640> many

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
inches greater it's that 5.5 inches and

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.069

the<00:01:24.670> screen<00:01:24.939> resolution<00:01:25.150> is<00:01:25.659> kind<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:25.900> sad

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
the screen resolution is kind of sad

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.020 
the screen resolution is kind of sad
here<00:01:26.290> that<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.650> actually<00:01:26.979> goes<00:01:27.130> down<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.670> PPI

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
here that it actually goes down the PPI

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.330 
here that it actually goes down the PPI
therefore<00:01:28.659> also<00:01:28.930> goes<00:01:29.229> down<00:01:29.470> but<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.130> screen

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
therefore also goes down but the screen

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.370 
therefore also goes down but the screen
a<00:01:30.369> lot<00:01:30.700> down<00:01:31.150> actually<00:01:31.600> because<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.079> screens

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
a lot down actually because the screens

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.590 
a lot down actually because the screens

of course also larger with this less

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.740 
of course also larger with this less
resolution<00:01:34.960> means<00:01:35.439> a<00:01:35.680> much<00:01:36.040> lower<00:01:36.430> PPI<00:01:37.060> PPI

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750
