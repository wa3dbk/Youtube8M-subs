he<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.669> mighty<00:00:02.939> Nelson<00:00:03.540> here<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.049> today<00:00:04.740> i'm

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
he is mighty Nelson here and today i'm

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.530 
he is mighty Nelson here and today i'm
talking<00:00:05.100> about<00:00:05.339> metabolic<00:00:06.140> flexibility<00:00:07.140> and

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
talking about metabolic flexibility and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.820 
talking about metabolic flexibility and
ideal<00:00:09.540> ways<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.410> train<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:12.210> use<00:00:12.420> of

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
ideal ways to train and the use of

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.010 
ideal ways to train and the use of
carbohydrates<00:00:13.940> so<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.059> previous<00:00:15.210> video<00:00:15.570> I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
carbohydrates so in the previous video I

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.670 
carbohydrates so in the previous video I
talked<00:00:16.379> about<00:00:16.500> how<00:00:17.100> insulin<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.410> helpful<00:00:19.410> with

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
talked about how insulin is helpful with

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.120 
talked about how insulin is helpful with
the<00:00:19.890> fuel<00:00:20.340> selector<00:00:20.850> switch<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.439> low<00:00:22.710> levels

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the fuel selector switch so low levels

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.460 
the fuel selector switch so low levels
of<00:00:23.250> insulin<00:00:23.430> will<00:00:23.910> push<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.630> body<00:00:24.810> towards

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
of insulin will push the body towards

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.029 
of insulin will push the body towards
using<00:00:25.710> fats<00:00:26.630> higher<00:00:27.630> levels<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.170> insulin<00:00:28.349> will

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
using fats higher levels of insulin will

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.299 
using fats higher levels of insulin will
push<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> body<00:00:29.880> towards<00:00:30.740> carbohydrate<00:00:31.740> use

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
push the body towards carbohydrate use

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.049 
push the body towards carbohydrate use
and<00:00:33.110> metabolic<00:00:34.110> flexibility<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.640> using

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
and metabolic flexibility we as using

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.920 
and metabolic flexibility we as using
the<00:00:36.180> right<00:00:36.360> fuel<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.370> time<00:00:38.930> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the right fuel at the right time so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.500 
the right fuel at the right time so
today<00:00:40.230> we're<00:00:40.410> talking<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.969> effects<00:00:42.239> of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
today we're talking about the effects of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.040 
today we're talking about the effects of
training<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:44.160> carbohydrates<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
training and the carbohydrates so if you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.940 
training and the carbohydrates so if you
look<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.559> basic<00:00:47.489> bio<00:00:47.930> energetics<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.320> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
look at just basic bio energetics if you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.630 
look at just basic bio energetics if you
want<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.760> maximum<00:00:51.539> output<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.190> gym

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
want to do the maximum output in the gym

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
want to do the maximum output in the gym
so<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> assuming<00:00:54.840> we're<00:00:55.170> doing<00:00:55.379> some

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
so this is assuming we're doing some

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.819 
so this is assuming we're doing some
type<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> weight<00:00:56.489> lifting<00:00:56.879> exercise<00:00:57.710> which<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
type of weight lifting exercise which is

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.160 
type of weight lifting exercise which is
really<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.250> obviously<00:00:59.489> to<00:01:00.059> add<00:01:00.510> muscle<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
really good obviously to add muscle and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.549 
really good obviously to add muscle and
also<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.590> burn<00:01:01.770> fat<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
also to burn fat so do that to get the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.450 
also to burn fat so do that to get the
highest<00:01:04.799> level<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:06.210> need<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.720> use

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
highest level out we need to use

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
highest level out we need to use
carbohydrates<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:09.180> anyone<00:01:09.570> has<00:01:09.600> tried<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> very

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
carbohydrates if anyone has tried a very

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.850 
carbohydrates if anyone has tried a very
low<00:01:11.210> carbohydrate<00:01:12.210> diet<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.140> initially<00:01:13.500> while

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
low carbohydrate diet so initially while

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.130 
low carbohydrate diet so initially while
your<00:01:13.979> body<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.460> adapting<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.299> usually<00:01:15.810> don't

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
your body is adapting I usually don't

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.010 
your body is adapting I usually don't
feel<00:01:16.860> very<00:01:16.920> good<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.840> other

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
feel very good which is for other

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.820 
feel very good which is for other
reasons<00:01:19.610> but<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> simplest<00:01:21.270> level

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
reasons but it's the simplest level

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
reasons but it's the simplest level
carbohydrates<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.759> drives<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.689> body's

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
carbohydrates are what drives the body's

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.800 
carbohydrates are what drives the body's
ability<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.920> maximum<00:01:26.580> amount<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:27.210> work

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
ability to do the maximum amount of work

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.609 
ability to do the maximum amount of work
so<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.159> cannot<00:01:29.549> use<00:01:30.119> carbohydrates<00:01:30.930> your

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
so if you cannot use carbohydrates your

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.999 
so if you cannot use carbohydrates your
ability<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:33.079> high-capacity<00:01:34.079> work<00:01:34.320> will<00:01:34.770> be

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
ability to do high-capacity work will be

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.109 
ability to do high-capacity work will be
inhibited<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.409> look<00:01:37.590> at

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
inhibited and we can actually look at

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.399 
inhibited and we can actually look at
pathophysiology<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.780> group<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.170> patients

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
pathophysiology at a group of patients

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
pathophysiology at a group of patients
who<00:01:40.890> are<00:01:41.430> not<00:01:42.150> able<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.079> use<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.619> glycogen<00:01:44.220> they

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
who are not able to use a glycogen they

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.179 
who are not able to use a glycogen they
have<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> disease<00:01:45.540> called<00:01:46.079> mcardle's<00:01:46.770> disease

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
have a disease called mcardle's disease

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.469 
have a disease called mcardle's disease
and<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:49.500> impairs<00:01:50.040> their<00:01:50.310> body's<00:01:50.850> ability<00:01:51.180> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and it impairs their body's ability to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.679 
and it impairs their body's ability to
use<00:01:51.979> carbohydrates<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.119> find<00:01:54.360> in

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
use carbohydrates and what we find in

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.660 
use carbohydrates and what we find in
that<00:01:54.810> group<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> people<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.460> their

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that group of people is that their

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.780 
that group of people is that their
ability<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.590> hi<00:01:58.590> outputs<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.189> work<00:01:59.460> is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
ability to do hi outputs of work is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.200 
ability to do hi outputs of work is
really<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:01.079> very<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.670> they<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.880> enjoy<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
really not very good they don't enjoy it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.350 
really not very good they don't enjoy it
not<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> lot<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.229> fun<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.909> can't<00:02:06.119> get

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
not a lot of fun and they just can't get

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.520 
not a lot of fun and they just can't get
to<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:07.849> sort<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> sprint<00:02:09.810> so

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to do sort of like a sprint so

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.160 
to do sort of like a sprint so
or<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.950> know<00:02:10.979> lower<00:02:11.310> Reb<00:02:11.640> sets<00:02:11.970> or<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:13.020> know

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
or you know lower Reb sets or you know

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.160 
or you know lower Reb sets or you know
very<00:02:13.410> high<00:02:13.740> output<00:02:14.010> type<00:02:14.520> stuff<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.930> gym

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
very high output type stuff in the gym

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.680 
very high output type stuff in the gym
so<00:02:17.010> that's<00:02:17.190> some<00:02:17.370> evidence<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.880> show<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so that's some evidence to show that the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.320 
so that's some evidence to show that the
use<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.950> carbohydrates<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.330> absolutely

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
use of carbohydrates is absolutely

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.230 
use of carbohydrates is absolutely
essential<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.500> want<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.890> perform<00:02:23.310> as<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
essential if we want to perform as the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.210 
essential if we want to perform as the
highest<00:02:24.420> level<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.650> even<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:25.920> your<00:02:26.040> goal<00:02:26.190> is

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
highest level so even if your goal is

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.090 
highest level so even if your goal is
fat<00:02:26.580> lot<00:02:26.850> when<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.750> go<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.110> gym<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.800> still

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
fat lot when you go to the gym you still

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.979 
fat lot when you go to the gym you still
want<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.580> able<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:30.060> perform<00:02:30.569> at<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.840> high

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
want to be able to perform at a high

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.770 
want to be able to perform at a high
level<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.010> can<00:02:32.220> do<00:02:32.459> as<00:02:32.880> much<00:02:33.209> work<00:02:33.480> as

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
level so you can do as much work as

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.309 
level so you can do as much work as
possible<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:36.209> when<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.450> train<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:36.900> want<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.230> be

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
possible so when we train we want to be

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.490 
possible so when we train we want to be
able<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.739> use<00:02:38.060> carbohydrates<00:02:39.060> effectively<00:02:39.840> so

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
able to use carbohydrates effectively so

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.870 
able to use carbohydrates effectively so
during<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.830> day<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:41.220> raising<00:02:41.459> fat

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
during the day if we raising fat

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.990 
during the day if we raising fat
effectively<00:02:42.540> let<00:02:43.080> me<00:02:43.170> go<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.920> gym<00:02:44.130> we<00:02:44.760> want

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
effectively let me go to the gym we want

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.350 
effectively let me go to the gym we want
to<00:02:45.120> be<00:02:45.239> able<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.720> switch<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:47.040> use

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
to be able to switch to use

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.259 
to be able to switch to use
carbohydrates<00:02:48.360> at<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:49.230> time<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.940> one<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
carbohydrates at that time so one of the

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.780 
carbohydrates at that time so one of the
things<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.570> can<00:02:51.810> try<00:02:51.989> out<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.620> having<00:02:53.580> some

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
things you can try out is having some

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.650 
things you can try out is having some

user recommend that people try this out

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.160 
user recommend that people try this out
first<00:03:04.769> thing<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.459> morning<00:03:06.050> everyone<00:03:07.050> will

have a little bit different response to

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.250 
have a little bit different response to

with<00:03:13.620> most<00:03:14.160> people<00:03:14.579> do<00:03:15.090> better<00:03:15.690> with<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
with most people do better with the

hand and people are using a protein and
carbohydrate<00:03:27.570> shake<00:03:27.870> I'll<00:03:28.769> probably<00:03:29.010> run<00:03:29.280> an

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
carbohydrate shake I'll probably run an

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.789 
carbohydrate shake I'll probably run an
hour<00:03:29.579> before<00:03:30.150> or<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:31.260> you're<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> little<00:03:31.680> bit

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
hour before or if you're a little bit

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.009 
hour before or if you're a little bit
unsure<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.850> have<00:03:33.120> half<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.780> an<00:03:33.900> hour

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
unsure can have half of it an hour

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.319 
unsure can have half of it an hour
before<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.890> then<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.459> sip<00:03:35.910> on<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.209> other

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
before and then just a sip on the other

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.259 
before and then just a sip on the other
half<00:03:36.570> during<00:03:36.959> your<00:03:37.350> training<00:03:37.590> session<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:39.239> we

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
half during your training session so we

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.150 
half during your training session so we
know<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.510> proteins<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.350> some<00:03:40.530> degree<00:03:40.680> and

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
know that proteins to some degree and

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.819 
know that proteins to some degree and
also<00:03:41.700> carbohydrates<00:03:42.450> will<00:03:43.170> promote<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
also carbohydrates will promote the

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.759 
also carbohydrates will promote the
release<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.459> insulin<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.329> body<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.900> that

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
release of insulin in the body and that

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.520 
release of insulin in the body and that
will<00:03:46.920> also<00:03:47.100> drive<00:03:47.970> us<00:03:48.239> towards<00:03:48.810> using<00:03:49.109> this

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
will also drive us towards using this

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.599 
will also drive us towards using this
more<00:03:50.180> carbohydrates<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:52.410> today's<00:03:52.739> tip<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.340> you

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
more carbohydrates so today's tip if you

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.400 
more carbohydrates so today's tip if you
want<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.880> get<00:03:53.940> out<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.299> highest<00:03:54.870> performance

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
want to get out the highest performance

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.580 
want to get out the highest performance
possible<00:03:55.980> your<00:03:56.880> body<00:03:57.150> has<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.630> be<00:03:58.019> able<00:03:58.079> to

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
possible your body has to be able to

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.870 
possible your body has to be able to
access<00:03:59.810> carbohydrates<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.140> gym<00:04:01.670> so<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> lot

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
access carbohydrates in the gym so a lot

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.910 
access carbohydrates in the gym so a lot
of<00:04:02.910> times<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.390> candy<00:04:03.720> from<00:04:03.750> their<00:04:04.079> stored

version and the liver and muscles or
just<00:04:07.140> glycogen<00:04:07.820> or<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.970> can<00:04:09.120> also<00:04:09.299> try<00:04:09.630> adding

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
just glycogen or you can also try adding

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.720 
just glycogen or you can also try adding
in<00:04:10.910> protein<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.049> carbohydrate<00:04:13.049> either<00:04:13.320> meal

or some type of shake before training

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.630 
or some type of shake before training
again<00:04:18.479> just<00:04:18.720> try<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.169> out<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.859> let<00:04:20.489> me<00:04:20.609> know

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
again just try that out and let me know

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.770 
again just try that out and let me know
how<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:21.060> goes
