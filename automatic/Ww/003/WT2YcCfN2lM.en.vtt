00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
so be careful if you get this phone and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.630 
so be careful if you get this phone and
that's<00:00:46.710> pretty<00:00:46.890> much<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> first<00:00:47.250> thing<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that's pretty much the first thing you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
that's pretty much the first thing you
see<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.090> pretty<00:00:48.270> nice<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.800> doesn't

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
see it's pretty nice actually doesn't

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.069 
see it's pretty nice actually doesn't
look<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.430> big<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.090> thought<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.480> would<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
look as big as I thought it would be the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.860 
look as big as I thought it would be the
back<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.649> has<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.129> nice<00:00:53.340> matte<00:00:53.850> black<00:00:54.210> finish<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
back it has a nice matte black finish to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.680 
back it has a nice matte black finish to
it<00:00:54.899> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> rubbery<00:00:56.190> texture<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.969> well<00:00:57.000> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it kind of a rubbery texture as well so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.330 
it kind of a rubbery texture as well so
that<00:00:57.870> feels<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:58.649> might<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.039> give

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that feels like they might actually give

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.160 
that feels like they might actually give
some<00:00:59.489> good<00:00:59.640> grip<00:00:59.910> let's<00:01:00.480> continue<00:01:00.750> along<00:01:00.960> with

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
some good grip let's continue along with

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170 
some good grip let's continue along with
the<00:01:01.260> box<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.770> organ<00:01:02.280> pretty<00:01:02.489> much<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.969> is

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the box and organ pretty much get is

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
the box and organ pretty much get is
just<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:03.930> charging<00:01:04.320> cable<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
just your charging cable and this is a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.859 
just your charging cable and this is a
standard<00:01:05.640> charging<00:01:06.119> cable<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.570> actually

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
standard charging cable it's actually

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.530 
standard charging cable it's actually
not<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> USB<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.950> e<00:01:07.979> charging<00:01:08.460> adapter<00:01:09.030> it's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
not a USB to e charging adapter it's

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.929 
not a USB to e charging adapter it's
just<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.900> standalone<00:01:10.350> cable<00:01:10.860> itself<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.640> then

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
just a standalone cable itself and then

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.300 
just a standalone cable itself and then
you<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.240> some<00:01:12.510> manuals<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> start<00:01:13.799> guide<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
you get some manuals and start guide and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.740 
you get some manuals and start guide and
that's<00:01:14.549> pretty<00:01:14.700> much<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.479> let's<00:01:15.600> take<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that's pretty much it so let's take a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.210 
that's pretty much it so let's take a
closer<00:01:16.020> look<00:01:16.140> at<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> phone<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> first

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
and I was expecting it to be a little

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.970 
and I was expecting it to be a little
bit<00:03:20.850> bigger<00:03:21.209> for<00:03:21.359> a<00:03:21.600> 5-inch<00:03:22.019> display<00:03:22.109> but<00:03:22.890> of

bit bigger for a 5-inch display but of

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.440 
bit bigger for a 5-inch display but of
course<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.519> because<00:03:23.850> I'm<00:03:24.000> coming<00:03:24.299> from

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
course that is because I'm coming from

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.020 
course that is because I'm coming from
the<00:03:24.600> note<00:03:24.780> 3<00:03:25.109> which<00:03:25.320> has<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.620> 5.7<00:03:26.489> inch<00:03:26.579> display

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and this phone pretty much just doors

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.349 
and this phone pretty much just doors
over<00:03:29.310> everything<00:03:29.790> else<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.209> it's

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
over everything else so it's

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.090 
over everything else so it's
understandable<00:03:30.540> why<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.350> would<00:03:31.680> think<00:03:31.859> this

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
understandable why I would think this

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.410 
understandable why I would think this
for<00:03:32.280> would<00:03:32.459> have<00:03:32.549> been<00:03:32.700> bigger<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.239> now<00:03:33.359> the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
