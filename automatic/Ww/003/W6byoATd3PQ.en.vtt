saw him really embrace the moment and

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.010 
saw him really embrace the moment and
then<00:00:28.640> we<00:00:28.760> were<00:00:28.910> sitting<00:00:29.210> at<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.330> table<00:00:29.539> all<00:00:29.840> up

so<00:00:30.080> we're<00:00:30.289> talking<00:00:30.680> but<00:00:30.770> he<00:00:30.890> was<00:00:31.039> quiet<00:00:31.310> and<00:00:31.580> he

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
so we're talking but he was quiet and he

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.459 
so we're talking but he was quiet and he
just<00:00:32.239> kept<00:00:32.480> putting<00:00:32.689> his<00:00:32.839> head<00:00:32.989> down<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.350> I

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
just kept putting his head down and I

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.549 
just kept putting his head down and I
kept<00:00:33.710> saying<00:00:33.949> are<00:00:34.069> you<00:00:34.190> alright<00:00:34.609> he<00:00:34.850> was<00:00:34.969> like
