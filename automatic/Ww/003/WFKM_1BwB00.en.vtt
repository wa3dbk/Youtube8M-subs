00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.460
 Luis Guillermo Calvo greets manager 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:17.130
 of six hands and allows me to introduce you 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:21.670
 today our series of old windows 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.520
 These are composed of glass panes 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.830
 new plastic and polycarbonate but 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.890
 glass sheets ranging from 20 to 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.239
 46 millimeters thick they're going to 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.800
 allow to stop the projectile of a weapon 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.170
 depending on the moons and the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.050
 thickness will do the resistance to 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.170
 projectile in this case we have here a 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.450
 window against ak-47 that is made up of 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.350
 eight moons or crystals that are glued 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.170
 characteristics to the crystal is that never 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.770
 will be lowered or damaged by the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.410
 sun the function of these moons is that the 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.800
 first absorb the lead of the projectile 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.050
 and they slow down their inertia or their energy and 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.010
 remaining wings 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.670
 stop 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.620
 the projectile and prevent it from penetrating all 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.420
 our series of windows will be with 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.870
 an old frame the same caliber 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.710
 all in stainless steel finish 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.430
 solid 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.830
 they can be in different sizes and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.640
 dimensions just as I explained them 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.850
 in different levels of resistance to 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.030
 the bullets in this case is all there 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.330
 our family of armored windows 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.950
 we can observe them and get in 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.649
 our destroyer to a republic of 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.990
 panama not home strong for 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.960
 information on this product and many 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:53.090
 more than ceim can visit the page 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:58.539
 of new safes that is www1 point 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.539
 no to puntocom safes thanks
