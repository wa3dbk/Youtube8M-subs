00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.550 

the<00:00:45.240> idea<00:00:45.450> was<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:46.020> medieval<00:00:46.500> art

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
the idea was that in medieval art

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.170 
the idea was that in medieval art
there's<00:00:47.070> lots<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> color<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.610> lots<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.970> things

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
there's lots of color and lots of things

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
there's lots of color and lots of things
to<00:00:48.330> look<00:00:48.450> at<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:48.960> also<00:00:49.110> very<00:00:49.320> flat<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
to look at and it's also very flat and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.800 
to look at and it's also very flat and
there's<00:00:50.040> no<00:00:50.130> point<00:00:50.400> of<00:00:50.520> focus<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> for

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
there's no point of focus so that for

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.850 
there's no point of focus so that for
most<00:00:51.990> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> movie<00:00:52.290> that's<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.770> we

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
most of the movie that's what we

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
most of the movie that's what we
considered<00:00:53.310> safe<00:00:53.580> very<00:00:53.970> colorful<00:00:54.480> flat

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
considered safe very colorful flat

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.200 
considered safe very colorful flat
that's<00:00:55.140> safe<00:00:55.380> and<00:00:55.710> happy<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.190> good<00:00:56.640> times<00:00:56.850> and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that's safe and happy and good times and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420 
that's safe and happy and good times and
then<00:00:57.990> whenever<00:00:58.230> there's<00:00:58.500> danger<00:00:58.860> we<00:00:59.100> pull<00:00:59.310> all

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
then whenever there's danger we pull all

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
then whenever there's danger we pull all
the<00:00:59.580> coal<00:00:59.730> arrive<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.720> like<00:01:00.900> in<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the coal arrive and then like in the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.320 
the coal arrive and then like in the
attack<00:01:01.380> it's<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.770> red<00:01:01.950> white<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> black<00:01:02.730> so

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
attack it's just red white and black so

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.570 
attack it's just red white and black so
we<00:01:03.450> tried<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> make<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.050> that<00:01:04.230> lack<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.220> color

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
we tried to make it that lack of color

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.180 
we tried to make it that lack of color
and<00:01:05.880> perspective<00:01:06.690> was<00:01:06.840> bad<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.380> lots<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
and perspective was bad and lots of

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.730 
and perspective was bad and lots of
color<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.520> lots<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.910> detail<00:01:09.270> was<00:01:09.930> safe<00:01:10.470> so

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
color and lots of detail was safe so

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.719 
color and lots of detail was safe so
that<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> approach

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.569 

in<00:01:15.270> terms<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> style<00:01:16.320> yeah<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.649> mean<00:01:16.890> we're

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
in terms of the style yeah I mean we're

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.800 
in terms of the style yeah I mean we're
Irish<00:01:17.789> and<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.240> were<00:01:18.299> trying<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.539> make<00:01:18.689> an

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
Irish and we were trying to make an

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.139 
Irish and we were trying to make an
Irish<00:01:18.930> animated<00:01:19.469> movie<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.060> we<00:01:21.060> were

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
Irish animated movie and we were

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.670 
Irish animated movie and we were
inspired<00:01:21.390> by<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> idea<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.170> using<00:01:22.350> like

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
inspired by the idea of using like

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.550 
inspired by the idea of using like
indigenous<00:01:23.189> Irish<00:01:23.490> art<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.289> to<00:01:25.289> as<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
indigenous Irish art to to as a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
indigenous Irish art to to as a
reference<00:01:25.979> starting<00:01:26.369> point<00:01:26.579> and<00:01:27.210> indeed<00:01:27.539> ei

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
reference starting point and indeed ei

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.749 
reference starting point and indeed ei
had<00:01:27.929> a<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.469> of<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.619> passion<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.070> medieval<00:01:29.610> art

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
had a kind of a passion for medieval art

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.639 
had a kind of a passion for medieval art
and<00:01:29.939> he<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.149> quite<00:01:30.270> inspired<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.899> push<00:01:31.470> it

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
and he was quite inspired to push it

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.130 
and he was quite inspired to push it
even<00:01:31.740> further<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.729> also<00:01:33.060> wanted<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
even further so we also wanted to be a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.569 
even further so we also wanted to be a
little<00:01:34.350> bit<00:01:34.500> more<00:01:34.649> authentic<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:35.399> it<00:01:35.490> was

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
little bit more authentic like it was

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
little bit more authentic like it was
very<00:01:35.759> important<00:01:36.179> to<00:01:36.210> us<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.569> accidents

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
very important to us that the accidents

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
very important to us that the accidents
were<00:01:37.020> real<00:01:37.289> Irish<00:01:37.619> accents<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.460> least<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.819> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
were real Irish accents at least in the
