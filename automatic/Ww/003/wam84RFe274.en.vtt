in<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.390> I've<00:02:13.900> actually<00:02:14.140> basted<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.070> outside

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
in and I've actually basted the outside

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.790 
in and I've actually basted the outside
with<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> gob<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.510> nectar<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.500> we're<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.740> to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
with a gob a nectar so we're going to

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.320 
with a gob a nectar so we're going to
see<00:02:17.950> how<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.250> turns<00:02:18.490> out<00:02:18.670> today<00:02:18.820> in<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.210> a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
see how that turns out today in just a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.290 
see how that turns out today in just a
few<00:02:19.510> hours<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.850> big<00:02:22.090> difference

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
few hours and so the big difference

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.260 
few hours and so the big difference
between<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.990> standard<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.640> even<00:02:24.940> though<00:02:25.060> the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
between a standard and even though the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.360 
between a standard and even though the
