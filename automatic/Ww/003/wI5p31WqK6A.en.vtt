00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.559
 greets you to the new technique tutorial 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.220
 today it's about the topic of biceps 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.720
 training the dumbbells us 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.790
 as I said many different 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.530
 methods i'll just show you now 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.290
 an exercise that has established itself 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.150
 namely the hammer curls with the 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.850
 okay, dumb the only thing 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.500
 need two dumbbells and im 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.540
 end effect your body weight the exercise 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.470
 You can do it at home or in the 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.090
 fitness studio 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.460
 Here it was important again if you have the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.770
 want to achieve biceps isolation 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.829
 that the elbow stops and 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.470
 do not wiggle back and forth , I said 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.680
 short time before with the exercise weight so 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.440
 huftbreit on the buttocks 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.920
 maximum together she tenses abdominal muscle 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.510
 maximum hang on arms loose 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.270
 shoulder blades pull back so 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.820
 that is the basic position and now without 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.370
 that the elbow is moving is the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.250
 forearm in the hammer in the handle after 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:12.310
 top drive to the maximum contraction 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:17.680
 and solve slowly as it and 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:22.810
 slowly release and slowly 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.950
 solve again and slowly you solve 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.130
 breathe out and down 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.130
 you one 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.830
 important is that the tank is not 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.320
 Moves the spine does not move 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.300
 and you stay completely fixed when you 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.070
 Start with the upper body up here 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.690
 wiggle or wiggle it with your hip 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.330
 is a sign that the weight is too high 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.850
 it could be okay that's why you have to 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.320
 screw down the ego 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.030
 rather less weight in the summer 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.470
 isolated outside meets apps work as 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.330
 the duo work out of the shoulder 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.070
 go to the front you make out of 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.200
 SchrÃ¶der the movement and not from the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.549
 biceps see you soon in the exercise 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.869
 set with the right weight 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:08.470
 equal yes who comes back to the exercise 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.250
 set again with the hammer curls one 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.509
 dumbbells 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.800
 I have a weight now 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.300
 pick out something about both 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.160
 Training weight is when you 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.310
 you want to train muscle building 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.140
 you can do between 6 and 15 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.150
 Repeat is six to eight 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.830
 viable again 615 feasible 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.530
 repetition and clean execution 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.560
 Of course, important parents remain fixed 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.209
 and hull stays under tension you go 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.090
 straight down with straight back brought 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.490
 court up now to me times the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.290
 variant in the default step is also a 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.000
 possibility 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.030
 high voltage this tension tree 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.170
 tension and now as I said only 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.170
 including armin upstairs 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:03:16.590
 12 fixed it is maximum one more 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.590
 with me then I was to become ours 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.760
 settle clean and breathe deeply 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.290
 Thanks for watching, we'll see each other 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.290
 Next technique tutorial is one
