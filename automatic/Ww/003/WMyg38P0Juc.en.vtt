00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.250
 friends before simon here Saturday from 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.260
 lehman day today such a little knowledge 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.559
 video on the subject of supplements on the topic 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.990
 casein you know that there are so 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.940
 Two casein varieties once with sari 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.369
 casein and once the calcium kassel 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.680
 today a little bit which is better 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.000
 which better suitable you know 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.830
 maybe if a shop knows him 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 you already know my opinion 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.470
 I would say both quite well though 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.150
 no matter why 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.500
 maybe both are in the shop 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.950
 somewhere right next to my head 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.200
 it emerged both varieties 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.809
 maybe anticipate shortly or so 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.210
 you probably know there are two 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 kinds of proteins so all the way 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 happy said quite simply, there are so 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.750
 that the whey protein or the fast 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.059
 available proteins that are good for 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.160
 for after training for the morning where that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.640
 protein is quickly available for 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 the body 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 and then there are the slow ones 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.629
 digestible proteins are mostly 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.210
 casseroles or casein mixtures which 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.360
 simply slow down your amino acids into 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.580
 Therefore, blood gives off casein super vorm 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.130
 sleep or something in between 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 where we just take longer time the body 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.479
 possible with the protein building blocks 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.430
 can provide but what casein is 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.229
 because now only better so im 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.630
 German-speaking in the European 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.470
 there was until recently or until 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.040
 a few years ago actually 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.990
 mainly kite juncker senate and im 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.520
 American area and the whole 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.110
 Supplements come here now handed it over 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.750
 actually mainly with solaris 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.670
 casein and of that very little because 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.049
 which mainly use which way 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.540
 better maybe so soon 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.280
 differences I do not want to because 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 scientifically approached calcium k 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.420
 Senat is easy so you take 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.990
 practically ticking cow milk, or that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.079
 the cow's milk protein and trend in the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.580
 Cow's milk is practically 20 way and 80 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.820
 percent coffee 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.460
 and this is separated by means of acid 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.040
 treatment and by means of heat one separates 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.900
 again from each other and contains or 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.170
 duck and get practically the pure 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.600
 many then say the proteins 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.140
 are a bit denatured and are 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.850
 not so biologically high quality me 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.410
 do not really believe it at the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.430
 You have to find new methods there 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.750
 really do not worry so 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.750
 really a good protein 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.310
 You can also see the values 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.840
 Calcium carbonate products are very 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.790
 very good because we really that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.310
 the whale have separated and the pure one 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.420
 The values are very high 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.430
 very good we have very high 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.620
 Protein content we have very very little 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.330
 fat and very little carbs so 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.420
 actually peaks from the values ​​protein 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.060
 while with solar casein it is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.270
 so that there is this milk protein 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.300
 really yes there already practical 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.560
 if you eat processed that is called 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.190
 we have casein at the missionary 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.640
 actually 80 percent casein and 20 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.280
 percent 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.739
 that's why the values ​​are not so good 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.950
 or usually not as perfect as at 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.360
 The calcium senate for it is easy 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.060
 high quality organic from the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.560
 Body better available but also say 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.080
 most i do not believe that 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.750
 I will find difference 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.769
 both good I think I do not know 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.269
 why because the production actually 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.220
 The calcium is more expensive anyway 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.780
 cashed cheaper that is so 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.140
 advantage of calcium cassettes with 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.480
 I find solaris protein better because 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.220
 the whole lumps in there so like 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.690
 said it is not that processed and 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.190
 it is a bit flakier one 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.890
 a bit lumpy tastes a bit 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.620
 after semolina I think it's delicious 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.450
 So casseroles are so I think so 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.610
 Tastiest egg white varieties are beautiful 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.380
 frothy will taste nice creamy 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.340
 absolutely brilliant the multi-component 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.379
 Proteins are usually in there 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.060
 especially the heart in the casino has 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.640
 That's why I give you a tip if you 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.709
 you can take casein both 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.379
 Both are top, just try them 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.810
 Super taste super satiate 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.599
 long help you on your protein intake 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.120
 to come therefore clearer from me 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.549
 For both you can try it 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.709
 absolutely top top products today by 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.209
 me that was it so far subscribed to the 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.010
 I'm looking forward to the next one 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.150
 tests is a lot of testing comes back 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.980
 many new things in 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.980
 See you next time I'm out
