because of your size relationship I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
because of your size relationship I
didn't<00:02:33.810> think<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.049> because<00:02:34.379> like<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.219> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
didn't think so because like in the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.860 
didn't think so because like in the
practice<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.819> was<00:02:35.969> having<00:02:36.239> trouble<00:02:36.359> with<00:02:36.689> some

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
practice I was having trouble with some

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.569 
practice I was having trouble with some
of<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.049> Dinos<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.890> girls<00:02:38.040> shorter<00:02:38.459> than

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
of the Dinos and the girls shorter than

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.720 
of the Dinos and the girls shorter than
me<00:02:38.730> were<00:02:38.939> doing<00:02:39.209> them<00:02:39.329> easily<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.700> yeah<00:02:41.700> I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
me were doing them easily so yeah I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.459 
me were doing them easily so yeah I
don't<00:02:41.939> think<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.900> really<00:02:43.200> made<00:02:43.439> a

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
don't think it it really made a

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.500 
don't think it it really made a
difference<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:44.280> think<00:02:44.609> it<00:02:44.700> came<00:02:44.879> down<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.269> just

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
difference I think it came down to just

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.420 
difference I think it came down to just
powering<00:02:46.409> through<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.769> moves<00:02:46.980> at<00:02:47.189> the<00:02:47.310> end

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
powering through the moves at the end

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.089 
powering through the moves at the end
having<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.939> strength<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.599> just<00:02:49.530> going<00:02:49.829> for

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
having the strength and just going for

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.149

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
it's 21 foot radius here at 21 for

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.480 
it's 21 foot radius here at 21 for
radius<00:06:17.080> here<00:06:17.259> and<00:06:17.409> the<00:06:17.469> 18<00:06:17.860> foot<00:06:18.069> radius<00:06:18.370> in

radius here and the 18 foot radius in
the<00:06:18.550> middle<00:06:18.819> so<00:06:19.419> it's<00:06:19.659> the<00:06:19.990> reason<00:06:20.379> for<00:06:20.590> that

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
the middle so it's the reason for that

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.730 
the middle so it's the reason for that
is<00:06:20.979> there<00:06:21.879> these<00:06:22.719> motocross<00:06:23.199> ramps<00:06:23.560> have<00:06:23.650> a

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
is there these motocross ramps have a

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.680 
is there these motocross ramps have a
little<00:06:23.919> pocket<00:06:24.129> in<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.520> middle<00:06:24.550> of<00:06:24.849> them<00:06:24.969> and

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
little pocket in the middle of them and

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.140 
little pocket in the middle of them and
it<00:06:26.960> creates<00:06:27.410> the<00:06:28.130> compression<00:06:28.700> of<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:28.820> shocks

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
it creates the compression of the shocks

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.390 
it creates the compression of the shocks
