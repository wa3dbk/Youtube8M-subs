and the lowercase together in order to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.600 
and the lowercase together in order to
reinforce<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:46.170> those<00:01:46.920> connections<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:49.610> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
reinforce that those connections the the

then<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.030> race

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.930
