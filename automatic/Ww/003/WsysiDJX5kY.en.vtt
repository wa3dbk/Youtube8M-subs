reading<00:04:53.360> it's<00:04:53.930> probably<00:04:54.590> just<00:04:54.860> broken<00:04:55.370> there

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:55.939 
reading it's probably just broken there

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.999 
reading it's probably just broken there
should<00:04:56.270> be<00:04:56.419> a<00:04:56.449> spare<00:04:56.900> one<00:04:57.139> in<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.379> supply<00:04:57.740> Bay

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
should be a spare one in the supply Bay

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.429 
should be a spare one in the supply Bay
and<00:04:58.340> what<00:04:58.580> do<00:04:58.669> we<00:04:58.789> do<00:04:58.969> if<00:04:59.120> it's<00:04:59.300> not<00:04:59.389> broken<00:04:59.960> I'm

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:00.439 
and what do we do if it's not broken I'm

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.889 
and what do we do if it's not broken I'm
not<00:05:00.590> sure
