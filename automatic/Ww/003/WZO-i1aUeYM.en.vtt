for<00:02:09.750> defense<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.110> lot<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.379> people

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
for defense a lot of people

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.100 
for defense a lot of people
getting<00:02:10.799> more<00:02:10.920> scared<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.720> eight<00:02:12.870> hours

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
getting more scared but it's eight hours

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.440 
getting more scared but it's eight hours
now<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.290> then<00:02:13.650> flamethrower<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.610> scorcher

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
now and then flamethrower and scorcher

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.170 
now and then flamethrower and scorcher
burn<00:02:15.900> damage<00:02:16.260> increase<00:02:17.010> from<00:02:17.340> plus<00:02:17.670> dammit

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180

statue<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.750> I'm<00:02:18.840> surprised<00:02:19.110> didn't<00:02:19.379> hit<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
statue so I'm surprised didn't hit the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.170 
statue so I'm surprised didn't hit the
scorchers<00:02:20.040> at<00:02:20.189> all<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.519> can<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.970> why<00:02:21.120> with

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
scorchers at all but I can see why with

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.149 
scorchers at all but I can see why with
all<00:02:21.390> these<00:02:21.540> new<00:02:21.599> defenses<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.739> their<00:02:22.950> burn

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
all these new defenses what their burn

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.399 
all these new defenses what their burn
damage<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:24.150> increased<00:02:24.480> now<00:02:24.750> with<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.019> statute

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
damage is increased now with the statute

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.949 
damage is increased now with the statute
power<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:25.860> well<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.220> that's<00:02:26.280> pretty<00:02:26.519> sweet

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
power as well so that's pretty sweet

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.170 
power as well so that's pretty sweet
then<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.079> victory<00:02:28.590> reward<00:02:29.340> boat<00:02:29.640> comes<00:02:30.000> at

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
then the victory reward boat comes at

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.690 
then the victory reward boat comes at
6am<00:02:30.659> when<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.470> days<00:02:31.680> when<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> event<00:02:32.430> starts

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
6am when the days when the event starts

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.250 
6am when the days when the event starts
so<00:02:33.090> that's<00:02:33.239> pretty<00:02:33.420> sweet<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:33.959> reduce

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
so that's pretty sweet and then reduce

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.750 
so that's pretty sweet and then reduce
camera<00:02:34.530> shake<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.250> ground<00:02:35.489> here<00:02:35.670> is

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
camera shake in the ground here is

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.250 
camera shake in the ground here is
explosion<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:36.420> that's<00:02:36.599> going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.840> all<00:02:37.109> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
explosion so that's going to be all the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.699 
explosion so that's going to be all the
