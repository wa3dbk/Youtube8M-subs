00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.330
 of creative sales advice in the 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.700
 customer service issue and today I want 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.849
 talk about a topic for others 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.590
 interesting the five big annoyances 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.560
 of the client when he calls us 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.689
 phone and how to avoid them of course 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.980
 knew that although the customer 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.880
 by email 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.739
 by chat or web is growing 85% of 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.360
 Clients still prefer attention 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.490
 by phone 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.210
 you know that every call that the 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.129
 company is a business opportunity 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.350
 you knew that a call can be the 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.340
 first and last time a client 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.080
 decide to deal with us 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.530
 the calls that reach our 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.530
 company are worth gold 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.269
 and these are the great annoyances that you 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 we cause customers when they call 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.470
 by phone 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.040
 33 percent of people 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.769
 surveyed in this study declare that 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.340
 the rude or indifferent attitude is what 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.190
 what bothers them the 23 percent 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.520
 considers that long waits are 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.530
 very bad taste when they make their call to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.650
 companies that are not aware of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.200
 how long have they been left on the line 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.570
 19 percent refers to the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 unanswered requests those in 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.080
 where the client has to make a 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.450
 second or a third call so that 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.180
 the company sends the information or gives 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.430
 an answer 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.370
 15 percent of people 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.470
 they consider it very annoying to be 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.750
 waiting for someone to answer the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.690
 called after a fifth a 6th 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.150
 ringing and that even worse immediately 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.330
 between voicemail 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.030
 finally 11% of people also 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.550
 they refer to how annoying it is that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.350
 channel our call badly 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.430
 transfer to an extension where not 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.770
 we wanted to talk 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.900
 and here are the techniques to avoid 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.030
 these great annoyances when we attend 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.840
 to the clients 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.400
 to avoid being understood as rude 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.980
 or indifferent our attitude to 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.200
 answer uses a protocol that 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.240
 tell the customer the name of the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.880
 company or the department where it is 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.520
 entering your call plus a greeting 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.000
 cordial plus your name and a phrase from 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.980
 help for example company to be very 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.910
 Good morning Olga attends you in that you 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.569
 I can help and add a smile to your 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.120
 protocol smiles when answering a call 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.080
 your voice will sound nicer and show a 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.910
 genuine attitude of service 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.640
 to avoid long waits to 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.580
 our customers considers that if the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.830
 wait will be greater than 20 seconds better 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.160
 offers some of these alternatives to 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.950
 client to transfer another extension to 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.870
 to attend to another executive to take 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.440
 your data if I call you later for 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.440
 give you an answer 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.980
 so as not to forget those requests that we 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.340
 do the clients 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.040
 the ideal is to answer the request in the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.519
 same call but if this is not possible 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.250
 then offer the customer to take their 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.580
 data and give the person's name 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.160
 that will attend your request and this last 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.230
 it is very important to give it a time of 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.680
 answer the standard that is handled in 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.599
 your company can be 24 hours 2 hours 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.599
 one hour 4 hours 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.120
 to avoid leaving our customers 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.370
 long time playing on the line 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.190
 and activate the mailbox automatically 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.220
 first answer the call to the first 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.379
 ring or before the third to give 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.830
 a welcome even if you're going to leave 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.390
 waiting example thank you for calling 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.610

 transfer to a customer question and 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.800

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.710
