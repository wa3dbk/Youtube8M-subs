00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
at night and then it would have went up

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
at night and then it would have went up
at<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.080> 12<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> morning<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> didn't<00:01:05.339> want

at like 12 in the morning I didn't want

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.469 
at like 12 in the morning I didn't want
to<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.909> lot<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> people<00:01:06.180> would

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to do that because a lot of people would

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.950 
to do that because a lot of people would
probably<00:01:06.720> miss<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:08.000> yeah<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.840> I've
