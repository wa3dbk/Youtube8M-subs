here's<00:00:01.350> another<00:00:01.439> example<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:02.730> side<00:00:03.000> has

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
here's another example this side has

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.120 
here's another example this side has
length<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.659> three<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.259> sign<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.710> length<00:00:04.980> of

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
length of three the sign is length of

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.099 
length of three the sign is length of
six<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.940> right<00:00:06.150> triangle<00:00:06.420> try<00:00:07.049> to

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
six this is a right triangle try to

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.190 
six this is a right triangle try to
figure<00:00:07.259> out<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.589> angle<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.189> side<00:00:09.200> try

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
figure out this angle and this side try

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.629 
figure out this angle and this side try
to<00:00:10.260> use<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> same<00:00:10.740> notation<00:00:11.099> an<00:00:11.340> approach

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
to use the same notation an approach

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:24.830 
to use the same notation an approach
that<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.910> used<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.269> previous<00:00:12.420> problem

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.929 

we<00:00:25.380> use<00:00:25.529> asterisks<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> indicate<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
we use asterisks to indicate the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.920 
we use asterisks to indicate the
information<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.570> we've<00:00:27.689> been<00:00:27.810> given<00:00:28.730> and

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
information that we've been given and

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.420 
information that we've been given and
also<00:00:30.930> even<00:00:31.470> though<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:31.980> been<00:00:32.160> given

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
also even though I have not been given

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
also even though I have not been given
this<00:00:32.520> angle<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.090> mean<00:00:33.239> put<00:00:33.360> an<00:00:33.449> asterisk<00:00:33.660> here

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
this angle I mean put an asterisk here

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
this angle I mean put an asterisk here
just<00:00:34.500> remind<00:00:34.860> myself<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
just remind myself that this is the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
just remind myself that this is the
angle<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.239> I'm<00:00:36.360> focusing<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.020> when<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.949> use

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
angle that I'm focusing on when I use

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.479 
angle that I'm focusing on when I use
the<00:00:38.250> trig<00:00:38.460> functions<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.980> now<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.280> label

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the trig functions and now we can label

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.939 
the trig functions and now we can label
that<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.879> side<00:00:42.089> of<00:00:42.269> the<00:00:42.360> hypotenuse<00:00:42.949> the

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
that this side of the hypotenuse the

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.460 
that this side of the hypotenuse the
horizontal<00:00:44.550> side<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.269> adjacent<00:00:45.900> to<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
horizontal side here is adjacent to the

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.610 
horizontal side here is adjacent to the
asterisk<00:00:47.070> angle<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.790> this<00:00:48.720> vertical<00:00:48.960> side<00:00:49.379> is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
asterisk angle and this vertical side is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.049 
asterisk angle and this vertical side is
opposite<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> angle<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.879> we're

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
opposite to the angle that we're

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.079 
opposite to the angle that we're
focusing<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:52.400> now<00:00:53.400> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.879> get<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
focusing on now this is what I get a

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.140 
focusing on now this is what I get a
problem<00:00:54.449> where<00:00:54.780> we've<00:00:54.960> been<00:00:55.110> given<00:00:55.409> two<00:00:55.650> sides

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
problem where we've been given two sides

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.030 
problem where we've been given two sides
well<00:00:57.150> we<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> find<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.619> angle<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:58.979> the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
well we have to find the angle in the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.740 
well we have to find the angle in the
hypotenuse<00:00:59.580> and<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.540> either

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
hypotenuse and you can do that in either

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.570 
hypotenuse and you can do that in either
order<00:01:01.080> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.500> find<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.799> hypotenuse<00:01:02.309> first

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
order you can find the hypotenuse first

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.910 
order you can find the hypotenuse first
or<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.939> can<00:01:03.059> find<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.360> angle<00:01:03.720> first<00:01:03.900> I<00:01:04.229> think

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
or you can find the angle first I think

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.710 
or you can find the angle first I think
usually<00:01:05.309> most<00:01:05.549> people<00:01:05.640> generally<00:01:06.299> find<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
usually most people generally find the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.149 
usually most people generally find the
side<00:01:06.930> first<00:01:07.320> that's<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:07.860> they're<00:01:08.010> doing

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
side first that's when they're doing

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.230 
side first that's when they're doing
these<00:01:08.369> videos<00:01:10.340> well<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> way<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
these videos well the way to do this is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.700 
these videos well the way to do this is
not<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> trig<00:01:13.020> function<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.560> way<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
not to use a trig function the way to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.410 
not to use a trig function the way to
find<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> hypotenuse<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.270> use

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
find the hypotenuse here is just to use

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.270 
find the hypotenuse here is just to use
the<00:01:15.540> Pythagorean<00:01:16.229> theorem<00:01:16.470> remember<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the Pythagorean theorem remember the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.760 
the Pythagorean theorem remember the
Pythagorean<00:01:17.430> theorem<00:01:18.150> says<00:01:18.770> hypotenuse

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
Pythagorean theorem says hypotenuse

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.740 
Pythagorean theorem says hypotenuse
squared<00:01:20.600> equal<00:01:21.600> length<00:01:21.869> squared<00:01:23.450> plus<00:01:24.450> length

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
squared equal length squared plus length

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.800 
squared equal length squared plus length
squared<00:01:28.249> now<00:01:29.249> we'll<00:01:29.490> plug<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.539> plug

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
squared now we'll plug in what do I plug

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.109 
squared now we'll plug in what do I plug
into<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> hypotenuse<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.950> don't<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.030> the

and what about plug in for this way

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
and what about plug in for this way
three

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.149 

don't<00:01:55.260> forget<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.560> we're<00:01:55.710> squaring<00:01:56.010> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
don't forget that we're squaring the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.670 
don't forget that we're squaring the
hypotenuse<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.940> left<00:01:57.119> hand<00:01:57.390> side<00:02:00.680> 6

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.860 
squared is 36 3 squared is 9 36 plus 9
is<00:02:08.429> 45<00:02:11.060> well<00:02:12.060> I'm<00:02:12.300> getting<00:02:12.510> really<00:02:12.660> sloppy

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
is 45 well I'm getting really sloppy

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.090 
is 45 well I'm getting really sloppy
here<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.260> keep<00:02:13.440> forgetting<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.860> we're

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
here I keep forgetting that we're

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.090 
here I keep forgetting that we're
squaring<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.150> hypotenuse<00:02:18.680> all<00:02:19.680> right<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:19.980> we

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
squaring the hypotenuse all right so we

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.890 
squaring the hypotenuse all right so we
have<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> hypotenuse<00:02:20.819> squared<00:02:21.150> equals<00:02:21.420> 45

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
have the hypotenuse squared equals 45

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.949 
have the hypotenuse squared equals 45
now<00:02:22.560> our<00:02:22.709> goal<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.550> salt<00:02:23.940> us<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.450> solve<00:02:24.780> this

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
now our goal is to salt us to solve this

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.750 
now our goal is to salt us to solve this
equation<00:02:25.110> for<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.680> hypotenuse<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.670> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
equation for the hypotenuse we have to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.360 
equation for the hypotenuse we have to
get<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.970> hypotenuse<00:02:27.540> term<00:02:27.810> by<00:02:28.230> itself<00:02:28.680> that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
get the hypotenuse term by itself that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.530 
get the hypotenuse term by itself that
means<00:02:29.550> we<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.790> get<00:02:29.910> rid<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> square

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
means we have to get rid of the square

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.070 
means we have to get rid of the square
well<00:02:31.320> we<00:02:31.500> do<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.920> opposite<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:33.420> opposite<00:02:33.989> of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
well we do the opposite the opposite of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.840 
well we do the opposite the opposite of
squaring<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.890> taking<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.610> square<00:02:35.850> root<00:02:40.850> so

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
squaring is taking the square root so

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.580 
squaring is taking the square root so
let's<00:02:42.000> take<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.269> square<00:02:42.420> root<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.840> both<00:02:43.530> sides

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
let's take the square root of both sides

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.680 
let's take the square root of both sides
if<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:44.610> take<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.910> square<00:02:45.209> root<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
if you take the square root of the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.190 
if you take the square root of the
left-hand<00:02:46.140> side<00:02:47.660> we're<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:48.840> left<00:02:49.019> with<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
left-hand side we're just left with the

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.320 
left-hand side we're just left with the
hypotenuse<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.910> take<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.209> square

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
hypotenuse and if you take the square

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.140 
hypotenuse and if you take the square
root<00:02:51.630> on<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.810> right<00:02:52.050> hand<00:02:52.319> side<00:02:55.910> we<00:02:56.910> get<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
root on the right hand side we get the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.070 
root on the right hand side we get the
square<00:02:57.330> root<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.600> 45

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
square root of 45

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.870 
square root of 45
and<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.709> course<00:02:58.920> we're<00:02:59.070> taking<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.400> positive

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
and of course we're taking the positive

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.710 
and of course we're taking the positive
square<00:03:00.000> root<00:03:02.269> now<00:03:03.269> we<00:03:03.329> can<00:03:03.510> use<00:03:03.540> our

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
square root now we can use our

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.210 
square root now we can use our
calculator<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.380> figure<00:03:04.530> out<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:05.010> positive

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
calculator to figure out the positive

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.780 
calculator to figure out the positive
square<00:03:05.640> root<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.030> 45<00:03:06.470> that's<00:03:07.470> six<00:03:07.890> point<00:03:08.160> seven

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:23.059 

so<00:03:14.790> our<00:03:14.940> hypotenuse<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.690> six<00:03:15.900> point<00:03:16.170> seven

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.100 

that's<00:03:23.640> probably<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.939> easy<00:03:24.150> part<00:03:24.689> maybe<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
that's probably the easy part maybe the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.750 
that's probably the easy part maybe the
hard<00:03:25.290> part<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.739> find<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.069> angle<00:03:26.340> over

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
hard part is to find this angle over

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.910 
hard part is to find this angle over
here<00:03:26.959> well<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.079> first<00:03:28.260> thing<00:03:28.409> is<00:03:28.590> it's<00:03:28.829> gonna

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
here well the first thing is it's gonna

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.619 
here well the first thing is it's gonna
be<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.099> lot<00:03:29.220> easier<00:03:29.640> if<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:29.879> give<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.180> angle<00:03:30.510> a

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
be a lot easier if you give this angle a

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.030 
be a lot easier if you give this angle a
name<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.200> let's<00:03:31.319> call<00:03:31.439> this<00:03:31.620> angle<00:03:31.829> theta

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
name so let's call this angle theta

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.460 
name so let's call this angle theta
again<00:03:35.060> I'm<00:03:36.060> going<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.209> call<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.480> angle<00:03:36.720> theta

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
again I'm going to call this angle theta

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.559 
again I'm going to call this angle theta
now<00:03:37.799> which<00:03:38.069> trig<00:03:38.430> function<00:03:38.879> should<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.329> use

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
now which trig function should I use

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.180 
now which trig function should I use
well<00:03:40.200> remember<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.680> we're<00:03:40.799> going<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.950> try<00:03:41.129> to

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
well remember that we're going to try to

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.559 
well remember that we're going to try to
use<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.700> information<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.329> we've<00:03:42.450> been

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
use the information that we've been

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.839 
use the information that we've been
given<00:03:42.900> well<00:03:43.440> we've<00:03:43.709> been<00:03:43.829> given<00:03:44.220> information

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
given well we've been given information

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.390 
given well we've been given information
about<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:46.230> opposite<00:03:46.650> side<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.250> adjacent

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
about the opposite side and the adjacent

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.430 
about the opposite side and the adjacent
side<00:03:47.879> that's<00:03:48.329> what<00:03:48.450> these<00:03:48.540> asterisks<00:03:49.260> are

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
side that's what these asterisks are

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.349 
side that's what these asterisks are
reminding<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.069> up<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.489> have<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.760> number<00:03:50.970> 6

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
reminding this up we have this number 6

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.420 
reminding this up we have this number 6
2<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:51.629> number<00:03:51.690> 3<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.859> we<00:03:52.980> want<00:03:53.159> a<00:03:53.189> trig

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
2 this number 3 so we want a trig

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.920 
2 this number 3 so we want a trig
function<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:54.000> deals<00:03:54.150> with<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.450> opposite

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
function that deals with the opposite

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.330 
function that deals with the opposite
and<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.290> adjacent<00:03:55.440> sides

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
and the adjacent sides

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.390 
and the adjacent sides
well<00:03:56.879> Toa<00:03:57.269> that's<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.959> tangent<00:03:58.400> tangent

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
well Toa that's the tangent tangent

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:10.789 
well Toa that's the tangent tangent
deals<00:03:59.879> with<00:04:00.090> opposite<00:04:00.569> MJC<00:04:09.560> tangent<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.620> theta

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
deals with opposite MJC tangent of theta

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.490 
deals with opposite MJC tangent of theta
is<00:04:11.069> opposite<00:04:11.549> over<00:04:11.760> adjacent<00:04:12.019> if<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.200> wanted

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
is opposite over adjacent if you wanted

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.949 
is opposite over adjacent if you wanted
to<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:14.129> could<00:04:14.340> use<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:15.000> hypotenuse<00:04:15.599> now<00:04:15.810> that

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
to you could use the hypotenuse now that

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.330 
to you could use the hypotenuse now that
we<00:04:16.049> know<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.320> hypotenuse<00:04:16.799> we<00:04:16.979> could<00:04:17.160> solve

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
we know the hypotenuse we could solve

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.650 
we know the hypotenuse we could solve
the<00:04:17.459> problem<00:04:17.789> another<00:04:18.030> way<00:04:18.209> using<00:04:18.449> the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
the problem another way using the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.719 
the problem another way using the
hypotenuse<00:04:19.229> however<00:04:20.190> that's<00:04:20.340> not<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.579> way

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
hypotenuse however that's not the way

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.069 
hypotenuse however that's not the way
people<00:04:21.000> usually<00:04:21.150> do<00:04:21.449> this<00:04:21.600> type<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.810> problem

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
people usually do this type of problem

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.810 
people usually do this type of problem
they<00:04:22.380> usually<00:04:22.530> do<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.949> problem<00:04:23.340> using<00:04:23.699> the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
they usually do the problem using the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.310 
they usually do the problem using the
information<00:04:24.030> they<00:04:24.449> were<00:04:24.510> originally<00:04:25.139> given

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
information they were originally given

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.779 
information they were originally given
not<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.830> new<00:04:25.979> information<00:04:26.250> they've<00:04:26.639> figured

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
not the new information they've figured

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.400 
not the new information they've figured
out<00:04:27.030> so<00:04:27.360> we'll<00:04:27.449> do<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.690> problem<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.110> way<00:04:28.139> it's

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
out so we'll do the problem the way it's

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.529 
out so we'll do the problem the way it's
conventionally<00:04:29.039> done<00:04:31.910> well<00:04:32.910> we<00:04:33.060> can<00:04:33.210> plug<00:04:33.389> in

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
conventionally done well we can plug in

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.390 
conventionally done well we can plug in
that<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.840> opposite<00:04:34.289> side<00:04:34.500> had<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.770> length<00:04:34.979> of<00:04:35.099> 6

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
that the opposite side had a length of 6

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.860 
that the opposite side had a length of 6
and<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:36.720> adjacent<00:04:36.990> side<00:04:37.440> had<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.770> length<00:04:38.010> of<00:04:38.130> 3

6 divided by 3 is 2 now we still need to

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.370 
6 divided by 3 is 2 now we still need to

get the theta by itself we need to get

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.529 
get the theta by itself we need to get
rid<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.590> this<00:04:49.710> tangent<00:04:50.250> term<00:04:50.520> by<00:04:50.940> doing<00:04:51.419> the

when<00:04:54.599> we<00:04:54.690> know<00:04:54.810> now<00:04:55.080> we've<00:04:55.260> learned<00:04:55.440> that<00:04:55.650> the

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
when we know now we've learned that the

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.040 
when we know now we've learned that the
opposite<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.280> tangent<00:04:56.760> is<00:04:56.910> inverse<00:04:57.690> tangent

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
opposite of tangent is inverse tangent

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.839 
opposite of tangent is inverse tangent
or<00:04:58.380> arctangent<00:05:01.310> we<00:05:02.310> have<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.520> take<00:05:02.699> the

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
or arctangent we have to take the

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.089 
or arctangent we have to take the
inverse<00:05:03.210> tangent<00:05:03.539> of<00:05:03.840> both<00:05:04.050> sides<00:05:04.110> well<00:05:04.979> when

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
inverse tangent of both sides well when

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.740 
inverse tangent of both sides well when
we<00:05:05.220> take<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.490> inverse<00:05:05.820> tangent<00:05:05.880> of<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.539> left

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
we take the inverse tangent of the left

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.110 
we take the inverse tangent of the left
hand<00:05:06.990> side<00:05:07.229> that<00:05:07.590> just<00:05:08.460> leaves<00:05:08.669> data<00:05:08.940> by

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
hand side that just leaves data by

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.689 
hand side that just leaves data by
itself<00:05:09.380> but<00:05:10.380> by<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.590> golden<00:05:10.979> rule<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.280> algebra

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
itself but by the golden rule of algebra

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:12.970 
itself but by the golden rule of algebra
since<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.060> just<00:05:12.120> took<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.599> end

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
since I just took the end

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.220 
since I just took the end
of<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.640> left-hand-side<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.540> must<00:05:14.870> take<00:05:15.080> the

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
of the left-hand-side I must take the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.140 
of the left-hand-side I must take the
inverse<00:05:15.530> tangent<00:05:15.800> of<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.280> right-hand<00:05:16.490> side

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.430 

so<00:05:20.150> we<00:05:20.240> know<00:05:20.360> this<00:05:20.510> is<00:05:20.570> one<00:05:20.870> good<00:05:21.020> way<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.230> write

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
so we know this is one good way to write

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.890 
so we know this is one good way to write
the<00:05:21.560> inverse<00:05:21.950> tangent<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:23.360> now<00:05:23.600> we<00:05:23.660> have<00:05:23.810> to

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
the inverse tangent and now we have to

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.510 
the inverse tangent and now we have to
get<00:05:23.960> our<00:05:24.110> calculator<00:05:24.320> and<00:05:24.860> figure<00:05:25.220> out<00:05:25.340> the

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
get our calculator and figure out the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.340 
get our calculator and figure out the
inverse<00:05:25.850> tangent<00:05:26.120> by<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.780> way<00:05:26.930> again<00:05:27.200> you

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
inverse tangent by the way again you

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.560 
inverse tangent by the way again you
would<00:05:27.470> read<00:05:27.650> this<00:05:27.860> tangent<00:05:28.700> of<00:05:28.790> theta<00:05:28.970> is<00:05:29.150> two

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
would read this tangent of theta is two

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.200 
would read this tangent of theta is two
and<00:05:29.840> this<00:05:30.350> says<00:05:30.590> theta<00:05:31.280> is<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.610> angle<00:05:31.970> whose

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
and this says theta is the angle whose

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.960 
and this says theta is the angle whose
tangent<00:05:32.450> is<00:05:32.780> two<00:05:33.040> theta<00:05:34.040> is<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.430> angle<00:05:34.790> whose

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
tangent is two theta is the angle whose

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.720 
tangent is two theta is the angle whose

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
tangent is two theta is the inverse

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.940 
tangent is two theta is the inverse
tangent<00:05:38.000> of<00:05:38.360> two<00:05:38.600> that<00:05:39.050> means<00:05:39.260> that<00:05:39.470> theta<00:05:39.680> is

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
tangent of two that means that theta is

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.130 
tangent of two that means that theta is
the<00:05:40.070> angle<00:05:40.490> whose<00:05:40.700> tangent<00:05:40.910> is<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.510> me<00:05:41.900> what<00:05:42.050> we

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
the angle whose tangent is to me what we

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.350 
the angle whose tangent is to me what we
can<00:05:42.260> use<00:05:42.350> our<00:05:42.470> calculator<00:05:42.920> here<00:05:43.360> remember

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
can use our calculator here remember

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.060 
can use our calculator here remember
that<00:05:44.390> you<00:05:44.900> probably<00:05:45.170> have<00:05:45.290> to<00:05:45.410> use<00:05:45.440> the<00:05:45.710> second

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
that you probably have to use the second

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.680 
that you probably have to use the second
key<00:05:46.250> on<00:05:46.490> your<00:05:46.670> calculator<00:05:46.850> you<00:05:47.330> have<00:05:47.450> to<00:05:47.570> hit

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
key on your calculator you have to hit

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.900 
key on your calculator you have to hit
second<00:05:48.110> and<00:05:48.200> then<00:05:48.800> tangent<00:05:49.250> to<00:05:49.700> get<00:05:49.820> the

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
second and then tangent to get the

00:05:49.910 --> 00:06:04.470 
second and then tangent to get the
inverse<00:05:50.210> tangent<00:05:50.480> and<00:05:50.810> then<00:05:50.960> you<00:05:51.050> can<00:05:51.170> hit<00:05:51.260> two

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.910 

so<00:06:05.480> in<00:06:05.630> most<00:06:05.750> calculators<00:06:06.140> this<00:06:06.590> is<00:06:06.710> how<00:06:06.860> you

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
so in most calculators this is how you

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.130 
so in most calculators this is how you
do<00:06:07.580> this<00:06:07.700> inverse<00:06:08.150> tangent<00:06:08.450> you<00:06:08.870> hit<00:06:09.020> the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
do this inverse tangent you hit the

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.320 
do this inverse tangent you hit the
second<00:06:09.500> key<00:06:09.680> then<00:06:10.340> you<00:06:10.370> put<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.700> tangent<00:06:11.150> key

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
second key then you put the tangent key

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.940 
second key then you put the tangent key
which<00:06:11.600> gives<00:06:11.810> you<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:12.020> inverse<00:06:12.350> tangent<00:06:12.620> and

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
which gives you the inverse tangent and

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.120 
which gives you the inverse tangent and
then<00:06:13.160> you<00:06:13.250> get<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:13.460> number<00:06:13.730> two<00:06:14.950> if<00:06:15.950> your

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
then you get the number two if your

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.470 
then you get the number two if your
calculator<00:06:16.520> works<00:06:16.760> differently<00:06:17.120> you'll<00:06:17.360> have

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
calculator works differently you'll have

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.290 
calculator works differently you'll have
to<00:06:17.570> figure<00:06:17.720> that<00:06:17.930> out<00:06:18.050> on<00:06:18.080> your<00:06:18.260> own<00:06:18.320> and<00:06:19.300> then

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
to figure that out on your own and then

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.270 
to figure that out on your own and then
you<00:06:20.420> can<00:06:20.570> do<00:06:20.660> the<00:06:20.810> inverse<00:06:21.170> tangent<00:06:21.500> of<00:06:21.890> two

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
you can do the inverse tangent of two

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.280 
you can do the inverse tangent of two
you<00:06:22.970> will<00:06:23.120> find<00:06:23.420> that<00:06:23.570> the<00:06:23.660> inverse<00:06:23.990> tangent

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
you will find that the inverse tangent

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:33.700 
you will find that the inverse tangent
of<00:06:24.530> two<00:06:24.770> is<00:06:25.040> approximately<00:06:26.140> 63<00:06:27.140> degrees<00:06:32.530> so<00:06:33.530> we

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
of two is approximately 63 degrees so we

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.980 
of two is approximately 63 degrees so we
can<00:06:33.860> say<00:06:33.980> that<00:06:34.130> this<00:06:34.250> angle<00:06:34.460> here<00:06:34.850> is<00:06:35.060> 63

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
can say that this angle here is 63

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:44.680 
can say that this angle here is 63
degrees<00:06:41.770> now<00:06:42.770> as<00:06:43.010> usual<00:06:43.220> the<00:06:43.910> way<00:06:44.180> I'm<00:06:44.330> solving

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
degrees now as usual the way I'm solving

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.090 
degrees now as usual the way I'm solving
these<00:06:44.780> problems<00:06:44.960> it's<00:06:45.410> not<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.620> only<00:06:45.800> way<00:06:46.040> to

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
these problems it's not the only way to

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.650 
these problems it's not the only way to
solve<00:06:46.400> them<00:06:46.610> there's<00:06:47.210> actually<00:06:47.510> many

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
solve them there's actually many

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.510 
solve them there's actually many
different<00:06:48.080> approaches<00:06:48.950> you<00:06:48.980> can<00:06:49.160> use<00:06:49.340> to

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
different approaches you can use to

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.370 
different approaches you can use to
solve<00:06:49.730> these<00:06:49.910> problems<00:06:49.970> but<00:06:50.750> I'm<00:06:50.870> using<00:06:51.080> the

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
solve these problems but I'm using the

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.530 
solve these problems but I'm using the
approach<00:06:51.710> that<00:06:51.740> is<00:06:52.220> most<00:06:52.520> commonly<00:06:52.970> used<00:06:53.090> in

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:53.540 
approach that is most commonly used in

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.970 
approach that is most commonly used in
physics<00:06:54.050> and<00:06:54.200> that's<00:06:54.350> the<00:06:54.470> approach<00:06:54.680> that<00:06:54.710> I

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:54.980 
physics and that's the approach that I

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.820 
physics and that's the approach that I
recommend<00:06:55.700> that<00:06:55.730> you<00:06:55.940> use<00:06:56.080> as<00:06:57.080> well<00:06:57.440> trying<00:06:57.770> to

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
recommend that you use as well trying to

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.230 
recommend that you use as well trying to
solve<00:06:58.100> the<00:06:58.160> problem<00:06:58.430> the<00:06:58.550> same<00:06:58.730> way<00:06:58.790> I'm<00:06:59.060> doing

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
solve the problem the same way I'm doing

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.430 
solve the problem the same way I'm doing
because<00:06:59.720> that's<00:06:59.930> the<00:07:00.080> way<00:07:00.169> that<00:07:00.350> you're

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
because that's the way that you're

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.690 
because that's the way that you're
conventionally<00:07:00.950> going<00:07:01.220> to<00:07:01.310> see<00:07:01.460> your

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
conventionally going to see your

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.220 
conventionally going to see your
textbook<00:07:02.030> and<00:07:02.330> your<00:07:02.390> instructor<00:07:02.840> solving

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.230 
textbook and your instructor solving

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.720 
textbook and your instructor solving
them<00:07:03.380> even<00:07:03.860> though<00:07:03.950> there<00:07:04.100> are<00:07:04.220> other<00:07:04.490> ways

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.730 
them even though there are other ways

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.860 
them even though there are other ways
that<00:07:04.910> would<00:07:05.090> also<00:07:05.240> give<00:07:05.510> you<00:07:05.600> the<00:07:05.690> right

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
that would also give you the right

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.930 
that would also give you the right
answer<00:07:06.200> for<00:07:06.770> example<00:07:07.160> it<00:07:07.250> is<00:07:07.400> possible<00:07:07.490> to

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
answer for example it is possible to

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.000 
answer for example it is possible to
find<00:07:08.180> this<00:07:08.360> angle<00:07:08.600> but<00:07:09.470> that<00:07:09.620> one<00:07:09.770> is<00:07:09.860> in<00:07:09.950> the

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.010 
find this angle but that one is in the

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.440 
find this angle but that one is in the
tangent<00:07:10.430> you<00:07:10.520> could<00:07:10.730> use<00:07:10.880> the<00:07:11.060> sine<00:07:11.240> or<00:07:11.270> the

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450 
tangent you could use the sine or the

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.120 
tangent you could use the sine or the
cosine<00:07:11.510> once<00:07:12.260> you<00:07:12.350> know<00:07:12.470> the<00:07:12.560> hypotenuse

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
cosine once you know the hypotenuse

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.770 
cosine once you know the hypotenuse
that's<00:07:13.460> not<00:07:13.669> the<00:07:13.760> way<00:07:13.850> people<00:07:14.120> usually<00:07:14.330> solve

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
that's not the way people usually solve

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:22.210 
that's not the way people usually solve
this<00:07:15.050> type<00:07:15.200> of<00:07:15.260> problem<00:07:20.290> so<00:07:21.290> this<00:07:21.380> is<00:07:21.530> our<00:07:21.680> next

this<00:07:26.690> is<00:07:26.750> a<00:07:26.870> lot<00:07:27.080> different<00:07:27.440> from<00:07:27.470> when<00:07:27.680> you're

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
this is a lot different from when you're

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.330 
this is a lot different from when you're
just<00:07:27.890> giving<00:07:28.160> aside<00:07:28.460> an<00:07:28.669> angle<00:07:29.770> all<00:07:30.770> right

just giving aside an angle all right
please<00:07:31.880> keep<00:07:32.270> redoing<00:07:32.690> this<00:07:32.990> problem<00:07:33.380> until
