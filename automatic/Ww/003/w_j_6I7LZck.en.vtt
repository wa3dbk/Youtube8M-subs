and we've seen all the messy cables that
everyone's<00:00:27.060> been<00:00:27.210> talking<00:00:27.329> about<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.840> YouTube

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
however as much as running these messy

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.890 
however as much as running these messy
cables<00:00:33.030> would<00:00:33.150> improve<00:00:33.390> our<00:00:33.540> air<00:00:33.659> flow

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
cables would improve our air flow

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.660 
cables would improve our air flow
there's<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> lot<00:00:35.129> on<00:00:35.159> your<00:00:35.339> flow<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
there's not a lot on your flow in the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.220 
there's not a lot on your flow in the
case<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.970> begin<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.839> we're<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.019> to<00:00:37.079> add

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
which way the fan rotates and which way

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.099 
which way the fan rotates and which way
the<00:00:53.699> air<00:00:54.390> will<00:00:54.570> come<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.780> or<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.019> I<00:00:55.609> believe<00:00:56.609> on

slower<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.030> there's<00:02:48.660> not<00:02:48.750> going<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.930> be<00:02:48.990> as

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
slower so there's not going to be as

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.380 
slower so there's not going to be as
much<00:02:49.320> air<00:02:49.560> coming<00:02:49.800> out<00:02:50.120> given<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.240> this<00:02:51.330> is

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
much air coming out given that this is

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.060 
much air coming out given that this is
the<00:02:51.540> only<00:02:51.720> exhaust<00:02:52.140> fan<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> machine

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
the only exhaust fan on the machine

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.860 
the only exhaust fan on the machine
we're<00:02:53.400> going<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.580> leave<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.790> plugged<00:02:53.970> into<00:02:54.240> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
we're going to leave it plugged into the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.500 
we're going to leave it plugged into the
molex<00:02:55.260> for<00:02:55.620> better<00:02:55.890> speed<00:02:56.190> more<00:02:56.610> airflow<00:02:57.560> now

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
molex for better speed more airflow now

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.290 
molex for better speed more airflow now
let's<00:03:00.510> take<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.690> look<00:03:00.930> at<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.940> 292<00:03:02.940> millimeter

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
let's take a look at the 292 millimeter

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.230 
let's take a look at the 292 millimeter
fans<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.840> front<00:03:06.980> in<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.130> case<00:03:09.350> we<00:03:10.350> have

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
fans in the front in this case we have

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.560 
fans in the front in this case we have
two<00:03:12.240> thumb<00:03:12.480> screws<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:15.150> hold<00:03:15.800> this<00:03:16.800> on<00:03:17.570> this

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
two thumb screws that hold this on this

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.350 
two thumb screws that hold this on this
is<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.810> great<00:03:19.050> for<00:03:19.260> mounting<00:03:19.560> fans<00:03:19.739> and

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
is like great for mounting fans and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.620 
is like great for mounting fans and
these<00:03:21.360> fans<00:03:22.730> need<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.760> be<00:03:23.940> positioned<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.570> a

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
these fans need to be positioned in a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.590 
these fans need to be positioned in a
way<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:25.530> blows<00:03:25.800> air<00:03:26.130> into<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.060> case<00:03:27.209> it's

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
way that blows air into the case it's

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.430 
way that blows air into the case it's
going<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> be<00:03:27.840> sucking<00:03:28.050> in<00:03:28.200> through<00:03:28.320> that

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
going to be sucking in through that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.000 
going to be sucking in through that
front<00:03:28.680> plate<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.250> pushing<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.850> in<00:03:31.010> remember

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
front plate and pushing it in remember

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.920 
front plate and pushing it in remember
we<00:03:32.130> have<00:03:32.280> air<00:03:32.820> goes<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.300> way<00:03:33.480> we're<00:03:33.720> tape

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
we have air goes that way we're tape

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.010 
we have air goes that way we're tape
this<00:03:34.140> way<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.830> comes<00:03:35.010> out<00:03:35.190> through<00:03:35.760> here<00:03:36.020> so

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
this way so it comes out through here so

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.780 
this way so it comes out through here so
we're<00:03:37.140> going<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.320> want<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.770> we're<00:03:38.520> gonna<00:03:38.640> want
