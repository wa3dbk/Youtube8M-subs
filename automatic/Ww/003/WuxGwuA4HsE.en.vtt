00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.910
 nearly 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.899
 the opponent has not created any opportunities

 living room or so on followed seconds 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.030
 but we believed to the last that we 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.039
 we can win 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.239
 Zubarev craftsmen prevent that is 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.360
 my opinion the result of the game is deserved 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.260
 practice or would you for dvd glue and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.720

 and alerts because the ass looks very 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.729
 an important point now psychologically is 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.860

 will also be very important 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:54.460
 that’s all I’m asking is just that 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.880
 the team has some problems 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.800

 poked that he collect we will come as I 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.230
 the coach doesn't comment on this for me 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.350
 the main thing that the player was confident 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.050
 when is going to pierce the amount 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.820

 selfish that he will score in the future 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.489

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:34.670
