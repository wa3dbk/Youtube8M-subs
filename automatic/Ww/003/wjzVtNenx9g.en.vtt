the argument most worlds were believed

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.810 
the argument most worlds were believed
to<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:37.950> their<00:00:38.100> pale<00:00:38.250> skin<00:00:38.460> from<00:00:38.610> staying

indoors all day as opposed to the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.420 
indoors all day as opposed to the
farmers<00:00:40.500> who<00:00:40.649> spread<00:00:40.860> their<00:00:40.980> lies<00:00:41.100> working

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
rice paddy fields Under the Sun their

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.690 
rice paddy fields Under the Sun their
skin<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.320> naturally<00:00:43.770> pale<00:00:43.950> why<00:00:44.430> did<00:00:44.610> they

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
skin was so naturally pale why did they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.369 
skin was so naturally pale why did they
paint<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> common-sense<00:00:45.809> question

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
paint it as the common-sense question

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.080 
paint it as the common-sense question
they<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:46.649> basically<00:00:47.039> say<00:00:47.280> because<00:00:47.670> cartoons

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
they then basically say because cartoons

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.459 
they then basically say because cartoons
are<00:00:48.270> more<00:00:48.390> simplified<00:00:48.870> versions<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.289> real

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
are more simplified versions of real

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.600 
are more simplified versions of real
lives<00:00:49.680> more<00:00:49.920> difficult<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.309> distinguish

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
lives more difficult to distinguish

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.950 
lives more difficult to distinguish
between<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.969> characters<00:00:51.329> without<00:00:51.449> extremes

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
between the characters without extremes

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.389 
between the characters without extremes
it's<00:00:52.230> why<00:00:52.320> some<00:00:52.379> anime<00:00:52.770> characters<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.190> blue

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
it's why some anime characters have blue

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.799 
it's why some anime characters have blue
hair<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.760> other<00:00:53.879> anime<00:00:54.180> characters<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.600> red

think<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.930> more<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.380> white

think this is more of just a white

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.719 
think this is more of just a white
person<00:01:31.860> problem<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.369> basically<00:01:32.579> as

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
person problem so it's basically as

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.950 
person problem so it's basically as
simple<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.689> chick<00:01:33.840> with

simple as this right the chick with

simple as this right the chick with
black<00:01:34.140> hair<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.380> purple<00:01:34.710> eyes<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.130> she

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
black hair and purple eyes because she

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.679 
black hair and purple eyes because she
simply<00:01:35.520> doesn't<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> dye<00:01:36.210> job<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.600> her

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
simply doesn't have a dye job on her

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.910 
simply doesn't have a dye job on her
hair<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.869> probably<00:01:37.079> assume<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> she's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
hair you probably assume that she's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.080 
hair you probably assume that she's
Asian<00:01:38.070> then<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.460> look<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.700> next<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> her

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
Asian then if you look just next to her

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.700 
Asian then if you look just next to her
it's<00:01:39.210> almost<00:01:39.299> exactly<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> same<00:01:39.990> face<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.680> a

Greenland<00:02:16.890> isn't<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.550> giant<00:02:17.910> chunk<00:02:18.060> of

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
Greenland isn't it like a giant chunk of

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.430 
Greenland isn't it like a giant chunk of
ice<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.540> out<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.810> all<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.990> countries<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
West the United States makes up maybe

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.610 
West the United States makes up maybe
25%<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.630> landmass<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.380> refer<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
25% of that landmass if you refer to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380 
25% of that landmass if you refer to
everyone<00:02:23.040> over<00:02:23.250> here<00:02:23.280> as<00:02:23.460> Westerners<00:02:23.940> come<00:02:24.210> on

everyone over here as Westerners come on
it's<00:02:24.660> almost<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:24.990> me<00:02:25.110> saying<00:02:25.290> everyone

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
it's almost like me saying everyone

who's Asian is Japanese it doesn't make

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.770 
who's Asian is Japanese it doesn't make
sense

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
sense

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.870

Japanese<00:02:28.230> people<00:02:28.590> are<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.860> smaller<00:02:29.250> section

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
Japanese people are the smaller section

holy shit and why they go on to say that

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.700

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
yeah and sometimes perspectives can be

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.590 
yeah and sometimes perspectives can be
wrong<00:02:38.070> if<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.370> draw<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> penis<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.210> piece<00:02:39.450> of

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
wrong if I draw a penis on a piece of

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
wrong if I draw a penis on a piece of
paper<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.050> say<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.320> looks<00:02:40.410> like<00:02:40.590> a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
paper and you say it looks like a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.260 
paper and you say it looks like a

submarine that doesn't make it a fucking
submarine<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:43.200> honestly<00:02:43.920> believe<00:02:44.130> most<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.490> the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
submarine I honestly believe most of the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.620 
submarine I honestly believe most of the
time<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:44.850> up<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> artist<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.450> site

third party oh that's interesting here

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.310 
third party oh that's interesting here
they're<00:02:48.300> pointing<00:02:48.570> out<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.750> Shane<00:02:48.960> Dawson

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
they're pointing out the Shane Dawson

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.690 
they're pointing out the Shane Dawson
looking<00:02:49.530> character<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.950> Light<00:02:50.100> Yagami<00:02:50.280> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
looking character of Light Yagami to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.220 
looking character of Light Yagami to
actual<00:02:51.120> Asian<00:02:51.480> people<00:02:51.840> here's<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.050> thing

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
actual Asian people here's the thing

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.420 
actual Asian people here's the thing
though<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.530> only<00:02:52.680> reason<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.100> said<00:02:53.130> Light

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
though the only reason I said Light

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.650 
though the only reason I said Light
Yagami<00:02:53.580> looks<00:02:53.940> like<00:02:54.030> Shane<00:02:54.240> Dawson<00:02:54.600> is

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
Yagami looks like Shane Dawson is

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.000 
Yagami looks like Shane Dawson is
because<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> hairstyle<00:02:55.350> which<00:02:55.530> Shane<00:02:55.770> used

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
because the hairstyle which Shane used

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.320 
because the hairstyle which Shane used
to<00:02:56.100> have<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.370> mean<00:02:56.400> if<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.730> look<00:02:56.880> at<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> faces

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
to have I mean if you look at the faces

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
to have I mean if you look at the faces
of<00:02:57.360> these<00:02:57.540> two<00:02:57.660> characters<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.140> doesn't

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
of these two characters it doesn't

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.660 
of these two characters it doesn't
change<00:02:58.500> much<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:58.890> that's<00:02:59.040> exactly<00:02:59.430> my<00:02:59.520> point

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
change much and that's exactly my point

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.100 
change much and that's exactly my point
it's<00:02:59.910> not<00:02:59.970> about<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.300> hair<00:03:00.480> color<00:03:00.750> or<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.080> eye

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
it's not about the hair color or the eye

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.570 
it's not about the hair color or the eye
color<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.770> definitely<00:03:02.040> not<00:03:02.100> about<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> skin

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
color it's definitely not about the skin

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.830 
color it's definitely not about the skin
colour<00:03:02.760> because<00:03:02.940> many<00:03:03.090> Asians<00:03:03.480> have<00:03:03.600> lighter

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
colour because many Asians have lighter

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.600 
colour because many Asians have lighter
colored<00:03:04.140> skin<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.830> these<00:03:04.950> two<00:03:05.130> faces<00:03:05.490> look

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
colored skin so if these two faces look

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.040 
colored skin so if these two faces look
incredibly<00:03:06.030> similar<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.630> obviously<00:03:06.840> one<00:03:07.020> of

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
incredibly similar and obviously one of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.630 
incredibly similar and obviously one of
those<00:03:07.200> faces<00:03:07.410> was<00:03:07.560> blatantly<00:03:07.950> drawn<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.490> look

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
those faces was blatantly drawn to look

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.070 
those faces was blatantly drawn to look
Asian<00:03:08.880> whereas<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.390> other<00:03:09.540> was<00:03:09.750> probably<00:03:10.020> a

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
Asian whereas the other was probably a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.690 
Asian whereas the other was probably a
lot<00:03:10.170> more<00:03:10.230> lenient<00:03:10.800> with<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.010> art<00:03:11.160> style<00:03:11.400> what

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
lot more lenient with the art style what
