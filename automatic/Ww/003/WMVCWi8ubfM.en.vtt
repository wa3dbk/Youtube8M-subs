00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello and welcome to the website of 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.670
 webmarketing is turning the goal of 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.710
 webmarketing tutorial it's very simple 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.410
 it is to allow everyone 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 to have the opportunity to create his own 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.509
 own website with professional design 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.949
 and its no line of code really have 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.980
 created your site without knowledge 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.710
 techniques and especially in a second 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.970
 time to make this site use purpose 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.650
 personal professional so really 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.539
 that they are useful to your activity and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.000
 which is profitable for you so he 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 brings back customers and so if we look 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 here on the site I divided into three 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.719
 large parts operation must 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.129
 marketing quito the first thing 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.469
 of enough to create this site is so 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.030
 to have an online presence and it can 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.410
 to be the creation of the site but also everything 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.760
 what goes around so creating a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.170
 facebook page creating a channel 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.489
 youtube creating our twitter account 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.940
 or whatever is useful to your 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.570
 online presence and secondly it's from 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.160
 generate customers and then we 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.520
 manages to generate customers with his 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.770
 site 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.559
 so we first go with the iron with the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.170
 advertising but also with non 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.869
 paying to optimize its sources of traffic 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.110
 to have more customers through our 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.530
 site 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.540
 here I have a little diagram what I have 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.520
 used in one of my tutorials here in 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 does the three big parts for 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.000
 simplify know not limited that those 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.560
 but in some tutors we 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.210
 simplifies the online presence 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.790
 is that the creation of the site and we will 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.409
 do it with wordpress wordpress it's 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.320
 what to pour the most platform 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.570
 used the world to create his site and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.329
 so it's a cms it's a system of 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.680
 content management and that allows 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.479
 really in a very simple way to manage 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.950
 its content 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.390
 secondly accused beard for example 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.399
 google adwords to get tested 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.439
 online and so as soon as someone searches 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.270
 something on google you will have the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.610
 ability to post an ad and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.229
 so that people find what they 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.180
 search and falls on your site 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.940
 and thirdly we will use google 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.980
 analytics to improve 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.260
 the profitability of the site once it 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.340
 has become profitable and is already driving it 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.550
 customers and so I use very very 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.020
 often this schema this schema he says 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.430
 just that it's very good 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.890
 first of all to have a website 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.540
 but for it to be really useful ben 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.110
 it must be from qualified egypt 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.510
 above and these visits must be 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.460
 then turned into a customer for you 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.890
 and so all of this has to be overseen by 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.570
 a strategy and goals and so 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.160
 I invite you to browse the website 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.380
