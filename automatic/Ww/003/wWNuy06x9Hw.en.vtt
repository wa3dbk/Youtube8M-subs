00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.820
 Hi, my name is a lot and I'm an alcoholic 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.530
 I say sniper and today I bring you my voice 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.539
 velvety and sexy to teach you a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.830
 which many have told me how 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.810
 do cous cous in butterfield 3 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.970
 I'm already here to explain 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.590
 the good thing I take to say that this 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.300
 video will be exclusive to my channel and the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.769
 channel of best friends because this rock 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.210
 he is working on it for 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.250
 move forward the Spanish community 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.589
 debate in cinema and Latin American and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.850
 I wanted to put my two cents in the 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.070
 only topic that I more or less understand 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.840
 that are the sleepers so without further 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.280
 dilated step to comment the subject that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.400
 we are concerned today how to do quiz cops 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.870
 in battlefield 3 by the way what comes out 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.190
 background is a pretty random game 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.530
 that I had kept there so we 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.800
 I scratched and you know pay more attention to what 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.110
 which it is the story of how you quiz com 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.620
 The theory of the click is simple and ancient 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.410
 from the counter 1.3 1.6 or asia that 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.570
 has already time and is to aim and just 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.800
 when the peephole is put on without passing 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.600
 a second to throw a shot and load 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.850
 someone and remove the peephole quickly 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.259
 up there all simple there is no 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.000
 problem 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.470
 now you will tell me a lot and why do I have to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.479
 doing crisco when I can do it is 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.950
 coconut for a simple reason the no 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.170
 scott always has a variant 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.460
 quite random which is the dispersion 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.409
 of the bullet can go out for any 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.240
 side you can give yourself in one leg can 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.610
 enter the moon or like a penalty is 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.340
 we explore then the quick what it does 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.050
 is to avoid that that random form that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.700
 when closing the cross that makes the bullet 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.990
 only that there is for that site then it is 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.300
 easier to give people making a 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.630
 cuit that a surly also depends on the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.630
 distance 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.780
 good what we go that I roll more 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.110
 that a bitch or do quiz crops 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.110
 fil 3 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.609
 to be able to do quixen butterfield 3 what 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.200
 first thing to do is put the 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.909
 enemy between the cross that only the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.009
 These are white stripes that mark 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.740
 where he has given us they danced and once 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.240
 you have square without moving to aim 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.920
 just when the zen mood of 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.850
 aimed shoot and just when 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.950
 you finish shooting remove the peephole 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.020
 these these are made easier if 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.489
 you wear the laser because it decreases 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.989
 remarkably the cros drops and makes you 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.310
 much easier to frame the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.840
 enemies 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.400
 that's the Cusco does not have anything else 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.870
 and now I'm going to tell you about the little 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.849
 trick that there is for textile clothes 3 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.129
 frame and fit several weeks 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.250
 followed and the crossfire is fixed 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.350
 look, it's okay, you do not see it well 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.000
 look now after pasting the first 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.100
 shot looks at the positioning of the cross 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.810
 hair is completely closed that 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.190
 indicates just what the weapon is pointing at 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.570
 then the only thing you have to do 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.850
 is while doing the animation 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.890
 of the bolt the cross to that is closed 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.200
 and you just have to point to 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.970
 next enemy to be able to fit 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.709
 several weeks in a row and has nothing 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.330
 more and that's a little trick that 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.210
 susan beats filtres to make some 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.190
 gusts of wikis quite pretty bad 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.570
 have you think that with this trick you 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.070
 do only the weeks have to have 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.300
 skill you know so it works out 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.620
 all this you have to practice and 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.440
 practice it and practice it if you're not going to 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.330
 remain a bank 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.370
 Well now I 'm going to tell you a couple of 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.990
 little things that are logical to know the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.850
 peephole you can put the one that comes out of the 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.940
 ass of iron cloth to that of porta 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.160
 24 x 40 for which you want for 12 the one 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.780
 ye do not care all that I say 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.640
 that with the peephole of x 8 is more 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.010
 nice that is the only thing is more aesthetic 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.720
 because the minority part is put 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.550
 then another little thing that the two best 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.200
 Weapons to click are the sv because 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.730
 is the best shot from hip has 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.590
 and I'm not 40 because that's what the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.540
 work faster and you will notice that 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.110
 the circuit is much easier 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.430
 nothing else 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.230
 this is all I hope you liked 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.730
 that has served you above all and good 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.920
 now it happens to you to put a mini assembly you 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.490
 have if you like it and such good because we 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.490
 we see trunk
