00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.259
 which I will explain tub Viru 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.829
 makeup since they start to 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.829
 make up 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.500
 diabetes so having a hairstyle a 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.500
 little more elaborate of the same 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.540
 hello so today I want to tell you about 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.720
 my night routine in this season of 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.700
 autumn and I usually spend my afternoons 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.950
 recording videos and that can be inside 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.230
 from the house but it can also be outside 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.910
 so it's tango and recorded and usually 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.530
 I take advantage of doing any diligence that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.840
 have to do at the same time 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.269
 I record and when it came to the house what 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.400
 I do is run and I go directly to 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.379
 bathroom because I'm always doing 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.750
 crisis as soon as I arrive at my house but 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.360
 once I'm in charge of that I leave the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.979
 things on the kitchen table is 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.080
 super bad habit I feel it is a 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.750
 little disastrous but good that 's what 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.300
 I do and of course I take away the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.740
 shoes I think that's one of the 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.810
 best things to get to your house that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 I can say goodbye to shoes and I 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.300
 I always charge stockings as extras that are 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.520
 supposedly somewhat uncomfortable people 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.320
 almost always arrived starving 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.150
 I like to eat a snack that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.210
 ideally it should be something healthy 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.250
 but most of the time it is not and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.500
 here grab with a marker that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.860
 coincidentally my case would be those of 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.810
 pacheta and tastes delicious 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.570
 I also take the opportunity to learn some 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.910
 candle and this one is called autumn and it smells good 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.040
 we did and have my whole house between 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.070
 as an environment and that the night is 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.110
 received with a good tone 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.240
 He also took the opportunity to sit down 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.320
 the computer and how I just got there what 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.880
 What I do is watch videos on facebook 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.800
 basically things that entertain me and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.350
 be fun for me to relax a 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.150
 little too yes that my computer 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.530
 currently it is super bad and I think that 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.119
 I need another one because you 're always 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.979
 take off as a blow to make it work 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.780
 of coal and eventually it works and 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.550
 I can see all the things in the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.650
 wonderful world of the interpreter 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.900
 foundation I realize that I have hours there 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.390
 it's time to take off my makeup 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.430
 but before guitar makeup to me 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.410
 I always like to pick up my hair 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.300
 a tail because always one hundred thousand 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.140
 hair with that is everywhere and 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.540
 I now feel that I do not have 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.160
 very long so they take them out and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.870
 also if it's not too cold you need 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.000
 the jacket because I feel like there's 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.580
 many things about me and how can we 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.560
 to be of rebÃ³n here since with a 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.330
 make-up remover from the pharmacy and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.550
 honestly I do not always do the best 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.320
 I work because there are times that I am super 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.810
 tired so I just do it very 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.910
 very fast and the next morning I have 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.550
 Makeup residues and dark circles that are 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.140
 caused by the eyeliner for me 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.700
 face i use make-up remover wipes 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.920
 because they are super 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.599
 fast to use but again 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.459
 have the same problem as sometimes 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.220
 there are residues on my face that do not 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.280
 they should be there now comes the best 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.769
 part of my life 15 remove mind you 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.099
 it feels too divine and all the 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.300
 girls we can live that 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.280
 after that what I do is jump to the 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.200
 shower and not every day I wash the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.019
 hair but this day is already necessary 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.940
 take it about three times a week and 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.580
 when I'm in the fight I take advantage of 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.980
 clean my face is that I use my 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.720
 Facial cleanser comes every day and 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.900
 I feel that when I apply it in the shower 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.000
 Saving water time and it's also like more 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.650
 rich i use a soon for the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.360
 hair that are salt-free because 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.000
 I have keratin treatment and it's 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.920
 the same shampoo and conditioner only 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.660
 that the container in conditioner I do not know 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.730
 what did I do but super bible service 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.440
 because it has a super weird presentation 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.510
 I had never seen shampoo and 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.130
 conditioner that come like that seems more 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.750
 good with a cream but they are super rich 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.890
 and apart from a good very well and for 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.079
 course I also love to use 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.630
 these exfoliating victories and that 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.130
 because they have fabulous textures and 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.780
 besides super python 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.970
 once I get out of the shower I love it 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.980
 hydrate my body once and they are 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.900
 using this cream that comes spray 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.150
 because I have an allergy in my test 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.950
 earlier so this does not have 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.200
 to touch both the cream because the time 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.360
 that they leave their hands is something super weird 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.250
 but it 's a baby cream and half super 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.710
 well with her also of course the 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.360
 deodorant can not miss and then I 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.400
 change my pajamas I am now 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.840
 obsessed with using these pajamas 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.450
 that combines at the top and the 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.580
 from below that is super cuchis but before 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.040
 I slept with whatever is like that with a 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.840
 old pants from an old shirt but 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.110
 Now I like to see myself a little better 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.390
 hostel 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.700
 my face cream I keep close to 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.260
 my bed so he applied on the bed and 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.630
 I'm using is a nibia 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.060
 that is super good leaves my face with 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.430
 baby skin of course I'm also going to 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.080
 touch my lips and then I'll move on 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.820
 bring my hair closer because if I sleep with 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.550
 wet hair I will wake up with a 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.990
 cold that's something that always happens 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.180
 and while you see that, I like the hair 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.640
 see a movie a series is like my 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.500
 relaxing moment but I have to put myself 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.940
 hearing aids because the dryer is too 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.840
 noisy and if it's not like 'mission 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.800
 impossible' 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.450
 I used to read 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.620
 subtitles but then I thought you're in 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.890
 the idea our position on what 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.840
 happened before and now of scenarios and 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.540
 I try to eat healthy things like 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.420
 proteins and vegetables try that's not 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.280
 always but I'm eating asparagus and 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.720
 these asparagus are giant never 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.390
 seen for our thanks in my life 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.580
 and what I did to cook his pan 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.740
 which is super fast cause need 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.090
 supervision and also accompanies it with 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.280
 fish that made the fish 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.470
 I do not know if I'm just me these dinners are 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.100
 super rich 300 that never fill me 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.320
 full 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.290
 me when I fish like a lot 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.960
 lemon and I love it tastes divine but I 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.400
 I'm left as it is here for cookies 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.810
 there are usually some series 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.820
 of people I'm watching the Rioja 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.190
 how many chelsea and just for the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.139
 second season but then he will put the 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.479
 day because I see her seriously almost all 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.340
 the days after that it 's time to 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.500
 sit down on a computer and work a 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.020
 little bit so what I do is work 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.240
 in editing videos and usually what more 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.580
 crimes are my daily blogs for 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.490
 edit them at night and then the morning 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.229
 Next to publish me after 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.330
 that it's time to sleep it costs you 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.310
 missing the eyes but always this is 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:25.050
 loses teeth and also even 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:27.300
 dental floss that you asked for but it is necessary 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.590
 and he used this is the bleach that 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.539
 What I do is place it on these 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.759
 retainers that have the mold of my 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.650
 teeth and they help me keep their shape 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.449
 and with use the seller also 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.729
 Help them to be super white daily 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:41.490
 Next after him throughout the 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.020
 night and we go to bed I need 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.030
 put on stockings before sleeping because 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.979
 I feel that the holidays are very free and 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.620
 I can not sleep but from the means I go to 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.810
 spend the night without sleep and what I do 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.610
 is to sleep is to check my phone and I see 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.669
 pages that are fun for me is 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.400
 so cute that I relax and seriously I do 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:01.650
 this is basically the time that is 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.780
 until I get really sleepy and 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.000
 When my eyes are closing I know that 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.879
 can you say good night so 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.590
 good night girl I hope this brings 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:13.490
 this idea once lives were made 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.490
 here the human failure
