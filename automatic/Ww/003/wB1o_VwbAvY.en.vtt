 Hi, my name is Jurek 

00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:07.567
 I provide instruction when it comes to cat. A. 

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:17.979
 Today I would like to present a Yamaha XJ6 motorcycle, which is used in the Provincial Traffic Center 

00:00:17.979 --> 00:00:25.351
 during the examination and I would like to discuss, so to speak, the basic elements that we have to check on 

00:00:25.827 --> 00:00:26.779
 maneuvering square. 

00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:35.933
 Start by checking the chain tension, it works between one wheel. and the other wheel. 

00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:46.066
 In the middle, the chain deflection should be between 4.5 and 5.5 cm, if there is more, the chain will be too loose 

00:00:46.572 --> 00:00:50.469
 if there is less, the chain will be too tight. 

00:00:51.107 --> 00:00:57.236
 After checking the chain tension, we must be able to indicate the lights. 

00:00:57.782 --> 00:01:00.553
 We will discuss all the lights from the beginning. 

00:01:01.018 --> 00:01:07.329
 The first light that we must be able to show is the position light. 

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:12.628
 It is activated after turning the ignition switch, it determines the position of the motorcycle on the road. 

00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:19.584
 The front is white, the back is red. 

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:28.118
 It should be mentioned that the position light also illuminates the white license plate. 

00:01:29.098 --> 00:01:33.891
 Another light that we must be able to point is the passing beam. 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:44.590
 The passing beam in this motorcycle is switched on from the machine, i.e. to start it, we need to start the motorcycle. 

00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:51.610
 We start the motorcycle and show in front that the passing beam is here. 

00:01:53.193 --> 00:01:59.400
 Another light that we have to present is the traffic light. 

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:06.880
 We must know that the traffic light is activated with the passing lights, ie the motorcycle is still moving. 

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:17.000
 The switch switches from dipped beam to road and road lights are activated by the switch on the left. 

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:21.590
 Another light that we must be able to present is the direction-indicator light. 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.240
 At the beginning we present a turn signal on the left front, a turn signal on the left rear. 

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:42.500
 Then the right-hand turn signal at the rear, the right-hand turn signal at the front. 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:53.610
 We must also be able to show the emergency lights - with this switch we turn on emergency lights. 

00:02:54.224 --> 00:03:01.960
 The back is on the right and on the left, on the front also on the right and on the left. 

00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:07.150
 Another light is stop brake light. 

00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:13.780
 The brake light is signaled by lighting the red lamp at the rear. 

00:03:14.331 --> 00:03:24.460
 It is activated from the foot brake and activated from the handbrake. 

00:03:25.524 --> 00:03:32.880
 If we have discussed all the lights, we still have to sound the signal. 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.450
 And then indication of operating fluids.
