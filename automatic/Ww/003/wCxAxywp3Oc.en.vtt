00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 so your today for a whole the 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.359
 video a creation of the kills so this 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780
 will be for a low cost small team 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.660
 budget brazil our rare I play in 4 2 3 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.950
 1 so a team within everyone's reach 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.690
 so you're going to tell me yes you're the ones 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.369
 credits why are not you doing the pure 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.750
 to the teams bah just for 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.980
 diversify a little bit I wanted 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.240
 to leave on equipment not very 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.500
 very dear I thought why not 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.119
 a rare neighbor I have not tested 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.260
 a lot of players and it is 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.830
 that this team is pretty good 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.099
 still 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.850
 so we'll start with the caretaker 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.879
 goal that played fluminense it's diego 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 cavalieri bought for 350 credit I the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.200
 still finds correct 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.239
 it's clear that it's a guardian 80 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.890
 general will have but frankly he does 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.170
 largely the taf 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.539
 then we will put the two defenders 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.640
 central so we at roanne solves this 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.699
 central defender of ter line and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 then manoel central defender of the ace 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.350
 kiko by the INSEE we will start with 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.789
 me christmas that I got in a step that 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.189
 he has 75 general are able to when 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.010
 even largely stats at the top so 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.340
 in 96 76 of defense and his system of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.260
 heads 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 frankly it is very very good you 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.350
 to have it for 400 credit maximum then 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.270
 roy the network bought for 500 credits a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.470
 small 78.2 general are nineteen of 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.600
 restricted head defense are smooth the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.400
 speed so see he spun stage 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.619
 still far above his 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.150
 general and him frankly it's a 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.759
 bomb I advise you all and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.759
 enough raptor and physically 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.869
 plus it's a southpaw then in 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.159
 left defender 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.560
 so I took adriano the defender 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.630
 left of the barca who bought for 450 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.030
 credit there are five stars bad foot 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.170
 still good he makes the taf 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.869
 after that I might have taken with 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.220
 sandro but now I've taken a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.950
 other player from 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.000
 and fc porto danilo who has him 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 frankly is very very good buy 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.410
 for 450 credits pro it's a gesture 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.960
 technique in addition to a side was 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.990
 do not neglect it anymore when we see 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.780
 his performance therefore in defense which means 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.940
 is rare in high attack for me for 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.679
 a lateral know that's really good I 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.810
 a team that's pretty solid so 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.090
 frankly there's no problem they 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.980
 show quite easily he can do 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.590
 why not a lot of good centers 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.940
 here I advise you all then 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.730
 so for the defensive midfield 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.280
 I took 1 of manchester city 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.360
 which cost me almost half of 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.180
 the credits of the team is for you 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.430
 say and the other of the sporting so we 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.010
 will start with process elias 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.550
 technical already for a defensive midfielder 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.500
 good it's still that 80 speed are 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.480
 here defensively frankly it's pretty 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.100
 are going to buy for 400 credit to I you 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.290
 advise everyone in more good there is 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.740
 not really possible choices to his 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.820
 post apart perhaps fernando I speak 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.100
 in map will of course have 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.130
 so here it is largely the sphere 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.810
 then fernandinho bought for 3900 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.670
 credit so roughly 4000 if you 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.590
 prefer it's clear that it's expensive 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.450
 because he is she knows basic 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.090
 I had with a style card in addition 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.590
 so frankly honestly if you 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.500
 buy a mc and it does not cost much 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.480
 no more so if you just take it off 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.340
 that makes the team cost you a little 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.010
 less than five minutes credit is yes 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.450
 if you have a map m and it's in 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.010
 your club so frankly no problem 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.470
 on it is really very very good 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.830
 four stars of bad foot 83 of 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.500
 speed 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.459
 Pocket 83 frankly there are stadiums 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.100
 very very good novel 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.160
 then at the post of m also we will have 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.209
 already the 4th rise and while I am 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.230
 remember how exactly I disposed 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.870
 it seems like 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:46.019
 firmino I put here so rafael initialed 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.000
 roberto firmino rather bought for 300 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.010
 4-star credit of technical gestures 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.200
 look at me this beautiful because everything 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.019
 simply my friend two goals a pass 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.459
 decisive it is largely correct I 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.519
 find at least very very good this player 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.040
 hoffenheim then in a nutshell it's up to 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.129
 left it seems to me that I douglas 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.670
 costa and in a word it's right 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.760
 I put a raphael raphael which is 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.870
 very very good kind of gladbach who has 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.970
 four floors and his cliques and new 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.690
 foot at a fairly correct speed a 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.609
 little bit like firmino so here's a 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.710
 goal and a live pass in six matches 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.910
 bought for 350 credit they love me 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.220
 very very nice goal and more so 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.220
 frankly I enjoyed it anyway 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.750
 raphael douglas costa the player of the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.570
 shakhtar 4 and the pink technical gesture 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.690
 2.415 speed are 12 10 rebounds 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.190
 it's ok enough 350 credit is 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.720
 clear that the team will not spit fire 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.610
 no more but it is very correct for 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.380
 those who are not too much credit 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.450
 who want to change their minds a 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.400
 little bit at the level and the teams that 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.720
 want to test a lot of players I 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.800
 you advise her especially for that so 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.360
 goals in a match 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.250
 it's clear as after you go go 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.370
 tell me it's super wind players 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.560
 they are good to them without more so there 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.090
 already have passed to the best player of 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.639
 the team so simply wellington 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.410
 good all in town we know one about 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.150
 barrels 12 barrels 13 have been cited by 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.919
 the good past now the war he 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.349
 has a little less it's gone our 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.539
 rare but still very very 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.800
 good stats bought for 4,100 credits 4 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.720
 bad foot 4 stars and paul gesture 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.740
 technique honestly he is very very 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.669
 good 4 goals in 6 games it's okay 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.280
 especially since I did I believe a 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.440
 work that I did to him but 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.060
 which does not prevent 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.580
 when you go to the kohn decrease team 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.020
 can not do much but when you 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.720
 against teams at your fingertips 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.710
 the team is still good 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.110
 little things which frankly 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.610
 wellington nothing to say about it pts 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.620
 so here I hope that this little 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.030
 team supports you these cases I you 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.520
 invite to leave a little like a 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.230
 commented to tell me if you have you 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.610
 to do the team or if I could have 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.220
 change some small players that's 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.980
 clear that I was able to miss out on two 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.160
 small ones also lose his pairs that not 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.450
 badly ignites a rare so here I hope 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.220
 what you liked is what we used 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.550
 left on this little compilation of 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.540
 goal 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.540
