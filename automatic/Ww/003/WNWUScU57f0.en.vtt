 important is the participation of the choir 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.810
 at a wedding the choir is an element 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.450
 essential in the bridal liturgy is part 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.640
 integral of the wedding liturgy because 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.520
 fulfills the task of being the ministry 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.290
 musical of the ceremony is to say no 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.030
 only do the songs the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.730
 we do with that lyrical level that everyone 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.989
 we know but we also develop 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.300
 the responses of the liturgy 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.750
 acts have to be answered by the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.339
 chorus to motivate to incentivize 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.800
 invited to also be 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.990
 active participants as well as the 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.659
 of prayers and do that motivation 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.250
 so that it is also well recorded 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.590
 answer in the wedding video what are 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.350
 the songs that are sung an average of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.510
 14 songs we do at the ceremony because 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.720
 we sing the full mass of the voice 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.680
 during the ceremony there is a protocol 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.490
 what is 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.920
 that many times is not known and sometimes 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.200
 the couple have no idea and that is a 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 plus that you give to the subject of 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.400
 advise them is that we have a 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.860
 label and protocol advisor for each 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.860
 church with wedding planner or green bay 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.710
 that they have with those who are going to read 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.570
 readings that will read requests with 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.090
 the witnesses so that they are located in 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.700
 your specific place and do not go to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.440

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.360
 coordination with the photographer and forget 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.060
 is for it to fit so that it lacks 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.680
 triumphal entry that we do musical of the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.509

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.000
