00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.160
 the country never fails in design and also the pet cap 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.860
 minnetjes became the picture being his 170 blatter the stylish kent rival almere 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.939
 Outside 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.820
 it is not just a cheap labor three or groups from the fourth but it 

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.980
 design is no different what is more in line with the new iphone 5 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.599
 also at the front and now see a lot with large ipad the edges are namely 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.419
 very much thinner 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.480
 that very cool the park also immediately the problem because if you go with a 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.860
 If you are stuck with someone else, you will soon be out with your thumb 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.500
 the couple thought of that 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.910
 You simply cannot sit on the ice with you there and then you have 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.910
 it still 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.520
 with this card this ipad mini is largely the same as the ipad 2 that 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.360
 has been around for a while 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.010
 none and 7 kommer 9 in certina a screen so that wooden bat 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 maybe in your pocket for the next generation if you have a retina 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.370
 screen are used for example from the ipad 3 yes and then you might like it 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.720
 difficult to switch back after 1024 by 768 pixels 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.820
 of this ipad mini 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.840
 but it is not the case then you will have a very beautiful look 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.040
 enschede 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 The processor is also the same as that of the iPad 2 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.760
 in short, the elimination is not exactly a speed sample 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.560
 but in practice you don't notice that much 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.020
 nevertheless he indicates that you have to think a bit if you scott very quickly 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.320
 on the webpage 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.660
 Also the loading of a heavy game may be longer per second 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.560
 but when it comes to the mark, it is still very nice 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.049
 the services that are optimal for Google are also a pioneering role 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.049
 the test 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.940
 the city center 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.470
 but I keep having a larger nine commercial agreement it was 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.710
 soon chose formsma as I never want to visit them 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.100
 is using this but I don't know how much threshold 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.600
 if you now send home and mail twente wanted to check if you want a game 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 Yes play a bargain really for this broadcast 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.899
 in short you will not get the highest resolution and not the most powerful 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:18.669
 processor but then I get the ipad that mostly singer and who is probably there 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.579
 pack much faster 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.059
 the broadcast is therefore also a 4 star 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:27.209
 but four stars, because the hefty selling prices score well anyway 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.079
 ever 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.979
 model is available from â‚¬ 349 million the most expensive with 64 gigabytes on 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.209
 memory and 3g that I am going here 660 euros 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.609
 Whether or not it is also a buyer is still a bit off how you look at it 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.189
 are you looking for a compact tablet then you can also for much less money 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.159
 we ended up buying 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.329
 with practical self-assurance 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.760
 where are you really looking for the user experience of the ipad m a 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.049
 malian to the highest specifications 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.049
 yes then you have this little one 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.259
 to be 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:03.979
