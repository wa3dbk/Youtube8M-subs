so<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.529> zerg<00:00:31.800> vs<00:00:32.189> terran

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so this is going to be zerg vs terran

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.130 
so this is going to be zerg vs terran
and<00:00:32.669> now<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:32.850> already<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.719> overload

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and now we already see this overload

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.290 
and now we already see this overload
making<00:00:34.590> its<00:00:34.710> way<00:00:34.770> across<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.489> chasm<00:00:35.790> here

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
making its way across this chasm here

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780 
making its way across this chasm here
and<00:00:36.450> will<00:00:37.020> quickly<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.559> able<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:38.040> see<00:00:38.309> where

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and will quickly be able to see where

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.240 
and will quickly be able to see where
exactly<00:00:39.059> drew<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.719> Andrew<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:41.040> his

exactly drew be is Andrew be with his

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.520 
exactly drew be is Andrew be with his
amazing<00:00:42.149> deductive<00:00:42.570> skills<00:00:42.660> will<00:00:43.050> also<00:00:43.350> know

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
amazing deductive skills will also know

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.130 
amazing deductive skills will also know
where<00:00:43.739> morale<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.700> well<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.480> moral<00:00:45.870> will<00:00:46.020> be

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
where morale is as well so moral will be

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
where morale is as well so moral will be
coming<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.680> will<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.219> try<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> pull<00:00:47.700> back<00:00:47.910> with

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
coming in will we try to pull back with

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.420 
coming in will we try to pull back with
this<00:00:48.390> overlord<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.379> time<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.920> order<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this overlord just in time in order to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
this overlord just in time in order to
not<00:00:50.610> reveal<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.449> Overlord<00:00:51.840> note<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> does<00:00:52.320> oh

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
not reveal the Overlord note it does oh

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.830 
not reveal the Overlord note it does oh
I<00:00:53.280> believe<00:00:53.399> he<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.030> actually<00:00:54.300> able<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.600> pull

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
I believe he was actually able to pull

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.110 
I believe he was actually able to pull
back<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.649> time<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.190> he<00:00:56.370> may<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.640> able<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
back just in time so he may be able to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.420 
back just in time so he may be able to
hide<00:00:57.989> his<00:00:58.199> location<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.800> quite<00:00:58.980> some<00:00:59.129> time<00:00:59.160> as

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
hide his location for quite some time as

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029 
hide his location for quite some time as
long<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.879> send<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> drone<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.620> he<00:01:01.770> sends

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
long as you send out a drone if he sends

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.860 
long as you send out a drone if he sends
out<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> drone<00:01:02.670> then<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.030> drone<00:01:03.300> will<00:01:03.539> make<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
out a drone then that drone will make it

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.010 
out a drone then that drone will make it
seem<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:04.860> he<00:01:05.760> did<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.090> spawn<00:01:06.479> over<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.900> this

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
seem like he did not spawn over in this

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.179 
seem like he did not spawn over in this
location<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.710> now<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
location here we now see that the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
location here we now see that the
overload<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.700> hiding<00:01:09.090> beyond<00:01:09.450> these<00:01:09.990> dark

to<00:01:35.729> morale<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.479> trying<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> come<00:01:37.020> back<00:01:37.110> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
to morale is just trying to come back in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
to morale is just trying to come back in
and<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.710> comes<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.220> dro<00:01:38.549> now<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.000> this

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and now in comes this dro now so this

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.580 
and now in comes this dro now so this
drone<00:01:39.390> coming<00:01:39.689> around<00:01:39.840> from<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.170> side<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
drone coming around from this side and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.190 
drone coming around from this side and
we'll<00:01:41.100> quickly<00:01:41.250> come<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.180> ramp<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.689> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
we'll quickly come up this ramp and this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
we'll quickly come up this ramp and this
SCV<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> lot<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.369> walking<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.180> before<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
SCV has a lot of walking to do before it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.050 
SCV has a lot of walking to do before it
figures<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.829> exactly<00:01:47.189> moro<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
figures out where exactly moro is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.450 
figures out where exactly moro is
meanwhile<00:01:48.869> back<00:01:49.110> over<00:01:49.380> here<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:49.799> see<00:01:50.040> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
meanwhile back over here we now see that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.399 
meanwhile back over here we now see that
there<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.759> no<00:01:51.119> VES<00:01:51.420> being<00:01:51.630> geysers<00:01:51.990> down<00:01:52.170> by

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
there are no VES being geysers down by

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.859 
there are no VES being geysers down by
Drew<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.280> taking<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.640> look<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
Drew be so taking a look at this and it

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.030 
Drew be so taking a look at this and it
looks<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.140> he's<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> try<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
looks like he's going to try to do a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.789 
looks like he's going to try to do a
fast<00:01:56.399> expansion<00:01:56.820> attempt<00:01:57.270> over<00:01:57.930> here<00:01:58.259> down<00:01:58.770> in

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
fast expansion attempt over here down in

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.950 
fast expansion attempt over here down in
this<00:01:59.250> location<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> spawning

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this location we do not see a spawning

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.480 
this location we do not see a spawning
pool<00:02:01.290> coming<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.680> from<00:02:01.829> moral<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.310> quite<00:02:02.460> yet

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
pool coming in from moral just quite yet

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.520 
pool coming in from moral just quite yet
so<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.450> fast<00:02:03.659> expansion<00:02:03.960> attempt<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.500> be

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
so that fast expansion attempt will be

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.260 
so that fast expansion attempt will be
able<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.189> successful<00:02:05.310> no<00:02:05.759> no<00:02:06.000> fast

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
able to be successful no no fast

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.180 
able to be successful no no fast
expansion<00:02:06.600> attempt<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.439> not<00:02:07.680> exactly<00:02:08.099> sure

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
expansion attempt so not exactly sure

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.639 
expansion attempt so not exactly sure
why<00:02:08.580> he's<00:02:08.789> sitting<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.119> 160<00:02:09.840> minerals<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.410> far

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
why he's sitting on 160 minerals so far

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.420 
why he's sitting on 160 minerals so far
in

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
in

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.069 
in
you<00:02:11.459> tried<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.969> build<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.209> command<00:02:12.569> center<00:02:12.659> here

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
you tried to build a command center here

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.050 
you tried to build a command center here
and<00:02:13.530> then<00:02:13.680> trying<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.129> double<00:02:14.519> I'm<00:02:14.730> training

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and then trying the double I'm training

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.610 
and then trying the double I'm training
up<00:02:15.209> some<00:02:15.359> more<00:02:15.510> SUV<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.079> get<00:02:16.230> up<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.439> full

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
up some more SUV to get up to full

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.550 
up some more SUV to get up to full
saturation<00:02:17.329> as<00:02:18.329> we<00:02:18.719> now<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> drone

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
saturation as we now have a drone

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.009 
saturation as we now have a drone
activating<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.400> L<00:02:20.609> noggle<00:02:20.939> watchtower<00:02:21.329> but

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
activating this L noggle watchtower but

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.110 
activating this L noggle watchtower but
an<00:02:22.079> extractor<00:02:22.530> already<00:02:22.920> am<00:02:23.280> nearly<00:02:23.640> completed

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
an extractor already am nearly completed

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.149 
an extractor already am nearly completed
and<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:24.719> Marines<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.409> currently<00:02:25.859> being

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
and now Marines are currently being

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.000 
and now Marines are currently being
trained<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:26.909> well<00:02:27.269> but<00:02:27.719> only<00:02:28.049> one<00:02:28.290> rack<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:28.799> far

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
trained as well but only one rack so far

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.559 
trained as well but only one rack so far
so<00:02:29.189> this<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.519> little<00:02:29.849> bit<00:02:29.939> of<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.090> curious

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
so this is a little bit of a curious

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.599 
so this is a little bit of a curious
billed<00:02:30.810> as<00:02:31.019> now<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.620> an<00:02:31.769> SC<00:02:32.099> making<00:02:32.489> its
