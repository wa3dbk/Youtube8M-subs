the<00:00:02.810> power<00:00:02.959> chords<00:00:03.350> team<00:00:03.590> today<00:00:04.220> we're<00:00:04.370> going

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.490 
the power chords team today we're going

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.220 
the power chords team today we're going
to<00:00:04.580> talk<00:00:04.760> a<00:00:04.790> little<00:00:05.060> bit<00:00:05.270> about<00:00:05.300> brake<00:00:05.870> cord

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
to talk a little bit about brake cord

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.199 
to talk a little bit about brake cord
safety<00:00:06.830> this<00:00:07.250> applies<00:00:07.580> whether<00:00:07.880> you're<00:00:08.029> using

safety this applies whether you're using

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.049 
safety this applies whether you're using
power<00:00:08.690> cords<00:00:09.139> or<00:00:09.559> steel<00:00:10.009> brakes<00:00:10.639> but<00:00:10.879> it's

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
power cords or steel brakes but it's

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.390 
power cords or steel brakes but it's
really<00:00:11.419> important<00:00:11.869> consideration<00:00:12.589> and<00:00:13.249> we've

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
really important consideration and we've

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.129 
really important consideration and we've
never<00:00:13.610> had<00:00:13.849> an<00:00:14.030> accident<00:00:14.419> here<00:00:14.690> with<00:00:14.839> any<00:00:14.990> of

never had an accident here with any of
our<00:00:15.259> power<00:00:15.469> cords<00:00:15.860> products<00:00:16.309> but<00:00:16.970> we<00:00:17.540> want<00:00:17.750> to

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
our power cords products but we want to

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.380 
our power cords products but we want to
keep<00:00:17.930> it<00:00:18.110> that<00:00:18.230> way<00:00:18.260> so<00:00:19.130> we're<00:00:20.120> gonna<00:00:20.240> look

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
keep it that way so we're gonna look

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.270 
keep it that way so we're gonna look
today<00:00:20.690> at<00:00:20.930> a<00:00:21.350> couple<00:00:21.620> of<00:00:21.710> techniques<00:00:21.920> we<00:00:22.250> can

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
today at a couple of techniques we can

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.250 
today at a couple of techniques we can
do<00:00:22.490> to<00:00:22.610> keep<00:00:22.790> safe<00:00:23.060> including<00:00:23.960> visual

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
do to keep safe including visual

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.290 
do to keep safe including visual
inspections<00:00:24.980> learning<00:00:25.490> how<00:00:25.580> to<00:00:25.610> brake<00:00:25.880> with

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
inspections learning how to brake with

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.470 
inspections learning how to brake with
the<00:00:26.540> front<00:00:26.990> brake<00:00:27.140> only<00:00:27.440> and<00:00:28.120> give<00:00:29.120> it<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:29.300> hard

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
the front brake only and give it a hard

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.600 
the front brake only and give it a hard
squeeze<00:00:29.780> before<00:00:30.260> we<00:00:30.320> go<00:00:30.470> for<00:00:30.680> a<00:00:30.710> ride<00:00:30.890> we<00:00:31.460> also

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
squeeze before we go for a ride we also

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.910 
squeeze before we go for a ride we also
look<00:00:31.940> at<00:00:32.090> when<00:00:32.599> it<00:00:32.630> becomes<00:00:33.020> time<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.620> replace

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
look at when it becomes time to replace

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.860 
look at when it becomes time to replace
your<00:00:33.980> brake<00:00:34.280> boards<00:00:34.610> now<00:00:35.390> when<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.630> brake

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
your brake boards now when a brake

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.569 
your brake boards now when a brake
failure<00:00:35.900> happens<00:00:36.650> it's<00:00:36.860> most<00:00:37.100> likely<00:00:37.250> going

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
failure happens it's most likely going

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.190 
failure happens it's most likely going
to<00:00:37.760> happen<00:00:37.970> at<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:38.360> rear<00:00:38.570> brake<00:00:38.930> that's

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
to happen at the rear brake that's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200 
to happen at the rear brake that's
because<00:00:39.560> the<00:00:39.950> typical<00:00:40.190> rider<00:00:40.640> puts<00:00:41.000> more

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
because the typical rider puts more

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.790 
because the typical rider puts more
pressure<00:00:41.450> on<00:00:41.900> their<00:00:42.050> rear<00:00:42.260> brake<00:00:42.500> than<00:00:42.710> they

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
pressure on their rear brake than they

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.920 
pressure on their rear brake than they
do<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.070> front<00:00:43.310> and<00:00:43.489> it's<00:00:43.610> also<00:00:43.790> actuated<00:00:44.540> more

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
do the front and it's also actuated more

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.260 
do the front and it's also actuated more
often<00:00:45.380> so<00:00:45.980> that's<00:00:46.489> why<00:00:46.700> we<00:00:46.970> need<00:00:47.120> the

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
often so that's why we need the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.690 
often so that's why we need the
technique<00:00:47.960> of<00:00:48.230> knowing<00:00:48.710> how<00:00:48.829> to<00:00:48.890> brake<00:00:49.190> on<00:00:49.520> our

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
technique of knowing how to brake on our

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.819 
technique of knowing how to brake on our
front<00:00:50.030> brake<00:00:50.270> even<00:00:50.899> if<00:00:50.989> we're<00:00:51.170> really<00:00:51.500> going

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
front brake even if we're really going

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.950 
front brake even if we're really going
fast<00:00:52.130> on<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.520> steep<00:00:52.820> downhill<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:53.750> it's<00:00:53.899> an

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
fast on a steep downhill so it's an

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.330 
fast on a steep downhill so it's an
important<00:00:54.350> thing<00:00:54.380> to<00:00:54.590> practice<00:00:54.770> while<00:00:55.190> you're

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
important thing to practice while you're

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.040 
important thing to practice while you're
out<00:00:55.430> there<00:00:55.610> doing<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.910> normal<00:00:56.030> ride<00:00:56.390> now

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
out there doing a normal ride now

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.130 
out there doing a normal ride now
secondly<00:00:57.500> before<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.700> major<00:00:58.850> ride<00:00:59.210> we<00:00:59.809> can<00:00:59.989> give

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
secondly before a major ride we can give

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.190 
secondly before a major ride we can give
the<00:01:00.290> brakes<00:01:00.530> an<00:01:00.950> extra<00:01:01.790> hard<00:01:02.000> squeeze<00:01:02.420> what

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
the brakes an extra hard squeeze what

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.289 
the brakes an extra hard squeeze what
this<00:01:03.410> allows<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:03.950> happen<00:01:04.159> is<00:01:04.519> for<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.089> brake

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
this allows to happen is for the brake

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.080 
this allows to happen is for the brake
to<00:01:05.479> fail<00:01:05.720> before<00:01:06.680> you're<00:01:06.950> out<00:01:07.100> riding<00:01:07.400> while

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
to fail before you're out riding while

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.390 
to fail before you're out riding while
you're<00:01:08.240> safe<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:08.750> standing<00:01:09.140> still<00:01:09.440> finally

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
you're safe and standing still finally

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.399 
you're safe and standing still finally
we<00:01:10.940> need<00:01:10.970> to<00:01:11.120> do<00:01:11.299> a<00:01:11.330> visual<00:01:11.570> inspection<00:01:11.780> before

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
we need to do a visual inspection before

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.350 
we need to do a visual inspection before
going<00:01:12.740> on<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:12.979> any<00:01:13.190> major<00:01:13.430> ride<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.180> that's

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
going on to any major ride and that's

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.700 
going on to any major ride and that's
also<00:01:14.750> we're<00:01:14.900> going<00:01:15.049> to<00:01:15.110> when<00:01:15.380> we're<00:01:15.560> going<00:01:15.650> to

also we're going to when we're going to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.770 
also we're going to when we're going to
find<00:01:15.979> out<00:01:16.159> when<00:01:16.610> it's<00:01:16.760> time<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.090> replace<00:01:17.570> your

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
find out when it's time to replace your

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.740 
find out when it's time to replace your
cords<00:01:18.369> when<00:01:19.369> we<00:01:19.490> consider<00:01:19.880> bicycle<00:01:20.390> cable
