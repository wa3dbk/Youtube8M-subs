00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
but you have three different powers for

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.640 
but you have three different powers for
each<00:02:24.880> one<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.450> have<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.600> salt<00:02:25.930> punch<00:02:26.260> medium

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
for the kick however the game's fatal

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.030 
for the kick however the game's fatal
flaw<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.990> way<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.320> controls<00:02:32.770> are
