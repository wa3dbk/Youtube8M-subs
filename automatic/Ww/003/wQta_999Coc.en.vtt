 unleashed and this is minecraft we are to 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.939
 Thursday and we are a seed day and 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.350
 Well, you're probably killing me 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.940
 like this' likes of everything then without seeing 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.640
 that yesterday I am not any 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.220
 video I do not have internet agreement today 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.949
 well, but I'm still recording and good 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.320
 as soon as I have internet, I'll upload 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.560
 all of hits that maybe tomorrow 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.009
 Friday or Saturday you are without 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.559
 eat it or drink it with 20 videos 120 not 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.840
 I'm exaggerating to see Wednesday Thursday 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.989
 Friday, Saturday, the odd extra for 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.879
 there or already pulling out more ties so 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.070
 seven videos hosted you find the 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.100
 Saturday one Friday morning if you leave me 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.019
 upload it is that I do not know I do not know what to do in 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.000
 end but nothing please because these 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.489
 failures occur and when they occur it is not 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 my fault and I can not do anything so 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.539
 Today's seed is special 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.880
 because it belongs to giving to these shops 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.680
 that came out the other day 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.350
 and well I think that you will be able to play 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.950
 in 1.7 I do not assure you and I do not know 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.720
 if it is 1.7 or version 1.6 point 3 is worth 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.320
 say that maybe we did not go to 7 and 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.970
 we stayed in 1.6 in green 2.3 that 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 is seeing insurance to not know if 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.420
 we pass when you meet and you go to 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.940
 show 1.6 point 3 is a 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.220
 ignorance totally good the 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:30.920
 next week less 66 64 95 47 23 21 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.260
 93 92 92 72 my mother very well blah blah 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.630
 bla all right back we are in creative 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.509
 Y 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.909
 and we started this site is special 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:44.200
 because we appear in a beautiful 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.930
 incredible new biome according to either 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.360
 is for you to know is fine and only yolk 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.240
 of the canyon ok and the canyon that is with 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.039
 cannons of agreement that are formed 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.890
 by the colorful clay that came out in 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.350
 the 1.6 or be great because estancilla 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.940
 It was a real horror to have to 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.630
 do it yourself 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.670
 and the truth is that it is great in principle 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.770
 this leads to characterize that 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.479
 they are dry trees after finding wood 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.330
 but come on, it's hard to find 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.680
 both wood and animal animals 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.810
 They gave great found me feeling 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.730
 that is like a desert type is worth and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.010
 well now let's teach a little bit 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.710
 from up here as you see basically 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.150
 it's like doing curves and curves and 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.580
 As if it were a cannon it is worth what you go 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.520
 find is pieces of desert with 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.030
 cactus we also go around there lost 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.380
 the odd tree and poquillo is better 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.310
 but good we are going to what we are going 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:47.280
 what is 3 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:47.280
 dp 164 46 minus 75 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:56.349
 so now 664 46 minus 75 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.720
 and we are going to take a portion 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.660
 and that has taken away music and sound 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.060
 see you later 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.160
 and this also 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.800
 it's funny I can not access 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.360
 and that I show we have to go there is that 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.640
 is a zombies respond according 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.850
 near where we started and 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.930
 we found a half that comes in handy 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.450
 for iron all life that is 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.840
 fantastic a music disc a 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.070
 super golden apple and a saddle 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.290
 iron 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.090
 the truth is that it is not bad that starts 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.310
 well in the rib here we have another 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:46.370
 disc plus one green discs and some of the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.819
 rest more 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.350
 Another advantage 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:56.290
 the saddle obviously and one ulna 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.510
 is a respond are wines that armor 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.110
 enchanted leather always ensured more 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.819
 delighted you are going to catch more potatoes and 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.420
 carrots you will also find 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.980
 for and some padilla and others and 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.510
 raw meat you are going to see also a lot 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.190
 so you see making zombie oranges 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.440
 brutal 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:26.380
 we go to another site pp minus 150 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:26.380
 except not here next 166 32 66 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.860
 all right 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.169
 this skeleton is so that already bows and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.910
 happy infinite infinite bones 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.530
 the subject of cultivation you already have it here 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.259
 with the bones so it's a wonder 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.300
 this answers writings and we find more 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:45.949
 iron according another music disc 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.509
 more rest another cube we have it here and 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.669
 more for now that we already have that 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.689
 powerful and super the truth that this 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:58.999
 it comes very well 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:05:02.729
 and now we are going to come to tp -154 73 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:06.269
 728 because this language apart from bringing 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.939
 what is said something desert a type 

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:11.300
 cannon is worth seeing if this load fast 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.810
 all right 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.410
 because he has loaded here 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.529
 good as you see has loaded me where nothing 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.279
 he wins 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:24.959
 ok is there these pieces wonders 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.670
 that I was before I had 

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:29.850
 appeared 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.980
 epic that is very cool what there is 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.720
 of lava up here 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.370
 but very cool obviously burns the 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:41.330
 tree evidently 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.889
 and well there we have the cane that part of 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.130
 out of language because the language of 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:50.440
 canyon that huge ticket we have left a 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.140
 little of the language and here we are 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.930
 and we are with everything we have done well now 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.240
 Well, it will take coordinates that maybe 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.490
 whom he has misplaced was saying 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.340
 this does not sound like me I do not know what to do 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:09.420
 improvising improvise peredo 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:13.590
 1,254 is worth 73 minus 728 that I have already put 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.810
 more 728 now yes now yes what scare of 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.280
 truth is saying my mother my mother 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.790
 that I'm shitting it in the video that 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.880
 you shitting but not good the cannon goes to 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.070
 see part of the bamboo that you can 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.400
 find and other this language are not the 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.290
 rivers and places like this also 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.300
 we find sites like this one that stops 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.120
 me is an authentic past and a 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.920
 wonder is like columns and columns 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.480
 they are bigger than others 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:45.240
 small in lava encinosa is that I 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.070
 it seems incredible what I do not have 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.590
 words that just petar the 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.020
 minecraft in such a way that the theme of 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.060
 this one of the biomes is an authentic 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.310
 last as you see 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.920
 look at this little pond here or you know what 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.889
 they just gave more play to this game the 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.110
 they had incredible that would be amazing 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:09.199
 and as you can see, it's an authentic look 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.780
 wonder what really wonder what 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.759
 wonder and good I did not find more 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.800
 subtract because he is not looking to look 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.229
 like a cliff gorge type or 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.539
 be like they can continue with you with your 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:23.330
 ship and do view once here in birds 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:25.310
 but come on I in my world is worth thanks 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.280
 here your little house says after here does 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:31.180
 Sometimes I do the walls here 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.180
 I love this 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:39.439
 It's super cool but good that this has 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:41.479
 been the seed if you like the law 

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:44.089
 subscribe and well it's not a good one either 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:46.939
 seed but as you can see is the seed of 

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:48.679
 a new biome so I do not expect anything 

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:52.239
 you play it you like it and tomorrow more and 

00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:52.239
 better see you later guys
