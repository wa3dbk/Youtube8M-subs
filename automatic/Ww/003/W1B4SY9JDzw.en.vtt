00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
kids now here I'm going to scale this

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.740 
kids now here I'm going to scale this
cute<00:00:16.340> let's<00:00:17.340> go<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.609> zero<00:00:18.060> zone<00:00:18.330> I'm<00:00:18.600> gonna

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
cute let's go to zero zone I'm gonna

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.720 
cute let's go to zero zone I'm gonna
pull<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.500> little<00:00:19.650> let<00:00:20.340> me<00:00:20.430> scale<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
pull this up a little let me scale a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.109 
pull this up a little let me scale a
little<00:00:21.119> bit<00:00:21.270> more<00:00:21.480> there<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.500> go<00:00:22.850> so<00:00:23.850> now<00:00:24.060> we

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
little bit more there we go so now we

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.870 
little bit more there we go so now we
need<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.750> go<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.289> Q<00:00:25.590> properties<00:00:26.430> here<00:00:26.760> on

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
need to go to the Q properties here on

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.589 
need to go to the Q properties here on
your<00:00:27.269> right<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.830> go<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.220> display<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.179> on

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
your right and go to the display and on

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.049 
your right and go to the display and on
the<00:00:30.720> type<00:00:30.990> choose<00:00:31.679> instead<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.279> texture<00:00:32.730> wire

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
the type choose instead of texture wire

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
the type choose instead of texture wire
so<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> inside<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:34.950> we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
so you can see from the inside so now we

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.400 
so you can see from the inside so now we
need<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> create<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.730> plane<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.960> gonna<00:00:37.260> be

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
need to create a plane that's gonna be

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.740 
need to create a plane that's gonna be
creating<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> smoke<00:00:38.250> now<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> plane<00:00:39.450> go

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
creating the smoke now for the plane go

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.530 
creating the smoke now for the plane go
to<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.079> physics<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.800> choose<00:00:41.610> smoke<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
to the physics here choose smoke and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.430 
to the physics here choose smoke and
choose<00:00:42.840> flow<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.969> house<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.570> cube<00:00:45.899> on

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
choose flow and for the house I cube on

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
choose flow and for the house I cube on
the<00:00:46.469> physics<00:00:47.010> choose<00:00:47.489> smoke<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.239> choose

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the physics choose smoke and choose

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.220 
the physics choose smoke and choose
domain<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> domain<00:00:50.719> is<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.110> that's

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
domain now the domain is the one that's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.569 
domain now the domain is the one that's
gonna<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.500> holding<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> smoke<00:00:53.399> inside

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
gonna be holding all the smoke inside

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.270 
gonna be holding all the smoke inside
and<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.600> plane<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.980> that's<00:00:56.129> are

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and the plane that is the one that's are

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.150 
and the plane that is the one that's are
gonna<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.550> flowing<00:00:57.149> all<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.829> smoke<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
gonna be flowing all the smoke it's the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
gonna be flowing all the smoke it's the
one<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.940> gonna<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.270> throwing<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> smoke

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
one that is gonna be throwing the smoke

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.789 
one that is gonna be throwing the smoke
inside<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.800> cube<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.799> almost

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
inside the cube so here we have almost

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.140 
inside the cube so here we have almost
everything<00:01:05.100> set<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.610> need<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.880> create<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
everything set up we need to create a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.359 
everything set up we need to create a
new<00:01:06.240> particle<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.380> plane<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.220> it

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
new particle for this plane here so it

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.160 
new particle for this plane here so it
can<00:01:08.549> create<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.060> smoke<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> particle

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
can create the smoke and the particle

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.969 
can create the smoke and the particle
will<00:01:10.740> make<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.780> part<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.590> need<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
will make that part so now we need to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
will make that part so now we need to
create<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.220> new<00:01:14.310> particle<00:01:14.939> system<00:01:15.540> let's<00:01:16.020> put<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
create a new particle system let's put a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.140 
create a new particle system let's put a
name<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.220> gonna<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.430> ps1<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
name on this one it's gonna be ps1 to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.600 
name on this one it's gonna be ps1 to
make<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> shorter<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.530> let's<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.400> war

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
make it shorter and now let's go to war

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.840 
make it shorter and now let's go to war
feel<00:01:21.180> weights<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.799> part<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.549> very

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
feel weights now this part here is very

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
feel weights now this part here is very
important<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> gravity<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.710> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
important the gravity because if you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
important the gravity because if you
leave<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.729> every<00:01:27.210> particle<00:01:27.630> will<00:01:27.960> go

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
leave this on one every particle will go

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
leave this on one every particle will go
down<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.860> put<00:01:29.070> zero<00:01:29.400> every<00:01:29.790> particle<00:01:30.329> will

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
down if you put zero every particle will

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.200 
down if you put zero every particle will
go<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.220> particle

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
go up so now that we have particle

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.149 
go up so now that we have particle
system<00:01:33.509> already<00:01:33.750> set<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.229> our<00:01:34.500> plane<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
system already set up for our plane to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.700 
system already set up for our plane to
create<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.700> smoke<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.900> need<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.140> go<00:01:37.259> back<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
create the smoke we need to go back to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.830 
create the smoke we need to go back to
our<00:01:37.740> physics<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.610> plane<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
our physics for the plane and on the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.770 
our physics for the plane and on the
flow<00:01:40.200> source<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.490> need<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> change<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.360> from

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
flow source you need to change the from

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170 
flow source you need to change the from
mesh<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.320> particle<00:01:43.799> system<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.729> particle

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.350 
put more strength to this one so I'm
gonna<00:04:25.039> put<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.760> string<00:04:26.000> on<00:04:26.120> three<00:04:27.849> maybe<00:04:28.849> more

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
gonna put the string on three maybe more

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.680 
gonna put the string on three maybe more
maybe<00:04:29.539> on<00:04:29.810> 10

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.110 

depending<00:04:36.590> on<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.130> options<00:04:37.730> of<00:04:38.090> the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
depending on the options of the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.050 
depending on the options of the
resolution<00:04:38.840> that<00:04:38.960> you<00:04:39.080> put<00:04:39.260> for<00:04:39.890> it<00:04:40.010> is<00:04:40.700> the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
resolution that you put for it is the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.090 
resolution that you put for it is the
house<00:04:41.390> of<00:04:41.660> smoke<00:04:41.900> is<00:04:42.050> gonna<00:04:42.260> look<00:04:42.470> so<00:04:42.710> for<00:04:42.950> that

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
house of smoke is gonna look so for that

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.250 
house of smoke is gonna look so for that
if<00:04:43.310> we<00:04:43.640> want<00:04:43.910> more<00:04:44.000> resolution<00:04:44.720> than<00:04:44.960> this<00:04:45.050> one

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
if we want more resolution than this one

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.230 
if we want more resolution than this one
you<00:04:45.350> need<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.620> choose<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.860> outside<00:04:46.550> cue<00:04:46.820> that

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
you need to choose the outside cue that

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.710 
you need to choose the outside cue that
is<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.510> one<00:04:47.660> that's<00:04:47.840> gonna<00:04:47.960> be<00:04:48.140> holding<00:04:48.350> the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
is the one that's gonna be holding the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.710 
is the one that's gonna be holding the
smoke<00:04:50.720> inside<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.650> go<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.640> this<00:04:52.880> little<00:04:53.270> chest

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
smoke inside and go to this little chest

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.530 
smoke inside and go to this little chest
checkbox<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:54.830> say<00:04:55.130> smoke<00:04:55.610> high-resolution

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
checkbox that say smoke high-resolution

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.860 
checkbox that say smoke high-resolution
and<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:57.890> toggle<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.790> for<00:04:59.780> the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
and just toggle that and for the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.570 
and just toggle that and for the
resolution<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.620> division<00:05:01.010> you<00:05:01.100> just<00:05:01.310> choose

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
resolution the division you just choose

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.250 
resolution the division you just choose
to<00:05:01.940> only<00:05:02.150> let's<00:05:03.050> have<00:05:03.230> to<00:05:03.320> play<00:05:03.500> again<00:05:05.170> does<00:05:06.170> it

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
to only let's have to play again does it

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.070 
to only let's have to play again does it
go<00:05:06.410> slower<00:05:06.800> because<00:05:07.130> it<00:05:07.940> has<00:05:08.150> more<00:05:08.480> resolution

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
go slower because it has more resolution

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.530 
go slower because it has more resolution
if<00:05:09.530> you<00:05:09.740> keep<00:05:10.010> pulling<00:05:10.670> up<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.120> divisions

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
if you keep pulling up the divisions

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.950 
if you keep pulling up the divisions
it's<00:05:11.870> gonna<00:05:12.020> be<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.640> slower<00:05:13.640> more<00:05:14.300> slow<00:05:14.690> and

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
it's gonna be a slower more slow and

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.330 
it's gonna be a slower more slow and
more<00:05:15.200> slow<00:05:15.680> even<00:05:16.010> more<00:05:17.050> but<00:05:18.050> only<00:05:18.770> for<00:05:19.100> this

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
more slow even more but only for this

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.360 
more slow even more but only for this
prior<00:05:20.150> for<00:05:20.510> this<00:05:20.660> tutorial<00:05:21.200> I<00:05:21.500> can<00:05:22.010> use<00:05:22.130> it<00:05:22.280> on

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
prior for this tutorial I can use it on

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.040 
prior for this tutorial I can use it on
two<00:05:22.610> just<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.060> show<00:05:23.210> you<00:05:23.270> guys<00:05:23.510> what<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:23.870> does

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
two just to show you guys what it does

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.040 
two just to show you guys what it does
but<00:05:24.860> as<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.460> can<00:05:25.580> see<00:05:25.820> the<00:05:26.090> smoke<00:05:26.330> looks<00:05:26.690> way

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
but as you can see the smoke looks way

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.440 
but as you can see the smoke looks way
much<00:05:27.260> better<00:05:27.560> than<00:05:28.280> it<00:05:28.400> was<00:05:28.490> before

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.900 

way<00:05:32.450> much<00:05:32.720> better<00:05:32.860> so<00:05:33.860> I'm<00:05:34.370> gonna<00:05:34.490> put<00:05:34.730> this

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
way much better so I'm gonna put this

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:42.610 
way much better so I'm gonna put this
one<00:05:34.970> on<00:05:35.420> three<00:05:36.760> four<00:05:37.760> maybe<00:05:41.170> put<00:05:42.170> it<00:05:42.260> on<00:05:42.380> four

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
one on three four maybe put it on four

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.470 
one on three four maybe put it on four
so<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:42.950> guys<00:05:43.130> can<00:05:43.340> see<00:05:43.520> how<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:43.820> smoke<00:05:44.090> will

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
so you guys can see how the smoke will

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.550 
so you guys can see how the smoke will
look<00:05:44.630> like<00:05:45.100> so<00:05:46.100> let<00:05:46.610> me<00:05:46.810> get<00:05:47.810> out<00:05:47.960> of<00:05:48.050> this<00:05:48.320> one

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
look like so let me get out of this one

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.690 
look like so let me get out of this one
here<00:05:48.980> there<00:05:49.790> we<00:05:49.880> go<00:05:51.010> I'm<00:05:52.010> gonna<00:05:52.220> delete<00:05:52.520> the

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
here there we go I'm gonna delete the

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.340 
here there we go I'm gonna delete the
wind<00:05:52.940> because<00:05:53.300> I<00:05:53.390> don't<00:05:53.570> want<00:05:53.720> to<00:05:53.810> see<00:05:54.230> it

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
wind because I don't want to see it

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.200 
wind because I don't want to see it
anymore

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
anymore

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:02.440 
anymore
so<00:05:56.210> I<00:05:56.270> can<00:05:56.480> go<00:05:58.750> so<00:05:59.750> now<00:05:59.870> we<00:05:59.930> only<00:06:00.230> have<00:06:01.450> the

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
so I can go so now we only have the

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.480 
so I can go so now we only have the
vortex<00:06:02.720> on<00:06:03.200> the<00:06:03.260> bottom<00:06:03.590> of<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.740> plane<00:06:04.010> and

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
vortex on the bottom of the plane and

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.700 
vortex on the bottom of the plane and
the<00:06:04.790> cube<00:06:05.060> outside<00:06:05.860> making<00:06:06.860> all<00:06:08.710> animation

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
the cube outside making all animation

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.409 
the cube outside making all animation
here<00:06:11.169> as<00:06:12.169> you<00:06:12.320> can<00:06:12.470> see<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:13.280> smoke<00:06:13.550> looks<00:06:14.000> more

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
here as you can see the smoke looks more

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.230 
here as you can see the smoke looks more
real<00:06:14.720> than<00:06:15.050> before<00:06:15.440> and<00:06:16.340> it's<00:06:16.490> because<00:06:16.910> the

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
real than before and it's because the

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.710 
real than before and it's because the
divisions<00:06:17.690> that<00:06:17.990> we<00:06:18.640> inserted<00:06:19.640> for<00:06:20.270> the

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
divisions that we inserted for the

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.190 
divisions that we inserted for the
high-resolution<00:06:21.320> smoke<00:06:25.000> looks<00:06:26.000> weight<00:06:26.720> much

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
high-resolution smoke looks weight much

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:35.249 
high-resolution smoke looks weight much
better<00:06:27.560> weigh<00:06:28.040> much

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.279 

so<00:06:36.259> I<00:06:36.620> think<00:06:37.039> this<00:06:37.370> is<00:06:37.430> all<00:06:37.759> for<00:06:38.449> working<00:06:38.870> with

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.289 
so I think this is all for working with

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:44.740 
so I think this is all for working with
smoke<00:06:40.220> and<00:06:42.490> winds<00:06:43.490> and<00:06:44.000> things<00:06:44.330> like<00:06:44.539> I<00:06:44.600> have

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
smoke and winds and things like I have

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.909 
smoke and winds and things like I have
or<00:06:44.930> text<00:06:46.600> okay<00:06:47.600> I'll<00:06:47.810> keep<00:06:48.080> you<00:06:48.229> guys<00:06:48.380> in<00:06:48.650> touch

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
or text okay I'll keep you guys in touch

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:52.840 
or text okay I'll keep you guys in touch
with<00:06:49.370> how<00:06:49.669> to<00:06:49.729> create<00:06:50.330> a<00:06:50.560> splosions<00:06:51.560> so<00:06:52.280> maybe

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
with how to create a splosions so maybe

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.490 
with how to create a splosions so maybe
that's<00:06:53.150> gonna<00:06:53.360> be<00:06:53.539> the<00:06:53.690> next<00:06:53.870> tutorial

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
that's gonna be the next tutorial

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.810 
that's gonna be the next tutorial
tutorial<00:06:54.850> number<00:06:55.900> 13<00:06:57.039> maybe<00:06:58.039> will<00:06:58.370> be<00:06:58.400> about

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
tutorial number 13 maybe will be about

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.710 
tutorial number 13 maybe will be about
how<00:06:59.270> to<00:06:59.330> make<00:07:00.229> explosions<00:07:01.009> with<00:07:01.490> smoke<00:07:02.150> in

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 
how to make explosions with smoke in

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.129 
how to make explosions with smoke in
particles<00:07:03.560> that<00:07:03.860> may<00:07:04.130> be<00:07:04.780> that<00:07:05.780> could<00:07:05.960> look

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
particles that may be that could look

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.360 
particles that may be that could look
like<00:07:06.410> it<00:07:06.590> like<00:07:06.800> maybe<00:07:07.520> rocks<00:07:08.000> or<00:07:08.449> or<00:07:09.099> sand<00:07:10.099> or

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
like it like maybe rocks or or sand or

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.390
