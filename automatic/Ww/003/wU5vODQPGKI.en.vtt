00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.779
 what we have here is the audi tt that 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:10.230
 we just had the chance to try here 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.420
 in mallorca hermitage of sawyer with some 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.900
 Especially slippery roads 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.820
 because of the temporary and good we are 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.250
 in the international presentation of the tt 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.410
 raster as you can see their designs 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.599
 it is practically identical to that of the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.630
 coupe version and the main difference 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.910
 because it is precisely the roof of 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.270
 canvas that has electric drive 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 that unfolds in just 10 seconds 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.460
 and that has a weight of 39 kilos that are 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.810
 3 kilos less than what he weighed on his 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.070
 predecessor the reason why we audi 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.130
 says that they have opted for a roof 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.800
 canvas because there are several reasons really 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.690
 one is aesthetic that for them is one of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.810
 the thanks of the raster tp is that it has 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.020
 this canvas roof the other is a theme 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.290
 technical and that is to spend much more but 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.030
 because it also allows it to be faster 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.860
 of triggering and they also get that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.750
 gravity center is located in a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.800
 highest position in the car I make 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.960
 in the end 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.410
 also the manageability of the car and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.410
 curved areas 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.799
 some 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.560
 apologize but is that today in 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.780
 mallorca is a bit windy some of 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.060
 the peculiar things that differentiate 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.670
 this car as you can see the interior 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.070
 it's very similar to the coupe version 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.100
 there are hardly any differences and let's say that 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.259
 can divide in two on the one hand this 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.939
 that we have here that in case 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.000
 we get for having the seats 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.369
 sports is what Mercedes called in 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.929
 your day download is a system that 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.460
 what it does is that it expels air out there 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.079
 hot 3 when you go descapotado 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.970
 you have a very nice feeling 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.130
 because the hot air is going 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.009
 giving the nape is a system that 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.140
 connect with these little hands that there 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:05.500
 here as you see in the air areas 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.290
 the filmmaker has a button if 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.080
 we press 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.850
 we see that what is connected is the part 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.260
 bottom of the seat that is a seat 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.019
 heated and if we turn it 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.780
 we see that they start to different 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:26.299
 ventilation system speeds 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.189
 of the seat this form of this kind of 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.230
 command is very similar to the one that already has 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.450
 the coupÃ© and what are these we have 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.840
 here you already have the coupe for the system 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.840
 of air conditioning
