okay<00:00:01.979> so<00:00:02.040> this<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.909> test<00:00:03.330> with<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.020> external

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
okay so this is a test with the external

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.629 
okay so this is a test with the external

Sony microphone designed for the multi
shoe<00:00:10.309> this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.610> right<00:00:12.000> now<00:00:12.150> mounted<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
shoe this is right now mounted on the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.039 
shoe this is right now mounted on the
NEX<00:00:13.620> VG<00:00:14.219> 30<00:00:14.670> which<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.420> compatible<00:00:15.809> with

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
NEX VG 30 which it is compatible with

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.460 
NEX VG 30 which it is compatible with
and<00:00:17.359> for<00:00:18.359> those<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> who<00:00:18.960> wanted<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> see

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and for those of you who wanted to see

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.590 
and for those of you who wanted to see
performance<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.910> should<00:00:20.970> give<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> pretty

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
performance it should give you a pretty

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.720 
performance it should give you a pretty
good<00:00:21.720> idea<00:00:21.869> keep<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.769> mind<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.160> course<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.580> am

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
good idea keep in mind of course I am

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.089 
good idea keep in mind of course I am
behind<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.300> microphone<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.289> my<00:00:25.740> level

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
behind the microphone so my level

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.810 
behind the microphone so my level
shouldn't<00:00:26.430> be<00:00:26.519> great<00:00:26.760> but<00:00:28.580> see<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
shouldn't be great but see what the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.580 
shouldn't be great but see what the
balance<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.359> audio<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.320> you'll<00:00:31.439> see

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
balance of audio is like and you'll see

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
balance of audio is like and you'll see
whether<00:00:31.769> or<00:00:31.890> not<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.309> pick<00:00:32.610> up<00:00:32.780> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
whether or not you can pick up the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:53.490 
whether or not you can pick up the
actual<00:00:34.170> powers<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:07.090 

go<00:00:54.500> back<00:00:54.739> in

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.469

microphone<00:01:12.140> would<00:01:13.010> pick<00:01:13.310> up<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:14.150> zoom<00:01:14.360> at<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
microphone would pick up the zoom at the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.540 
microphone would pick up the zoom at the
highest<00:01:15.350> speed<00:01:15.590> which<00:01:15.830> is<00:01:15.860> what<00:01:16.160> I<00:01:16.190> have<00:01:16.430> it

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
highest speed which is what I have it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.150 
highest speed which is what I have it
sets<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.940> right<00:01:17.210> now<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.950> we'll<00:01:19.040> be

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
sets you right now so we'll be

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
sets you right now so we'll be
interesting<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.610> see<00:01:19.729> whether<00:01:19.910> or<00:01:20.030> not<00:01:20.119> I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
interesting to see whether or not I

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:40.890 
interesting to see whether or not I
picked<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.540> up

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.899 

and<00:01:41.900> now<00:01:42.049> we've<00:01:42.200> got<00:01:42.409> a<00:01:42.440> sample<00:01:42.890> without<00:01:43.490> the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
and now we've got a sample without the
