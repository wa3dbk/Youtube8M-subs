little<00:03:23.549> hand<00:03:24.180> sanitizer<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:25.169> that<00:03:25.530> makes<00:03:25.829> it

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
little hand sanitizer so that makes it

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.270 
little hand sanitizer so that makes it
like<00:03:26.239> smell<00:03:27.239> good<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.930> also<00:03:28.590> softens<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.250> up

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
like smell good and also softens it up

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.659 
like smell good and also softens it up
and<00:03:30.000> if<00:03:30.569> you<00:03:30.659> don't<00:03:30.840> have<00:03:30.959> hand<00:03:31.229> sanitizer

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
and if you don't have hand sanitizer

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.890 
and if you don't have hand sanitizer
doesn't<00:03:32.669> matter<00:03:32.819> just<00:03:32.909> just<00:03:33.329> water<00:03:33.569> but

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
doesn't matter just just water but
