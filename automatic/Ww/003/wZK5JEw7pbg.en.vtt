00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 the next duel this Saturday evening 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.920
 bayarena leverkusen against the vfb 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.820
 Stuttgart, both teams currently with him 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.410
 weaker benefits leverkusen with 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.330
 a performance of just 36 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.400
 percent stuttgart a bit better with 43 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.130
 percent 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:30.269
 the last games of leverkusen were 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:34.260
 a sovereign 0 kidnaps that the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.370
 second defeat against benfica before 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:43.559
 a close 2 1 win against Augsburg then 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.920
 again defeat against benfica and am 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.390
 19 2 one more 3 3 against gladbach one was 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 It must say that that is not 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.520
 really weapons lepper at stuttgart 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.960
 it looks similar 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.149
 last game 1 1 against nuremberg before 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.519
 beaten against genk in the euroleague 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.770
 so moved on 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.439
 whenever it is the duel against 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.420
 Hope home 1 0 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.979
 the whole thing has already been made 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.500
 then for stuttgart feels right 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.680
 against genk 1 1 and before defeat 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.770
 against bremen with 1 to 4 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.869
 the direct comparison says that 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.450
 leverkusen has clear advantages 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.180
 Twenty-two times the points remained with leverkusen 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.689
 only eight draws and ten 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.049
 best protect victories for stuttgart 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.610
 at leverkusen are kieÃŸling with 15 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.920
 behind it, student castro with 6 sidney sam 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.360
 with 5 and lars bender in defensive 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.320
 midfield usable 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.520
 at stuttgart the meadow which with ten 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.250
 But he has already believed that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.740
 longer deadly hit woman 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.320
 may not be the internet austrian 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.630
 harnik 6 gates and gentner grape 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.430
 three each and the japanese and 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.050
 contacts with 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:17.720
 a few balls the third against the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:21.730
 eleventh points difference stuttgart 29 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.560
 points only at one right 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.690
 negative gate ratio just 25 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:33.610
 goals against 40 gegentore leverkusen against 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:39.260
 43 goals scored 30 cashed 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.140
 yes the season hour leverkusen 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.270
 has been holding for ten days 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.700
 just over 15 more 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.880
 playing days already in the upper or in the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:55.330
 European space Stuttgart last with 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.860
 but quite changeable course 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.840
 in the meantime even in sixth place 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.220
 then jumped clearly again 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.410
 crashed with place 14 15 and lingering 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.910
 The last two games have one again 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.910
 few places well done 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.750
 the hole to the last duels the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.360
 Both 22 ended in the last two games 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.910
 before that there was a single one 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.830
 leverkusen and two clear victories 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:30.530
 each with peter and for leverkusen 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:31.280
 once 1 4 2 and 1 x 1 41 I see that 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.320
 ahead 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.330
 Stuttgart plays with even in 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:42.400
 cup against bochum and of course not 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.640
 counting as an excuse animal is enough 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.200
 place to the generations there actually 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.440
 every case 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.760
 leverkusen has become more quality 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.970
 That's why I see them in front 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.540
 I think it with a 3 1 with yours 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.400
 with 1 drive is then again one 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.850
 worse fight over 200 a bit 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.870
 to join in 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:15.490
 That's why I say 31 what I do 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:17.290
 also leverkusen wants to say almost something 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.390
 similar but I believe that stuttgart 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.190
 simply defensive too weak for us that 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.640
 you get three to four goals 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.300
 become 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.710
 even my tip is on the first three new ones 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.760
 maybe even 40 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.600
 what would have been the clapping I was 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.600
 strong from out
