when<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.490> put<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:12.030> arcs<00:01:12.450> structure<00:01:13.229> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
when you put up an arcs structure you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.399 
when you put up an arcs structure you
start<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.280> footings<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> floor<00:01:15.600> slab<00:01:15.960> just

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
start with footings or a floor slab just

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.800 
start with footings or a floor slab just
as<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:16.979> normally

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
as you would normally

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.990 
as you would normally
next<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.170> form<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> walls<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> arcs

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
next you form the walls with the arcs

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.749 
next you form the walls with the arcs
expanded<00:01:21.689> polystyrene<00:01:22.110> form<00:01:23.070> units<00:01:23.580> and
