one<00:05:01.070> day<00:05:01.280> so<00:05:01.570> very<00:05:02.570> interesting<00:05:03.140> new<00:05:03.260> unit

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
one day so very interesting new unit

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.770 
one day so very interesting new unit
very<00:05:03.860> smart<00:05:04.220> transmission<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.360> think<00:05:05.660> it's

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
very smart transmission and I think it's

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.330 
very smart transmission and I think it's
going<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:05.960> be<00:05:06.110> a<00:05:06.140> winner<00:05:06.410> for<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.800> pickup

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
going to be a winner for a pickup

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.910 
going to be a winner for a pickup
delivery<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.030> other<00:05:08.630> urban<00:05:09.140> oriented<00:05:09.680> fleets
