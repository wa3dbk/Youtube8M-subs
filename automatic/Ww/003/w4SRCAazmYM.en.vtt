00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.690
 Hello everyone, you have to play 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.019
 channel today to our attention 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.840
 hit game like simcity release 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.240
 which was the beginning of this month game 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.730
 is a modern remake of old 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.180
 versions in a new guise which for us 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.180
 built an indispensable studio maksis so 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.579
 let's see what a miracle in the game we are 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.130
 acting as an ambitious mayor not 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.640
 always with a sober look at the world back a 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.489
 with a bunch of dough it is not reasonable to spend which 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.920
 can quickly become a problem target 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.199
 our stay here does not change this 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.109
 building a city and that's how it is 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.730
 the so-called view will decide you already 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.039
 cities may be the most diverse 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.620
 from the industrial complex to 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.839
 tourist paradise begins the game with 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.170
 road construction which is already 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.699
 residents of our city will be located 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.610
 the main buildings here are divided into three 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.130
 This kind of residential complexes and commercial 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.800
 industrial after all all people need 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.470
 somewhere to live and work and somewhere to walk 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.540
 shopping is true as the city grows 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.730
 residents will demand to build new ones 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.280
 new services such as hospitals and 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.040
 fire stations not to mention 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.810
 providing electricity and water 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.240
 This is the main thing not to rush and always 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.520
 keep a budget in profit game engine 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.040
 eye boxing constantly monitors 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.400
 mood and condition of city residents 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.290
 that does not relax for a second 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.780
 absolutely every move every purchase 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.510
 or the location of certain buildings 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.340
 may affect the rating of the mayor well then 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.890
 have you everything comes to such trifles 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.560
 what if building plants without relying 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.720
 which side is blowing winds can 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.480
 shit from residents for pollution 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.580
 air or for example you already have sex 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.950
 hundreds of thousands of inhabitants need to move 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.140
 further and the location of the roads creates 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.850
 Moscow traffic jams have to expand 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.250
 roads but demolish buildings 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.470
 along with the buildings you take down the hospital a 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.840
 thereafter the city is covered by an epidemic 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.670
 plague of such nuances in various 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.489
 indicators it seems that in this game 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.310
 thousands and keep track of all very difficult 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.160
 especially in the early stages of the game and again 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.410
 about traffic jams in simcity 4 cars just 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.870
 dissolved in the air and here such 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.760
 every character doesn't have the right 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.520
 drive public transport 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.950
 either walking again asking 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.650
 question to the mayor a traffic situation on 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.660
 roads when the city is about to acquire 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.709
 stability can be determined with the goal 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.200
 recreations 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.450
 I personally chose a tourist built 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.120
 several monuments I hope that 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.640
 I pay off and then you can go smoothly 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.680
 to multiplayer on the same site can 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.590
 to be at once several cities to manage 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.989
 which can not necessarily moms together 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.970
 building a city with a friend is much more fun 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.200
 for example, the inhabitants of his city will 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.430
 come my watch 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.680
 attractions 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.420
 and I will buy back oil from him 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.819
 which he mines and in general 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.400
 interaction between cities is big 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.890
 many, again, all and not name 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.019
 periodically city residents will give 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.570
 us different tasks depending on 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.430
 situations in the game they are included as 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.530
 tips for example if schools 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.450
 overflowed director necessarily 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.049
 will offer us to build new ones for it 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.510
 classes 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.250
 and the fire department chief will require 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.560
 more machinery 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.140
 if they do not have time for all the challenges 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.750
 I would like to note the beauty of simcity and 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.940
 music all executed 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.790
 at a very high level creates 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.010
 mood and tightens well 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.170
 if you are tired of looking at your city and 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.780
 its inhabitants well give ellen and empty 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.880
 requests no one has canceled the disaster 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.140
 who can be so casually said 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.170
 bring to life 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.360
 cities so let's sum up simcity 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.310
 always been a classic to them town planning 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.560
 simulators and over time as we could 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.200
 make sure not lost its coolness 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.319
 beauty and is another reason 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.900
 great time to kill personally I myself do not 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.360
 noticed as 4 hours trying to create 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.330
 candy from your city revealing everything 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.730
 New and new features even if 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.519
 look skeptical after dota 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.400
 or residents of the shaft sure many she is not 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.620
 will leave you indifferent it was a review from 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.510
 Denis lm and if you liked 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.940
 put your thumbs up and subscribe 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.940
 to the channel thank you all and good luck
