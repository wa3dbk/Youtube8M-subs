00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
comfortable on my wrist even while

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.109 
comfortable on my wrist even while
running<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.409> didn't<00:02:05.250> feel<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.430> shifting<00:02:05.969> or

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119

anything<00:02:06.450> they<00:02:06.719> kind<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.020> stayed<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> place

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
anything they kind of stayed in place

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.490 
anything they kind of stayed in place
and<00:02:09.379> you<00:02:10.379> know<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> didn't<00:02:11.009> you

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.720 
and you know I didn't you
I<00:02:11.530> was<00:02:11.680> thinking<00:02:11.830> maybe<00:02:12.130> because<00:02:12.520> it's<00:02:12.670> a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
I was thinking maybe because it's a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.980 
I was thinking maybe because it's a
little<00:02:12.970> plastic<00:02:13.180> II<00:02:13.600> kind<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.140> um<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:15.840> know<00:02:16.840> how

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
little plastic II kind of um I know how

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.230 
little plastic II kind of um I know how
to<00:02:17.340> say<00:02:18.340> how<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.850> call<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.270> um<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.060> little

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
to say how to call this um it's a little

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.850 
to say how to call this um it's a little
bit<00:02:22.330> plasticky<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.110> thought<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.680> when

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
bit plasticky and so I thought that when

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.920 
bit plasticky and so I thought that when
maybe<00:02:24.340> when<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.610> sweat<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.390> was<00:02:25.510> going<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.750> kind

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
maybe when I sweat it was going to kind

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.320 
maybe when I sweat it was going to kind
of<00:02:26.020> itch<00:02:26.200> my<00:02:26.440> skin<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.770> little<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:27.820> didn't<00:02:28.150> it

the<00:03:04.239> sensor<00:03:04.570> you<00:03:04.780> can't<00:03:05.080> leave<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.500> hooked<00:03:05.680> to

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
the sensor you can't leave it hooked to

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.890 
the sensor you can't leave it hooked to
your<00:03:05.950> strap<00:03:06.430> because<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:07.270> will<00:03:07.420> waste<00:03:07.630> your

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
your strap because it will waste your

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.380 
your strap because it will waste your
battery<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.620> I'm<00:03:09.459> not<00:03:09.670> even<00:03:09.700> sure<00:03:09.940> how<00:03:10.239> much

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
battery and I'm not even sure how much

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.030 
battery and I'm not even sure how much
these<00:03:10.600> batteries<00:03:10.989> are<00:03:11.230> but<00:03:11.590> they're<00:03:11.800> probably

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
these batteries are but they're probably

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.520 
these batteries are but they're probably
somewhere<00:03:12.250> around<00:03:12.430> ten<00:03:12.820> dollars<00:03:13.270> at<00:03:14.050> walmart

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
somewhere around ten dollars at walmart

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.100 
somewhere around ten dollars at walmart
