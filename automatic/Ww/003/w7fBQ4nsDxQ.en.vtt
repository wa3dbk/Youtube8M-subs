00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
you manage to motivate yourself when

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.340 
you manage to motivate yourself when
you're<00:00:47.299> at<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.479> bottom<00:00:47.659> at<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.019> beginning<00:00:48.260> of

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
you're at the bottom at the beginning of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.799 
you're at the bottom at the beginning of
the<00:00:48.470> year<00:00:48.699> I<00:00:49.699> think<00:00:50.180> at<00:00:50.299> the<00:00:50.360> beginning<00:00:50.479> of<00:00:50.720> the

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
the year I think at the beginning of the

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.439 
the year I think at the beginning of the
year<00:00:50.930> ours<00:00:51.199> is<00:00:51.409> to<00:00:51.530> be<00:00:51.619> lost<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:52.339> down<00:00:52.519> I<00:00:52.940> was

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
year ours is to be lost and down I was

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.560 
year ours is to be lost and down I was
kind<00:00:53.839> of<00:00:53.930> more<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:54.619> struggling<00:00:55.129> with<00:00:55.250> myself

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
kind of more so struggling with myself

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.240 
kind of more so struggling with myself
I've<00:00:56.570> know<00:00:56.780> rather<00:00:56.930> than<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.920> actual

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
I've know rather than the actual

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.219 
I've know rather than the actual
competitions<00:00:59.210> and<00:00:59.390> that<00:00:59.510> makes<00:00:59.689> sense<00:00:59.900> it<00:01:00.140> was

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
competitions and that makes sense it was

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.109 
competitions and that makes sense it was
like<00:01:00.379> I<00:01:00.589> wasn't<00:01:01.040> just<00:01:01.220> losing<00:01:01.670> in<00:01:01.729> heat<00:01:01.909> so<00:01:02.059> I

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
like I wasn't just losing in heat so I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.450 
like I wasn't just losing in heat so I
was<00:01:02.239> just<00:01:02.420> like<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.170> not<00:01:03.650> myself<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.339> that's

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
was just like so not myself and that's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.670 
was just like so not myself and that's
what<00:01:04.670> really<00:01:04.879> made<00:01:05.119> me<00:01:05.150> upset<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:06.110> think<00:01:06.500> I

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
what really made me upset so I think I

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.289 
what really made me upset so I think I
said<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:06.890> focus<00:01:07.250> on<00:01:07.400> myself<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.060> little

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
said to focus on myself and the little

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.240 
said to focus on myself and the little
things<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:08.600> life<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.049> just<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.590> that's<00:01:09.799> where

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
things in life and just and that's where

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.649 
things in life and just and that's where
really<00:01:10.280> everything<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.299> turned<00:01:11.509> around<00:01:11.659> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
really everything just turned around and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.809 
really everything just turned around and
just<00:01:13.140> trusting<00:01:13.530> myself<00:01:13.679> again<00:01:14.159> when<00:01:14.789> I

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
hi Laurie I really like a series do you

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.959 
hi Laurie I really like a series do you
think<00:02:04.289> it's<00:02:04.409> more<00:02:04.619> competitive<00:02:05.039> on<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
think it's more competitive on the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.590 
think it's more competitive on the
women's<00:02:06.239> side<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.629> men<00:02:06.899> sir

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
women's side of the men sir

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.010 
women's side of the men sir
I<00:02:08.660> think<00:02:09.650> it's<00:02:10.400> it's<00:02:10.790> hard<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.180> compare<00:02:11.600> the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
I think it's it's hard to compare the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.720 
I think it's it's hard to compare the
competitiveness<00:02:12.770> of<00:02:12.920> women's<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.370> men's<00:02:13.520> I

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
competitiveness of women's and men's I

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.460 
competitiveness of women's and men's I
mean<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.000> early<00:02:14.210> 17<00:02:14.720> girls<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:15.110> little<00:02:15.230> bit

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
mean this early 17 girls a little bit

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.770 
mean this early 17 girls a little bit
slow<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.860> us<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.190> we'll<00:02:16.790> find<00:02:17.030> ourselves<00:02:17.270> like

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
slow to us so we'll find ourselves like

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.000 
slow to us so we'll find ourselves like
matching<00:02:18.170> up<00:02:18.260> against<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.590> same<00:02:18.800> get<00:02:18.980> the

matching up against the same get the
same<00:02:19.280> girls<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.820> most<00:02:19.910> heats<00:02:20.270> but<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.900> think<00:02:21.770> at

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
same girls and most heats but I think at

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.590
