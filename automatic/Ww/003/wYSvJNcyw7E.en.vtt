second interval play two half steps or

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.900 
second interval play two half steps or
from<00:00:18.420> any<00:00:18.660> note<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.350> you'll<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.640> maid

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
from any note and you'll have a maid

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.689 
from any note and you'll have a maid
second<00:00:21.570> interval<00:00:22.199> between<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.310> note<00:00:23.519> you

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
second interval between the note you

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.339 
second interval between the note you
started<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:25.230> note<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.400> stepped<00:00:26.789> up

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
started on and a note to have stepped up

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.400 
started on and a note to have stepped up
for<00:00:28.349> example<00:00:28.920> here's<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.970> second<00:00:30.689> interval

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
for example here's a second interval

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.459 
for example here's a second interval
away<00:00:32.399> from<00:00:33.360> see<00:00:35.149> here<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.510> major<00:00:36.809> second

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
away from see here is a major second

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.020 
away from see here is a major second
interval<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.910> time<00:00:39.239> away<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:40.050> f1<00:00:43.100> 2a<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
interval this time away from f1 2a is a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.170 
interval this time away from f1 2a is a
major<00:00:45.570> second<00:00:46.350> interval<00:00:46.950> away<00:00:47.820> from<00:00:48.390> day<00:00:50.180> one

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
major second interval away from day one

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.819 
major second interval away from day one
so<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:52.100> is<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> major<00:00:53.760> second<00:00:54.480> interval<00:00:55.110> away

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so a is a major second interval away

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.170 
so a is a major second interval away
from<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:57.980> you'll<00:00:58.980> notice<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> major

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
from a you'll notice that the major

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.139 
from a you'll notice that the major
second<00:01:00.930> interval<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.859> basically<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.879> whole

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
second interval is basically a whole

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:14.959 
second interval is basically a whole

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
many well-known melodies used second

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.940 
many well-known melodies used second
interval<00:01:19.030> for<00:01:19.780> example<00:01:20.350> happy<00:01:21.130> birthday<00:01:22.950> made

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950

the distance between both notes

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.880 
the distance between both notes
are<00:02:36.110> exactly<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.860> same<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.410> why<00:02:39.650> I'm

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
are exactly the same this is why I'm

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.770 
are exactly the same this is why I'm
able<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.340> play<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.700> beginning<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.450> happy

birthday anywhere on the piano by going

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.280 
birthday anywhere on the piano by going
up<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:45.020> major<00:02:45.620> second<00:02:46.130> interval<00:02:46.900> from<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.080> note

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
up a major second interval from the note

00:02:48.290 --> 00:03:06.540 
up a major second interval from the note
i<00:02:48.530> started<00:02:49.130> on

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.510 

minor<00:03:07.550> means<00:03:08.300> smaller<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.740> therefore<00:03:09.980> the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
minor means smaller so therefore the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.630 
minor means smaller so therefore the
minor<00:03:10.820> second<00:03:11.570> interval<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.380> one<00:03:13.100> half<00:03:13.430> step

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
minor second interval is one half step

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.530 
minor second interval is one half step
lower<00:03:13.790> than<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.570> major<00:03:14.930> second<00:03:15.500> interval<00:03:16.540> to

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
lower than a major second interval to

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.920 
lower than a major second interval to
put<00:03:17.780> simply<00:03:18.050> play<00:03:19.040> one<00:03:19.340> half<00:03:19.670> step<00:03:19.910> up<00:03:20.330> from

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
put simply play one half step up from

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.640 
put simply play one half step up from
any<00:03:21.260> note<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.970> you'll<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.540> minor<00:03:23.960> second

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
any note and you'll have a minor second

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.140 
any note and you'll have a minor second
interval<00:03:25.310> from<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.850> note<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.360> started<00:03:27.020> on<00:03:28.150> so

major second interval by a half step

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.440 
major second interval by a half step
I'll<00:03:38.210> have<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.140> minor<00:03:39.560> second<00:03:40.280> interval<00:03:40.850> away

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
I'll have a minor second interval away

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.210 
I'll have a minor second interval away
from<00:03:41.840> a
