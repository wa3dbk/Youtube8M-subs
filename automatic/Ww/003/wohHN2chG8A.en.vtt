00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.489
 hello to all and all these increases at 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.550
 earlier and we find ourselves today 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.649
 for a new tutorial that will consist of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.510
 to position your logo on one of your 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 videos from your youtube channel 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.629
 so for this tutorial you will need 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.489
 photoshop is a good video editor 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.350
 for video editing like sony vegas me 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.840
 I would take sony vegas for the tutorial 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.830
 so you will first open photoshop 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.930
 and create a new file 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.159
 so here I will not teach you to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 create the logo so i'm going to take 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.049
 my personal logo so if you do 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.630
 720p videos 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.680
 you will have to have a width of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.420
 1280 pixels by 720 in height and if 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.200
 it's due 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:31.259
 of the 1080p you must have 1920x1080 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.659
 so you go so 1280 x 720 it's 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.580
 for me it's my thing and I 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.649
 take transparent more than the big logo 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.020
 will be on top of the video not need it 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:48.600
 there are some white did ok you 're going 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:56.310
 import your logo up brought to I take 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:58.080

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.830
 wait I'm explaining I you 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.140
 will explain after so much forgiveness here 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.130
 novelty writing is 16.6 so this is 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.060
 for that the interface is a bit 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.080
 weird it must be surely 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.470
 wait i 'll show you just 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.269
 after that surely the indispensable 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.310
 So here you will surely be like 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.489
 that's me the novelty of these six 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.760

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.959
 you're going to put it at the size of the 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.459
 video logo knowing that all this 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.000
 which is transparent behind that will be the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.579
 size of the video so not too much no 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.440

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.390
 I always learned that the logo was 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.030
 better placed down right kyle car 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.829

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.460
 here on the desk makes it a drag 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.540
 drop and you'll put it on 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:45.470
 the whole video by shooting them like here 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.860
 there I will do it at the end of my 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.860
 intro 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.039
 here 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.509
 and now so now you can 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.279
 see your logo at the bottom right 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:03.379
 it's not if you want very well on 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:06.199
 him he's here down right so he 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:10.270
 will not move since the image does not move 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:12.319
 it's not an image how to say 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.929
 logo will stay in place for any 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.830
 the video and you can choose how much 

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:17.839
 of time he will stay 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.009
 you can add at the end a little 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:23.869
 degraded like here and you finally have 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.369
 to wear your logo right there we do not see 

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:28.580
 very good on a black background it's not great 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.949
 example I did you here you go 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.219
 you can take it away and you have 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.119
 your logo on your video 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:37.969
