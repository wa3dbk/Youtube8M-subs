00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.820
 yes 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.900
 today we are going to talk about diet car 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.900
 hygienic 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.920
 did you know that a whole karin diet 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.400
 that high-carbohydrate diet 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.400
 carbon 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.910
 that's the reason why if you think about it, 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.360
 just sweets and calugas like all 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.720
 they believe constitute this diet also they 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.350
 include drinks the pasta the potato 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.350
 for example 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.560
 clearly carbohydrates are 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.200
 necessary for our children are a 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.000
 immediate account of energy and in turn 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.380
 they serve as a structural component 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 for our cells 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.970
 that's why it matters that eating these 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.620
 food but remembering the following 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.600
 while more viscous and adhesives are 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.280
 our food longer 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.700
 will remain attached to our teeth 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.440
 thus increasing the risk of caries this 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 is for example chewing gum and 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.009
 calugas 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.110
 in turn, you have to be careful 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.390
 time to eat foods that 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 easily break up and fragment as 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.979
 the cookies or the potato chips that 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.200
 we like them so much because these little ones 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.689
 pieces of food get trapped 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.750
 easily in the spaces included 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.700
 in the teeth between the teeth 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.860
 where the access by the brush 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.050
 teeth is more complicated 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.320
 avoids sugars like glucose and 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.660
 sucrose there are other sweeteners like 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.420
 which you can see on the screen that is not 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.680
 affect oral health remember that 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.030
 you can always read the information 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.030
 nutritional of your food 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.870
 choose more fibrous foods like 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.350
 fruits and vegetables as well as 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.350
 nuts 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.380
 Water consumption in addition to promoting 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.420
 a healthy diet helps the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.790
 prevention of caries due to its content 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.770
 football it is advisable to drink between a 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.720
 liter and a half to two liters of water 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.970
 daily so let's start drinking water 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.040
 but actually now that we know 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.130
 really what hydrates are 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.320
 carbon will be a myth passed down from 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.020
 our ancestors that this kind of 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.060
 food cause tooth decay 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.730
 really what these produce 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.370
 Foods from our oral cavity 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.980
 Even if you do not believe it in your mouth, 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.349
 large number of bacteria that coexist 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.890
 with each other these bacteria 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.409
 metabolize that is to say they feed on the 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.250
 carbohydrates not see any 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.080
 true problem 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.460
 the metabolic defects of these 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.380
 bacteria is acid here is the problem 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.410
 you once put sugar in a glass of 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.290
 water after a while that lump of 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.110
 sugar is undoing the same thing happens with your 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.670
 teeth in an acidic environment but very 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.670
 slow very slow 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.660
 in fact the things of diaz is a matter of 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.360
 months and even years 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.550
 the problem is that consuming this type of 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.040
 food habitually and in a way 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.100
 constant will cause cavities in your 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.280
 teeth then the key is in the 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.040
 moderation know the right rations 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.930
 and take into consideration some of the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.070
 tips like the ones that we have given you in 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.070
 the course this video 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.490
 there is currently a pyramid 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.970
 proposed by the center of 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.440
 nutrition policy and promotion a 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.160
 organization of the department of 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.940
 USA agriculture made the year 2004 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.700
 the call martina mit a pyramid 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.190
 food of vertical stripes that do not 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.340
 only tells us the variety and quantity 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.440
 of the group feed food but 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.750
 he also talks about lifestyle 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.590
 how to do sport that is extremely 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.590
 important 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.750
 respect the meal times try to 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.479
 do not eat at published times that eat 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.550
 at an inconvenient time do not brush your teeth 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.210
 so we keep that acid ph in your 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.210
 mouth for more time 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.970
 Here I leave a brief summary of everything 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.970
 what we have seen
