00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 Hello dear friends and today 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.210
 of course we are in to 7201 or how are you 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.790
 already affectionately nicknamed sneaker lion today 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.799
 we will see one rather amusing fight 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.870
 and talk about not propping up 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.890
 allies this will be the main moral 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.660
 of today's fight and so look what u 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.689
 we have here on this tank and at the same time 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.820
 and watch the fight 9 and 4 seconds recharge 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.410
 4 seconds are reduced guns are guns 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.359
 same as the mouse only 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.059
 slightly she's fast-fire here 12 and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.270
 8 centimeters gun immediately you damage 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.670
 816 units breaking 248 millimeters 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.710
 quite enough on the ninth level 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.000
 great thing the only thing with 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 Of course, if only a little 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 quickly it would be great 3220 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.460
 hit points are pretty good 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.559
 even quite good fat car and 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.340
 By the way, armor, too, of course 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.379
 solves 150 millimeters in the forehead of the body 180 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.239
 millimeters in the forehead of the tower is cool 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.800
 look in chat and you see i nagibator 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.019
 for me now you will understand everything 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.909
 one nagibator we have already left the crowd 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.070
 enemies and now he's just very 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.150
 not bad yes either this here and the second one arrived 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.310
 and got behind me 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.020
 Well, of course , I'm trying to do something neatly 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.600
 you slip out so that you can 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.189
 stand overboard and not bother to the bottom 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.310
 bronelist who is pretty weak here 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.860
 there is no need for pain points on the tower 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.720
 shoot this under her tower in epaulets 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.450
 bang and then you'll pierce here's how 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.009
 now they have punched me on the cheek but that too 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.380
 does not always happen there all the same there 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.840
 some which corners of the tower is quite strong 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.759
 the sides of the hull are certainly not as strong 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
 as it would be desirable but rather from them 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.000
 not bad bounce if you play under 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.460
 at a high angle I am here so here 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.799
 got up and the top of the tower so that I could not 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.570
 nothing purposeful and when 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.210
 only my recharge is right 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.740
 end and bring down and give a butt to the enemy 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.930
 1 701 of them lay down here our ally died 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.729
 and this one here to whom and propped 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.009
 he is also trying to get through 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.649
 most still pushes me on the enemy 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.829
 and in general, absolutely nothing good 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.719
 here it does not do me just interferes well 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.300
 in the meantime, we have already merged three 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.290
 ally this in a pap general min Th 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.810
 trying to climb a mountain 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.329
 but what do you do to me 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.209
 I do not go round the drinks pestalbed friend 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.280
 my here pushes out i'm trying 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.599
 back drive up here now all 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.030
 I understand that I will not give anything 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.959
 do have to travel and die a 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.599
 what else to do 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.340
 who else tank out and die from 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.069
 opponents because I don't know where 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.920
 I 'll stand up if there 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.019
 corpse 701 I will disassemble on my left I will rise on 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.970
 left me will understand about the general very 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.090
 even so cool decided to get up 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.950
 middle pass at me all killed 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.920
 we have time to hand out farewell buns and 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.919
 from Endova hoof Well, of course I 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.620
 already the one who confirms me and merge 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:54.760
 Well what else could I do, and I 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.799
 beautiful i merged 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.250
 great great back me 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.359
 pushed out just stupidly on opponents well 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.230
 what do i have of course on this 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.849
 about just a little bit 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.220
 burned but in general I'm already loyal 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.200
 treat such things but a guy if you 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.879
 look give me this video never again 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.720
 so do not a bad person you 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.970
 radish like this, now I ask 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.030
 making berries on the baby but what am I doing to me 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.979
 now I understand everything absolutely 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.629
 I can do nothing, I can calmly 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:28.180
 watch the fight and let's talk 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.970
 more about sneaker lion car slow 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.069
 the car is very similar to sneakers b she is very 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.560
 armored has a pretty pretty 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.970
 cannon but slow and single 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.549
 The problem with them is the rear location 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.159
 turret gun does not fall down that is 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.750
 the soldiers but we do not have in general not 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.459
 say that it really hurt 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.530
 especially when you need to click click 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.620
 something gorges is very good 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.389
 so decides that these bar here so you can 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.489
 playing a diamond is quite good 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.739
 still plus a pretty strong tower with 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.870
 huge mask and generally not bad 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.209
 pretty guns for nine quite 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.040
 I really liked the tank and 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.900
 I advise you to pump it in although I do not know 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.389
 why do desyatochka probably 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.810
 it will not be better although I still try it 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.310
 try it out maybe it will be needed 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.049
 let's see how it all turns out in life 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.840
 we are the only ally 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.150
 who is being killed now 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.340
 and at the same time we'll see the results of course 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.860
 fight and look at our awesome on 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.199
