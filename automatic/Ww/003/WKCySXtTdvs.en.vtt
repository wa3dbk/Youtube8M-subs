00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
pink pad now we're going to go ahead and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.540 
pink pad now we're going to go ahead and
heat<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.690> embossing<00:00:55.260> powder<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.949> it's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
heat the embossing powder up it's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.619 
heat the embossing powder up it's
actually<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> clear<00:00:57.090> sticky<00:00:57.329> powder

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.810 

using<00:01:02.320> just<00:01:02.469> a<00:01:02.559> regular<00:01:02.590> heat<00:01:03.129> gun<00:01:03.340> here<00:01:03.640> and

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
using just a regular heat gun here and

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.649 
using just a regular heat gun here and
we're<00:01:03.910> just<00:01:04.000> going<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.239> move<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.600> around

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
we're just going to move it around

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
we're just going to move it around
basically<00:01:07.659> melting<00:01:08.110> all<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.350> powder

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.859 

if<00:01:11.880> everything's<00:01:12.420> gone<00:01:12.630> clear<00:01:14.659> pretty<00:01:15.659> much

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
if everything's gone clear pretty much

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.469 
if everything's gone clear pretty much
melted<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.439> sticky<00:01:17.189> powder<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.210> it's

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
melted all the sticky powder and it's

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.980 
melted all the sticky powder and it's
now<00:01:18.659> tacky<00:01:19.790> you<00:01:20.790> let<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.149> cool<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> second

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
now tacky you let it just cool a second

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.899 
now tacky you let it just cool a second
but<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.320> too<00:01:22.560> long<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
but not too long because we want it to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.569 
but not too long because we want it to
stay<00:01:24.090> sticky<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.830> like<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.250> leave<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
stay sticky I like to do is leave the

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.160 
stay sticky I like to do is leave the
paper<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.149> back<00:01:27.329> of<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> gold<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.049> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
paper on the back of the gold so that I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.749 
paper on the back of the gold so that I
can<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:28.500> push<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> leaf<00:01:29.280> into<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
can actually push the leaf into the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.139 
can actually push the leaf into the
surface<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:31.009> make<00:01:32.009> sure<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.369> sticking<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
surface and make sure it's sticking to

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.410 
surface and make sure it's sticking to
the<00:01:33.360> surface<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.080> sticking<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.740> powder

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
the surface or sticking to the powder

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.160 
the surface or sticking to the powder
then<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.689> actually<00:01:36.840> pull<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.960> leaf<00:01:39.960> off

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
then I can actually pull the leaf off

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.460 
then I can actually pull the leaf off
using<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.189> other<00:01:41.310> piece<00:01:43.369> for<00:01:44.369> later

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
using the other piece for later

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.870 
using the other piece for later
now<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.740> come<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.130> either<00:01:47.459> a<00:01:47.549> brush

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
now you can come in with either a brush

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.070 
now you can come in with either a brush
or<00:01:48.409> cheesecloth<00:01:50.179> tap<00:01:51.179> it<00:01:51.360> into<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:51.659> surface

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
or cheesecloth tap it into the surface

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.980 
or cheesecloth tap it into the surface
first<00:01:52.259> even<00:01:52.709> if<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:52.950> using<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.310> brush<00:01:53.990> tap

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
first even if you're using a brush tap

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.870 
first even if you're using a brush tap
it<00:01:55.229> into<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.440> surface<00:01:55.890> first<00:01:56.100> before<00:01:56.580> you<00:01:56.700> do

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it into the surface first before you do

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.539 
it into the surface first before you do
any<00:01:57.060> wiping<00:01:57.649> after<00:01:58.649> you've<00:01:58.860> tapped<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.340> into

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
any wiping after you've tapped it into

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.440 
any wiping after you've tapped it into
the<00:01:59.640> surface<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.899> gently<00:02:01.140> wipe<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:03.330> that

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the surface you can gently wipe and that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.419 
the surface you can gently wipe and that
will<00:02:03.539> actually<00:02:03.840> clean<00:02:04.140> off<00:02:04.319> all<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.659> leaf<00:02:07.429> in

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
will actually clean off all the leaf in

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.279 
will actually clean off all the leaf in
some<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> areas<00:02:09.090> where<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.899> actually

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
some of the areas where it's actually

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.870 
some of the areas where it's actually
what<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> call<00:02:10.709> tented<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.730> it's

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
what I call tented that's because it's

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.050 
what I call tented that's because it's
got<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.180> pattern<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.780> got<00:02:12.930> two<00:02:14.060> parallel

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
got a pattern it's got two parallel

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.479 
got a pattern it's got two parallel
areas<00:02:15.660> or<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.320> some<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.709> pattern<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.310> these

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
areas or in some of the pattern of these

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.660 
areas or in some of the pattern of these
the<00:02:18.769> stamp<00:02:19.769> you've<00:02:20.040> got<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.489> with<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
the stamp you've got to go in with a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.470 
the stamp you've got to go in with a
brush<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.239> just<00:02:21.299> clean<00:02:21.510> out<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.900> details<00:02:23.480> so

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
brush and just clean out the details so

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.229 
brush and just clean out the details so
that's<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.959> way<00:02:25.829> to<00:02:25.890> go<00:02:26.070> ahead<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.459> pop<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
that's the way to go ahead and pop the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.759 
that's the way to go ahead and pop the
detail<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> stamp<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.930> we<00:02:31.049> can<00:02:31.200> see<00:02:31.440> as<00:02:31.590> I

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
detail of the stamp so we can see as I

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.289 
detail of the stamp so we can see as I
clean<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:35.010> stamp<00:02:35.540> we<00:02:36.540> can<00:02:36.690> get<00:02:36.840> all<00:02:36.959> that

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
clean up the stamp we can get all that

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.460 
clean up the stamp we can get all that
clean
