the<00:00:28.019> walls<00:00:28.289> weren't<00:00:28.650> high<00:00:28.949> enough<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.910> Alma

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the walls weren't high enough for Alma

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.849 
the walls weren't high enough for Alma
battles<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.050> some<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> mobs<00:00:31.619> just

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
battles because some of the mobs just

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.889 
battles because some of the mobs just
like<00:00:31.980> into<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.910> sky<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.390> then<00:00:33.510> they<00:00:33.690> come

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
like into the sky and then they come

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.049 
like into the sky and then they come
down<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.320> an<00:00:34.440> explosion<00:00:34.860> or<00:00:35.309> whatever<00:00:35.670> um

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
down with an explosion or whatever um

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.080 
down with an explosion or whatever um
anyway<00:00:36.750> right<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.739> battled<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.489> today<00:00:38.850> we

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
anyway right not battled so today we

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.080 
anyway right not battled so today we
have<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.570> mutant<00:00:39.899> zombie<00:00:40.260> who<00:00:41.040> has<00:00:41.250> 150

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
have the mutant zombie who has 150

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.000 
have the mutant zombie who has 150
health<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> hold<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.960> cool<00:00:43.410> attacks<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
I think statistically he's been in more

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.229 
I think statistically he's been in more
battles<00:00:48.750> than<00:00:48.840> any<00:00:49.170> other<00:00:49.440> mob<00:00:49.680> areas<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.879> yeah

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239

battles than any other mob areas so yeah

You Jared for requesting this battle now

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.600 
You Jared for requesting this battle now
since<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> night<00:01:07.049> bug<00:01:07.290> has<00:01:07.680> 600<00:01:08.250> health<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
since the night bug has 600 health and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.820 
since the night bug has 600 health and
is<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.540> strong<00:01:09.869> they're<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.710> to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
is really really strong they're going to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.210 
is really really strong they're going to
be<00:01:10.950> fighting<00:01:11.479> at<00:01:12.479> night<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.860> reason<00:01:14.189> for

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
be fighting at night and the reason for

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
be fighting at night and the reason for
that<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> mutant<00:01:14.909> zombie<00:01:15.210> recovers<00:01:15.600> one

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that is the mutant zombie recovers one

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.600 
that is the mutant zombie recovers one
health<00:01:16.080> every<00:01:16.320> five<00:01:16.560> seconds<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.100> night<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
health every five seconds at night so it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
health every five seconds at night so it
might<00:01:17.939> make<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.720> very<00:01:19.140> small

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
might make just a a very small

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.520 
might make just a a very small
difference<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.150> either<00:01:21.509> way<00:01:21.750> let's<00:01:22.080> uh<00:01:22.290> let's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
difference so either way let's uh let's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.050 
difference so either way let's uh let's
go<00:01:22.740> ahead<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> battle<00:01:23.670> started

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
go ahead and get the battle started

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.030 
go ahead and get the battle started
right<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.869> they're<00:01:25.110> off<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.740> see

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
right and they're off as you can see

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
right and they're off as you can see
mutant<00:01:26.820> zombie<00:01:27.060> still<00:01:27.420> trying<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> kill<00:01:27.840> me

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
mutant zombie still trying to kill me

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.300 
mutant zombie still trying to kill me
but<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> important<00:01:28.590> thing<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:29.040> he's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
but the important thing is now he's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.590 
but the important thing is now he's
going<00:01:29.549> after<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.880> night<00:01:30.000> bug<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.390> there

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
going after the night bug and there

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.990 
going after the night bug and there
that's<00:01:30.869> my<00:01:31.079> probably<00:01:31.890> my<00:01:31.979> favorite<00:01:32.520> attack<00:01:32.790> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that's my probably my favorite attack of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.090 
that's my probably my favorite attack of
all<00:01:33.270> time<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.840> stat<00:01:34.049> smash<00:01:34.409> attack<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.979> for

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
all time to stat smash attack and for

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.429 
all time to stat smash attack and for
some<00:01:35.280> reason<00:01:35.670> he<00:01:36.270> does<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.659> lot<00:01:36.869> against<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
some reason he does it a lot against the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.020 
some reason he does it a lot against the
night<00:01:37.590> bug<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.009> saw<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:38.430> an<00:01:38.520> explosion

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
night bug and you saw there an explosion

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.810 
night bug and you saw there an explosion
that<00:01:39.060> was<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:40.470> bug<00:01:40.710> roommate<00:01:41.009> related<00:01:41.610> he

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that was like bug roommate related he

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880 
that was like bug roommate related he
has<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.420> explosion<00:01:43.259> base<00:01:43.409> attacks

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
has to explosion base attacks

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.039 
has to explosion base attacks
well<00:01:44.549> obviously<00:01:44.759> he's<00:01:45.240> got<00:01:45.420> his<00:01:45.509> basic<00:01:45.810> attack

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
well obviously he's got his basic attack

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.780 
well obviously he's got his basic attack
where<00:01:46.229> he<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.439> hits<00:01:46.590> them<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> his<00:01:47.520> second

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
where he just hits them and his second

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.609 
where he just hits them and his second
attack<00:01:48.000> he<00:01:48.180> jumps<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.930> does<00:01:49.020> an<00:01:49.170> explosion

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
attack he jumps up and does an explosion

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.190 
attack he jumps up and does an explosion
ocean<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.299> third<00:01:51.600> attack<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.930> he<00:01:52.020> like

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
ocean and the third attack is he like

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590 
ocean and the third attack is he like
shoots<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.770> pin<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.700> explodes<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.420> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
shoots like a pin that explodes it I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.240 
shoots like a pin that explodes it I
think<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.560> that's<00:01:55.770> causing<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
think is the one that's causing the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.770 
think is the one that's causing the
explosions<00:01:56.700> right<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.420> you're<00:01:57.600> probably

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
explosions right now but you're probably

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.010 
explosions right now but you're probably
struggling<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:59.299> due<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.540> felt

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
struggling to see due to the felt

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.139 
struggling to see due to the felt
he's<00:02:01.229> doing<00:02:01.500> his<00:02:01.530> explosive<00:02:02.189> attack<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.909> look

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
he's doing his explosive attack and look

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.569 
he's doing his explosive attack and look
oh<00:02:03.390> wow<00:02:04.200> them<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.799> mutant<00:02:05.159> zombie<00:02:05.399> actually

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
oh wow them the mutant zombie actually

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.940 
oh wow them the mutant zombie actually
managed<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> counter<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:07.229> explosion<00:02:07.710> attack

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
managed to counter the explosion attack

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.770 
managed to counter the explosion attack
by<00:02:08.160> knocking<00:02:08.580> him<00:02:08.610> when<00:02:09.030> he<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> air

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
by knocking him when he was in the air

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.470 
by knocking him when he was in the air
that<00:02:09.959> was<00:02:10.110> very<00:02:10.500> very<00:02:11.250> wise<00:02:11.640> play<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
that was very very wise play but the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.260 
that was very very wise play but the
attack<00:02:12.780> really

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
attack really

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.670 
attack really
I<00:02:13.300> think<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.900> most<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> time<00:02:14.500> you've

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
I think that most of the time you've

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.930 
I think that most of the time you've
seen<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.950> explosions<00:02:15.460> from<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.700> mutant

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
seen the explosions from the mutant

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.620 
seen the explosions from the mutant
night<00:02:16.290> but<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.740> night<00:02:18.040> bug<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.000> one<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
night but the night bug is that one the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.200 
night but the night bug is that one the
pin<00:02:19.840> attack<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:21.280> can't<00:02:21.550> see<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.760> due<00:02:22.090> to

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
pin attack but you can't see it due to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.460 
pin attack but you can't see it due to
the<00:02:22.300> fact<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.570> they're<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:22.900> close<00:02:23.200> but

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
the fact that they're so close but

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.470 
the fact that they're so close but
hopefully<00:02:23.890> at<00:02:24.460> some<00:02:24.520> stage<00:02:25.000> we'll<00:02:25.150> get<00:02:25.330> one

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
hopefully at some stage we'll get one

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.830 
hopefully at some stage we'll get one
where<00:02:25.660> they're<00:02:25.870> actually<00:02:26.050> further<00:02:26.650> away<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
where they're actually further away and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.760 
where they're actually further away and
then<00:02:28.840> you'll<00:02:28.990> be<00:02:29.080> able<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.320> see<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.650> just

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
then you'll be able to see it and just

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.430 
then you'll be able to see it and just
ignore<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.310> are<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:31.090> two<00:02:31.270> carrier<00:02:31.720> bugs<00:02:32.020> in

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
ignore the are the two carrier bugs in

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.930 
ignore the are the two carrier bugs in
the<00:02:32.590> corner<00:02:32.890> over<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.190> they're<00:02:33.430> another

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
the corner over there they're another

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.460 
the corner over there they're another
part<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.480> mod<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:34.990> installed

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
part of this mod that I installed

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.770 
part of this mod that I installed
obviously<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> arena<00:02:36.400> needs<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.450> be<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.720> a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
obviously the arena needs to be just a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.350 
obviously the arena needs to be just a
little<00:02:38.080> bit<00:02:38.200> more<00:02:38.350> well<00:02:38.620> lit<00:02:38.920> but<00:02:39.250> that's<00:02:39.970> okay

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
little bit more well lit but that's okay

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.900 
little bit more well lit but that's okay
it's<00:02:40.870> fine<00:02:41.110> I'll<00:02:41.320> I'll<00:02:41.560> I'll<00:02:42.130> play<00:02:42.580> some<00:02:42.820> more

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
it's fine I'll I'll I'll play some more

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.250 
it's fine I'll I'll I'll play some more
lighting<00:02:43.210> around<00:02:43.300> with<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.630> look<00:02:43.780> later<00:02:44.020> it's

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
lighting around with the look later it's

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.780 
lighting around with the look later it's
not<00:02:44.440> actually<00:02:44.950> causing<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.370> problem<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:45.700> this

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
not actually causing a problem in this

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.550 
not actually causing a problem in this
battle<00:02:46.060> at<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.180> moment<00:02:46.480> oh<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.050> then<00:02:47.410> that

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
battle at the moment oh and then that

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.780 
battle at the moment oh and then that
bug<00:02:47.740> there<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.010> can<00:02:48.130> see<00:02:48.280> actually<00:02:48.460> put

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
bug there you can see actually put

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.240 
bug there you can see actually put
slowness<00:02:49.210> on<00:02:49.330> his<00:02:49.450> enemies<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.930> mutant

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
slowness on his enemies so the mutant

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.090 
slowness on his enemies so the mutant
zombie<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.340> now<00:02:51.520> slurred<00:02:52.740> so<00:02:53.740> yes<00:02:53.920> it's

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
zombie is now slurred so yes it's

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.230 
zombie is now slurred so yes it's
probably<00:02:54.190> gonna<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.490> quite<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.850> long<00:02:55.000> battle

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
probably gonna be quite a long battle

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.240 
probably gonna be quite a long battle
because<00:02:55.570> oh<00:02:55.720> no<00:02:55.990> it<00:02:56.200> seems<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:56.980> meat<00:02:57.160> in

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
because oh no it seems like the meat in

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.470 
because oh no it seems like the meat in
that<00:02:57.370> book<00:02:57.550> may<00:02:57.730> be<00:02:57.760> picked<00:02:58.060> up<00:02:58.180> his<00:02:58.300> game<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
that book may be picked up his game a

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.970 
that book may be picked up his game a
little<00:02:58.630> bit<00:02:58.810> before<00:02:59.170> he<00:02:59.260> seems<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.590> be<00:02:59.710> having

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
little bit before he seems to be having

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.670 
little bit before he seems to be having
trouble<00:03:00.010> executing<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.510> zombie<00:03:01.870> but<00:03:02.320> now<00:03:02.500> it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
trouble executing the zombie but now it

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.770 
trouble executing the zombie but now it
seems<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:03.040> he's<00:03:03.190> actually<00:03:03.520> doing<00:03:04.060> see<00:03:04.600> look

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
seems like he's actually doing see look

seems like he's actually doing see look
now<00:03:04.810> he's<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.380> don't<00:03:05.470> know<00:03:05.680> what<00:03:05.830> was<00:03:05.920> up<00:03:06.040> before

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
now he's I don't know what was up before

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.550 
now he's I don't know what was up before

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
with these guys because honestly it

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.710 
with these guys because honestly it
wasn't<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:39.010> all<00:04:39.130> close<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.910> it's<00:04:40.120> not<00:04:40.270> really

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
wasn't it all close so it's not really

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.409 
wasn't it all close so it's not really
worth<00:04:40.900> but<00:04:41.260> kind<00:04:42.160> of<00:04:42.250> close<00:04:42.430> but<00:04:42.520> then<00:04:43.240> that

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
worth but kind of close but then that

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.900 
worth but kind of close but then that
buzz<00:04:43.600> was<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.930> obvious<00:04:44.350> winner<00:04:44.590> here<00:04:44.979> so

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
buzz was the obvious winner here so

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.130 
buzz was the obvious winner here so
there<00:04:46.090> was<00:04:46.180> no<00:04:46.330> real<00:04:46.479> point<00:04:46.750> during<00:04:46.960> another
