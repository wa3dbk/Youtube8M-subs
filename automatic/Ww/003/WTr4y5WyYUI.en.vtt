00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.740 
mark the first side directly underneath
and<00:01:39.380> then<00:01:39.649> as<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.399> can<00:01:40.549> see<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:41.060> second<00:01:41.509> part

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
and then as you can see the second part

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.479 
and then as you can see the second part
or<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.409> other<00:01:42.560> side<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:43.039> it<00:01:43.159> we're<00:01:43.369> actually

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:43.489 
or the other side of it we're actually

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:45.669 
or the other side of it we're actually
going<00:01:43.789> to<00:01:43.880> cut<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.060> little<00:01:44.299> bit<00:01:44.420> wider<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:45.140> little

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
going to cut a little bit wider a little

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.620 
going to cut a little bit wider a little
bit<00:01:45.860> farther<00:01:46.159> off<00:01:46.489> from<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.090> stitching

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
bit farther off from the stitching

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.880 
bit farther off from the stitching
because<00:01:47.780> we're<00:01:48.110> going<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.319> want<00:01:48.500> this<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.679> be

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
because we're going to want this to be

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.120 
because we're going to want this to be
an<00:01:48.979> off-the-shoulder<00:01:49.640> t-shirt<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.130> that's

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
an off-the-shoulder t-shirt so that's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.499 
an off-the-shoulder t-shirt so that's
why<00:01:52.280> we're<00:01:52.459> going<00:01:52.579> a<00:01:52.729> little<00:01:52.849> bit<00:01:53.030> wider<00:01:53.299> on

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
why we're going a little bit wider on

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.120 
why we're going a little bit wider on
that<00:01:53.689> side<00:01:53.929> you<00:01:54.140> can<00:01:54.289> do<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.500> on<00:01:54.590> either<00:01:54.770> side

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
that side you can do it on either side

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.979 
that side you can do it on either side
whatever<00:01:55.399> side<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.119> want<00:01:56.329> it<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.539> go<00:01:56.689> off<00:01:56.840> the

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:56.989 
whatever side you want it to go off the

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:59.229 
whatever side you want it to go off the
shoulder<00:01:57.380> after<00:01:58.340> you've<00:01:58.489> done<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.759> you're

00:01:59.229 --> 00:01:59.239 
shoulder after you've done that you're

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:01.059 
shoulder after you've done that you're
just<00:01:59.479> going<00:01:59.689> to<00:01:59.780> begin<00:02:00.140> by<00:02:00.380> cutting<00:02:00.709> I'm

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
just going to begin by cutting I'm

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.490 
just going to begin by cutting I'm
cutting<00:02:01.759> directly<00:02:02.509> underneath<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
cutting directly underneath the

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.050 
cutting directly underneath the
stitching<00:02:04.039> and<00:02:04.219> then

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
stitching and then

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.230 
stitching and then
cutting<00:02:05.810> out<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.050> little<00:02:06.470> bit<00:02:06.680> whiter<00:02:07.040> so<00:02:07.940> that

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
cutting out a little bit whiter so that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.790 
cutting out a little bit whiter so that
when<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:09.190> stretch<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.369> fabric<00:02:10.850> it's<00:02:11.150> going<00:02:11.270> to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
when we stretch the fabric it's going to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:25.030 
when we stretch the fabric it's going to
fall<00:02:12.800> off<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.100> shoulder<00:02:13.400> nicely<00:02:23.860> after<00:02:24.860> we've

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
fall off the shoulder nicely after we've

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.890 
fall off the shoulder nicely after we've
cut<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.520> then<00:02:25.910> we're<00:02:26.120> going<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.600> stretch

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
cut it then we're going to just stretch

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.320 
cut it then we're going to just stretch
the<00:02:27.110> fabric<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:28.370> doesn't<00:02:29.030> look<00:02:29.060> so

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
the fabric so that it doesn't look so

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.240 
the fabric so that it doesn't look so
jagged<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> fabric<00:02:30.530> kind<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.830> folds<00:02:31.160> over

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
jagged and the fabric kind of folds over

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.270 
jagged and the fabric kind of folds over
a<00:02:31.459> little<00:02:31.640> bit<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.470> then<00:02:33.470> after<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.010> we're

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
a little bit and then after that we're

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.430 
a little bit and then after that we're
going<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.520> focus<00:02:34.760> on<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.690> sleeves<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.350> the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
going to focus on the sleeves of the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.160 
going to focus on the sleeves of the
t-shirt<00:02:36.800> because<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.700> sleeves<00:02:37.970> also<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.810> a

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
t-shirt because the sleeves also have a

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.610 
t-shirt because the sleeves also have a
stitching<00:02:40.100> on<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:41.360> unless<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.930> like<00:02:42.350> that

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
stitching on it and unless you like that

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.410 
stitching on it and unless you like that
kind<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:42.950> fitted<00:02:43.280> look<00:02:43.459> on<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.730> sleeves<00:02:44.060> then

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
kind of fitted look on the sleeves then

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.300 
kind of fitted look on the sleeves then
you're<00:02:45.080> going<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.350> want<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.590> cut<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.830> off<00:02:45.980> so

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
you're going to want to cut it off so

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.130 
you're going to want to cut it off so
I'm<00:02:46.820> just<00:02:47.090> going<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.360> directly<00:02:47.840> cut

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
I'm just going to directly cut

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.930 
I'm just going to directly cut
underneath<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.800> stitching<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.550> take<00:02:49.760> all

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
underneath the stitching just take all

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:00.760 
underneath the stitching just take all
that<00:02:50.180> out

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.620 

then<00:03:01.770> after<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.460> I'm<00:03:02.700> going<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.180> stretch<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
then after that I'm going to stretch the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:24.430 
then after that I'm going to stretch the
fabric<00:03:03.810> just<00:03:04.320> like<00:03:04.560> we<00:03:04.680> did<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.070> collar

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.630 

I'm<00:03:25.440> doing<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.890> same<00:03:26.069> thing<00:03:26.129> for<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.610> other

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
I'm doing the same thing for the other

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.490 
I'm doing the same thing for the other
sleeve<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.510> cutting<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.930> stitching<00:03:28.349> off

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
sleeve just cutting the stitching off

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.350 
sleeve just cutting the stitching off
and<00:03:28.800> then<00:03:29.010> stretching<00:03:29.519> out<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.730> fabric<00:03:29.940> so

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
and then stretching out the fabric so

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:55.000 
and then stretching out the fabric so
that<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.780> lot<00:03:30.959> looser

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.290 

then<00:03:56.010> when<00:03:56.220> you're<00:03:56.340> done<00:03:56.370> with<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:57.090> can

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
then when you're done with that you can

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.240 
then when you're done with that you can
also<00:03:57.510> take<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.080> stitching<00:03:58.500> off<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.860> bottom

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
also take the stitching off the bottom

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.370 
also take the stitching off the bottom
of<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.490> t-shirt<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.630> can<00:04:00.810> be<00:04:00.960> just<00:04:01.260> an

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
of the t-shirt so it can be just an

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.650 
of the t-shirt so it can be just an
overall<00:04:01.710> looser<00:04:02.220> fit<00:04:02.520> but<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.940> don't<00:04:03.240> have<00:04:03.450> to

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
overall looser fit but you don't have to

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.120 
overall looser fit but you don't have to
if<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.810> like<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.350> be<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.470> little<00:04:04.740> fitted<00:04:05.010> at

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
if you like it to be a little fitted at

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.200 
if you like it to be a little fitted at
the<00:04:05.160> bottom<00:04:07.130> that's<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.340> finisher<00:04:08.790> hope<00:04:09.090> you

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
the bottom that's the finisher hope you

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.950 
the bottom that's the finisher hope you
