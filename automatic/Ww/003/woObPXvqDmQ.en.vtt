mathematics was used throughout history
this<00:02:26.099> helps<00:02:26.489> me<00:02:26.610> learn<00:02:26.790> about<00:02:27.090> its<00:02:27.270> connection

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
this helps me learn about its connection

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.780 
this helps me learn about its connection
with<00:02:27.840> art<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.260> hygiene<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.130> food<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
with art and hygiene and food and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.180 
with art and hygiene and food and
discovery<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.569> explosives<00:02:31.380> in<00:02:31.560> medicine<00:02:32.099> and
