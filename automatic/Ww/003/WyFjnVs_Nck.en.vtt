00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
some of craters of the game so I do know

some of craters of the game so I do know
that<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.430> think<00:03:48.850> there<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.240> think<00:03:49.630> there's<00:03:49.780> a

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
that I think there I think there's a

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.890 
that I think there I think there's a
sound<00:03:50.110> track<00:03:50.230> down<00:03:50.530> there<00:03:50.710> as<00:03:50.800> well<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:52.540> I

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
sound track down there as well this I

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.750 
sound track down there as well this I
believe<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:54.370> mat<00:03:56.250> roll<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.980> it's<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.580> map

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
believe is a mat roll and it's the map

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.110 
believe is a mat roll and it's the map
of<00:04:00.940> Rome

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
of Rome

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.869 
of Rome
and<00:04:04.120> here's<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.629> front<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.400> that's<00:04:06.400> pretty

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
and here's the front of it that's pretty

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.619

game looks pretty good I know that is a

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.490 
game looks pretty good I know that is a
previous<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.539> that's<00:04:44.440> equal<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:46.080> 22<00:04:47.080> so

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
is the back of the cover and it's just

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.240

art<00:04:57.849> clips<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.630> screenshots<00:04:59.020> of<00:04:59.349> the<00:04:59.410> game<00:04:59.620> now

art clips of screenshots of the game now
for<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:01.090> jack-in-the-box<00:05:05.280> take<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.310> key<00:05:06.930> go<00:05:07.930> in

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
for the jack-in-the-box take a key go in

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.290 
for the jack-in-the-box take a key go in
there<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:10.419> I<00:05:10.900> think<00:05:11.460> turn<00:05:12.460> like<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:13.060> the

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
there and I think turn like that and the

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.689 
there and I think turn like that and the
Harlequin<00:05:13.780> pops<00:05:13.990> out<00:05:14.229> and<00:05:14.650> you<00:05:15.190> just<00:05:15.340> pull<00:05:15.580> the

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
Harlequin pops out and you just pull the

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.779 
Harlequin pops out and you just pull the
key<00:05:15.849> out<00:05:15.880> and<00:05:16.000> that<00:05:16.750> is<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.050> Harlequin<00:05:17.789> pretty

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
key out and that is the Harlequin pretty

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.560 
key out and that is the Harlequin pretty
nice<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:19.889> then<00:05:20.889> just<00:05:21.340> to<00:05:21.580> deploy<00:05:21.940> it<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.240> push

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
nice and then just to deploy it I push

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.140 
nice and then just to deploy it I push
down<00:05:22.750> on<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.960> sides<00:05:23.199> right<00:05:23.380> here<00:05:23.880> push<00:05:24.880> and

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
down on the sides right here push and

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.180 
down on the sides right here push and
someday<00:05:25.840> sometimes<00:05:26.650> you<00:05:26.770> might<00:05:26.889> get<00:05:27.070> stuck

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
someday sometimes you might get stuck

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.219 
someday sometimes you might get stuck
because<00:05:27.400> as<00:05:27.580> daggers<00:05:28.000> might<00:05:28.180> hit<00:05:28.360> these<00:05:28.539> these

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
because as daggers might hit these these

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.710 
because as daggers might hit these these
