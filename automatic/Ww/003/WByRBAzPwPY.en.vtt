00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
what I'll do a hundred in the morning

what I'll do a hundred in the morning
times<00:03:50.069> on<00:03:50.400> top<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:50.970> hill<00:03:51.180> with<00:03:51.420> my<00:03:51.450> three

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
times on top of the hill with my three

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.089 
times on top of the hill with my three
thermals<00:03:52.490> rising<00:03:53.170> which<00:03:54.170> will<00:03:54.410> give<00:03:54.620> me<00:03:54.800> an

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
thermals rising which will give me an

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.729 
thermals rising which will give me an
advantage<00:03:55.660> because<00:03:56.660> I<00:03:56.810> can't<00:03:57.110> really<00:03:57.440> these

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
advantage because I can't really these

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.280 
advantage because I can't really these
dealer<00:03:58.099> deer<00:03:58.430> can<00:03:58.700> come<00:03:58.940> from<00:03:59.150> any<00:03:59.390> direction

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
dealer deer can come from any direction

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.070 
dealer deer can come from any direction
so<00:04:00.890> what<00:04:01.220> I'll<00:04:01.370> do<00:04:01.610> I'll<00:04:01.849> use<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.390> thermals<00:04:02.840> to

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
so what I'll do I'll use the thermals to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.500 
so what I'll do I'll use the thermals to
get<00:04:03.739> my<00:04:03.890> sin<00:04:04.160> above<00:04:04.459> them<00:04:04.670> hopefully<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:05.209> mean<00:04:05.450> a

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
get my sin above them hopefully I mean a

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.900 
get my sin above them hopefully I mean a
deer<00:04:05.780> could<00:04:05.989> bust<00:04:06.200> me<00:04:06.470> very<00:04:07.220> easily<00:04:07.430> but<00:04:07.819> if

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
deer could bust me very easily but if

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.150 
deer could bust me very easily but if
the<00:04:08.030> thermals<00:04:08.420> are<00:04:08.540> good<00:04:08.750> I'm<00:04:09.410> high<00:04:09.709> up<00:04:09.739> on<00:04:10.040> the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
the thermals are good I'm high up on the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.729 
the thermals are good I'm high up on the
ridge<00:04:10.400> my<00:04:11.360> scent<00:04:11.630> rise<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.230> got<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.440> lot

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
ridge my scent rise and I got a lot

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.060 
ridge my scent rise and I got a lot
better<00:04:12.770> chance<00:04:13.520> on<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:15.140> get<00:04:15.319> away<00:04:15.410> with<00:04:15.739> being

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
better chance on to get away with being

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.340 
better chance on to get away with being
here<00:04:16.340> if<00:04:16.489> we<00:04:17.180> get<00:04:17.359> some<00:04:17.540> good<00:04:17.570> rain<00:04:17.930> that's<00:04:18.200> the
