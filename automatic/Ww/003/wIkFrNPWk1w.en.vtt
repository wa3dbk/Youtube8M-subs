change the speed of the music the pitch
will<00:00:33.480> stay<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> same<00:00:38.210> now<00:00:39.210> pressing<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.930> lock

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
will stay the same now pressing the lock

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.130 
will stay the same now pressing the lock
feature<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:41.010> locks<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.120> pitch<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.690> speed

feature here locks the pitch and speed

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.010 
feature here locks the pitch and speed
together<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.760> regular<00:00:45.210> turntable<00:00:45.840> if

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
together so like regular turntable if

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.889 
together so like regular turntable if
you<00:00:46.140> slow<00:00:46.410> down<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.800> music<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:48.090> music<00:00:48.239> also

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
you slow down the music the music also

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.830 
you slow down the music the music also
drops<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.410> pitch<00:00:49.680> or<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.879> speed<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
drops in pitch or if you speed it up the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.560 
drops in pitch or if you speed it up the
music<00:00:52.079> rises<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.829> pitch<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:54.030> by<00:00:54.149> turning<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
music rises in pitch so by turning on

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.439 
music rises in pitch so by turning on
lock<00:00:54.840> you've<00:00:55.199> essentially<00:00:55.620> disabled<00:00:56.489> any<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
lock you've essentially disabled any of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.959 
lock you've essentially disabled any of
the<00:00:57.570> time<00:00:57.780> stretching<00:00:58.289> features<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.800> torque

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.579 

now<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.120> you're<00:01:03.239> using<00:01:03.480> external<00:01:04.049> control

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
now if you're using external control

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.719 
now if you're using external control
such<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.129> vinyl<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.920> we<00:01:07.920> engage<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.549> in

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
such as vinyl here and we engage it in

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.920 
such as vinyl here and we engage it in
the<00:01:08.909> preferences<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> system<00:01:12.659> works<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the preferences the system works a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.140 
the preferences the system works a
little<00:01:13.020> differently<00:01:13.760> I'm<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.030> ahead

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
little differently I'm going to go ahead

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.230 
little differently I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:15.240> start<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> song<00:01:15.810> from<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> same<00:01:16.290> place

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.109 

now<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.930> still<00:01:22.170> use<00:01:22.350> plus<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.009> minus<00:01:23.909> 2

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
now I can still use plus and minus 2

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.789 
now I can still use plus and minus 2
transpose<00:01:24.420> pitch<00:01:26.930> but<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.259> change<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
transpose pitch but if I change the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.960 
transpose pitch but if I change the
speed<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> record<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> slider

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
speed of the record here with the slider

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.170 
speed of the record here with the slider
we<00:01:32.970> hear<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.329> same<00:01:33.570> change<00:01:33.990> happen<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.590> pitch

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
we hear the same change happen in pitch

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.550 
we hear the same change happen in pitch
even<00:01:36.180> though<00:01:36.270> time<00:01:36.570> stretching<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.079> enabled

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
even though time stretching is enabled

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
even though time stretching is enabled
now<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> main<00:01:38.880> difference<00:01:38.909> between

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
now this is the main difference between

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.289 
now this is the main difference between
an<00:01:39.720> internal<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.380> external<00:01:40.439> mode<00:01:41.000> when<00:01:42.000> using

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
an internal and external mode when using

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.899 
an internal and external mode when using
external<00:01:42.600> control<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> press<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
external control you have to press the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.780 
external control you have to press the
