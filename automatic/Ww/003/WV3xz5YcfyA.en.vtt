00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.060
 welcome to a new edition that also no points him 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.350
 video podcasts after a very very long break powerful and me now 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.139
 again a relatively regular intervals new and interesting easy 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.309
 to imagine that 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.449
 Occasionally, some older ones will certainly be there 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.960
 can be interesting 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.050
 Today I want to start with Speech fans 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.949
 you can imagine your car you are in Krad 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.859
 Abroad and does not speak the language and still wants everyone anyway 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.949
 Submit concerns or communicate with others 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.970
 that is quite good for now 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.350
 For simplicity's sake, I just have the English German version 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.300
 chosen 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.120
 but for example there is one since I speak French Italian English 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.200
 version 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.200
 depending on what you need right now 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.930
 the app is relatively simple either you can top English text 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.859
 also speak or in German text 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:52.909
 and maybe 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.949
 Just make a situation like they happen abroad 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.270
 could 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.960
 In addition to that, I disrupted my life and the record button 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.270
 Hello comma 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.430
 Can you please tell me where to find the nearest outlet 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.750
 Question mark 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.750
 I urgently need to charge my iPhone 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.140
 Ulm 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.590
 on 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.320
 yes, if you hear now hear 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.950
 where the whole translated 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.710
 and 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.350
 Dr conversation partner 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.210
 So it's the other person 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.850
 will definitely 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.890
 get an impression of what you get 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.810
 it does not always work all alone and free but we can 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.070
 now maybe just if this person now wants Antwerp words 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 You can test if that works in English too 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.310
 Rashly Keynote 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.800
 what i'm no good coffee-shop nearby 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 ICANN Giulio so recession 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.870
 Aachen 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.499
 Bonn 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.659
 that worked reasonably well now 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.909
 this confusion and with you and pull 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.909
 It's not all that bad I think the situation 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.869
 yes so I think this app could already be ten episodes if one to 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.479
 For example, voice projection in Japan now wants them from business 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.479
 buy and 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.729
 much to take with us judge and entertain feet 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.029
 then percent of that maybe maybe already makes sense 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.670
 that is a few more features 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.569
 if you click on the button below 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.149
 You can also send the whole by e-mail 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.149
 then a few seconds 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.159
 and then the text will be inserted 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.130
 and below but also around 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.509
 the Thuner Time new format 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.509
 Siemon and nice feature 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.590
 The whole could now also be sent to Treptow, for example 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.510
 these translations to Facebook 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.910
 So it was not very useful, I think 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.199
 the Software Group 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.179
 misjudged the words "and that's funny 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.589
 but now I come to the biggest disadvantage he is relative to himself 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.350
 Expensive costs currently reduced the App Store 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.530
 7 EUR 9 90 usually material turns 15 rounds 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.560
 to reason even with 500 translation something for me a pity 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:29.819
 as you can see here at 2 12 cents 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.109
 I still have 458 translations left 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.509
 and but if and when they are used up 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.879
 which still buy 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.730
 so i wish that the whole country would be Uni with here to stay though 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.029
 seems to be slides business model 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.969
 I do not know 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.759
 but and 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:53.499
 we have used up this 500 initial translation 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:53.880
 Has 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.069
 You would have to buy this 9 $ 9 90 then also 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.069
 7 EUR 9 90 in the German iTunes Store 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.349
 yes that's what 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.919
 and he can not be funny for me 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.819
 you should probably only to Lingener acute need exists 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:12.769
 around 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.859
 the price for me not so good 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.859
 Here the winter should be reduced again 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.569
 that's what already 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.990
 if you want, you can get Natek News Corp documentation again 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.930
 There you will always find the latest episodes and a few more 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.409
 other news from the man blogs 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.050
 for the download and see you next time
