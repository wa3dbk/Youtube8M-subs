00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.010 
modes I think it's fair to say that
multiplayer<00:00:40.910> content<00:00:41.120> isn't<00:00:41.480> really<00:00:41.960> as

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
but they've really changed it up and

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.130 
but they've really changed it up and
lost<00:01:54.670> them<00:01:54.880> down<00:01:55.120> because<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.630> race<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:56.020> now

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
lost them down because the race is now

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.750

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
them I mean the city is a variation on

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.490 
them I mean the city is a variation on
the<00:06:36.670> the<00:06:36.880> territories<00:06:37.450> game<00:06:37.720> and<00:06:37.990> it<00:06:38.080> is<00:06:38.200> kind

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
the the territories game and it is kind

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.170 
the the territories game and it is kind
of<00:06:38.590> similar<00:06:38.950> to<00:06:38.980> the<00:06:39.250> the<00:06:39.670> one<00:06:39.820> that<00:06:39.970> was<00:06:40.060> in

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
of similar to the the one that was in

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.710 
of similar to the the one that was in
GTA<00:06:40.510> 4<00:06:40.840> the<00:06:41.590> difference<00:06:42.040> here<00:06:42.370> is<00:06:42.610> that<00:06:42.720> when

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
GTA 4 the difference here is that when

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.150 
GTA 4 the difference here is that when
you<00:06:43.750> capture<00:06:44.170> one<00:06:44.320> of<00:06:44.350> the<00:06:44.500> half<00:06:44.680> a<00:06:44.800> dozen<00:06:44.950> or

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
you capture one of the half a dozen or

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.100 
you capture one of the half a dozen or
so<00:06:45.190> territories<00:06:45.820> there<00:06:46.060> in<00:06:46.210> the<00:06:46.510> area<00:06:46.840> city

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
so territories there in the area city

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.470 
so territories there in the area city
that<00:06:47.230> you're<00:06:47.320> playing<00:06:47.620> in<00:06:47.830> a<00:06:48.010> bunch<00:06:48.730> of<00:06:48.850> NPC's

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
that you're playing in a bunch of NPC's

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.520 
that you're playing in a bunch of NPC's
from<00:06:50.200> your<00:06:50.410> gang<00:06:50.650> show<00:06:51.250> up<00:06:51.400> to<00:06:51.580> defend<00:06:51.910> it<00:06:52.180> and

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
from your gang show up to defend it and

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.930 
from your gang show up to defend it and
so<00:06:53.530> then<00:06:53.740> you<00:06:54.310> know<00:06:54.400> so<00:06:54.520> you<00:06:54.610> don't<00:06:54.640> have<00:06:54.820> to

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
so then you know so you don't have to

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.340 
so then you know so you don't have to
worry<00:06:55.030> about<00:06:55.120> defending<00:06:55.600> all<00:06:55.840> the<00:06:55.930> time<00:06:56.140> like

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
worry about defending all the time like

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.530 
worry about defending all the time like
at<00:06:56.500> this<00:06:56.680> unlike<00:06:57.430> the<00:06:57.520> one<00:06:57.640> in<00:06:57.730> GTA<00:06:57.880> 4<00:06:58.300> you<00:06:58.420> get

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 
at this unlike the one in GTA 4 you get

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.760 
at this unlike the one in GTA 4 you get
to<00:06:58.660> play<00:06:58.810> a<00:06:58.840> lot<00:06:58.990> more<00:06:59.110> offense<00:06:59.500> because

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
to play a lot more offense because

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.290 
to play a lot more offense because
you've<00:06:59.980> got<00:07:00.100> NPC's<00:07:00.700> who<00:07:00.910> are<00:07:01.030> doing<00:07:01.210> your

pretty easily well it kind of

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.840 
pretty easily well it kind of
interesting<00:07:11.140> twists<00:07:11.590> in<00:07:11.710> this<00:07:11.800> mode<00:07:12.070> is<00:07:12.790> that

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850 
interesting twists in this mode is that

and then drive it around their own
territories<00:07:21.580> and<00:07:22.000> as<00:07:22.240> you<00:07:22.360> drive<00:07:22.630> past<00:07:22.930> your

territories and as you drive past your
friendly<00:07:24.730> NPCs<00:07:25.270> you<00:07:25.990> upgrade<00:07:26.470> their<00:07:26.650> weapons

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.010 
friendly NPCs you upgrade their weapons

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.610 
friendly NPCs you upgrade their weapons
automatically<00:07:27.730> so<00:07:28.390> they're<00:07:29.140> still<00:07:29.380> not<00:07:29.470> going

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:29.620 
automatically so they're still not going

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.200 
automatically so they're still not going
to<00:07:29.680> be<00:07:29.830> great<00:07:30.280> they're<00:07:30.640> still<00:07:30.850> not<00:07:30.970> going<00:07:31.150> to

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
to be great they're still not going to

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.850 
to be great they're still not going to
really<00:07:31.570> do<00:07:31.690> that<00:07:31.810> well<00:07:31.990> against<00:07:32.200> players<00:07:32.470> but

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.860 
really do that well against players but

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.220 
really do that well against players but
at<00:07:33.490> least<00:07:33.670> you<00:07:33.820> give<00:07:33.970> them<00:07:34.090> a<00:07:34.150> fighting<00:07:34.390> chance

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.780 

the<00:07:38.230> only<00:07:38.410> downside<00:07:38.950> of<00:07:38.980> the<00:07:39.280> lost<00:07:39.490> em<00:07:39.640> down

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:39.790 
the only downside of the lost em down

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.730 
the only downside of the lost em down
multiplayer<00:07:40.360> right<00:07:40.540> now<00:07:40.690> at<00:07:40.930> least<00:07:41.080> based<00:07:41.530> on

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.740 
multiplayer right now at least based on

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.260 
multiplayer right now at least based on
my<00:07:41.890> experience<00:07:42.340> with<00:07:42.400> it<00:07:42.610> is<00:07:42.760> that<00:07:42.790> it<00:07:43.120> can<00:07:43.240> be

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:43.270 
my experience with it is that it can be

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.600 
my experience with it is that it can be
really<00:07:43.570> hard<00:07:43.780> to<00:07:43.840> find<00:07:44.110> a<00:07:44.260> game<00:07:44.580> you<00:07:45.580> know

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:45.610 
really hard to find a game you know

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.280 
really hard to find a game you know
player<00:07:46.000> matches<00:07:46.420> are<00:07:46.540> there<00:07:46.690> ranked<00:07:47.080> matches

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290 
player matches are there ranked matches

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.350 
player matches are there ranked matches
are<00:07:47.620> there<00:07:47.800> either<00:07:48.790> way<00:07:48.880> I<00:07:48.910> think<00:07:48.970> ranked

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 
are there either way I think ranked

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.060 
are there either way I think ranked
matches<00:07:49.570> are<00:07:49.870> kind<00:07:50.020> of<00:07:50.080> easier<00:07:50.440> to<00:07:50.590> get<00:07:50.740> into

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.070 
matches are kind of easier to get into

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.800 
matches are kind of easier to get into
it<00:07:51.550> can<00:07:51.700> be<00:07:51.760> tough<00:07:52.030> getting<00:07:52.330> into<00:07:52.510> some<00:07:52.660> of<00:07:52.690> the
