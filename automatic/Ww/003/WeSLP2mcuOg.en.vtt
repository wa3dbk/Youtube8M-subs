00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the left here are the two headsets now

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
the left here are the two headsets now
they<00:00:44.399> both<00:00:44.700> basically<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.450> same<00:00:45.570> thing

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
they both basically do the same thing

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.010 
they both basically do the same thing
but<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> top<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.480> simple

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
but the one on the top is just a simple

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.420 
but the one on the top is just a simple
wired<00:00:49.260> hits<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> bottom

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
wired hits it and the one in the bottom

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.260 
wired hits it and the one in the bottom
is<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> wireless<00:00:51.149> headset<00:00:51.960> um<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:54.120> main

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
is the wireless headset um the main

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
is the wireless headset um the main
difference<00:00:54.300> between<00:00:54.780> these<00:00:55.079> two<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
difference between these two is as you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.959 
difference between these two is as you
can<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.640> size<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> price<00:00:57.629> um<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> if
