while<00:00:33.560> we<00:00:33.739> switch<00:00:33.950> on<00:00:34.130> these<00:00:34.310> what<00:00:34.520> we<00:00:34.670> find<00:00:34.910> it

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
while we switch on these what we find it

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.630 
while we switch on these what we find it
asks<00:00:35.990> us<00:00:36.080> immediately<00:00:36.740> for<00:00:37.070> entering<00:00:37.520> the

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
asks us immediately for entering the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.760 
asks us immediately for entering the
time<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.810> what<00:00:38.900> I<00:00:38.930> will<00:00:39.110> do<00:00:39.230> we<00:00:39.320> have<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.530> enter

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
time so what I will do we have to enter

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.480 
time so what I will do we have to enter
the<00:00:39.800> time<00:00:40.100> for<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:40.940> time<00:00:41.180> is<00:00:41.450> about<00:00:41.930> say<00:00:42.490> 12:55

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
the time for the time is about say 12:55

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:54.640 
the time for the time is about say 12:55
so<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.270> say<00:00:44.710> 12<00:00:50.530> 5500<00:00:52.990> after<00:00:53.990> that<00:00:54.140> it<00:00:54.290> prompts

so I say 12 5500 after that it prompts

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.040 
so I say 12 5500 after that it prompts
me<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:55.280> enter<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.580> date<00:00:55.970> so<00:00:56.390> I<00:00:56.450> can<00:00:56.690> enter<00:00:56.930> the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
me to enter the date so I can enter the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.940 
me to enter the date so I can enter the
date<00:00:57.230> today's<00:00:57.800> date<00:00:57.830> is<00:00:58.280> 19th<00:01:00.940> October<00:01:02.470> and

time as 12 55 or 56 say 1256 he asked me
the<00:01:25.159> medicine<00:01:25.729> number<00:01:26.120> 2<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.350> say<00:01:30.940> 1257<00:01:32.560> new

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
the medicine number 2 so I say 1257 new

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.590 
the medicine number 2 so I say 1257 new
industry<00:01:33.920> medicine<00:01:34.070> number<00:01:34.490> 3<00:01:34.760> and<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:35.240> on<00:01:35.270> it

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
industry medicine number 3 and so on it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.780 
industry medicine number 3 and so on it
goes<00:01:35.630> on<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.260> say<00:01:39.159> 1258<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.370> starts

goes on so I say 1258 and so it starts
with<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.270> clock<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:45.080> we<00:01:45.260> can<00:01:45.409> see<00:01:45.590> here<00:01:45.860> the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
with the clock that we can see here the

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.960 
with the clock that we can see here the
date<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.570> time<00:01:47.810> at<00:01:48.020> 12:55<00:01:48.890> had<00:01:49.640> of<00:01:49.790> course

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
date and the time at 12:55 had of course

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.500 
date and the time at 12:55 had of course
a<00:01:50.240> message<00:01:50.900> welcome<00:01:51.350> message<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.549> once<00:01:53.360> the
