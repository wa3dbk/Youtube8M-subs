little bit the SAP ones will go down

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.849 
little bit the SAP ones will go down
towards<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> planter<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.530> if<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:01.649> can't

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
towards the planter and if they can't

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.219 
towards the planter and if they can't
fit<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.219> planter<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.879> carry<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
fit in the planter so carry on to the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.770 
fit in the planter so carry on to the
rest<00:01:04.410> of<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> system<00:01:05.030> we<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.210> down<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
rest of the system we get down to this

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.570 
rest of the system we get down to this
squeezer<00:01:08.689> where<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:10.020> squeezes<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.799> apples

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
squeezer where it squeezes the apples

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.960 
squeezer where it squeezes the apples
that<00:01:11.610> come<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.030> farm<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.479> well<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.970> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that come from that farm as well and it

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.820 
that come from that farm as well and it
turns<00:01:15.180> into<00:01:15.360> apple<00:01:15.720> juice<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
turns into apple juice and the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.380 
turns into apple juice and the
occasional<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.689> it<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.900> also<00:01:19.170> push<00:01:20.100> out

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
occasional one it will also push out

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.480 
occasional one it will also push out
mulch<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.350> got<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> 20%<00:01:22.950> chance<00:01:22.979> per

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
mulch in this it's got a 20% chance per

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.789 
mulch in this it's got a 20% chance per
Apple<00:01:24.170> see<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> put<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.409> app<00:01:25.560> which<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
Apple see I put the app which is

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.560 
Apple see I put the app which is
squeezing<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> back<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.150> time<00:01:27.299> being

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
squeezing in the back for the time being

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.080 
squeezing in the back for the time being
you<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.110> explain<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.759> knew<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you know explain what you knew of that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.770 
you know explain what you knew of that
later<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.680> okay<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.790> mulch<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.570> gets

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
later on okay so the mulch that gets

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.319 
later on okay so the mulch that gets
produced<00:01:34.020> by<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.530> squeezer<00:01:34.920> comes<00:01:35.850> out<00:01:36.060> here

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
produced by the squeezer comes out here

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.850 
produced by the squeezer comes out here
and<00:01:36.680> then<00:01:37.680> goes<00:01:37.950> into<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.659> fermenter<00:01:39.770> here<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and then goes into a fermenter here it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.310 
and then goes into a fermenter here it
is<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:42.240> fermenter<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.619> pump<00:01:44.100> water<00:01:44.430> in

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
is the fermenter you can pump water in

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.749 
is the fermenter you can pump water in
honey<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:47.689> apple<00:01:48.689> juice<00:01:49.310> now<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.549> produce

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
honey or apple juice now if you produce

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.969 
honey or apple juice now if you produce
if<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.270> put<00:01:51.450> water<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
if you put water in there you get a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.609 
if you put water in there you get a
hundred<00:01:53.220> percent<00:01:53.540> production<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.439> put

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
hundred percent production if you put

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.920 
hundred percent production if you put
honey<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.210> apple<00:01:57.210> juice<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.659> you'll<00:01:57.810> get

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
honey or apple juice in there you'll get

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.690 
honey or apple juice in there you'll get
a<00:01:57.990> hundred<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> fifty<00:01:58.560> percent<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:58.979> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
a hundred and fifty percent so that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.819 
a hundred and fifty percent so that
apple<00:01:59.969> juice<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.390> used<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> fish

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
apple juice can be used as a fish

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.200 
apple juice can be used as a fish
efficiency<00:02:02.700> game<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:04.729> let's<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> avoiding

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
efficiency game and let's the avoiding

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.780 
efficiency game and let's the avoiding
SAP<00:02:06.509> ones<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.930> us<00:02:09.530> grab<00:02:10.530> something

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.300 

what<00:02:14.790> yeah<00:02:15.180> these<00:02:16.080> are<00:02:16.320> saplings<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.800> want<00:02:17.930> and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
what yeah these are saplings we want and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.490 
what yeah these are saplings we want and
it<00:02:21.080> generates<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.260> turns<00:02:22.530> into<00:02:22.970> biomass<00:02:23.970> and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
it generates and turns into biomass and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.790 
it generates and turns into biomass and
then<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.920> biomass<00:02:26.460> gets<00:02:26.820> pumped<00:02:27.180> out<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
then the biomass gets pumped out and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.460 
then the biomass gets pumped out and
then<00:02:28.800> into<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.700> still<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:31.080> still<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.350> quite

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
then into a still this still is quite

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.940 
then into a still this still is quite
slow<00:02:31.800> but<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:32.220> turns<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:32.700> biomass<00:02:33.090> into

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
slow but it turns this biomass into

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.850 
slow but it turns this biomass into
ethanol<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:36.330> at<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> end<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.050> you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
ethanol and then at the end of it you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.250 
ethanol and then at the end of it you
can<00:02:38.070> burn<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.610> ethanol<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.510> combustion

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
can burn the ethanol in a combustion

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.290 
can burn the ethanol in a combustion
engine<00:02:41.210> ok<00:02:42.210> so<00:02:42.890> that's<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.250> simple<00:02:44.910> one<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
engine ok so that's the simple one I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.720 
engine ok so that's the simple one I
watched<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.080> video<00:02:46.320> on<00:02:46.350> how<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.560> make<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> biomass

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
watched a video on how to make a biomass

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.520 
watched a video on how to make a biomass
and<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.090> actually<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.420> 1<00:02:48.720> hour<00:02:48.930> long<00:02:49.200> video

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
and it was actually a 1 hour long video

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.700 
and it was actually a 1 hour long video
so<00:02:49.770> I've<00:02:50.670> made<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.330> one<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> short<00:02:51.870> net<00:02:52.020> in

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
so I've made this one the short net in

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.350 
so I've made this one the short net in
there<00:02:52.980> one<00:02:53.130> they<00:02:53.280> had<00:02:53.490> two<00:02:54.300> farms<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:56.360> though

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
there one they had two farms and though

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.610 
there one they had two farms and though
I'm<00:02:57.510> making<00:02:58.730> sugarcane<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.030> wheat<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.230> this

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
I'm making sugarcane and wheat so this

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.470 
I'm making sugarcane and wheat so this
one's<00:03:01.800> easy<00:03:02.010> because<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.550> one<00:03:03.300> little

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
one's easy because it's just one little

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.380 
one's easy because it's just one little
farm<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.520> basically<00:03:05.820> expand<00:03:06.270> to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
farm and you can basically expand to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.540 
farm and you can basically expand to
whatever<00:03:06.630> size<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.960> want<00:03:07.040> now<00:03:08.040> let's<00:03:08.280> go<00:03:08.400> see

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
whatever size you want now let's go see

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.710 
whatever size you want now let's go see
what<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.760> does<00:03:08.880> I've<00:03:09.060> one<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.360> I've<00:03:09.450> expanded

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
what it does I've one that I've expanded

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.540 
what it does I've one that I've expanded
these<00:03:10.290> are<00:03:10.470> all<00:03:10.560> combustion<00:03:11.040> engines<00:03:11.340> that's

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
these are all combustion engines that's

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.420 
these are all combustion engines that's
all<00:03:11.760> ethanol<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.470> middle<00:03:14.120> okay<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:16.430> this

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
all ethanol in the middle okay and this

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.540 
all ethanol in the middle okay and this
is<00:03:17.490> a<00:03:18.270> while<00:03:19.050> just<00:03:19.290> plant<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.830> farm<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.430> can

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
is a while just plant a farm you can

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.160 
is a while just plant a farm you can
have<00:03:20.730> it's<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.510> 25<00:03:21.930> by<00:03:22.260> 25<00:03:23.600> as<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.810> see<00:03:24.959> we

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
have it's a 25 by 25 as you can see we

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:42.380 
have it's a 25 by 25 as you can see we
split<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.680> wood<00:03:25.980> off<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:39.410> have<00:03:40.850> 3<00:03:41.850> from<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.270> to

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
split the wood off I have 3 from it to

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.850 
split the wood off I have 3 from it to
Zoey

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
Zoey

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.160 
Zoey
one<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:43.980> them<00:03:44.070> over<00:03:44.220> here<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:45.690> fits<00:03:45.959> our

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
one of them over here just fits our

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.010 
one of them over here just fits our
fridges<00:03:46.590> put<00:03:46.800> into<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.100> so<00:03:47.310> again<00:03:48.270> the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
fridges put into it so again the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.680 
fridges put into it so again the
efficiency<00:03:49.560> gain<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.950> mentioned<00:03:50.430> before<00:03:50.690> and

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
efficiency gain I mentioned before and

00:03:51.690 --> 00:04:01.880 
efficiency gain I mentioned before and
now<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.100> our<00:03:53.100> water<00:03:53.430> ones<00:03:56.780> and<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:01.470> pilots

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
now to our water ones and the pilots

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.290 
now to our water ones and the pilots
then<00:04:02.160> gets<00:04:02.430> pumped<00:04:02.670> into<00:04:02.790> these<00:04:03.000> stills<00:04:08.300> so

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
then gets pumped into these stills so

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.110 
then gets pumped into these stills so
this<00:04:09.420> one's<00:04:09.660> as<00:04:10.230> far<00:04:10.620> as<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.830> can<00:04:10.920> go<00:04:11.070> or<00:04:11.580> you

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
this one's as far as you can go or you

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.050 
this one's as far as you can go or you
can<00:04:12.270> have<00:04:12.390> this<00:04:12.510> tiny<00:04:13.170> little<00:04:13.320> one<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:13.800> I<00:04:14.790> think

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
can have this tiny little one so I think

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.370 
can have this tiny little one so I think
this<00:04:15.300> is<00:04:15.420> probably<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.720> best<00:04:15.840> way<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.080> go<00:04:16.290> if

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
this is probably the best way to go if

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.130 
this is probably the best way to go if
you<00:04:16.440> want<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.620> get<00:04:16.739> biomass<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:18.450> also<00:04:18.989> it's

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
you want to get biomass and also it's

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.659 
you want to get biomass and also it's
also<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.380> great<00:04:19.500> way<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.710> power<00:04:20.370> everything

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
also a great way to power everything

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.270 
also a great way to power everything
because<00:04:21.060> you've<00:04:21.180> got

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
because you've got

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.760 
because you've got
excess<00:04:22.940> amount<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.290> charcoals<00:04:24.290> making<00:04:24.680> as

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
excess amount of charcoals making as

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.540 
excess amount of charcoals making as
well<00:04:26.140> that's<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.230> end<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.500> goes<00:04:27.680> please
