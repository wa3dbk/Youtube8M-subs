it was connected to and it will try to

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.860 
it was connected to and it will try to
connect<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.130> by<00:00:26.280> itself<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.330> we'll<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.690> here

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
microprocessor reproduces the original

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.249 
microprocessor reproduces the original
in<00:01:54.509> tone<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.649> produced<00:01:56.069> by<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.249> ecotone<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
in tone we produced by the ecotone so to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.850 
in tone we produced by the ecotone so to
bring<00:01:58.619> down

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.610 

and<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:05.240> phone<00:02:05.480> breaks<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.930> same<00:02:06.170> way<00:02:06.380> that

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
and the phone breaks the same way that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.830 
and the phone breaks the same way that
is<00:02:06.800> used<00:02:07.010> arranged<00:02:07.430> with<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.420> original
