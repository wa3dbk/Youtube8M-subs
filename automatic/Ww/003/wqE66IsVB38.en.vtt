now if you want to really smoke down
bottom<00:04:33.510> line<00:04:33.720> then<00:04:34.110> go<00:04:34.230> ahead<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.500> use

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
bottom line then go ahead and use

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.950 
bottom line then go ahead and use
something<00:04:34.860> like<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.070> 217<00:04:35.730> but<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.810> was

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
something like the 217 but that was

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.750 
something like the 217 but that was
certainly<00:04:37.230> not<00:04:37.590> my<00:04:37.830> intention<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.520> would

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
certainly not my intention I would

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.790 
certainly not my intention I would
probably<00:04:38.940> look<00:04:39.240> like<00:04:39.420> a<00:04:39.660> crazy<00:04:40.140> person<00:04:40.290> so

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
probably look like a crazy person so

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.750 
probably look like a crazy person so
instead<00:04:41.510> I'm<00:04:42.510> going<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:42.990> use<00:04:43.110> my<00:04:43.760> Lancome

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
go into that champagne color it's very

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:58.310 
go into that champagne color it's very
shimmery<00:04:49.950> so<00:04:54.050> watch<00:04:55.050> out<00:04:55.320> using<00:04:56.310> it<00:04:57.140> don't<00:04:58.140> go

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
shimmery so watch out using it don't go

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.500 
shimmery so watch out using it don't go
overboard<00:04:59.120> ok<00:05:00.120> now<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.360> matte<00:05:00.660> brown

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.510 

blending<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.380> into<00:05:07.500> that<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.860> then<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.340> matte

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
blending it into that and then the matte

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:21.430 
blending it into that and then the matte
black

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.500 

and<00:05:22.010> I<00:05:22.100> did<00:05:22.250> turn<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.640> eyeshadow<00:05:23.000> brush<00:05:23.210> flat

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
and I did turn the eyeshadow brush flat

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.530 
and I did turn the eyeshadow brush flat
to<00:05:23.870> do<00:05:24.020> that<00:05:24.580> just<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.640> widen<00:05:26.030> that<00:05:26.090> area<00:05:26.480> out

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
to do that just to widen that area out

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.300 
to do that just to widen that area out
so<00:05:27.080> she<00:05:27.140> because<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:27.470> had<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:27.740> fall<00:05:27.950> out<00:05:28.130> there

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
so she because I had that fall out there

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.300 
so she because I had that fall out there
so<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:29.390> looks<00:05:29.600> more<00:05:29.660> deliberate<00:05:30.290> all<00:05:31.190> right

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
so it looks more deliberate all right

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.830 
so it looks more deliberate all right
that's<00:05:31.520> it<00:05:31.700> so<00:05:32.150> I'm<00:05:32.390> going<00:05:32.450> to<00:05:32.630> put<00:05:32.720> on<00:05:32.810> my

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
that's it so I'm going to put on my

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.360 
that's it so I'm going to put on my
liner<00:05:33.080> and<00:05:33.320> my<00:05:33.500> mascara<00:05:33.920> and<00:05:34.070> I'll<00:05:34.160> be<00:05:34.250> right
