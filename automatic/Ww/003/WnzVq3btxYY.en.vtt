I<00:00:15.269> like<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.080> keep<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.529> short<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.010> it's

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
I like to keep it really short so it's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.920 
I like to keep it really short so it's
about<00:00:17.490> time<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.570> actually

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
about time to do it it's actually

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.000 
about time to do it it's actually
bothering<00:00:19.289> me<00:00:19.380> quite<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> bit

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
bothering me quite a bit

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.070 
bothering me quite a bit
people<00:00:20.400> always<00:00:20.580> ask<00:00:20.850> me<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.210> grade<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.810> use

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
people always ask me what grade I use

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.140 
people always ask me what grade I use
when<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.439> shave<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.609> actually<00:00:23.789> use<00:00:24.119> a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
when I shave it and I actually use a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.429 
when I shave it and I actually use a
beard<00:00:24.600> attachment<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.350> Clippers<00:00:27.439> beard

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
beard attachment for the Clippers beard

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439 
beard attachment for the Clippers beard
on<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.340> don't<00:00:29.519> know<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.670> equivalent<00:00:30.359> of

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
on I really don't know the equivalent of

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.400 
on I really don't know the equivalent of
what<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> use<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.890> hair<00:00:33.230> attachment

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
what I use with a hair attachment

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.959 
what I use with a hair attachment
I<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> hair<00:00:35.309> attachments<00:00:35.730> are<00:00:35.820> too

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
I think the hair attachments are too

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.459 
I think the hair attachments are too
long<00:00:36.149> because<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.540> had<00:00:36.690> somebody<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> salon

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
long because I had somebody at the salon

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.490 
long because I had somebody at the salon
do<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.980> once<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:40.260> long

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
do one once and it was like this long

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.020 
do one once and it was like this long
and<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> shorter<00:00:41.670> than<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> can

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
and I like it shorter than this so I can

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.700 
and I like it shorter than this so I can
put<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.960> know<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.410> people<00:00:46.530> want

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
put it on for you know some people want

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.319 
put it on for you know some people want
to<00:00:46.800> hold<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.190> different<00:00:47.610> ways<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.149> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
to hold it different ways like this I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.479 
to hold it different ways like this I
mean<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:48.870> videos<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.770> shaving<00:00:50.190> your<00:00:50.280> head

should<00:00:52.649> actually<00:00:52.800> hold<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> pen<00:00:53.579> all

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
should actually hold it like a pen all

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
should actually hold it like a pen all
the<00:00:54.600> way<00:00:54.690> close<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> top<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.980> think
