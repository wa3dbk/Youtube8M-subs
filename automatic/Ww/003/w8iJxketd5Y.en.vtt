00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 let's get some practice by subtracting 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:11.130
 mixed fractions let's say for example 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:15.420
 that we have two and five eighths and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 we want to subtract an integer and two eighths 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.240
 and well I recommend you to put it 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.410
 a pause to this video and try to do 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.410
 this subtracts on your own 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.300
 well one way to do this subtraction is 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.989
 place these two numbers here 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.780
 mixed we can put here two and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:43.829
 five eighths and here one and two 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 eighths and we are subtracting and then then 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.530
 we can look at this column here 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.320
 we have pure eighths we have five 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.260
 eighth and we want to subtract two eighths 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.110
 and when we have five of a thing and you 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.129
 we subtract two from one thing because we have left 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.330
 three of that thing and in this case that thing 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.140
 they are eighth 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.439
 then we have three eighths left and then 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.280
 in this other column we have cigars 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.939
 whole although we have two integers and we 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.540
 we want to subtract an integer then 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:27.420
 we have an integer so this is that this 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.670
 here is equal to an integer and three eighths 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.369
 now let's do one more exercise 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.979
 interesting even if we say for example 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:41.780
 that we have three integers and two fifths and 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.479
 we're going to subtract two integers and three 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.909
 fifth and as always put a break to the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.780
 video and try to do this subtraction for your 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.780
 account 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.899
 ready good let's try to solve 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.689
 this subtraction in the same way as 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.009
 we did around here then we're going to 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:06.020
 write here three integers and two 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:10.640
 fifths minus two integers and three fifths 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.920
 two whole and three fifths though 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.500
 we start with this column here in 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.650
 this subtraction was super simple because 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.489
 we had five eighths minus two eighths 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.299
 and that clearly is three eighths without 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.239
 But here we have two fifths less 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.270
 three fifths but two fifths is a 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.720
 number smaller than three fifths 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.330
 then how are we going to do good 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.000
 Well, one of the options we have is 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.060
 regroup not create and here we have three 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.090
 whole and we can take an integer and 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.860
 convert it into fraction and then already 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.440
 let's have a sufficient number 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.740
 big enough to make it easy to subtract 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.680
 three fifths do not believe then of these 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.610
 three whole we are going to borrow one 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.590
 and then we have two integers and that 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.600
 we will convert another whole 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.330
 fraction an integer is equal to five 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:16.350
 fifths not here there are two plus five fifths 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.960
 is equal to three and good two fifths more 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:25.010
 five fifths equals seven fifths 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.720
 then we have two and seven fifths left 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.830
 ok in fact we could even write it 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.590
 here 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.780
 gheit three and two fifths 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:42.180
 is exactly equal to two and seven 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:46.379
 fifth there are two and seven fifths 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.019
 these two numbers are equivalent and by 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.969
 what then because I took one of these 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.579
 whole and then I had two 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:56.519
 whole and that whole made it 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.790
 fraction and add it to this fraction and 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.879
 then we were seven fifths ok 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.810
 because an integer is equal to five 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:11.340
 fifths and since we rewrite this 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:15.150
 number like two and seven fifths two and 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.690
 seven fifths then we are ready 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.019
 to do this subtraction we take seven 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.190
 fifths and we subtract three fifths and we 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:31.020
 four fifths remain and then we have 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:34.380
 two minus two but then 2 minus 12 0 like this 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:39.509
 is that the total of this subtraction is four 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:43.759
 fifth then this subtraction is equal to 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:47.099
 four fifths good now let's do 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.650
 another one of these exercises in which 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:52.980
 we have to regroup 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:57.660
 integers and fractions let's say for example 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:02.190
 that we have seven and a sixth and we're going 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:07.320
 to subtract four and do not know what to say 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:11.790
 five sixth five fifths and we're 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.270
 subtracting we have a sixth and we want you 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:18.030
 subtract five sixths but then it is not 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.270
 very easy to do that because a sixth is 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.850
 smaller than five sixths then what 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.120
 what are we going to do as in the 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:30.750
 Past exercise is to ask for a whole 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.960
 lent to this 7 then we asked 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:38.139
 one borrowed and we have 6 left 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.139
 and the whole thing that is lending us the 7 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:44.380
 we're going to convert it to a fraction 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.580
 to convert to 6 sixths and then 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:52.389
 we add those 6 sixths plus a sixth and we 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.009
 there are 7 sixths 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.490
 I do not think we 're going to explain 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:00.250
 this part step by step we had here 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.340
 a sixth but we need a fraction 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:07.030
 bigger then we go and we ask 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.270
 a whole lent to this 7 that you 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:14.259
 we ask for a borrowed whole and then 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.690
 we have 6 integers left and then this whole 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.360
 who is lending us what are we going to 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.400
 convert to fraction and it suits us a 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.699
 fraction that has sixth as 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.849
 denominator then let's write 1 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.330
 as 6 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:33.839
 sixth not 6 sixth is equal to one 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:37.529
 whole and then we have six integers 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:40.439
 plus an integer that is lending us in 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:43.879
 the six sixth form but we have you 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:47.789
 that add this one sixth that we already had 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:51.899
 then we have one sixth plus six 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:54.360
 sixth that is equal to seven sixths and the 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:57.330
 why we are doing everything 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.759
 this relaxation is for us to have one 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.449
 largest fraction and we can do this 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:08.179
 subtraction then we have seven sixths 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:11.909
 minus five sixths and that's two 

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:16.069
 sixth and in the column of the integers 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:20.399
 we have six minus four that are two 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:23.819
 then the result of this subtraction is 

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:25.529
 two and two sixths but hey this 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:28.110
 fraction of here you can still 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:29.820
 simplify a little bit more because the 2 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.940
 divide the number 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.360
 and then as the denominator 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:41.010
 simplifying this mixed number 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:45.720
 we get two integers and two sixths is 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:49.940
 equivalent to one third and ready too 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.940
 we can write it this way
