00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.230
 this time we are in the open plaza of the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.860
 marine of san miguel we have here 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.400
 practically 10-12 cars on display 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.400
 10 more positions ready for test drive 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.550
 the idea of a nine o'clock tour 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.450
 dates that you are going to see at the national level is 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.980
 be able to make the client and those and the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.290
 public in general can live the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.120
 experience here to this implies power 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.760
 see the models all those who have just 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.320
 launched the brand to be able to test them in a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.160
 circuit that we have specially 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.390
 designed for them to be able to have fun 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.949
 during the day spend a family day 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.160
 because they also have games for children 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.739
 They have other activities that make 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.270
 that they can spend the day here and how 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.270
 I say is to live the experience here 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.110
 we are approaching the client 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.560
 now approaching the client and you 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.900

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.190
 with all the time in the world choose which 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.570

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.110
