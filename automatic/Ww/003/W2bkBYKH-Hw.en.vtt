Raider<00:05:12.830> but<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:13.860> couldn't<00:05:14.189> really<00:05:14.370> get<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.699> to

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
Raider but I couldn't really get it to

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.189 
Raider but I couldn't really get it to
come<00:05:15.000> off<00:05:15.110> there<00:05:16.110> we<00:05:16.319> go<00:05:17.930> missile<00:05:18.930> will<00:05:19.020> want

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
come off there we go missile will want

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.260 
come off there we go missile will want
to<00:05:19.259> split<00:05:19.650> apart<00:05:19.770> if<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.460> don't<00:05:20.669> do<00:05:20.909> it<00:05:21.060> right

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
to split apart if you don't do it right

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.080 
to split apart if you don't do it right
and<00:05:21.599> that's<00:05:21.779> not<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.379> good

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
and that's not so good

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.899 
and that's not so good
so<00:05:24.139> it's<00:05:25.139> a<00:05:25.199> good<00:05:25.440> sized<00:05:25.710> missile<00:05:26.310> right<00:05:26.550> there

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
so it's a good sized missile right there

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.829 
so it's a good sized missile right there
who<00:05:27.870> knows<00:05:28.129> maybe<00:05:29.129> it's<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.550> nuke<00:05:29.789> so<00:05:30.599> we<00:05:30.690> got
