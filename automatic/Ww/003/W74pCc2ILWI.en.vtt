00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.170
 if it's us we are the east 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.379
 that we gain weight to achieve it we have invested in 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.639
 I do not know if it's a defect or something but that's how we are the egg producers 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.340
 I really especially here in the province between rivers I think it has been 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.349
 pioneer in the transformation of the old sheds 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.500
 liverpool is smart new automatic with a phrase investments 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.099
 very important aute 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.710
 at this time 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.710
 favors the one that has been modernized why 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.480
 in production it is much more efficient different to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.750
 compare the prices of cereals in which there is at this moment in which they have 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.220
 really much uploaded 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.190
 I think the lord 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 to people who have believed and invested in good 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.670
 nevertheless, I think that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.310
 always challenges not 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.360
 and now this is our challenge is 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.680
 the Condor 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.850
 higher cost keep producing 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.850
 achieve better positioning our 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.560
 the best expression men is the time of the consultant that has been 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.670
 a very strong increase in the last five years 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.700
 again your product very cheap 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.750
 very cheap and 1-1 fashion 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.590
 ita contribute a lot of lots of silver and proteins 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.780
 and a decent quality of life is a food 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.310
 very complete 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.470
 the most complete milk can help 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.580
 a chicken was generated 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.940
 there really is a change in the consumption trend 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.540
 It is very accessible 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.770
 and also we are now doing one for the first time in many 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.810
 years a house 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.600
 the advertising campaign in which we are 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.090
 encouraging egg consumption not because 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.930
 we compete with another product that makes a lot of margin a lot and good is 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.360
 one of the challenges 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.189
 what we have here 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.619
 that we have to know that like any industry 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.299
 we have to apart from 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.089
 of the post assume production costs I have to assume certain 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:21.219
 marketing cost 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.939
 still like 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.569
 This is how advertising is generated 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.829
 all areas of the can not be that our product does not 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.489
 also the consumption of its energy in relation to the Arab countries 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.769
 in my 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.799
 heb mexico is the one that consumes the most per capita in the world 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.799
 334 egg per capita per year 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.599
 Argentina is at 214 215 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.049
 Brazil is at 120 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.999
 in Europe they are at 250 eggs per capita per year 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.889
 Japan 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.609
 it's almost 300 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.509
 the countries that consume more a new one if you notice that they are 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.649
 the japan 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.499
 French Spain 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:11.299
 he has very little face irrigation 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.489
 average consumption day is all that was talked about that 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.869
 it was a myth what the third gold was a myth 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.340
 whenever 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.209
 gone through very important medical studies and today that has done 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.779
 that also 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.779
 also the consumption habits in the most developed countries 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.040
 and is that the sector is very clear about what is 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.940
 transform the raw materials and be able to export it to decompress the market 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.500
 internally on the one hand but also to generate a lot more value from 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.180
 four are the basis in the basics of our sesame philosophy 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:04.139
 in what the earth produces us castrated to form the face not send it 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.449
 outside to do it 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.329
 in other countries not 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.280
 and that would generate employment in the places where the raw materials are produced 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.579
 very important change 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.079
 kylie is exporting 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.819
 let's not forget that in 2010 web was imported a powder 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:26.610
 already from india 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.639
 he came from israel 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.969
 he came from the united states 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.969
 nowadays we are clearly exporters 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.259
 around 8 10% of our production 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.169
 we want to reach higher levels of 20 25% 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.930
 that is our goal 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.610
 We believe that there is a market for that but we also do not forget that our 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.659
 The main customer is the consumer 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.839
 the year 2010 the poultry sector has again achieved growth what if the 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:00.540
 production 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.310
 a growth in exports and also a growth in consumption 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.120
 internal of this product now the goal in 2015 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.919
 we exceeded all expectations in the first white 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
 in the we overcome iguano we believe that now we must continue working 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.239
 and not to think about the very short term, not because 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:32.449
 ghana age and problems some pitfalls arise but their challenge is avoided 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.919
 in sectors like 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.400
 that they fall on they passed the objectives of December take to the first 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.110
 medium-term planning 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.560
 also in the second hour and the numbers go well the meat sector 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.350
 He also made a long-term planning and also about other objects what 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.020
 that technically the sector always 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.650
 two sectors have to come together to plan 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.589
 in order to obtain concrete results 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:56.889
 but very important 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.879
 they say very important you have to join 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.719
 and well, these zonal meetings are very important to transmit those 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.150
 concepts 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.979
 at this moment in the crisis cd 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.960
 the European very important has affected us a lot we have to develop another 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.789
 marked sa and other possibilities 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:20.339
 but eventually Europe is losing competitiveness are putting 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:22.809
 so many regulations 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:24.639
 from animal welfare 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.810
 there are countries that fables are suppressed because they believe in animal welfare 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.279
 there are things that bad attention because people live 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.489
 pretend that live chickens better than in humans 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.969
 the same with piglets for example possession 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.969
 will lose against competitiveness us everything but not because it was very 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:46.839
 important 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.069
 reduce our product 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:49.900
 Murcia 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.110
 there are more producers in the euro area 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.029
 are already being incorporated by d a verse avoid new facts 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:59.029
 they also accept 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:01.439
 although holland for criminals of the dynamic sector 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:04.199
 I do not know if of course there was already 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.620
 thing that did not happen until a couple of years ago exactly if 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.580
 in the province of buenos aires 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.580
 the savings are also very important noted d 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.210
 in version b outside the sector that 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.759
 but pointed to the export 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.919
 only export 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.460
 I do not know that yesterday old and his own brother 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.819
 there are very good prospects 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:31.819
 but like everything 

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:37.079
 third was the sky s with many play souk a lot sacrifice 

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:40.340
 and 40m that the hill planning
