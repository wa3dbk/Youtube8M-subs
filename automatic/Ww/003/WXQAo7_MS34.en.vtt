00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.509
 hello beautiful I bring you this video 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 about a makeup and tan 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.910
 supernatural like wearing make-up 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.030
 pronounced but super natural I hope 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.460
 you like it and we start applying with a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.590
 moisturizer all over our face 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 selection are in benicÃ ssim perfume 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.970
 apart that it has sunscreen so 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 It is very important to use any 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.199
 type of cream that has sunscreen 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.390
 and more for this summer I'm going to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.880
 recommend this tarte cream that I am 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.129
 president and what is for the body and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.969
 so much for the face this helps us 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.059
 be tanned this but without exaggerating 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.950
 and apart it lasts days and fasting used 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.410
 twice a week and more because my 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.270
 skin on the part of the face is much more 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.010
 pale than the rest of the body 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.770
 now with the makeup I will use 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.510
 this concealer group independent the 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.820

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.100

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.740
 smartbooks is this base I like because 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.790
 It is not so liquid and dries quickly 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.619
 and it does not look too greasy now to seal 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.780

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.420

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.920
