just try to follow him to see what

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.340

direction<00:00:05.580> he<00:00:06.089> was<00:00:06.240> going<00:00:06.359> where<00:00:07.080> he<00:00:07.170> was

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
direction he was going where he was

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.430 
direction he was going where he was
headed<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:09.090> next<00:00:09.330> thing<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.660> knew<00:00:09.870> he<00:00:09.900> was

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
headed and the next thing I knew he was

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.020 
headed and the next thing I knew he was
in<00:00:10.860> front<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.400> me<00:00:11.630> sideways<00:00:13.639> wanting<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.790> pull

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
out from the Lions Club driveway and I

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.189 
out from the Lions Club driveway and I
thought<00:00:20.369> I'd<00:00:20.609> try<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.880> stop<00:00:21.330> him<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:23.990> gave<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
thought I'd try to stop him so I gave it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.120 
thought I'd try to stop him so I gave it
some<00:00:25.439> gas<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.689> looked<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:28.050> he<00:00:28.680> was<00:00:28.800> looking

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
some gas and looked right he was looking

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.420 
some gas and looked right he was looking
right<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.369> me<00:00:30.980> swert<00:00:31.980> my<00:00:32.309> car<00:00:33.030> over<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> bit<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
right at me swert my car over a bit and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.630 
right at me swert my car over a bit and
hit<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.640> front<00:00:35.850> quarter<00:00:36.300> panel<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:37.640> his

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
vehicle righted the tire and I think he

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.360 
vehicle righted the tire and I think he
was<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:42.629> surprised<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.739> then<00:00:46.739> he<00:00:47.010> put<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
up and he was wedged between my truck

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.569 
up and he was wedged between my truck
and<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.219> telephone<00:00:56.550> pole<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.559> loosened<00:00:59.460> up

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and a telephone pole so it loosened up

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.930

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
them but I didn't think he would get

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.270 
them but I didn't think he would get
real<00:02:06.540> far<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:06.810> his<00:02:07.079> tire<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.649> that

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
other direction because my lane of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.090 
other direction because my lane of
traffic<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.840> pretty<00:02:16.500> much<00:02:16.590> had<00:02:16.920> that

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.270 
dark vehicle go after him and I think
several<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.590> them<00:02:34.890> did<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.480> guess<00:02:37.290> when<00:02:38.130> his

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
several of them did so I guess when his

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.750 
several of them did so I guess when his
vehicle<00:02:38.459> stopped<00:02:38.970> running<00:02:40.040> or<00:02:41.040> he<00:02:41.220> decided<00:02:41.580> it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
vehicle stopped running or he decided it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.880 
vehicle stopped running or he decided it
was<00:02:41.910> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.330> slow<00:02:42.630> dragging<00:02:43.019> that<00:02:43.260> tire<00:02:43.560> he

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
was going to slow dragging that tire he

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.990 
was going to slow dragging that tire he
got<00:02:44.130> out<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:45.480> suppose<00:02:46.170> not<00:02:46.200> far<00:02:46.800> away<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.400> ran

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
got out I suppose not far away and ran

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.420 
got out I suppose not far away and ran
for<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:50.660> ran<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.350> opposite<00:02:52.830> direction<00:02:53.010> of

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
for it and ran the opposite direction of

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.180 
for it and ran the opposite direction of
me<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:55.970> probably<00:02:56.970> think
