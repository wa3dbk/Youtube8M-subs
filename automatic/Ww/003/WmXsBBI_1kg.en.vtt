00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.900
 about 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.699
 on 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:56.510
 i'm having frequent problems friend kidding 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.690
 I will reveal the secret of the first any guitar what 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.829
 whatever it is she needs tuning for 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.129
 every musician he could have short fingers 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.860
 long 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.430
 Kudrin on the sheets is not like I have something 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.280
 more and why kerosene people see 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:20.270
 carefully on the guitar you will see that 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.429
 I first inserted another extra 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.789
 metal you on handles made of 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.610
 natural bone bone happened here 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.030
 see such billets have them 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.170
 sawed tapping methyl pegs 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:44.330
 throws all and replace all these 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:47.719
 pegs on wheels car my opinion 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.200
 the best sound is still obtained 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.880
 to 9 not even bone one wooden 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.180
 crumbs 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.180
 I see a bull made of cedar 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.990
 now see frets note 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.000
 what are not neat polished 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:17.290
 especially pay attention to the edge 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.960
 and aster let loose as low as possible but 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.730
 still not so low to ticks 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.150
 they have there Vladimir 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.820
 rang in some way about 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:35.080
 but now, let's see about 9 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:38.920
 millimeter two and a half now 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.860
 look many say that could body me 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.420
 need nails on interferes herself enjoys 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.739
 media is right as you like 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.700
 today I personally use the course see 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:58.480
 so we call it do not need gel nails 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:01.860
 on purpose than they are good because they are 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.340
 as a pick with a mass of 2 such sound 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.950
 9 which we are very difficult to distinguish 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.950
 you immediately get 7 prominently well 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.540
 catch up is rich 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.010
 easy logging 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.340
 quiet and grab 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.840
 get out 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.840
 met the same 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.420
 Here they say these nails, too, it turns out 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.330
 there is a good sound 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.599
 the musician is not 3 1 and the kids are not art 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.150
 how picking is the most important thing 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.780
 any instrument he will sound 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.840
 better exactly another person who 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.840
 just knows the notes and plays the guitar and 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:01.030
 get ready only battery 2 and hit the button 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.480
 and everything and she was herself no sound 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.280
 guitar so many shades and the devil 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.760
 stove after all his training 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.440
 institutions still went to study 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:17.190
 albeit but such a wonderful musician 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.420
 hold the teacher and have notified 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.730
 royal is two 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.400
 key I studied they are not a goat 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.620
 or where anything and they do not teach it 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.570
 him at the conservatory you 're lying musical 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.050
 I am a music school at school 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.510
 it is precisely the art of sound extraction then 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.510
 there is what the block itself considers necessary 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.040
 understand but if water don't lift 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.170
 consider what to do only one guitar 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.130
 then the machine 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:48.240
 mistaken this thing is all in your head 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:51.920
 your hands your ears is a 0 tool 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.920
 in principle will sound 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.200
 to help 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.200
 but also beads
