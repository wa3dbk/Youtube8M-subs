okay now for next bit and x5 steps is
coming<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> interface<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:14.520> outline<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
coming like the interface the outline of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.280 
coming like the interface the outline of
the<00:01:15.450> interface<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.820> again<00:01:18.290> spherical

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the interface so it's again spherical

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.920 
the interface so it's again spherical
kind<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.159> shapes<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.720> don't<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
clump up nor can i shape that is always

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.020 
clump up nor can i shape that is always
never<00:01:24.360> taught<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.900> place<00:01:25.710> girl<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.220> don't

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
the blocks and again it's great game

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.319 
the blocks and again it's great game
whenever<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.979> got<00:01:32.759> these<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.950> right<00:01:34.950> angle

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
whenever I got these and right angle

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.960 
whenever I got these and right angle
oval<00:01:36.439> pieces<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.340> combine<00:01:38.640> them<00:01:38.820> together

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
oval pieces and I combine them together

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.149 
oval pieces and I combine them together
to<00:01:39.360> make<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.079> bottom<00:01:40.350> half<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> airline's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.420 
to make the bottom half of the airline's
face<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:42.119> makes<00:01:42.240> sense<00:01:42.860> but<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.130> bit

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
face that makes sense but it's a bit

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.060 
face that makes sense but it's a bit
earlier<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.670> blue<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> screen<00:01:45.360> hmm<00:01:46.110> put<00:01:46.979> it

earlier on blue on the screen hmm put it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.219 
earlier on blue on the screen hmm put it
simply<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:48.060> above<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.420> there's<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
simply and then above that there's I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.999 
simply and then above that there's I
pieces<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.520> should<00:01:50.820> pop<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.799> left<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.920> right

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
pieces it should pop out left and right

left and right left and right left and
right<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:56.030> then<00:01:57.030> from<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> airliners<00:01:57.869> face

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
right and then from the airliners face

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.170 
right and then from the airliners face
it<00:01:58.380> was<00:01:58.560> quite<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> simple<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.759> make<00:02:00.030> sure<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it was quite a simple so make sure you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.340 
it was quite a simple so make sure you
just<00:02:00.299> shrink<00:02:00.390> them<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:00.630> nice<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:00.960> fit<00:02:01.320> them

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
just shrink them down nice and fit them

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.260 
just shrink them down nice and fit them
all<00:02:01.500> together<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.979> they<00:02:02.070> all<00:02:02.159> blend<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.969> form

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
all together so they all blend to form

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
all together so they all blend to form
kind<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.600> worn<00:02:03.899> shape<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.399> wish<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.520> would<00:02:05.610> just

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
make one shape anyway for next bit is

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.680 
make one shape anyway for next bit is
the<00:02:09.479> eyes<00:02:09.599> again<00:02:10.430> spherical<00:02:11.430> shapes<00:02:11.700> it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the eyes again spherical shapes it's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.550 
the eyes again spherical shapes it's
amazing<00:02:12.810> when<00:02:13.110> you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
years in circles eyes make one little

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.750 
years in circles eyes make one little

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
these right angle spherical shapes for

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.770 
these right angle spherical shapes for
the<00:02:25.950> eyes<00:02:26.190> or<00:02:26.610> not<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.239> I'm<00:02:27.300> sorry<00:02:27.540> the
