creative<00:00:41.040> alright<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> first<00:00:41.790> item<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
creative alright so the first item that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.010 
creative alright so the first item that
I<00:00:42.660> definitely<00:00:43.290> recommend<00:00:43.500> would<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:45.020> food

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020

scale<00:00:46.170> digital<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:47.160> analog<00:00:47.520> doesn't<00:00:47.850> matter

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
scale digital or analog doesn't matter

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.430
