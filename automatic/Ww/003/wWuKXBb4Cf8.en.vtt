00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
sometimes when you do questing it will

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.390 
sometimes when you do questing it will
close<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.010> area<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.830> different<00:01:10.830> mobs<00:01:11.070> will

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
that one what I'm going it's far better

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:03.609 
that one what I'm going it's far better
mobs<00:01:54.509> constantly<00:01:55.320> respond

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.669 

okay<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> place<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:07.409> right

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679
