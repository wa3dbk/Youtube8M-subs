00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.269
 Hi everyone honors me and then today 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.630
 there are few of us of any kind 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.330
 prove that being magicians is possible 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:18.170
 this was something created by jay 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.550
 ragon something like this 100 0 14 that 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.410
 practically allows you to use the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.730
 magic in minecraft without using 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.039
 some fashions that if for me anything 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.779
 really spectacular for showing how 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.609
 network works copy a mussel rules 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.529
 the inter of a common block by activating it 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.310
 spawn was also a koman fuck 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.960
 bloc 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.370
 actually the idiot who for the 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.300
 code you don't have to learn memory either 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.770
 nothing special 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.960
 however still quite interesting 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.640
 what this mode does is quite a lot 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.100
 more interesting or allows 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.450
 to become magicians to return to gods 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.680
 magicians must use a fishing rod 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.390
 and a portion of experience there 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.160
 will create our magic wand 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.510
 after creating our wand 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.040
 magic comes us mode 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.100
 survival and we'll have some fantastic ones here 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.880
 zombies that will work to give us 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.200
 a hand 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.090
 first we have to load the wand 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.500
 magical sleep over the glaston that 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.420
 will be destroyed as we go 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.230
 we walk over to load ours 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.210
 Magic wand 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.940
 our magic wand has some 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.730
 functions that vary when I say vary 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.150
 I mean they change these functions 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.590
 based on the slot based on what 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.850
 we have equipped in the inventory 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.740
 we have different types of 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.150
 now shows the exhibit for a moment 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.409
 the nicest ones you want 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.780
 just try it yourself at home 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.490
 Swedish in slot 9 the ice we are 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.810
 fucking ice wizards 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.490
 here is our magic wand we can 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.900
 shoot what I of the walls of 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.820
 something like ice we can 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.080
 catch them zombies actually in this 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.460
 moment it is not possible to load them zombies 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.960
 because it has made its own invulnerable 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.610
 hi tech and exhibit though if you want 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.620
 see on rabbits and very easy 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.680
 being able to kill rabbits through the 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.090
 our black magic or you want to crash 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.560
 micete of the barriers to protect from 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.510
 any zombies anyway it is 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.920
 much at your discretion in this 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.869
 chance let's take a look again that we are 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.330
 killing rabbits by choking them in 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.430
 ice the thing quite sad though 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.110
 this is what he does and does not want too 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.890
 so many charges if you see it consumes about 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.689
 about thirty 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.970
 I assume you have about thirty charges 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.590
 each use is therefore consumed 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.390
 however a mod that is not a fashion 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.480
 own scribe in the sense that once 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.250
 apply initial command you have to create yourself 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.670
 charges and using crostone 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.800
 so it's not like it seems to me 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.930
 all in all st power and obvious that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.150
 however it is much stronger than weapons 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.590
 normal present in another minecraft 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 of the things that this note with 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.239
 the use of the five george makes george 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.830
 that I don't know what to call it 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.989
 lets you shoot fucking balls 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.989
 of fire in this case are burning 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.430
 me too and this is not a good thing 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.650
 these fireballs are capable 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.480
 precisely to propagate along a 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.660
 very long territory I know probably 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.920
 will have to stop burning sooner or later 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.680
 allow us to do precisely these 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.959
 bombardments with napalm 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.280
 that practically if we succeed to 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.920
 train all of your enemies there 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.180
 chasing is something phenomenal 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.950
 let's see if we can manage a moment 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.019
 and we see a moment social hub for that 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.750
 creeper without dying burned 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.280
 we will probably die burned and right 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.840
 this thing is particularly sad 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.700
 since above all I could have arms 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.420
 of armor before entering this 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.220
 in this game 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.630
 let's go and find our body from 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.250
 take back our wand 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.810
 magic that as you see still charged 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.410
 queen who loses to office every time 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.510
 that we die 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.980
 fortunately we are now ready for 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.360
 experience the latest features of 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.280
 this magic wand that I think 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.540
 it 's worth showing you there are 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.579
 others such as regeneration 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.140
 of life but genuinely class one 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.299
 magic wand to regenerate a little 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.570
 I don't know how much faster my life 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.829
 may be something interesting 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.420
 but equip the TNT this time 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.930
 in our magic wand as you have 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.180
 I got it 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.769
 the magic of ice allows us to 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.870
 freeze people the magic of fire 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.670
 to burn the tnt is something 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.000
 absolutely more powerful than there 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.989
 allows you to launch tnt precisely in the long run 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.450
 distance 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.090
 I still have to take good care to understand 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.890
 as how to fix it obviously aims the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.400
 system is not exactly the maximum seen 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.950
 that never 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.799
 let's say he exploits the tricks 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.450
 this this mechanism of magic does not 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.970
 it was but people are grateful in a fashion then 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.100
 certainly much more difficult than that 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.870
 check much easier 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.859
 check it tnt via commands that 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.049
 through a fashion where you can change 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.430
 just the game at this point I would say 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.290
 that we are ready to show you the last one 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.540
 fantastic creation also that of 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.160
 bie with that apart from the fact that if 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.600
 you want to play and honestly say it 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.970
 quite difficult to get of 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.530
 consequence also quite rare among 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.120
 to be able to obtain it precisely for 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.960
 use it for military purposes such as 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.820
 we're going to do us 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.800
 the only thing we should first upload 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.080
 moment our wand why not 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.940
 I wish its functions are exhausted 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.289
 right in time of need 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.930
 something very son has connoted for 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.550
 upload them to make simple stacks of this 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.930
 glow stone what to do to load it 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.280
 then equip yourself the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.789
 wand we will get down to speed 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.349
 of the light 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.120
 possibly smashing there is also a bit 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.440
 my legs reached the beautiful wand 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.789
 equipped we can start giving 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.640
 vent our creativity 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.770
 destroyer going at the mobs 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.750
 using this power to push them 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.330
 via is a kind of tornado in reality 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.710
 but it works in a circular manner 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.200
 but now for a moment to show of 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.150
 better if we don't even put ourselves of 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.250
 shoulders should work the same e 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.780
 in this case it sends the binary zoom 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.419
 now the zombie please give me the 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.950
 courtesy of getting out of the balls 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.270
 if you notice here is also the whole hens 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.460
 how much is sent to the air then one 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.849
 perhaps the strongest powers even if not 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.860
 f 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.140
 it's not the coolest to see why that 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.810
 that primacy undoubtedly belongs to 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.479
 fireballs is for sure a power that 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.890
 worth using just in case 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.390
 we are surrounded by numerous mobs 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.130
 we can blow everything up in the air 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.970
 maximum are of shots to make them 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.310
 jump in the air 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.169
 distrust coltan from falling this case 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.010
 we finish with a nice fire 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.469
 that I have yet to figure out how to use 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.840
 without burning all the cells 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.550
 nervous after I die 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.229
 I would say that the time has come to conclude 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.630
 this video if you want to replicate it 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.310
 you also find the command that 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.050
 something very long in a link in 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.409
 description perimeter indiscretion 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.270
 I don't think they're putting us there 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.830
 anyway to tell you something you have 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.120
 simply copy paste is not 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.099
 nothing to understand 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.510
 copy and paste launch yours 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.159
 your fishing rod 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.289
 put your passion and experience 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.669
 and you are ready to play and from this by 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.630
 little is everything I thank you saw 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.820
 this video 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.289
 I also thank one of my fans 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.820
 he did this fantastic within 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.340
 i will use for these episodes and beats way 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.969
 recently commemorative and see you all 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.150
 to the next 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.150
 Hello
