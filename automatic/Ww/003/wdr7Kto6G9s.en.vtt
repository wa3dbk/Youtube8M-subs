need<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.480> know<00:02:22.630> how<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.930> actually<00:02:23.380> do<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.220> now

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
need to know how to actually do this now

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.060 
need to know how to actually do this now
let's<00:02:25.300> look<00:02:25.570> at<00:02:25.750> how<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.440> do<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.830> same

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
let's look at how you can do the same

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.600 
let's look at how you can do the same
thing<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:28.060> Nikon<00:02:28.450> d7100<00:02:29.320> so<00:02:29.950> we<00:02:30.310> are<00:02:30.460> here

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
thing on the Nikon d7100 so we are here

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.630 
thing on the Nikon d7100 so we are here
with<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.910> Nikon<00:02:31.660> d7100<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:33.250> let's<00:02:33.460> say<00:02:33.610> that

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
with the Nikon d7100 and let's say that

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.760 
with the Nikon d7100 and let's say that
we<00:02:33.910> want<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.210> do<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.510> same<00:02:34.720> thing<00:02:35.110> here<00:02:35.620> we

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
we want to do the same thing here we

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.410 
we want to do the same thing here we
have<00:02:35.950> an<00:02:36.070> image<00:02:36.190> let's<00:02:36.610> say<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.910> we<00:02:37.060> want<00:02:37.300> to

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
have an image let's say that we want to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.060 
have an image let's say that we want to
go<00:02:37.540> inside<00:02:37.720> we<00:02:38.140> need<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.410> press<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.680> plus

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
go inside we need to press the plus

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.480 
go inside we need to press the plus
button<00:02:39.100> or<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.390> minus<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:41.080> go<00:02:41.290> out<00:02:41.830> into<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
for image now let's say that we want to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.010 
for image now let's say that we want to
do<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.250> same<00:02:45.490> thing<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.000> we<00:02:46.180> did<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.660> the

have ok button much more simple much
more<00:03:07.570> sensible<00:03:08.260> naming<00:03:09.190> than<00:03:09.520> what<00:03:09.880> we<00:03:10.030> have

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
more sensible naming than what we have

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.830 
more sensible naming than what we have
on<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.780> D<00:03:10.930> 810<00:03:11.830> we<00:03:12.550> choose<00:03:12.820> this<00:03:13.090> then<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.690> go

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
on the D 810 we choose this then we go

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.699 
on the D 810 we choose this then we go
into<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.440> playback<00:03:15.010> mode<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:16.410> we<00:03:17.410> choose

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
into the playback mode and we choose

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.780 
into the playback mode and we choose
zoom<00:03:18.250> on/off<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:20.250> here<00:03:21.250> we<00:03:21.400> have<00:03:21.550> three

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
zoom on/off and here we have three

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.370 
zoom on/off and here we have three
options<00:03:22.000> we<00:03:22.480> have<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.810> low<00:03:23.020> magnification

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
options we have the low magnification

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.229 
options we have the low magnification
medium<00:03:24.250> magnification<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.030> high

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
medium magnification and high

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.420 
medium magnification and high
magnification<00:03:26.020> we're<00:03:26.530> not<00:03:26.680> sure<00:03:26.860> why<00:03:27.190> not

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
magnification we're not sure why not

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.170 
magnification we're not sure why not
didn't<00:03:28.170> choose<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.440> actually<00:03:29.620> give<00:03:30.070> them<00:03:30.340> the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
didn't choose to actually give them the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.830 
didn't choose to actually give them the
actual<00:03:31.360> magnification<00:03:32.290> one-to-one<00:03:32.980> or<00:03:33.840> 200%

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
actual magnification one-to-one or 200%

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.810 
actual magnification one-to-one or 200%
or<00:03:35.290> something<00:03:35.650> like<00:03:35.800> that<00:03:35.860> but<00:03:36.430> we<00:03:36.640> know<00:03:36.790> that

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
or something like that but we know that

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.430 
or something like that but we know that
a<00:03:37.000> medium<00:03:37.360> magnification<00:03:38.020> should<00:03:38.290> be

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
a medium magnification should be

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.850 
a medium magnification should be
one-to-one<00:03:39.450> 100%<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:40.959> we<00:03:41.230> choose<00:03:41.440> medium

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
one-to-one 100% so we choose medium

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.100 
one-to-one 100% so we choose medium
magnification<00:03:42.550> let's<00:03:43.000> go<00:03:43.180> back<00:03:43.480> into<00:03:43.840> the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
magnification let's go back into the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.160 
magnification let's go back into the
image<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:44.860> this<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.310> our<00:03:45.489> image<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.030> now<00:03:46.690> with

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
image so this is our image and now with

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.470 
image so this is our image and now with
a<00:03:47.200> simple<00:03:47.470> click<00:03:47.890> on<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.400> ok<00:03:48.850> button<00:03:48.880> we<00:03:49.450> see

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
a simple click on the ok button we see

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.370 
a simple click on the ok button we see
the<00:03:50.380> 4<00:03:50.770> image<00:03:51.100> in<00:03:51.250> 100%<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:52.330> this<00:03:52.810> case<00:03:53.050> we<00:03:53.230> can

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
the 4 image in 100% in this case we can

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.190 
the 4 image in 100% in this case we can
see<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.830> image<00:03:54.160> is<00:03:54.310> not<00:03:54.520> sharp<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:56.050> the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
see that the image is not sharp so the

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.900 
see that the image is not sharp so the
focus<00:03:56.440> wasn't<00:03:56.770> good<00:03:57.070> or<00:03:57.100> there<00:03:57.430> was<00:03:57.580> some

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
focus wasn't good or there was some

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.330 
focus wasn't good or there was some
other<00:03:58.120> problem<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.560> we<00:03:59.770> do<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.040> all<00:04:00.310> the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
other problem and we do this all the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.370 
other problem and we do this all the
time<00:04:00.459> every<00:04:01.150> time<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:01.510> we<00:04:01.660> shoot<00:04:01.900> which<00:04:02.140> if

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
time every time that we shoot which if

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.190 
time every time that we shoot which if
we<00:04:02.620> check<00:04:02.830> their<00:04:03.040> focus<00:04:03.580> using<00:04:04.450> just<00:04:05.020> one

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
we check their focus using just one

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.949 
we check their focus using just one
click<00:04:05.470> very<00:04:05.950> useful<00:04:06.519> just<00:04:06.730> another<00:04:07.420> click<00:04:07.720> and

don't know why from some reason Ikon
decided<00:05:00.730> that<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.180> is<00:05:01.360> too<00:05:01.660> advanced<00:05:02.080> for

amateur or beginner photographers this
is<00:05:06.400> plain<00:05:07.270> wrong<00:05:07.540> in<00:05:07.750> our<00:05:07.960> view<00:05:08.290> it<00:05:09.010> should

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
is plain wrong in our view it should

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.540 
is plain wrong in our view it should
exist<00:05:09.400> also<00:05:09.970> on<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:10.810> lower<00:05:11.590> end<00:05:11.890> series<00:05:12.250> of

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
exist also on the lower end series of

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.670 
exist also on the lower end series of
cameras<00:05:12.970> actually<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.420> should<00:05:13.750> be<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:13.990> default

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
cameras actually it should be a default

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.580 
cameras actually it should be a default
state<00:05:15.070> in<00:05:15.310> our<00:05:15.490> view<00:05:15.910> but<00:05:16.870> this<00:05:17.110> is<00:05:17.260> how<00:05:17.440> it

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
state in our view but this is how it

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.950 
state in our view but this is how it
goes<00:05:17.830> very<00:05:18.430> very<00:05:18.820> simple<00:05:19.360> you<00:05:19.390> need<00:05:19.660> to<00:05:19.810> know

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
goes very very simple you need to know

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.650 
goes very very simple you need to know
how<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.140> do<00:05:20.440> it<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:21.340> might<00:05:21.640> be<00:05:21.700> a<00:05:21.880> bit<00:05:22.210> different

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
how to do it it might be a bit different

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.990 
how to do it it might be a bit different
for<00:05:22.840> each<00:05:22.960> camera<00:05:23.380> but<00:05:23.740> this<00:05:23.890> is<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.340> basic

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
for each camera but this is the basic

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.660 
for each camera but this is the basic
idea<00:05:25.180> so<00:05:25.720> here<00:05:26.350> you<00:05:26.500> have<00:05:26.710> it<00:05:26.860> really<00:05:27.280> simple

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
idea so here you have it really simple

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.700 
idea so here you have it really simple
really<00:05:27.940> easy<00:05:28.090> if<00:05:28.510> you<00:05:28.630> know<00:05:28.780> how<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.050> do<00:05:29.350> it<00:05:29.500> if
