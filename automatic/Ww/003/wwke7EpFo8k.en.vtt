new features now the cool thing about
the<00:00:18.539> Alexa<00:00:18.869> plus<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:20.279> everything<00:00:20.759> for

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the Alexa plus is that is everything for

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.550 
the Alexa plus is that is everything for
the<00:00:21.029> Aerie<00:00:21.210> wireless<00:00:21.720> remote<00:00:21.989> system<00:00:22.380> built

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the Aerie wireless remote system built

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.040 
the Aerie wireless remote system built
in<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.730> take<00:00:23.939> your<00:00:23.970> lens<00:00:24.360> motors<00:00:24.779> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
in so you can take your lens motors and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.900 
in so you can take your lens motors and
plug<00:00:25.710> them<00:00:25.890> directly<00:00:26.339> into<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> camera

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
plug them directly into the camera

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
plug them directly into the camera
there's<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.750> radio<00:00:28.019> building<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> camera

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
there's a radio building to the camera

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.950 
there's a radio building to the camera
so<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> Aerie<00:00:30.089> wireless<00:00:30.660> remote

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
so with the Aerie wireless remote

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.829 
so with the Aerie wireless remote
control<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.589> can<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.099> pull<00:00:32.369> focus<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.540> zoom

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:33.839 
control I can now pull focus I can zoom

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:36.860 
control I can now pull focus I can zoom
and<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.769> can<00:00:34.980> change<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:36.030> iris<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> camera

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and I can change the iris of the camera

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.590 
and I can change the iris of the camera
so<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.769> can<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:38.220> control<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.910> Alexa<00:00:39.329> plus

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
so you can now control the Alexa plus

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.750 
so you can now control the Alexa plus
from<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.470> air<00:00:40.589> a<00:00:40.620> wireless<00:00:41.100> remote<00:00:41.220> system

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
from the air a wireless remote system

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.490 
from the air a wireless remote system
but<00:00:42.239> there's<00:00:42.420> another<00:00:42.629> piece<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> exciting

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
but there's another piece of exciting

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.380 
but there's another piece of exciting
news<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.370> worked<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> partnership

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
news we have worked in a partnership

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.080 
news we have worked in a partnership
with<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:46.440> motion<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.610> make<00:00:47.879> wireless

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
with see motion they also make wireless

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
with see motion they also make wireless
systems<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.079> we're<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.320> cooperating<00:00:49.980> with

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
systems and we're not cooperating with

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.369 
systems and we're not cooperating with
it<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.910> are<00:00:50.969> selling<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> every<00:00:51.870> system<00:00:52.260> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it we are selling the every system is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
it we are selling the every system is
well<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> sea<00:00:52.920> motion<00:00:53.219> system<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.000> see

motion<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.750> selling<00:00:55.079> area<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.559> well<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.800> see

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
motion is selling area as well as see

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
motion is selling area as well as see
motion<00:00:56.250> furthermore<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:59.070> Alexa<00:00:59.550> plus<00:00:59.940> will

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
motion furthermore the Alexa plus will

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.599 
motion furthermore the Alexa plus will
also<00:01:00.840> work<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.199> ass<00:01:01.350> emotions<00:01:01.739> evolution

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
also work with ass emotions evolution

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.249 
also work with ass emotions evolution
system<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.510> there's<00:01:03.660> no<00:01:03.750> two<00:01:03.809> ways<00:01:04.050> to

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
system so there's no two ways to

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.050 
system so there's no two ways to
remotely<00:01:04.710> control<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.309> lens<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.789> the<00:01:05.820> motor

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
remotely control the lens and the motor

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.419 
remotely control the lens and the motor
one<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> airy<00:01:07.110> wireless<00:01:07.619> system<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
one is the airy wireless system the

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:10.639 
one is the airy wireless system the
other<00:01:08.550> way<00:01:08.789> one<00:01:09.149> is<00:01:09.390> thus<00:01:09.570> emotions<00:01:09.899> evolution

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
other way one is thus emotions evolution

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.710 
other way one is thus emotions evolution
system<00:01:11.009> so<00:01:11.789> that's<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.360> side<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.660> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
system so that's it for this side of the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.150 
system so that's it for this side of the
camera<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.259> we<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.679> more<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.039> other

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
camera but we have more on the other

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.539 
camera but we have more on the other
side<00:01:14.479> let<00:01:15.479> me<00:01:15.599> swing<00:01:15.869> around

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.459 

all<00:01:19.549> right<00:01:19.789> what<00:01:20.179> we<00:01:20.270> have<00:01:20.420> here<00:01:20.689> is<00:01:20.719> more<00:01:21.229> note

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
all right what we have here is more note

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.889 
all right what we have here is more note

this month on and the RCU for is exempt

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.730 
this month on and the RCU for is exempt
essentially<00:01:29.240> exactly<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.990> same<00:01:30.259> user

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
essentially exactly the same user

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.770 
essentially exactly the same user
interface<00:01:31.250> as<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:32.000> rest<00:01:32.149> of<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.359> camera<00:01:32.630> has

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
interface as the rest of the camera has

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.719 
interface as the rest of the camera has
so<00:01:33.319> if<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.469> know<00:01:33.619> how<00:01:33.829> to<00:01:33.859> operate<00:01:34.189> an<00:01:34.310> Alexa

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
so if you know how to operate an Alexa

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.719 
so if you know how to operate an Alexa
you<00:01:35.119> know<00:01:35.329> how<00:01:35.509> to<00:01:35.569> operate<00:01:35.959> an<00:01:36.079> RC<00:01:36.380> before

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
you know how to operate an RC before

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.730 
you know how to operate an RC before
which<00:01:37.729> brings<00:01:37.939> me<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.179> this<00:01:38.780> baby<00:01:39.109> on<00:01:39.349> top<00:01:39.590> of

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
board for us and it before it's only

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.910 
board for us and it before it's only
airing<00:01:46.909> raw<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.209> a<00:01:47.270> single<00:01:47.630> channel<00:01:48.020> but<00:01:48.679> it
