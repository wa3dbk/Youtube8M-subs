module like this to be able to layer
sound<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:39.869> unique<00:01:40.140> sounds<00:01:40.530> actually

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
sound so you get unique sounds actually

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
sound so you get unique sounds actually
over<00:01:41.579> four<00:01:41.880> hundred<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.180> seventy<00:01:42.329> seven

over four hundred and seventy seven

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.780 
over four hundred and seventy seven
thousand<00:01:43.229> combinations<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.890> sounds<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.610> by

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
thousand combinations of sounds just by

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
thousand combinations of sounds just by
layering<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.229> enough<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
layering and if that's not enough it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.929 
layering and if that's not enough it
actually<00:01:46.710> has<00:01:47.009> sampled<00:01:47.250> importance<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.820> can

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
actually has sampled importance you can

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.880 
actually has sampled importance you can
import<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.299> own<00:01:48.600> sounds<00:01:49.229> into<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
import your own sounds into it and you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
import your own sounds into it and you
do<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.159> via<00:01:50.340> USB<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.509> correct

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
do that via USB that is correct

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.880
