last summer I gave in like I think like

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.560

a<00:01:19.130> month<00:01:19.369> early<00:01:19.759> or<00:01:19.880> two<00:01:20.090> months<00:01:20.299> or<00:01:20.360> nine<00:01:20.540> or

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.069 
a month early or two months or nine or
something<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.500> um<00:01:21.679> so<00:01:22.310> I'm<00:01:22.399> so<00:01:22.609> happy<00:01:22.719> now<00:01:23.719> I

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
something but um so I'm so happy now I

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.620 
something but um so I'm so happy now I
think<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:25.009> my<00:01:25.159> hair<00:01:25.369> has<00:01:25.399> grown<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.999> little

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
think that my hair has grown a little

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.059 
think that my hair has grown a little
bit<00:01:26.780> I<00:01:27.020> really<00:01:27.950> do<00:01:29.200> I'm<00:01:30.200> not<00:01:30.380> sure<00:01:30.439> how<00:01:30.770> much

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
bit I really do I'm not sure how much

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.849 
bit I really do I'm not sure how much
but<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.060> really<00:01:32.359> do<00:01:32.509> think<00:01:32.539> like<00:01:32.869> it's<00:01:33.469> like<00:01:33.679> a

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
but I really do think like it's like a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.260 
but I really do think like it's like a
little<00:01:34.009> bit<00:01:34.219> past<00:01:34.399> um

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
little bit past um

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.410 
little bit past um
arm<00:01:35.840> bit<00:01:36.109> length<00:01:36.319> and<00:01:37.039> I<00:01:37.189> think<00:01:37.460> before<00:01:37.609> it<00:01:38.179> was

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
arm bit length and I think before it was

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.300 
arm bit length and I think before it was
just<00:01:38.950> too<00:01:39.950> armpit<00:01:40.429> like<00:01:40.749> excuse<00:01:41.749> me<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:42.310> can't

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
just too armpit like excuse me I can't

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.800 
just too armpit like excuse me I can't
find<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.729> before<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.210> ask<00:01:44.359> your<00:01:44.509> pictures

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
find that before and ask your pictures

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.459 
find that before and ask your pictures
so<00:01:45.679> I<00:01:46.340> can't<00:01:47.030> really<00:01:47.119> tell<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:48.049> I<00:01:48.200> think

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
so I can't really tell but I I think

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.620 
so I can't really tell but I I think
that<00:01:48.679> it<00:01:48.889> has<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:49.399> if<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.850> hasn't<00:01:49.999> to<00:01:50.359> you<00:01:50.450> guys

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
that it has and if it hasn't to you guys

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.330 
that it has and if it hasn't to you guys
I<00:01:50.659> really<00:01:50.840> think<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:51.619> got<00:01:52.009> much

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
I really think that it's got much

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.969 
I really think that it's got much
healthier<00:01:52.789> from<00:01:53.420> before<00:01:54.200> when<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:54.439> started

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
healthier from before when I started

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.469 
healthier from before when I started
like<00:01:55.490> if<00:01:55.609> you<00:01:55.700> put<00:01:55.850> your<00:01:55.969> hands<00:01:56.179> full<00:01:56.359> it

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
like if you put your hands full it

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.809 
like if you put your hands full it
through<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.109> just<00:01:57.259> feels<00:01:57.469> so<00:01:57.560> soft<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.520> I

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
through it it just feels so soft and I

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.840 
through it it just feels so soft and I

but I just want to show you guys that

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.200 
but I just want to show you guys that
completely<00:04:38.500> straight<00:04:38.830> I'm<00:04:39.460> looking<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:40.180> the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
completely straight I'm looking in the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.640 
completely straight I'm looking in the
mirror<00:04:40.300> that's<00:04:40.570> why<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.750> keep<00:04:40.900> looking<00:04:41.050> up<00:04:41.410> but

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
mirror that's why I keep looking up but

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.820 
mirror that's why I keep looking up but
I<00:04:41.889> really<00:04:42.280> think<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.300> it<00:04:43.630> grew<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.970> little<00:04:45.970> bit

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
I really think that it grew a little bit

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.810 
I really think that it grew a little bit
honestly<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:47.860> don't<00:04:47.979> remember<00:04:48.130> how<00:04:48.460> long<00:04:48.639> it

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
honestly I don't remember how long it

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.320 
honestly I don't remember how long it
was<00:04:48.960> before<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.229> started<00:04:50.500> but<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.130> know<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.340> did<00:04:52.180> I

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
was before I started but I know I did I

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.070 
was before I started but I know I did I
turned<00:04:52.750> my<00:04:52.810> ends<00:04:53.080> before<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:53.410> started<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:56.050> I

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
turned my ends before I started so I

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.550 
turned my ends before I started so I
think<00:04:56.410> it<00:04:56.500> was<00:04:56.650> like<00:04:56.860> I<00:04:57.419> don't<00:04:58.419> know<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:58.840> don't

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
think it was like I don't know I don't

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.070 
think it was like I don't know I don't
know<00:04:59.650> but<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.400> do<00:05:00.520> feel<00:05:00.850> like<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.150> grew<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.990> I

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
know but I do feel like it grew and I

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.200 
know but I do feel like it grew and I
feel<00:05:02.260> like<00:05:02.350> it's<00:05:02.500> much<00:05:02.680> healthier<00:05:03.030> though<00:05:04.030> my

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
feel like it's much healthier though my

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.900 
feel like it's much healthier though my
ends<00:05:04.449> are<00:05:04.510> kinda<00:05:04.900> like<00:05:05.139> really<00:05:05.350> thick<00:05:05.949> I<00:05:06.280> don't

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
ends are kinda like really thick I don't

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.340 
ends are kinda like really thick I don't
buy<00:05:07.030> flattering<00:05:07.600> them<00:05:07.750> good<00:05:07.930> enough<00:05:08.139> or<00:05:08.320> not

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
buy flattering them good enough or not

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.770 
buy flattering them good enough or not
but<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.669> also<00:05:09.820> need<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.060> get<00:05:10.210> my<00:05:10.300> inch<00:05:10.479> trim

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
so don't worry about these ends because

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.670 
so don't worry about these ends because
I<00:05:12.610> will<00:05:12.760> be<00:05:12.880> getting<00:05:13.000> them<00:05:13.300> trimmed<00:05:13.720> so<00:05:14.410> this

I will be getting them trimmed so this

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:23.930 
I will be getting them trimmed so this
is<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.950> front<00:05:16.320> um<00:05:18.930> this<00:05:19.930> is<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.680> side<00:05:22.770> and

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
is the front um this is the side and

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:33.360 
is the front um this is the side and
hopefully<00:05:24.940> you<00:05:25.150> can<00:05:25.210> see<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.690> back<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:33.220> can

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
hopefully you can see the back you can

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:42.740 
hopefully you can see the back you can
see

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.680 

yeah<00:05:46.740> what<00:05:47.740> do<00:05:47.830> you<00:05:47.889> think<00:05:48.330> yeah<00:05:49.330> so<00:05:49.509> that's

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
yeah what do you think yeah so that's

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.939 
yeah what do you think yeah so that's
what<00:05:49.870> that's<00:05:50.110> what<00:05:50.319> it<00:05:50.410> looks<00:05:50.560> like<00:05:50.740> without

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
what that's what it looks like without

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.089 
what that's what it looks like without
curling<00:05:51.729> it<00:05:52.000> under<00:05:52.560> because<00:05:53.560> I<00:05:53.770> thought<00:05:53.919> that

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
curling it under because I thought that

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:55.260 
curling it under because I thought that
maybe<00:05:54.220> would<00:05:54.490> probably<00:05:54.819> look<00:05:54.910> a<00:05:54.970> little<00:05:55.150> bit

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
maybe would probably look a little bit

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.490 
maybe would probably look a little bit
shorter<00:05:55.599> with<00:05:55.720> curled<00:05:55.990> under

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
shorter with curled under

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.620 
shorter with curled under
but<00:05:56.830> maybe<00:05:57.340> it's<00:05:57.520> about<00:05:57.639> the<00:05:57.789> same<00:05:57.940> but<00:05:58.419> anyway

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
but maybe it's about the same but anyway

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.860 
but maybe it's about the same but anyway
this<00:05:58.750> is<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:59.020> front<00:05:59.289> view<00:05:59.669> like<00:06:00.669> past<00:06:01.569> my

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
this is the front view like past my

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.230 
this is the front view like past my
armpits

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
armpits

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.129 
armpits
yeah<00:06:04.240> so<00:06:04.479> I'm<00:06:04.599> definitely<00:06:04.720> I<00:06:04.960> definitely

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
yeah so I'm definitely I definitely

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:06.839 
yeah so I'm definitely I definitely
think<00:06:05.440> that<00:06:05.530> in<00:06:05.680> his<00:06:05.770> room<00:06:06.039> because<00:06:06.400> it<00:06:06.550> wasn't

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
think that in his room because it wasn't

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.379 
think that in his room because it wasn't
past<00:06:07.180> my<00:06:07.389> armpits<00:06:07.750> before<00:06:08.940> this<00:06:09.940> is<00:06:10.090> a<00:06:10.120> side

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
past my armpits before this is a side

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.629 
past my armpits before this is a side
view<00:06:10.419> and<00:06:14.099> hopefully<00:06:15.099> you<00:06:15.190> could<00:06:15.310> see<00:06:15.460> them

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
view and hopefully you could see them

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:23.700 
view and hopefully you could see them
after<00:06:15.789> you<00:06:21.090> um<00:06:22.090> yeah<00:06:22.690> so<00:06:22.960> I<00:06:22.990> know<00:06:23.110> my<00:06:23.349> dip<00:06:23.530> my

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
after you um yeah so I know my dip my

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.010 
after you um yeah so I know my dip my
ends<00:06:24.039> probably<00:06:24.460> look<00:06:24.610> dead<00:06:24.909> because<00:06:25.659> I<00:06:25.840> don't

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
ends probably look dead because I don't

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.040 
ends probably look dead because I don't
know<00:06:26.080> what<00:06:26.319> so<00:06:27.509> don't<00:06:28.509> worry<00:06:28.690> about<00:06:28.810> those

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
know what so don't worry about those

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.580 
know what so don't worry about those
because<00:06:29.259> I'm<00:06:29.349> gonna<00:06:29.500> get<00:06:29.650> them<00:06:29.800> done<00:06:29.949> and<00:06:30.370> uh
