enough it's an hdmi cable I really don't

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.529 
enough it's an hdmi cable I really don't
need<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.369> only<00:00:17.550> reason<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.910> got<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.359> is

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
need this the only reason I got it is

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.529 
need this the only reason I got it is
because<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.380> was<00:00:19.590> apple<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.210> looked<00:00:21.449> like

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
because it was apple and it looked like

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.830 
because it was apple and it looked like
the<00:00:21.810> 30-pin<00:00:22.260> dock<00:00:22.320> connector<00:00:23.630> other<00:00:24.630> than

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the 30-pin dock connector other than

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.870 
the 30-pin dock connector other than
that<00:00:24.900> though<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.350> unnecessary<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.519> mainly

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
that though is unnecessary and I mainly

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880 
that though is unnecessary and I mainly
just<00:00:27.029> bought<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.599> unboxing<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.560> review

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
just bought it for unboxing and review

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.179 
just bought it for unboxing and review
so<00:00:29.580> let's<00:00:29.730> get<00:00:29.910> straight<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.480> um<00:00:31.199> it's

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
so let's get straight into this um it's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.690 
so let's get straight into this um it's
just<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.780> clear<00:00:33.800> bad<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> white<00:00:35.460> backing

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
just a clear bad with the white backing

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.780 
just a clear bad with the white backing
and<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.320> got<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> specs<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.460> here

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and it just got the specs on it up here

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.450 
and it just got the specs on it up here
it's<00:00:39.450> not<00:00:39.660> gold<00:00:39.989> plated<00:00:40.469> though<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.739> silver

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it's not gold plated though it's silver

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.930 
it's not gold plated though it's silver
plated<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.379> highest<00:00:43.940> quality

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
plated so it's not the highest quality

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.420 
plated so it's not the highest quality
I'm<00:00:45.660> guessing<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.800> don't<00:00:46.980> tell<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> how

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
I'm guessing and they don't tell you how

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.670 
I'm guessing and they don't tell you how
much<00:00:47.670> how<00:00:48.239> long<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.840> feet<00:00:49.110> only<00:00:49.590> in

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
much how long it is in feet only in

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.170 
much how long it is in feet only in
meters<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:51.210> anyways<00:00:51.480> let's<00:00:51.800> rip<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.949> open

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.680 

and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:58.079> pull<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.850> no<00:00:59.850> cable<00:01:00.120> ties<00:01:00.449> or

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and then pull it out no cable ties or

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.729 
and then pull it out no cable ties or
anything<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.670> cable<00:01:02.670> itself<00:01:03.619> to<00:01:04.619> be

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
anything just the cable itself to be

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.280 
anything just the cable itself to be
honest<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.670> off<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.090> bat<00:01:06.290> this
