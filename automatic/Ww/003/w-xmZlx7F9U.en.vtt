00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 today we are going to make a full HD camera 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.090
 using harry cough and guinea pig in 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.929
 cash because finance thing that nobody 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.490
 but think 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.170
 before we start doing 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.839
 any equipment we will have to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.510
 talk about a thing that people 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.939
 can not make paper that is the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.250
 camera has no money to invest because 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.720
 the cell phone camera can invest a 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.000
 little money in this 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.310
 so come on the first tip is lame 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.460
 against those field or hand 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.530
 by the iso wines cameras that fit 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.719
 that thing that hits the zone will use 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.550
 to inform the niece's wedding 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.300
 so one tip is to invest in 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.489
 dslr equipment independent of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.309
 choice you have two things that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.000
 strongly indicate that you 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.860
 before choosing the camera first 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.520
 search for a camera that has the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.340
 number of possible manual controls and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.160
 The second tip is that it has a 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.780
 external microphone because the audio is 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.360
 as important as the image as 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.210
 When you 're working on 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.080
 some production paulo brand buy me 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.409
 that what is there is no meat with a 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.320
 I'll have you with and now what I prefer 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.250
 here luxury by which you decide and 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.549
 small 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.509
 here does not have a robot series that is the series 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.040
 d of the entrance cameras of the brand them 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.439
 are cheap 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.360
 I speak of this law or why you 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.070
 ended up falling in this channel that the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.549
 production with little money 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.310
 all cameras and seriously boldak in them 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.799
 are full hd and have microphone input 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.290
 as I already said the manual controls 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.409
 so you're going to be very well served 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.229
 I will recommend that three cameras in 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.980
 three different price ranges up to 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.180
 five and is the youngest 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.120
 they are very good between 2 thousand and 2 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.380
 thousand and two hundred reais if you 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.820
 straight searching has up to 4 m which is 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.550
 this one I'm using now 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.850
 record this video now you can do 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.990
 miracle with this zia camera and up to 13 is 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.810
 More line in the series but I know people 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.450
 that has this camera and the final quality 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.400
 image is very close to the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.930
 that up to 4 ifaz and up to 5 ifa to up to 4 she 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.940
 it's between one thousand and six hundred thousand 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:40.730
 six hundred and up to 13 you can find by 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.430
 1,500 and 1,600 if well panned in the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.870
 free market and enzo domes with 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.110
 any of the three cameras that I 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.970
 I spoke here you can do 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.490
 very good looking good videos 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.830
 professional leaving little money here 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.350
 I will end up not detailing the 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.250
 technical specifications day 'd' each 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.380
 from them 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.200
 Why do you guys know google then? 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.850
 I think it does not fit here anymore if there is 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.070
 any doubt that you have 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.080
 Can you afford a comment that I 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.810
