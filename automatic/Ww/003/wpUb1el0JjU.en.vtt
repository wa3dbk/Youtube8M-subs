now<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.350> mounting<00:01:37.799> features<00:01:38.130> there<00:01:38.400> are

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
now as for mounting features there are

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.200 
now as for mounting features there are

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
areevo up there mounted by just changing

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.620 
areevo up there mounted by just changing
the<00:01:55.460> spots<00:01:55.760> where<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.030> bungee<00:01:56.360> cords

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the spots where the bungee cords

connected

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.320 

now<00:02:10.679> compared<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.310> old<00:02:11.340> trailer<00:02:11.760> which<00:02:12.180> was

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
now compared to my old trailer which was

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.270 
now compared to my old trailer which was
a<00:02:12.360> tilt<00:02:12.690> deck<00:02:14.540> my<00:02:15.540> new<00:02:15.720> trailer<00:02:15.989> it's<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:17.129> as

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
a tilt deck my new trailer it's just as

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.720 
a tilt deck my new trailer it's just as
simple<00:02:18.440> because<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.739> fact<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.099> ramps<00:02:20.580> are

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
simple because the fact that ramps are

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.860 
simple because the fact that ramps are
included<00:02:25.340> now<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.330> flip<00:02:27.660> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
included now if you have to flip it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.190 
included now if you have to flip it
upside<00:02:28.830> down<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.970> would<00:02:30.090> notice<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
upside down you would notice that on the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.530 
upside down you would notice that on the
end<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.620> screen<00:02:31.890> all<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.459> way<00:02:32.849> around

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
end of the screen all the way around

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.780 
end of the screen all the way around
there's<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.500> tack<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:37.250> there's<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.310> rare<00:02:38.489> chance

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
there's a tack so there's a rare chance

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.819 
there's a tack so there's a rare chance
that<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.420> bottom<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.079> will<00:02:40.260> collapse<00:02:40.560> on

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
that the bottom of it will collapse on

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.759 
that the bottom of it will collapse on
you<00:02:41.040> unless<00:02:41.579> you<00:02:41.819> start<00:02:42.030> standing<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.959> by

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
you unless you start standing on it by

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.670 
you unless you start standing on it by
which<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.220> did<00:02:44.549> stand<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.930> corners<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.530> it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
which I did stand on the corners of it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.089 
which I did stand on the corners of it
and<00:02:47.579> by<00:02:47.970> corners<00:02:48.359> I<00:02:48.599> mean<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.049> had<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:49.709> foot
