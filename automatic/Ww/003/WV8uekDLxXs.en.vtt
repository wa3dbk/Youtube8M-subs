00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.609
 let's start the audio course praise 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.020
 pathology 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.899
 general 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.899
 for health workers 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.889
 held by 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.889
 dott. la forlani riccardo 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.020
 surgeon 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.699
 online expert 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.699
 functional neuro immunology 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.810
 medicines 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.899
 complementary 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.810
 this course 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.809
 will consist of a first part 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.050
 which will deal with 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.230
 basic general pathology elements 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.550
 defined in keep it g wines 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.630
 and a more systematic second part 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.870
 therefore go but to analyze 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.830
 the basic elements 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.960
 must be of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.420
 diseases 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.510
 + oh - common 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.670
 that we could find in our clinic 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.330
 so let's start 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.560
 daie elements of general pathology of bari 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.229
 the first element from which we must begin is certainly the definition 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:13.740
 of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.840
 Latin image 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.820
 there 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.230
 the first time disease dissertation 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.520
 del potro monza define it as an alteration of the 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.100
 physiological situation of a human being 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.600
 and therefore in other words as a 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.770
 alteration from the state of health 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.540
 reality 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.990
 land 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.340
 disease 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.260
 we must consider it 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.869
 any kind of 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.480
 by factor 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.219
 which determines 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.799
 internal then external that is an alteration of physiology 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.880
 other words 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.600
 we will say that help 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.490
 may exist 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.960
 and he factors 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.470
 to specific 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.159
 internal and therefore endogenous 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.419
 or exogenous 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.109
 or there may be factors 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:20.419
 for specific fluids causing specific physiological alterations 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.269
 endogenous 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.129
 exogenous 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.000
 having said that then 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.849
 as a concept or illness as an alteration of the 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.849
 physiological state caused by 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.719
 internal elements these weapons and by specific factors 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.019
 and specific 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.199
 the fundamental element is that 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.199
 all the causes that alter 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.409
 such physiology 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.469
 must be studied 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.939
 and must be studied precisely from natural medicine 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.400
 better defined 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.090
 causal biological medicine works 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.029
 there 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.079
 medicine 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.079
 biological of the absolutely be 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.059
 personalized 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.029
 why 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:21.029
 all human beings 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.599
 of the elements of distinction 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.459
 although obviously very similar 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.739
 and to distinction it is linked above all to 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.949
 modality 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.869
 harrehhhhhhhhh action 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.529
 towards the perfect 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.359
 external then internal 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.719
 which now changes our physiology 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.869
 then we define finally 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:50.999
 the illness 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.279
 such as 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.279
 the abnormal interaction 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.909
 between causes 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.729
 effects 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.019
 and especially 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.820
 you will get activities 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.820
 individual 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.939
 distracting activities 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:14.269
 hopla harrehhhhhhhhh activity that is the inability to respond 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.779
 part of one in vivo 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.340
 to a specific non-specific effect 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.419
 endogenous this ocean that is 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.140
 represents 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.909
 the true genesis 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.909
 of the disease 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.979
 d is to say, however 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.680
 then 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.930
 becomes fundamental in the study of diseases understood in these terms 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.509
 let's find out the causes 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.340
 the initial causes 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.349
 Well 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.460
 we must distinguish 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.710
 basically 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.349
 two types of causes 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.909
 d diseases access exception 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.939
 etiology means cause 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.550
 of the disease 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.369
 we will have diseases the causes inter in shoals and its being 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.319
 intrinsic to nism 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.270
 and we will have causes of illness instead 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.800
 extrinsic 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.960
 which are caused by outside elements 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.509
 headcount 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:39.569
 and now we analyze the causes and the intrinsic disease of the organism 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.039
 in the case of illness 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.039
 may be present 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:47.780
 before 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.659
 or after birth 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.680
 these are the causes that are inherent within the 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.949
 the body 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.030
 to consider that 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.830
 the 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.099
 that appear before birth 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.439
 such as 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.439
 engineering pathologies 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.990
 while 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.080
 the intrinsic causes that 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.479
 appear after birth 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.059
 we could define them as tower dispositions and athens so that 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:27.759
 we therefore send and analyze what are the dry interim causes 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:33.529
 web even before birth therefore on a genetic basis ie those 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:36.339
 diseases 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.979
 characterized by one 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:40.809
 alteration of the 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:43.809
 patrimonio gnt 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.909
 at the moment 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.939
 the mutation 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:51.180
 concept extremely important in the 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.990
 alteration of genetics 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.990
 I said by mutation 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.710
 yes means the 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.339
 abrupt modification 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.259
 stable 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:05.699
 heritability 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:06.639
 and a 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.430
 character 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.820
 we can have a mutation 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.270
 at the level of a gene 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.270
 and therefore we call it gene mutation 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:18.149
 or 

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:19.559
 can I have 

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:23.080
 a mutation of an entire chromosome 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.120
 that therefore a commutation 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.779
 i run muson micca 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:33.689
 or inside we can have a mutation on + chromosomes 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:36.719
 and therefore we will define this one 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:38.869
 genomic mutation
