00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
have two applications for it I built

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.389 
have two applications for it I built
kind<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.170> two<00:00:43.320> scenarios<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> my<00:00:44.219> old

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
kind of two scenarios this is my old

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.709 
kind of two scenarios this is my old
let's<00:00:44.850> play<00:00:45.090> house<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> did<00:00:46.320> some

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
creative renovations on it here's my
second<00:00:52.079> instance<00:00:52.500> where<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.800> trap<00:00:53.039> could

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
second instance where this trap could

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680 
second instance where this trap could
come<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.520> handy<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:53.879> basically<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.360> kind

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
what you're gonna want to have is a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.649 
what you're gonna want to have is a
narrow<00:01:04.799> two-way<00:01:05.369> walkway<00:01:05.880> it'll<00:01:06.330> work<00:01:06.450> best

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
narrow two-way walkway it'll work best

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.690 
narrow two-way walkway it'll work best
on<00:01:06.960> two-way<00:01:07.409> walkways<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:07.979> one-way<00:01:08.310> walkway

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
on two-way walkways or one-way walkway

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.570 
on two-way walkways or one-way walkway
three<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> little<00:01:09.780> complex<00:01:10.400> that's<00:01:11.400> why<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
three is a little complex that's why I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.830 
three is a little complex that's why I
didn't<00:01:11.790> choose<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.810> don't

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
didn't choose to do that because I don't

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.240 
didn't choose to do that because I don't
want<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> make<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> more<00:01:13.500> complex<00:01:13.860> than<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.130> has

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
want to make it more complex than it has

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
want to make it more complex than it has
to<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.939> really<00:01:15.090> easy<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.570> make<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.020> with

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to be it's really easy to make and with

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.840 
to be it's really easy to make and with
the<00:01:16.259> 3-way<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.950> could<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.490> three-way

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the 3-way one it could that three-way

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.330 
the 3-way one it could that three-way
with<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> 3-way<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.290> could<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:20.189> more

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
with the 3-way one it could get more

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.660 
with the 3-way one it could get more
complex<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.060> has<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:23.460> I'm

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
complex and it has to be so I think I'm

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.249 
complex and it has to be so I think I'm
actually<00:01:23.790> gonna<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> outside<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
actually gonna do the outside one to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.600 
actually gonna do the outside one to
show<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.310> more

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
open so I'm gonna wire back in here

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.230 
open so I'm gonna wire back in here
but<00:01:30.250> yeah<00:01:30.430> you're<00:01:30.610> gonna<00:01:30.700> want<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.000> narrow

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
but yeah you're gonna want a narrow

but yeah you're gonna want a narrow
two-way<00:01:31.630> walkway<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.140> hallway<00:01:32.530> will<00:01:32.890> work

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
two-way walkway a hallway will work

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.969 
two-way walkway a hallway will work
pretty<00:01:33.280> well<00:01:33.399> a<00:01:33.820> road<00:01:34.210> kind<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.689> like<00:01:34.810> this<00:01:35.049> is

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.760 
this works all right so here's the open
look<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.369> have<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.520> hey<00:01:55.299> buddy<00:01:55.539> all<00:01:56.140> right<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:56.500> as

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
look I have a hey buddy all right so as

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.219 
look I have a hey buddy all right so as
you<00:01:56.799> can<00:01:56.979> see<00:01:57.039> villagers<00:01:57.549> can<00:01:58.329> activate<00:01:59.110> it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
you can see villagers can activate it

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.630 
you can see villagers can activate it
themselves<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.679> could<00:01:59.890> be<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.069> problem<00:02:00.310> if

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
themselves that could be a problem if

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.699 
themselves that could be a problem if
you<00:02:00.729> put<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:00.939> on<00:02:00.969> a<00:02:01.030> road<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.409> might<00:02:02.590> work

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
you put it on a road so it might work

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.559 
you put it on a road so it might work
best<00:02:03.009> if<00:02:03.399> it's<00:02:03.700> like<00:02:03.849> in<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.090> downstairs

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
best if it's like in a downstairs

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.020 
best if it's like in a downstairs
hallway<00:02:05.110> on<00:02:05.860> like<00:02:06.099> the<00:02:06.250> first<00:02:06.490> level<00:02:06.819> of<00:02:06.909> a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
hallway on like the first level of a

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.430 
hallway on like the first level of a
house<00:02:07.179> something<00:02:07.869> like<00:02:07.990> that

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
house something like that

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.319 
house something like that
but<00:02:08.829> you<00:02:08.950> know<00:02:09.069> creative<00:02:09.549> control<00:02:09.819> do<00:02:10.179> what

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
but you know creative control do what

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.110 
but you know creative control do what
you<00:02:10.450> want<00:02:10.660> with<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:12.069> pretty<00:02:12.459> easy<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.940> set

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
you want with it it's pretty easy to set

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.600 
you want with it it's pretty easy to set
up<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:13.450> very<00:02:13.630> compact<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:15.190> most<00:02:15.400> you'll

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
up it's very compact the most you'll

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.520 
up it's very compact the most you'll
need<00:02:15.849> on<00:02:16.000> either<00:02:16.150> side<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.630> probably<00:02:16.930> like<00:02:17.140> for

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
need on either side is probably like for

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.460 
need on either side is probably like for
the<00:02:17.590> word<00:02:17.769> wiring<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.970> know<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.569> maybe<00:02:20.110> four

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
the word wiring you know like maybe four

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.080 
the word wiring you know like maybe four
blocks<00:02:20.709> down<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.489> can<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.790> some<00:02:21.970> room

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
blocks down so you can have some room

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.390 
blocks down so you can have some room
for<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.329> redstone<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.130> three

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
for the redstone and just like three

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.789 
for the redstone and just like three
blocks<00:02:24.549> over<00:02:25.000> heard<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.840> part<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.560> yeah<00:02:26.680> it's

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
blocks over heard this part so yeah it's

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.920 
blocks over heard this part so yeah it's
pretty<00:02:27.060> compact<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.390> can<00:02:28.510> put<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
pretty compact and you can put it in a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.050 
pretty compact and you can put it in a
basement<00:02:29.110> or<00:02:29.500> like<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> mine<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.250> I'll<00:02:30.880> prank

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
basement or like a mine and I'll prank

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.069 
basement or like a mine and I'll prank
your<00:02:31.180> friends<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.480> as<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.720> see<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:31.959> this

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
your friends and as you can see on this

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.080 
your friends and as you can see on this
one<00:02:32.319> I<00:02:32.470> did<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:32.860> double-sided<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.700> if<00:02:33.819> anyone

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
one I did it double-sided so if anyone

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.789 
one I did it double-sided so if anyone
was<00:02:34.209> coming<00:02:34.450> from<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.750> side<00:02:34.959> they<00:02:35.680> would

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
was coming from this side they would

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.789 
was coming from this side they would
also<00:02:36.069> activate<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.639> so<00:02:37.470> yeah<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.810> uh<00:02:40.989> it's

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
also activate it so yeah it's uh it's

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.410 
also activate it so yeah it's uh it's
versatile<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.579> it'll<00:02:42.880> work<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.239> lot<00:02:43.389> of

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
versatile and it'll work in a lot of

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.180 
versatile and it'll work in a lot of
fashions<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.170> I'm<00:02:44.410> very<00:02:44.560> proud<00:02:44.859> of<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
fashions and I'm very proud of the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.390 
fashions and I'm very proud of the
outcome<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.150> here's<00:02:46.720> how<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.900> set<00:02:47.079> it<00:02:47.139> up<00:02:47.400> so

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
outcome so here's how to set it up so

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.150 
outcome so here's how to set it up so
I'm<00:02:48.910> gonna<00:02:49.060> make<00:02:49.420> one<00:02:49.630> along<00:02:50.470> with<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:50.950> you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
I'm gonna make one along with it so you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.680 
I'm gonna make one along with it so you
can<00:02:51.340> understand<00:02:51.700> how<00:02:51.819> it<00:02:51.880> works<00:02:52.030> now<00:02:52.450> won't

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
can understand how it works now won't

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.390 
can understand how it works now won't
work<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.109> this<00:02:53.319> block<00:02:53.739> right<00:02:53.950> here<00:02:54.010> because

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
work on this block right here because

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.670 
work on this block right here because
it's<00:02:54.549> right<00:02:54.730> next<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.209> wire<00:02:55.389> but<00:02:56.350> I'll

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
it's right next to the wire but I'll

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.699 
it's right next to the wire but I'll
just<00:02:56.829> show<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.040> how<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.430> gets<00:02:57.700> set<00:02:57.970> up<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.930> you

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
just show you how it gets set up so you

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.940 
just show you how it gets set up so you
take<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.160> redstone<00:03:00.700> torch<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.680> then<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.769> take

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
take a redstone torch and then you take

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.650 
take a redstone torch and then you take
a<00:03:03.130> piston<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:03.609> you<00:03:03.819> put<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.090> piston<00:03:04.269> right

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
a piston and you put the piston right

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.080 
a piston and you put the piston right
above<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.310> redstone<00:03:06.310> torch<00:03:06.519> so<00:03:06.730> basically

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
above that redstone torch so basically

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.640 
above that redstone torch so basically
what<00:03:07.299> we've<00:03:07.420> done<00:03:07.450> right<00:03:07.750> now<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:08.079> that<00:03:08.560> we've

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
what we've done right now is that we've

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.170 
what we've done right now is that we've
made<00:03:08.859> it<00:03:08.980> default<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.700> piston<00:03:10.090> is

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
made it default that the piston is

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.539 
made it default that the piston is
activated<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.049> what<00:03:11.920> we're<00:03:12.040> gonna<00:03:12.160> do<00:03:12.340> now<00:03:12.519> is

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
activated and what we're gonna do now is

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.129 
activated and what we're gonna do now is
we're<00:03:12.849> gonna<00:03:12.940> invert<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.540> wiring<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.049> the

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
we're gonna invert the wiring so the

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.890 
we're gonna invert the wiring so the
piston<00:03:14.590> will<00:03:15.069> deep<00:03:15.489> what<00:03:16.209> does<00:03:16.329> it<00:03:16.450> dietrich

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
piston will deep what does it dietrich

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.190 
piston will deep what does it dietrich
tract<00:03:17.230> retract<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.400> block<00:03:18.700> back<00:03:19.060> when<00:03:19.810> the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
tract retract the block back when the

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.960 
tract retract the block back when the
tripwire<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.680> activated<00:03:21.069> cuz<00:03:21.190> naturally<00:03:21.639> if

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
tripwire is activated cuz naturally if

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.550 
tripwire is activated cuz naturally if
you<00:03:22.209> didn't<00:03:22.480> have<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.900> torch<00:03:23.170> right<00:03:23.319> here

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
you didn't have this torch right here

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.530 
you didn't have this torch right here
when<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.549> stepped<00:03:24.819> on<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:24.970> tripwire<00:03:25.329> these

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
when you stepped on the tripwire these

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.210 
when you stepped on the tripwire these
would<00:03:25.720> go<00:03:25.840> out<00:03:26.019> instead<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:26.889> you<00:03:26.950> just

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
would go out instead of in so you just

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.430 
would go out instead of in so you just
see<00:03:27.370> lava<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.760> obviously

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
see lava and obviously

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.200 
see lava and obviously
for<00:03:28.710> that<00:03:28.800> cuz<00:03:28.950> they're<00:03:29.040> not<00:03:29.070> all<00:03:29.250> retarded<00:03:29.550> so

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
for that cuz they're not all retarded so

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.210 
for that cuz they're not all retarded so
what<00:03:31.050> you're<00:03:31.140> gonna<00:03:31.260> do<00:03:31.410> now<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.590> take<00:03:31.860> a

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
what you're gonna do now is take a

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.730 
what you're gonna do now is take a
repeater<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.060> put<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:33.870> block<00:03:34.140> below<00:03:34.350> it

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
repeater and put it one block below it

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.920 
repeater and put it one block below it
won't<00:03:34.920> work<00:03:35.160> if<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.700> do<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.090> like<00:03:36.240> this<00:03:36.300> and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
won't work if you do it like this and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.090 
won't work if you do it like this and
put<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.230> repeater<00:03:37.500> there<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.830> have<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.070> put

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
put the repeater there you have to put

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.100 
put the repeater there you have to put
it<00:03:38.280> one<00:03:38.400> block<00:03:38.670> below<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.270> put<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.870> two

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
it one block below and put it on two

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.800 
it one block below and put it on two
ticks<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:41.460> timed<00:03:41.760> right<00:03:42.210> or<00:03:42.690> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
ticks so that it's timed right or the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.010 
ticks so that it's timed right or the
person<00:03:43.110> walks<00:03:43.290> over<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.570> there<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.600> go

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
person walks over it and there you go

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.840 
person walks over it and there you go
it's<00:03:46.440> pretty<00:03:46.800> easy<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.220> repeat<00:03:47.820> that

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
it's pretty easy you just repeat that

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.700 
it's pretty easy you just repeat that
for<00:03:48.180> as<00:03:48.270> many<00:03:48.420> blocks<00:03:48.750> as<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.020> want<00:03:49.230> you'll

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
for as many blocks as you want you'll

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.440 
for as many blocks as you want you'll
probably<00:03:49.890> want<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.250> get<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.520> like<00:03:50.730> four<00:03:51.330> or

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
probably want to get it like four or

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.850 
probably want to get it like four or
five<00:03:51.480> blocks<00:03:51.960> so<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.320> they<00:03:52.410> can't<00:03:52.620> spread

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
five blocks so that they can't spread

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.590 
five blocks so that they can't spread
across<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.430> because<00:03:53.880> as<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.270> right<00:03:54.420> now

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
across it because as it is right now

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.260 
across it because as it is right now
you<00:03:54.840> can't<00:03:55.140> sprint<00:03:55.470> across<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:55.950> one<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:57.060> try

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
you can't sprint across this one you try

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.720 
you can't sprint across this one you try
to<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.860> think<00:03:58.860> even<00:03:58.980> if<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.190> try<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.460> jump

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
to and I think even if you try to jump

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.340 
to and I think even if you try to jump
you<00:04:00.120> won't<00:04:00.300> get<00:04:00.420> across<00:04:00.660> unless<00:04:00.990> you<00:04:01.140> don't

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
you won't get across unless you don't

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.200 
you won't get across unless you don't
activate<00:04:01.710> it<00:04:01.830> in<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.040> first<00:04:02.220> place<00:04:02.460> so<00:04:02.940> for

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
activate it in the first place so for

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.510 
activate it in the first place so for
the<00:04:03.330> most<00:04:03.450> part<00:04:04.040> you're<00:04:05.040> gonna<00:04:05.100> be<00:04:05.280> killing

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
the most part you're gonna be killing

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.040 
the most part you're gonna be killing
some<00:04:05.610> people<00:04:05.850> with<00:04:05.970> this<00:04:06.090> if<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:06.450> can<00:04:06.630> hide<00:04:06.870> it

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
some people with this if you can hide it

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.420 
some people with this if you can hide it
properly<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.740> the<00:04:08.130> good<00:04:08.250> thing<00:04:08.400> about

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
properly and the good thing about

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.040 
properly and the good thing about
tripwires<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.420> can<00:04:09.570> put<00:04:09.750> these<00:04:09.900> as

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
tripwires is that you can put these as

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.810 
tripwires is that you can put these as
far<00:04:10.260> back<00:04:10.440> as<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.680> want<00:04:11.040> they<00:04:11.610> could<00:04:11.730> be

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
far back as you want they could be

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.060 
far back as you want they could be
further<00:04:12.000> back<00:04:12.270> than<00:04:12.930> this<00:04:13.200> so<00:04:13.680> no<00:04:13.860> one<00:04:13.950> will

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
further back than this so no one will

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.340 
further back than this so no one will
see<00:04:14.250> them<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.550> that's<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.870> good<00:04:16.170> thing<00:04:16.290> about

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
see them and that's a good thing about

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.600 
see them and that's a good thing about
tripwires<00:04:16.770> is<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.130> can<00:04:17.280> really<00:04:17.430> put

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
tripwires is that you can really put

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.220 
tripwires is that you can really put
them<00:04:17.730> anywhere<00:04:18.000> as<00:04:18.330> long<00:04:18.630> as<00:04:18.810> they're<00:04:19.049> in<00:04:19.140> that

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
them anywhere as long as they're in that

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.080 
them anywhere as long as they're in that
straight<00:04:19.560> line<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.430> have<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.730> strings

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
straight line and you have the strings

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.070 
straight line and you have the strings
in<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.270> middle<00:04:21.510> if<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.660> don't<00:04:21.840> know<00:04:21.930> how<00:04:22.020> to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
in the middle if you don't know how to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.200 
in the middle if you don't know how to
set<00:04:22.290> up<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.440> tripwire<00:04:22.680> I'll<00:04:23.370> I'll<00:04:23.820> do<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:23.970> quick

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
set up a tripwire I'll I'll do a quick

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.150 
set up a tripwire I'll I'll do a quick
tutorial<00:04:24.330> right<00:04:24.810> now<00:04:24.960> for<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:26.010> basically

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
tutorial right now for you so basically

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.610 
tutorial right now for you so basically
you<00:04:26.910> take<00:04:27.060> your<00:04:27.270> little<00:04:27.390> tripwire<00:04:27.900> hooks<00:04:28.230> and

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
you take your little tripwire hooks and

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.730 
you take your little tripwire hooks and
you<00:04:29.490> set<00:04:29.730> them<00:04:29.880> up<00:04:30.140> just<00:04:31.140> across<00:04:31.260> from<00:04:31.680> each

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
you set them up just across from each

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.710 
you set them up just across from each
other<00:04:31.890> and<00:04:32.160> then<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.820> take<00:04:33.030> string<00:04:33.510> now<00:04:33.660> I

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
other and then you take string now I

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.120 
other and then you take string now I
know<00:04:33.810> string<00:04:34.200> you're<00:04:34.350> gonna<00:04:34.440> be<00:04:34.590> like<00:04:34.740> extrude

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
know string you're gonna be like extrude

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.690 
know string you're gonna be like extrude
you<00:04:35.520> can't<00:04:35.730> really<00:04:35.880> blue<00:04:36.090> string<00:04:36.420> well<00:04:37.020> in<00:04:37.140> 1.3

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
you can't really blue string well in 1.3

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.820 
you can't really blue string well in 1.3
you<00:04:38.700> can<00:04:38.850> play<00:04:39.000> string<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:40.290> just<00:04:40.500> connect

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
you can play string you just connect

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.040 
you can play string you just connect
them<00:04:40.950> with<00:04:41.130> string<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:42.120> when<00:04:42.270> they<00:04:42.390> kick<00:04:42.840> down

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
them with string and when they kick down

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.960 
them with string and when they kick down
like<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.440> they're<00:04:44.130> all<00:04:44.310> ready<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.550> go<00:04:44.760> and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
just like you will with a pressure plate

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.830 
just like you will with a pressure plate
or<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.800> lever<00:04:47.130> or<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.490> button<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:48.419> just<00:04:48.570> put<00:04:48.690> some

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
or a lever or a button you just put some

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.630 
or a lever or a button you just put some
redstone<00:04:49.020> wiring<00:04:49.440> behind<00:04:49.890> it<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.250> wire<00:04:50.460> it

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
redstone wiring behind it you wire it

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.310 
redstone wiring behind it you wire it
down<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.120> it's<00:04:51.270> all<00:04:51.390> set<00:04:51.600> up<00:04:51.630> it's<00:04:51.990> pretty

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
down and it's all set up it's pretty

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.680 
down and it's all set up it's pretty
easy<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:53.550> gonna<00:04:53.640> get<00:04:53.820> your<00:04:53.970> friends<00:04:54.330> killed
