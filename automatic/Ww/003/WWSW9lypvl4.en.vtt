so<00:00:25.560> you're<00:00:25.740> kind<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.010> weighing<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.550> want

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so you're kind of weighing do you want

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.189 
so you're kind of weighing do you want
colston<00:00:27.150> or<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.420> want<00:00:27.570> Perryman<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.109> this

is<00:00:28.320> kind<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.369> an<00:00:29.460> upside<00:00:29.880> versus

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
is kind of a this is an upside versus

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.749 
is kind of a this is an upside versus
consistency<00:00:31.080> type<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> question<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.980> would<00:00:32.550> see

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
consistency type of question I would see

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
consistency type of question I would see
the<00:00:32.880> question<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.300> same<00:00:33.480> way<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:33.989> Anquan

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the question the same way as like Anquan

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
the question the same way as like Anquan
Boldin<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:35.250> Steve<00:00:35.489> Smith<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:35.940> somebody<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
Boldin or Steve Smith or somebody you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.880 
Boldin or Steve Smith or somebody you
know<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.200> ball<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> lot<00:00:37.620> but

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
know is going to get the ball a lot but

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
know is going to get the ball a lot but
probably<00:00:38.520> doesn't<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.910> top<00:00:39.149> end<00:00:39.360> up

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
probably doesn't have that top end up

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.850 
probably doesn't have that top end up
side<00:00:40.730> based<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.969> your<00:00:42.540> roster<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.379> probably

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
side based on your roster I probably

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.350 
side based on your roster I probably
hang<00:00:44.250> onto<00:00:44.430> Perryman<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.030> think<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.270> have

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
hang onto Perryman I think you have

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
hang onto Perryman I think you have
enough<00:00:45.450> consistency<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.379> Jones<00:00:46.710> with

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
enough consistency with Jones with

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.510 
enough consistency with Jones with
Landry<00:00:48.379> that<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.680> probably<00:00:49.950> take<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
Landry that you can probably take the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.069 
Landry that you can probably take the
chance<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.969> Perryman<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.960> he

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
chance on Perryman and just see what he

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.709 
chance on Perryman and just see what he
becomes<00:00:52.879> that's<00:00:53.879> kind<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> direction<00:00:54.390> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
becomes that's kind of the direction I

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.170 
becomes that's kind of the direction I
would<00:00:54.899> go<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> PPR<00:00:55.829> League<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
would go this is a PPR League I think I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.430 
would go this is a PPR League I think I
think<00:00:57.539> Coulson<00:00:57.899> I'll<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> bounce-back

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
think Coulson I'll have a bounce-back

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.590 
think Coulson I'll have a bounce-back
good<00:00:59.010> year<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.340> he's<00:00:59.430> not<00:00:59.609> his<00:01:00.000> ceiling<00:01:00.329> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
good year but he's not his ceiling is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.029 
good year but he's not his ceiling is
not<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:00.960> he's<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.379> over<00:01:01.680> twelve

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
not you know he's not going over twelve

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.740 
not you know he's not going over twelve
thirteen<00:01:02.699> hundred<00:01:02.910> yards<00:01:03.239> he's<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.480> scoring

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
thirteen hundred yards he's not scoring

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.359 
thirteen hundred yards he's not scoring
15<00:01:04.199> touchdowns<00:01:04.409> he's<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.949> doing<00:01:05.189> anything

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
15 touchdowns he's not doing anything

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.210 
15 touchdowns he's not doing anything
special<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:07.380> terms<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:07.920> wanting

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
special and in terms of just wanting

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.740 
special and in terms of just wanting
upside<00:01:08.640> maybe<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> need<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> guy<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> come<00:01:09.689> in

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
upside maybe you need a guy to come in

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.390 
upside maybe you need a guy to come in
and<00:01:09.990> give<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> big<00:01:10.530> week<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.890> think<00:01:11.070> Perryman

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and give you a big week I think Perryman

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.740 
and give you a big week I think Perryman
is<00:01:11.460> more<00:01:11.610> likely<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> give<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.390> big<00:01:12.570> week

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
is more likely to give you that big week

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
is more likely to give you that big week
than<00:01:12.930> colston<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.280> again<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.210> going

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
than colston is and so again it's going

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.550 
than colston is and so again it's going
to<00:01:15.420> come<00:01:15.479> down<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.810> roster<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:16.380> that's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to come down to your roster but that's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.630 
to come down to your roster but that's
kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> way<00:01:17.040> I'd<00:01:17.189> go<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.490> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
kind of the way I'd go with that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
kind of the way I'd go with that
question<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.780> you've<00:01:18.900> got<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> question<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
question so if you've got a question of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.630
