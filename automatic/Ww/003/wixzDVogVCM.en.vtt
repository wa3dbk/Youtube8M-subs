 please stop this cousin to the fullest and 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.949

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.640
 national team next Tuesday 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.769
 against belarus already warned miguel 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.360
 Herrera that is going to change the whole of 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.119
 the people out there paul aguilar will be the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.159
 only type that I could repeat myself in that 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.170
 part I do not quite understand why it 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.270
 modify after mexico had a 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.860
 nice performance against holland if 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.300
 well it is true there were moments and passages 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.429
 where it seems that it was 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.350
 collapsing the Mexican team rode 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.179
 a very great rebellion and they finished 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.880
 being dominators and just victors 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.619
 well now Belarus a rival of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.179
 much honor is being pollen gives 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.909
 possibility let's say to others 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.490
 footballers of power this one win a 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.620
 space is very clear that the blow of 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.320
 authority that gives the Mexican team 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.390
 on credit gives stability gives 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 security or at the end of accounts one 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.290
 have to recognize when things are 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.970
 they do well and in general terms the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.460
 Mexican team did it in a way 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.040
 right we'll see this selection let's say 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.930
 alternative i what particular i would like 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.600
 see again Jonathan two saints this 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.450
 guy that I think is a different man 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.010
 we will see jiménez on the court not 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.990
 it's also important that the guy has 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.520
 giovani two saints minutes that will have 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.590
 to realize that Carlos has arrived 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.869
 candle and that already complicated the matter of 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.820
 those of the subject of being the owner 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.190
 some other alternatives in the part 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.690
 from behind that is where Mexico has 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.880
 very great problems to be able 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.580
 rebuild what he had in the past 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.440
 world cup in short the Mexican team 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.970
 it makes us hope and took a 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.160
 very good performance against holland that 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.170
 will have to be reaffirmed even if it's a 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.180
 team sees that I insist that I do not 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.770
 I agree so many changes 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.360
 because my son would have to start 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.220
 find a titular alignment and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
 after you've found him then 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.420
 and look for so many alternatives in Miguel 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.800
 Herrera thinks differently and apart he is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.050
 the boss who does what he is given the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.840
 damn it wins and so we'll have to see it 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.390
 with also 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.739
 I insist many changes now that I see 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.940
 how this new selection works 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.940
 national greetings
