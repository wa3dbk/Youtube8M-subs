00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 everything changes everything goes very fast and 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.379
 technology works fast and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.540
 car universe arrives one hour in 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.620
 that it is necessary to abandon the practices of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 our grandparents 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.780
 what we can call the past in 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.270
 cold days you must have seen your 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.859
 Grandfather or father start the car in the morning 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.590
 home garage to warm up the engine 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.470
 before leaving he turned the key 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.960
 carts and did not pick up there 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.920
 pulling the lawyer's lever all 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.539
 resolved 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.910
 it henry that if the air mix 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.640
 reducing the intake of air. 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.649
 proportionately more 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.200
 gasoline in the combustion chamber and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.870
 explosion occurred more easily 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.180
 since the late 1980s this is more 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.489
 electronic injection takes care of the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.200
 mixture of time acts to ensure that the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.590
 burning is ideal 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.320
 in all situations the first in the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.710
 Brazil retire the choke and debut 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.149
 this technology was the gti goal in 1988 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.939
 and this story of taking the car to the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.130
 put to lubricate in cars 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.170
 it was necessary to unify the bushings 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.270
 the suspension that does not pass him 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.880
 It was usually done with the exchange 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.280
 oil today are witches' autolub 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.619
 cisers another custom that should be 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 retired downhill in neutral 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.659
 to save fuel with 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 carburetor was working but it was always 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.420
 wrong because it overloads the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.340
 brakes 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.979
 You can push if you need to. 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.750
 accelerate in the emergency to run in 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.970
 idle the engine needs to be 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.040
 powered by cars with injection 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.229
 electronics right take your foot off 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.750
 accelerator on the descent with the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.259
 the short entry system 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.479
 and then yes but nothing softens the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.000
 Zero car engine was common until the 5 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.070
 one thousand kilometers the driver steers well 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.939
 light on the accelerator until it reaches 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.799
 that mark 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.130
 nowadays it is enough to not exaggerate 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.649
 first 500 kilometers that tact 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.200
 sure sure someone in your family 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.210
 already drove the car to spray the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.959
 chassis or all this lower part 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.260
 here with castor oil after washing 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:14.150
 nor does this practice only accumulate 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.430
 more dirt and still dries the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.280
 of the suspension bushings and the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.930
 sealing motor without protecting the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.810
 electronic central station and still 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.300
 chemicals is another bored nobody 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.190
 advise this further to complete the 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.410
 battery is a maintenance that in the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.510
 may be unnecessary 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.700
 modern cars usually 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.769
 factory with sealed batteries 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.780
 but make sure you have caps in the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.090
 The upper part is of the old type 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.580
 need to check if the book is 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.280
 complete with distilled water without 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.830
 additives just be aware of the life of 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.489
 real about two years in me remember 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.630
 of the tire caster in x already fell by 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.519
 with the radials the right thing is to 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.040
 from front to back and back from 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.069
 on the same side so that 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.950
 wear evenly and last longer attention 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.340
 in the right calibration for nothing to clean 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.260
 The candles, such people are full of manias, right? 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.170
 the transformations are constant and you 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.510
 will be left behind in doubt consult the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.690
 manual and your car mechanic. 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.690
 confidence
