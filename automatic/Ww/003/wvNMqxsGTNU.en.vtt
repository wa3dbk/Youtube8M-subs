00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.350

 I'm using a plant but for the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.070
 joke is to remove this 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.280
 as you can see there we have the super box 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.850

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.090

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:44.390
 we are going to remove these plastics from here 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:49.330

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:53.830

 and good the truth of the design to this 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.970
 identical to iphone 5 I liked it a lot 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.370
 I tell them as I did not have the iPhone 5 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.710

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.290
