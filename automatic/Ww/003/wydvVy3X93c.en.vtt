think that people appreciate that not
only<00:02:39.150> his<00:02:39.900> exceptional<00:02:40.530> talent<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:40.980> he<00:02:41.069> goes

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
only his exceptional talent when he goes

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.720 
only his exceptional talent when he goes
out<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.459> plays<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:42.180> he's<00:02:42.600> become<00:02:42.989> this<00:02:43.730> you
