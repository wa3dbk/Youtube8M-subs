00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.209 

I'm<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> use<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> wireless<00:00:48.890> keyboard<00:00:49.890> and

mouse but I went ahead and purchased

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.590 
mouse but I went ahead and purchased
this<00:00:52.320> anyway<00:00:52.710> thinking<00:00:53.190> hey<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.210> complete

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
this anyway thinking hey it's a complete

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.979 
this anyway thinking hey it's a complete
set<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:56.010> think<00:00:56.850> it'd<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:56.969> cool<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.629> one

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
set and I think it'd be cool to have one

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.750 
set and I think it'd be cool to have one
that<00:00:58.170> has<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.379> Amiga<00:00:58.890> logo<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.670> all

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
that has the Amiga logo on it and all

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.509 
that has the Amiga logo on it and all
that<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:03.350> here<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> hopefully<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.400> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that so here is the hopefully this is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.620 
that so here is the hopefully this is
coming<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.939> okay<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.990> Amiga<00:01:07.320> keyboard

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
1000 it looks like it's a kind of

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.789 
1000 it looks like it's a kind of
another<00:02:52.489> user<00:02:53.060> guide<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:54.200> they<00:02:54.380> print<00:02:54.709> it

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
another user guide that they print it

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.650 
another user guide that they print it
off<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.280> they<00:02:55.340> put<00:02:55.580> inside<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:56.060> binder<00:02:56.480> for

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
off and they put inside this binder for

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.530 
off and they put inside this binder for
us<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.230> users<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.769> have<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.340> again<00:02:59.330> hopefully

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
us and users to have so again hopefully

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.210 
us and users to have so again hopefully
this<00:02:59.870> is<00:02:59.989> all<00:03:00.110> showing<00:03:00.470> up<00:03:00.620> but<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.980> don't<00:03:01.160> have

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
this is all showing up but I don't have

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.940 
this is all showing up but I don't have
a<00:03:01.310> tripod<00:03:01.549> but<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.360> think<00:03:02.989> this<00:03:03.080> will<00:03:03.260> get<00:03:03.799> the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
a tripod but I think this will get the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.090 
a tripod but I think this will get the
point<00:03:04.190> across<00:03:04.280> good<00:03:04.730> enough<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:08.769> did<00:03:09.769> get<00:03:09.920> my

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
point across good enough I did get my

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.780 
point across good enough I did get my
linux<00:03:10.670> debian<00:03:11.000> CD<00:03:11.690> i<00:03:11.959> did<00:03:12.769> order<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.280> along

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
linux debian CD i did order that along

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.640 
linux debian CD i did order that along
with<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.480> i<00:03:14.720> got<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:17.420> amiga<00:03:17.750> OS<00:03:18.109> 4.1

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
with it so i got that the amiga OS 4.1

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.410 
with it so i got that the amiga OS 4.1
box<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.489> looks<00:03:19.670> like<00:03:19.850> they<00:03:19.970> went<00:03:20.120> ahead<00:03:20.180> and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
box it looks like they went ahead and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.789 
box it looks like they went ahead and
said<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:20.840> your<00:03:21.019> head<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.260> time<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:23.680> then<00:03:24.680> I

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
said that your head of time and then I

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.250 
said that your head of time and then I
guess<00:03:24.950> later<00:03:25.160> on<00:03:25.430> we'll<00:03:25.640> be<00:03:25.670> getting<00:03:26.030> our

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
guess later on we'll be getting our

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.550 
guess later on we'll be getting our
amiga<00:03:28.930> OS<00:03:29.930> CD<00:03:30.170> with<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.560> 10-point<00:03:32.380> 10-1<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:33.440> as

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.759

sees but it's got the two buttons on the
sides<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.329> computer<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.480> all<00:04:21.720> wrapped<00:04:21.989> in

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
sides and the computer is all wrapped in

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.210 
sides and the computer is all wrapped in
plastic<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:23.250> protect<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:25.070> there<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.100> go

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
plastic to protect it so there you go

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.760 
plastic to protect it so there you go
there<00:04:26.840> I'm<00:04:27.840> going<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.080> go<00:04:28.139> ahead<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.380> turn<00:04:28.620> off
