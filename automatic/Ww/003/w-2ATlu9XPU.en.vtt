00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.120
 the arrival of the newest 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.130
 nintendo wii u the company solved 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.960
 also give good fans a new 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.740
 game that there is no sun symbol of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.690
 company 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.179
 but the true mascot of video games 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 in general new super mario bros gil is the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.320
 family game room receive the title 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.420
 again and even though some of the versions 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.820
 have been criticized for 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.070
 offer little new content and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 Mario is definitely more going to go. 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.039
 shoot the memory of those who 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.820
 accompany the character his glorious 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.050
 days during the 80's and 90's 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.059
 it is clear that proving the new version 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 we also need a little power or 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.870
 to spice things up and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 The latest discovery of the mushroom kingdom is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.629
 the transformation and a fofuchos that the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.610
 flying 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.550
 unlike the fox of the primary 3 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.649
 I'm from the racoon of the most correct to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.660
 no more need to run the accumulate power 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.120
 to catch the flight to jump and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 press the start button which does not 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.629
 lasted for a long time, leaving the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.149
 character a second stage of descent 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.070
 and you can stick to the wall and the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.989
 do it the player who has the score 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.970
 first jump opening possibility for 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.540
 many and many lives in one 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.540
 taken alone 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.719
 instead of stopping the map for eight worlds 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.820
 closed and traditional 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.610
 mario is a way risk of variations 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.710
 but without ever stopping the action it is clear that the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.179
 name of each arena appears on the screen but the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.950
 things are not so black on white 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.420
 as in other versions 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.369
 Another difference is the possibility of 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.289
 choose alternate paths 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.060
 see some stages to 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.799
 behind but of course if you want 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.740
 complete all that is possible to be 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.420
 done in a great game like this can 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.979
 be leaving those phases there 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.270
 in fact, like many other 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.580
 franchise with the metal is not 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.720
 necessarily difficult, except in the 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.189
 last moments 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.289
 now find all the secrets 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.000
 collect the three giant coins 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.250
 present at all stages is already 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.970
 feature of the thousand series and there is another 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.799
 story 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.869
 which I think leads some classics like 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.569
 already cited super mario 3d super mario 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.579
 world but I want to be in the stages of 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.590
 enemies or the presence of extremely 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.509
 charismatic yoshi who I think this 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.489
 Anybody, everybody, I really miss him. 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.009
 already available to the blocks of the type 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:11.650
 secret used gives a sense of 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.030
 I've seen this before but fortunately 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.920
 positive way 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.079
 but unlike the world itself 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.970
 was very creative in this part the bosses 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.989
 in general they are repetitive and well 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.760
 conservatives 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.250
 it is clear that not everything not only today and 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.840
 first time icon of the great japanese 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.970
 is in high definition 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.639
 super mario bros saw is the first sea ​​in 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.680
 hd as well as il is the first console 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.239
 which comes standard with hdmi cable 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.100
 What bothers you is that it was not even a 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.260
 little used I hope textures 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.579
 very rich or spend a certain amount of time 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.829
 summer in details 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.319
 the game hd goes on the required crossbar 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.239
 to be called that and little scenario 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.019
 explores the graphical capability of the new 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.519
 video game 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.680
 The same happens with the soundtrack that 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.840
 even containing unreleased songs and 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.209
 take advantage of some of the thousand 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.109
 maintains the same inspiration in almost all 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.670
 the creations 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.019
 when using the game pad it will 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.480
 Restricts when repeating what is on the screen 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.010
 and in a way this is great 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.930
 I did not even come close to being a use 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.910
 innovator of the river chief car 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.769
 but even without realizing all that 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.389
 pass near our console played 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.669
 practically all the time using 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.030
 just the control and never looking at you 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.349
 to see 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.329
 after a while neither 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.730
 We're more concerned with powering the appliance. 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.100
 love it in multiplayer mode 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.320
 game 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.270
 it asks in the character control none 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.490
 you can use the pen to create 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.620
 platforms to save or 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.210
 disrupt the player one of the new modes 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.310
 including created just above 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.970
 this and since we have touched on the subject who 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.250
 would say 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.230
 there are different game modes 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.440
 Imagine mixing super mario bros 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.750
 the system of conquest of xbox 360 is 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.460
 more or less the spirit of all base 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.590
 in challenges to test your player 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.530
 skills such as diverting 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.900
 fireball for as long as possible and one 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.700
 tiny space to move or else 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.770
 try to complete all stages in the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.480
 the shortest possible time is a fun 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.970
 sound for those who are looking for new experiences 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.430
 but it will probably please only those 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.500
 looking to test their squirrels Mario 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.970
 and what a good level not to repeat that mistake 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.800
 of other hardware releases 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.620
 recent and had not played the boat 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.810
 to enjoy the first day to foaming 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.700
 brazil the group a lot we confer 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.320
 all versions of the thousand series and with 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.780
 sure will surprise those connected 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.300
 who had never even seen this look before 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.130
 not so new so if you buy one 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.500
 wii, who are we to talk about? 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.210
 buy obligatory you already know this 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.830
 still the conservative profile of 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.930
 most stages and the lack of 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.180
 exploiting the promised potential of the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.340
 most powerful nintendo 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.200
 today makes us quite anxious to 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.150
 see if who knows who they are for 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.250
 preparing to visit new worlds 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.060
 kingdoms or galaxies even more 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.060
 interesting 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.070
 O
