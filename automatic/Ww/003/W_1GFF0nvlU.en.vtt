with reality and really severing his
bonds<00:02:00.979> with<00:02:01.790> his<00:02:01.940> team<00:02:02.180> because<00:02:02.360> he<00:02:02.510> say<00:02:02.720> he

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
bonds with his team because he say he

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.020 
bonds with his team because he say he
used<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.140> be<00:02:03.260> like<00:02:03.440> Naruto<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.610> he<00:02:04.700> went<00:02:04.940> the

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
other way so you would guess that those

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.620 
other way so you would guess that those
bonds<00:02:08.539> that<00:02:08.780> he<00:02:08.869> had<00:02:09.079> with<00:02:09.379> his<00:02:09.530> whole<00:02:09.769> team

protruding<00:03:39.730> out<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.360> moral<00:03:40.570> his<00:03:40.750> right

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020
