 we borrowed with foul language here 

00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:18.509

 adult male 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.410
 we helped a little satellite systems 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.420
 let's say for me 4 quarter shock 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.560
 pagan counter 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.280
 until there was an hour 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.770
 cover only owed 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770
 who do you think Belarusians should consider 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.080
 if they are not acquainted with the museum 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.430
 they desperately need these artifacts 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.310
 but did not work on his case, and then above 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.310
 about the payment of whether debts we did not agree 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.620
 in the process 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.010
 really so bad may 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.480
 the message of the zerg attack comes 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.680
 the main forces of the fleet to protect the central 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.690
 dominion planets 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.500
 leaving frontiers to the mercy of fate 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 it's real 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.870
 until we can stop the invasion 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.160
 shandong ship yankovsky 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.310
 volunteers 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 then we will not fight against 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.870
 wins usa held balsat and everything is there 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.850
 settle down a little 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.280
 when i figure it out 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.950
 Yuri seems to understand nothing 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.630
 settles all these stop until 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.080
 go from us all 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.530
 third five people 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.890
 no one is going higher yet just 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.580
 now is not in the best shape possible 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.320
 make money raise people 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.660
 armed with 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.080
 then we can still do something 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.860
 process assistant when closed 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.760
 laboratory 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.079
 study was assigned 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.079
 with 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.849
 under normal foreign 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.399
 manufacturers returned to Milan 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.429
 so-called 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.159
 second grade 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.779
 nothing special 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.889
 for a long time the troops are unknown for what 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.339
 produces armor bookings 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.989
 so more they all related to the comments 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.249
 there they will need money and considerable 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.309
 I hope to return not empty-handed 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.769
 listen i know what's up with the money lately 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.419
 time was tight 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.139
 on this artifact your barn will buy all our 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.169
 expenses somewhere I already heard that brother 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.989
 but now it's another matter 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.989
 and I heard that too 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.419
 the rise of what we already have is 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.809
 OK 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:12.539
 but when we have new ones 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:13.689
 development 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.870
 whether the machine roll the ball 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.380
 when through our workshops passes 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.900
 something new 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.969
 singer guarding 9 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:22.669
 so that if necessary 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.430
 set up production 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.320
 if you need to build something 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.680
 special 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 on the provision of drawings 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:38.960
 reported on the situation 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.610
 we got a distress call with the planets 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.520
 Sergey attacked agricultural 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.919
 the colony 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.590
 dollars and your enterprising 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.389
 says that mts offers to capture 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.300
 the artifact is on the street sacred 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300
 process planet 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.669
 Russia believes that the fourth quarter 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.669
 adjacent to the Irish 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.809
 by him in Slovakia 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:07.499
 sociologists 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:08.620
 in the course of what 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.389
 next year 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.629
 0 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.240
 usually 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.930
 as the newspaper notes 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.240
 this is done specially sochi 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.689
 February accent 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.689
 proper error message 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.469
 growth 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.650
 his entourage 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.009
 everything is like in the Russian church 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.499
 when Ukraine is alive 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.219
 I do not even know 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.180
 there are quite a few questions 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.680
 we will have to 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.819
 so Assad 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.050
 but attention 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.050
 in this case according to the journalist 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.650
 I believe, that 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.139
 of course we all decided to reconstruct 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.960
 Churchill 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.020
 on hand d 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.840
 to cut off that they run to our 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.379
 the sanctuary 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.189
 it's all complicated but we can't 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.999
 fight on two fronts of buryatia if you're lucky 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.909
 then we do not have all that we need is 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.710
 cordon off the sanctuary 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.919
 people live long enough 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.080
 to extract the artifact so we 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.749
 sit down here and problems that through 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:34.279
 protasises 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.989
 while their main forces are occupied by the mirror 

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:40.419
 sales are doomed to their destruction a matter of time 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.789
 so our task is to capture artifacts and 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.070
 quickly disappear
