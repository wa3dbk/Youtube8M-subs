 downloadable from ubisoft and one of the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.750
 most recommended proposals of this 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.550
 2014 that being inspired by the facts 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.160
 occurred in the First World War and 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.340
 with the centennial certification granted 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.660
 for the mission center net 1410 suite the

 memorial of the first war 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.500
 world this proposal presents us 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.710
 four characters and a dog that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.019
 they will cross their lives during the conflict 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.059
 love survival and drama are some 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.010
 of the feelings that we will live to 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.040
 long episodes with emile and his 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.950
 dog bolt freddy lime and anna los 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.770
 protagonists of this story from the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.189
 zerocoma instant empathize with your 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.680
 cause 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.020
 they all get us to the soul 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.000
 hurting us even when they die by 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.400
 our fault by not overcoming some 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.650
 obstacle the story that we are told 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.150
 well introduced by a previous locution 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.759
 which places us on the map of the moment 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.340
 key of this or that character is 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.399
 attractive and dramatic 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.869
 the characters do not speak babble and the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.990
 melodies that accompany the missions 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.840
 they make reference to the time emphasizing 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.340
 the experience varies hearts the greek 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.369
 war is a development proposal 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.069
 lateral in 2d with elements in 3-d each 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.719
 character has its own actions 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.329
 although broadly speaking, the 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.429
 same buttons 1 the action to attack and 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.840
 another to interact maintaining 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.149
 pressed the right trigger and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.909
 pressing the lower button we launch 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.220
 grenades we can give orders to the dog 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.649
 pressing any top button and the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.299
 relevant action button if we 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.579
 we remain silent is possible 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.799
 unlocking tracks is not a game 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:15.280
 difficult and in many situations the 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.079
 advance is based on trial and error the 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.120
 gameplay is as addictive as the 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.950
 rayman games although this time 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.340
 we are facing a development something more 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.829
 paused to be an adventure the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.230
 difficulty is in really knowing how 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.350
 solve this or that situation although the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.360
 key element is usually close 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.040
 to grant variety there are moments in 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.600
 those who for example anna heal the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.760
 civilians through short quick time 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.920
 events as well as we find also 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.390
 moments in vehicles where 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.030
 we drive towards the screen of 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.100
 TV for those who like the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.530
 exploration indicate that there are a hundred 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.050
 of hidden objects find what of 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.580
 rejugability necessary this title then 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.380
 although overcoming it is not a task 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.900
 complicated or long 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.910
 find the treasures if it is with the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.260
 motor obviate the same engine graphic 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.360
 used in recent deliveries of 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.610
 rayman has gotten a game to medium 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.100
 path between an interactive comic and a 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.020
 animated adventure much of 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.900
 designers of this proposal worked 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.820
 in rayman origins and rail man legends well 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.460
 that this information can already give all 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.260
 the guarantees the characters and the 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.420
 environment around which they move offer a 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.640
 very formidable artistic design 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.410
 striking good use of the various 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.050
 colors and tones according to 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.850
 location where we are all 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.040
 corners of the screen present some 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.770
 detail that deceives us introducing us 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.810
 in a world that at the moment absorbs us and 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.980
 it moves us to the facts that it does 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.870
 reference 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.239
 explosions landslides wounded 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.519
 shooting bunkers fire war not 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.640
 left nothing standing and in each visited area 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.019
 we see terror and destruction take 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.940
 approximately four or five 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.950
 hours in finishing them the game plus the 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.120
 time we dedicate to discover all 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.910
 your secrets 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.799
 the price is almost fifteen euros 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.319
 marian hearts the grid works is a 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.530
 proposal that you like and much for original 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.180
 by technical invoice and by gameplay a 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.040
 product that more than meets the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.519
 expectations at a pretty price 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.519
 tight
