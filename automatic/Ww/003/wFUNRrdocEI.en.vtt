00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
and then you got another slot right here

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.820 
and then you got another slot right here
we<00:03:16.799> could<00:03:16.950> put<00:03:17.130> another<00:03:17.239> fan<00:03:18.470> whoops<00:03:19.470> and

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
we could put another fan whoops and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.250 
we could put another fan whoops and
there's<00:03:20.610> all<00:03:20.730> sound<00:03:21.090> dampening<00:03:21.510> material<00:03:21.600> on

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
there's all sound dampening material on

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.190 
there's all sound dampening material on
all<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.530> these<00:03:22.650> pots<00:03:25.760> there<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:26.880> go<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:28.140> is

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
all of these pots there we go this is

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.920 
all of these pots there we go this is
the<00:03:28.380> side<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.239> see<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.540> sound<00:03:30.780> up

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
the side of it you can see the sound up

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.110 
the side of it you can see the sound up
in<00:03:31.080> material<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:32.280> all<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:32.910> pretty

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
in material on all of it and it's pretty

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.030 
in material on all of it and it's pretty
heavy<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.260> where<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.500> attach<00:03:34.799> your

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
heavy and this is where you attach your

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.259 
heavy and this is where you attach your
120<00:03:36.030> 140<00:03:36.690> millimeter<00:03:37.290> fan<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.880> let's<00:03:39.000> put<00:03:39.150> out

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
120 140 millimeter fan so let's put out

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.620 
120 140 millimeter fan so let's put out
to<00:03:39.360> one<00:03:39.510> side<00:03:39.540> with<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.739> screws<00:03:41.269> I'm<00:03:42.269> trying

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
to one side with the screws I'm trying

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.070 
to one side with the screws I'm trying
to<00:03:42.810> lose<00:03:43.019> them

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.750 

because<00:03:46.770> I<00:03:46.860> don't<00:03:47.280> know<00:03:47.370> all<00:03:47.610> the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
because I don't know all the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.580 
because I don't know all the
specifications<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:48.720> case<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:49.140> know<00:03:49.440> you

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
specifications on this case I know you

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.650 
specifications on this case I know you
can<00:03:49.860> remove<00:03:50.100> these<00:03:50.310> two<00:03:50.550> hard<00:03:50.910> drive<00:03:51.090> kids<00:03:51.390> you

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
can remove these two hard drive kids you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.730 
can remove these two hard drive kids you
could<00:03:51.810> spin<00:03:52.080> them<00:03:52.230> around

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
could spin them around

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.650 
could spin them around
so<00:03:53.220> if<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.430> only<00:03:53.550> use<00:03:53.640> three<00:03:54.120> hard<00:03:54.360> drives<00:03:54.480> you

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
so if you only use three hard drives you

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.030 
so if you only use three hard drives you
get<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.960> take<00:03:55.110> those<00:03:55.260> ones<00:03:55.530> out<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.740> have

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
get to take those ones out and have

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.820 
get to take those ones out and have
better<00:03:56.250> air<00:03:56.400> flow<00:03:56.430> coming<00:03:56.820> in<00:03:57.560> you<00:03:58.560> got<00:03:58.650> your

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
better air flow coming in you got your

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.440 
better air flow coming in you got your
fan<00:03:59.130> at<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.310> back<00:03:59.550> so<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.850> included<00:04:00.240> fans

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
fan at the back so the included fans

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.720 
fan at the back so the included fans
that<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.720> get<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.290> 140<00:04:02.070> millimeter<00:04:02.490> fan

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
that you get is the 140 millimeter fan

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.870 
that you get is the 140 millimeter fan
at<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:02.970> front<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.630> back<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.760> could

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
at the front and the back and you could

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.220 
at the front and the back and you could
have<00:04:05.970> fans<00:04:06.270> at<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.450> bottom<00:04:06.750> as<00:04:06.840> well<00:04:06.870> when

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
have fans at the bottom as well when

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.010 
have fans at the bottom as well when
you've<00:04:07.320> got<00:04:07.410> space<00:04:07.650> for<00:04:07.710> your<00:04:07.920> hard<00:04:08.130> drive<00:04:09.020> and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
you've got space for your hard drive and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.200 
you've got space for your hard drive and
then<00:04:10.080> these<00:04:10.590> all<00:04:10.770> are<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.010> cables<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:12.090> then

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
then these all are the cables and then

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.940 
then these all are the cables and then
right<00:04:12.510> down<00:04:12.660> here<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.320> get<00:04:13.440> your<00:04:13.590> little<00:04:13.710> box

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
we could focus in a bit so these are all

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.790 
we could focus in a bit so these are all
the<00:04:21.120> different<00:04:21.299> turn<00:04:22.080> it<00:04:22.200> rubber<00:04:22.380> up<00:04:22.530> there's

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
pages take a good look at them the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.690 
pages take a good look at them the
pretty<00:04:38.520> solid<00:04:39.470> made<00:04:40.470> out<00:04:40.620> metal<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:44.550> also

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.340 
pretty solid made out metal and you also
have<00:04:44.940> some<00:04:45.210> sound<00:04:45.510> dump<00:04:45.750> in<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.900> material<00:04:46.260> in

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
have some sound dump in the material in

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.630 
have some sound dump in the material in
this<00:04:46.470> little<00:04:46.740> part<00:04:46.920> as<00:04:47.070> well<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.490> should

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
this little part as well so it should

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.920 
this little part as well so it should
reduce<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.030> noise<00:04:48.270> then<00:04:48.510> it<00:04:48.600> is<00:04:48.690> pretty

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
reduce the noise then it is pretty

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.080 
reduce the noise then it is pretty
weighty<00:04:49.110> so<00:04:50.040> I'm<00:04:50.130> gonna<00:04:50.250> try<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.490> put<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:50.880> right

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
weighty so I'm gonna try to put it right

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.530 
weighty so I'm gonna try to put it right
