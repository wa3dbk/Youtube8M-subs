00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 we introduce the colors of the world 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.900
 but if we are like a sheet of some 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.900
 drawing 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:21.400
 this is a very cute red strawberry the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:27.400
 drawing but no no no no 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.400
 Well, we're taking the yellow look cta 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.829
 do not 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.489
 in the vibra he makes contact with the 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.620
 colors we will avoid the color pencils 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.219
 do it with toys and do it with a 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.110
 object more than canary since all this 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.300
 can lead to mistakes of the 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.329
 mind of the child instead if you use 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.680
 cards of colors you can not give foot to 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.589
 that the child is wrong what you want 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.940
 teach him the color first of all 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.680
 we have to make sure that it does not 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.549
 have vision problems so what 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.549
 we will do so 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.080
 which is the same as it is 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.590
 which is the same as being here is the same as 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.060
 this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.619
 very good all beauty if the child has not 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 made evidence coupled the colors 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.310
 as it should and we will start to introduce 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:35.840
 the colors in stages 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:44.479
 we add the color red red red 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:48.920
 yellow yellow yellow blue blue 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.920
 blue colors 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.100
 the child learns one at the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.329
 colors because that way the child can 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.289
 compare between colors 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.490
 rafa let's see if he recognizes what is 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.840
 the Red 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.840
 what is the yellow 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.099
 what is the blue 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.569
 if your son has not been able to point 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.959
 the color you are naming leaves you the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.959
 accent mark 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.230
 we will try it in the days 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.400
 next and we'll start from the top 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.180
 a cover let's see if you name them 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.180
 colors this 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.240
 what color stature and what color blue 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.970
 yellow very well in this last stage 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.350
 name the color we will do the same is here 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.390
 activity 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.180
 and we'll start the next day for the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.620
 front if the child is able to name 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.090
 the color 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.830
 you already learned this color is taught 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.970
 we will move to remove all we will leave 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.769
 one that she knows and we will place two 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.010
 especially do not forget that each child is 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.049
 different and each child learns to emerge 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.689
 do not force me if you want to see how it works 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.870
 they make click color cards 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.870
 here 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.030
 if you want to watch a video related to 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.030
 the colors and the final comfort 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.310
