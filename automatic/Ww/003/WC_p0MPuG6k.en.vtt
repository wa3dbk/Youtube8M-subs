00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
knows but you know the legal system ran

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.190 
knows but you know the legal system ran
its<00:05:13.400> course<00:05:13.460> I<00:05:13.880> didn't<00:05:14.150> find<00:05:14.390> enough<00:05:14.690> evidence

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
its course I didn't find enough evidence

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.550 
its course I didn't find enough evidence
to<00:05:15.980> bring<00:05:16.930> charges<00:05:17.930> against<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.860> guy<00:05:19.040> and

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
to bring charges against the guy and

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.190 
to bring charges against the guy and
decided<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.590> drop<00:05:21.950> their<00:05:22.190> case<00:05:22.960> now<00:05:23.960> if<00:05:24.080> it

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
decided to drop their case now if it

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.200 
decided to drop their case now if it
gets<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.620> this<00:05:24.710> kind<00:05:25.010> of<00:05:25.100> situation<00:05:25.280> again<00:05:25.790> or

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
gets to this kind of situation again or

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.970 
gets to this kind of situation again or
gets<00:05:26.419> into<00:05:26.510> any<00:05:26.720> kind<00:05:26.990> of<00:05:27.110> trouble<00:05:27.169> again<00:05:27.710> then
