00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.090
 but it is formed then in first we are 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.809
 friends for a long time we are 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.420
 friends then suddenly we start to 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:18.920
 get together to make music 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.110
 came up it came up like this all of a sudden and we're 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.820
 nice to what happens is that we came from 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.369
 different bands effectively from covers 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.200
 but after a while like three 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.790
 years of knowing this poem sergio and 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.740
 we started playing together we have a 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.250
 band apart then we went out to that band 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.470
 and found omar do not know us 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.020
 then this alex feel that we 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.720
 make the music but that was musical 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.550
 our original music was looking for 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.580
 something that was heard well that had 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.170
 to see how the night and the west as well 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.269
 we use to have ideas and suddenly it arose 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.699
 stir off and the name we've seen 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.250
 he stayed the biggest reason as well 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.909
 Well, just like that, I was looking for the internet 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.880
 in dates or things presume tasks and 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.150
 of the call 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.470
 I mentioned them, he sent the video 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.270
 we expected we do not have the expectation of 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.659
 that if we enter luckily if we enter 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.549
 and so if we send the video 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.700
 they called us they called us the whole process 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.670
 and that's it 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.520
 well, from the moment we learn that 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.899
 we have to come out the truth is that 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.909
 we have a lot of faith, not so in what 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.189
 we are doing so we believe that it is 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.560
 the search is good, it's good 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.060
 sincere and this expressive then it is 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.110
 already being there inside we thought that 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 we have the possibility d 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.100
 to give him everything and they were rooms and 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.100
 when we found out that he helped 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.430
 because of the contest as such, I'm telling you 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.710
 expectation we do not want to win not 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.000
 obviously we have we are sure 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.800
 that we were going to go through but the first 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.190
 for people 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.020
 when you see it from the outside it does not look good no 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.970
 it feels good to be green there what 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.450
 that you are working on is already giving them 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.170
 some fruits feel very good is 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.970
 regardless of what we are giving 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.860
 the contact is therefore a springboard that 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.300
 we can take advantage of this one yes you can 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.440
 Take advantage of what good if you can not 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.180
 take advantage then we follow us 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.220
 how important we do not do it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.220
 so we do it to enjoy it equally 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.480
 this went well then but if not yes no 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.610
 will this be because there is something to several 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.230
 contests or there will be other events where 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.430
 we can make the most of it and 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.840
 we follow hi we are stir and so 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.720
 our search can be found there in 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.590
