going to pursue I thought about what
type<00:01:07.340> of<00:01:07.369> job<00:01:07.549> would<00:01:08.000> give<00:01:08.240> me<00:01:08.450> the

type of job would give me the
opportunity<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.880> have<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:11.090> kind<00:01:11.360> of

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
opportunity to have that kind of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.090
