00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:11.420
 It is Coji-Coji 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:16.250
 This time it has been a while since I went to Akihabara, so I will introduce a buy or jump 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.970
 I'm junk I'm not sure here 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.320
 Portable game key 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.640
 Contains 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.480
 I will not move Mima skane Please take Uzi 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:34.000
 It was 300 yen 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:37.629
 Yes, behind that I once that in such a feeling 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.160
 I wonder if the working day without warranty was 2000 yen 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:47.140
 It is a game and a super NES is stuck 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.470
 I've bought the suspicious of cats Kedomo I had already flowing in with the feeling 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.790
 Already 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.240
 Yeah I do not feel only tomorrow 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.830
 That Akihabara's 3 get? 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:04.410
 I've bought in Saki's March I'd have entered Mr. Saki March 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.410
 When once Ne put power 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:15.500
 As we turn on tap light 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:18.890
 It seems that I'm calling a few numbers this time but I'm not doing this repair yet 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.510
 I would like to check if it is junk 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.000
 Play 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.000
 I think that I want to go to Super Mario Collection No 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.200
 What is it like? 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.770
 Uwaa feeling of this cat 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.270
 Abandoned bridge 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 I turn on my power 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.650
 After all it does not move 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.060
 Can you hear 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:55.230
 It seems that the sound is really done 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:02:00.900
 photo seems to be on the floor or out 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:06.570
 Hi that's not completely dead this opportunity 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.590
 What is the connection of the LCD part wrong ? 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.390
 That's-isn't it 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:17.530
 Relationship between history LCD is really dead or is it either 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.700
 It is here that there was this opportunity this time 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:27.020
 I wonder if it should be here I say an av amp here 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:33.030
 Terminal Masu with Tei and this time I would like to here I also check 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:36.780
 Well Kedomo Now I reporter Fukkiru meaning there is no longer even able to av-out 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.110
 We will refer to the top and bottom cleaner Super NES that it is 10 percent house at 300 yen 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.800
 Say this 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.790
 In the 3.5mm earphone jack 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:51.280
 Yellow red white is growing. The thing called cable says the world 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:55.490
 I'm talking about products that are twinkled with Tama 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.640
 I've got it what was attached to the strange tree x 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:06.330
 Now I can output to TV for a while 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.000
 f Check if the prize is dead or if the sound signal of the internal visual system is dead 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.310
 I think that want to go 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.280
 Then let's have the cable for the picture like this 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.730
 Hey i tried 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.730
 I think I would like to check the power supply 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.090
 Pong 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.489
 Oh cormorant 2 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.700
 I'll Fishing 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.700
 We also hear Akontororu 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.750
 Oh it moves beautifully 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.370
 The tab is considered Mario 2 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.550
 Hey do it 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.550
 I do not see the screen but 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.520
 Yes 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:03.840
 It does not seem dead inside 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:07.170
 This junk of Pokefami Deluxe in that 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:12.660
 It looks like the internal circuit is alive 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.239
 That screen itself by av output is clearly taken to clear beneath 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:21.519
 It seems that the game can also be operated 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:29.979
 It just seems that the liquid crystal of you is dead 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:31.460
 Is the liquid crystal itself really dead or that the internal sound wiring is disconnected male 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.380
 Is there 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:40.770
 There seems to be a great need 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:42.330
 I don't think I 'll be around this time, but I'm going to leave it as a deferment machine 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.220
 Hmmm 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:52.469
 If you think so well I do not have an ac adapter 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:56.900
 I was able to move it somehow because it has that battery, but 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.900
 Or do you have to buy the finished playing a 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:06.260
 So the eggs toys had to such a super Cup gold moves in it and Deployment 300 yen even now 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.180
 I think it is interesting 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:14.360
 Well I am May 23, 2015 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.620
 3 Since the time that I went to get Mr. 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:26.050
 Poke Fai Deluxe That Junk 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:35.740
 Operable of sound at 300 yen 700 yen 2,000 yen towards me 300 yen three types have Mutte directly below 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:37.610
 I think that there are still some people who do not seem to move like both numbers n 4 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.030
 The right wing could be 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.919
 So you want people 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:47.280
 I think it's probably better to look at 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.639
 To Do what to do Toka ac adapter even if it 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:55.420
 We worry far from 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:06:00.210
 That's all for this introduction Thank you for watching 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.210
 I hope you see it again
