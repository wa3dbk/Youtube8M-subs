00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.580
 I do not always believe it 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.650
 Simply island state if you want to 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.579
 German champion was 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.259
 good is just in the youth 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.460
 the half about cadre concerns because 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.940
 the rest is replenished to young 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.300
 player 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.100
 that is , some have the same way 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.410
 motivates in the new season by felix 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.239
 There were breaks between the songs 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.280
 then of course with the 70 expression 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.390
 I think sensational start 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.430
 look back very much 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.989
 extraordinary was the series of eleven 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.489
 winning in a row believes that is one 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.190
 youth team very extraordinary 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.750
 to play with this constant 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.580
 Of course, the decisive factor in the end is that we 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.119
 Southern German champion Vfb also in these 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.119
 taken before 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.060
 learns 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.250
 It was surprising, I think 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.810
 that nobody in the fas is extremely fun 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.730
 has developed games to play 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.840
 The way to play football like 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.670
 who made this dessert 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.980
 that was a big factor 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.480
 point that coincidentally had to say 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.400
 in some games have the luck of the game 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.650
 i think back in stuttgart a 4 3 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.510
 on our side where do you play one 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.160
 which you do not necessarily win the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.290
 world have won in the phase and 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.390
 Even so , the series came off once 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.170
 Developing fun also saves that 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.170
 good fortune 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.659
 everything was different than I was sure that the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.860
 Team would have to be a bit like us 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.090
 So that's the way you act 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.830
 Last one would be one 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.080
 Surprise bag still for some teams you 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.000
 knew it was from my idea how to 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.220
 Of course, football needs to be played 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.330
 Each team specifically brings these 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.830
 I always noticed that the opponents 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.930
 simply adjust significantly more 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.909
 as we did not want to play then 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.679
 always answer in the game when we get up 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.090
 one of the 10 minutes something changed 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.959
 what else have done that now what 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.810
 was planned 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.030
 I think it was before this that we 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.440
 tactically variable were still that 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.720
 the opponent well prepared for ours 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.370
 could want to play in style 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.410
 Quick change so new again 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.410
 Surprises can make good use 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.239
 he has 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.790
 most important is how was the first in 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.519
 augsburg where we impress very much 0 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.450
 have won what the bundesliga 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.400
 is extraordinary 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.870
 of course, the guys have off and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.189
 when I came in well in the in the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.329
 year and I think fast 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.249
 realized that even this again 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.840
 what can achieve and thus the 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.730
 The most emotional game was in Stuttgart where 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.019
 we shortly after halftime 2 1 in 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.900
 then go within one 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.700
 minute in arrears to 3 2 then 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.040
 then the fast again 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.409
 Compensate for 3 3 and then in the 94 and 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.680
 standard variant 43 do for us 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.700
 was a request against vfb went very much 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.930
 emotional moment and also one 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.049
 important game for the development of 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.049
 team 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.700
 leipzig like the ones who want to play 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.870
 one saw here earlier than comekommen 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.810
 Hoffnungheim was active 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.340
 the idea the leipzig the whole club 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.950
 I believe we know that we are 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.150
 because you are very strong on pressing you put on 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.040
 an orderly mess 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.990
 because we hope to adjust to the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.700
 stress that hide the players 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.260
 von leipzig want to kindle by 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.210
 with five six people on the bar council 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.890
 but act can go this stress 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.080
 I think I have a good chance 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.680
 football school are also too scoring opportunities too 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.320
 earn 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.700
 we know or we suspect like seven 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.870
 It does not want to play 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.780
 give big surprise 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.220
 you just have to be the players always 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.200
 Again , just report that 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.820
 Hide stress that very much 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.650
 to donate many white games to her 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.030
 and then try football there 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.030
 to play the pressing
