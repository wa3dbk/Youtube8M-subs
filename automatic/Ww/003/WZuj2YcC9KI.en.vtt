just a bowl with if sort of beaded top
the<00:00:11.250> thing<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.940> tricky<00:00:12.389> part<00:00:12.540> about<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the thing is a tricky part about this is

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.360 
the thing is a tricky part about this is
to<00:00:13.259> get<00:00:13.380> them<00:00:13.500> exactly<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.920> right<00:00:14.070> size<00:00:14.309> so

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
to get them exactly the right size so

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.070 
to get them exactly the right size so
the<00:00:14.790> grille<00:00:15.030> fits<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.450> because<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.900> such

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
the grille fits in because it's such

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.050 
the grille fits in because it's such
it's<00:00:16.289> all<00:00:16.619> at<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> tolerance<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.609> grille

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
it's all at the tolerance for the grille

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.300 
it's all at the tolerance for the grille
you<00:00:18.779> met<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> pot<00:00:19.199> too<00:00:19.380> small<00:00:19.680> or<00:00:20.070> any<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.250> you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you met the pot too small or any of you

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.650 
you met the pot too small or any of you
make<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.490> too<00:00:20.730> big<00:00:20.760> it'll<00:00:21.119> fall<00:00:21.300> through<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
make it too big it'll fall through the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.590 
make it too big it'll fall through the
holes<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.670> that's<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> men<00:00:23.970> they've<00:00:24.210> got<00:00:24.449> some

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
holes so that's the men they've got some

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.810 
holes so that's the men they've got some
calipers<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.050> measure<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.769> anyway<00:00:26.519> I'll

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
calipers to measure it so anyway I'll

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.360 
calipers to measure it so anyway I'll
just<00:00:26.849> get<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.710> make<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.949> those<00:00:34.370> I'm

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
just get on and make one of those I'm

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:48.060 
just get on and make one of those I'm
using<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:36.510> about<00:00:37.160> halfway

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.040 

it<00:00:48.250> essentially<00:00:48.850> quite<00:00:49.210> Belgrad<00:00:49.630> to<00:00:49.810> start

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
it essentially quite Belgrad to start

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.570 
it essentially quite Belgrad to start
off<00:00:50.200> with<00:00:50.380> I'm<00:00:50.590> gonna<00:00:50.770> start<00:00:51.070> off<00:00:51.160> with<00:00:51.220> it's

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
off with I'm gonna start off with it's

00:00:51.580 --> 00:01:12.140 
off with I'm gonna start off with it's
all<00:00:51.700> flat<00:00:52.030> out<00:00:54.060> kind<00:00:55.060> of<00:00:55.150> tube<00:00:55.450> shed

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870 

I'm<00:01:13.050> gonna<00:01:13.200> lift<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.710> keep<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> flared<00:01:14.730> out

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
I'm gonna lift it up keep it flared out

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.640 
I'm gonna lift it up keep it flared out
at<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.120> top<00:01:17.480> complete<00:01:18.480> opposite<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.960> how

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
at the top complete opposite to how

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.140 
at the top complete opposite to how
you'd<00:01:19.830> normally<00:01:19.950> throw<00:01:20.340> pop

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150 

it's<00:01:25.780> about<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.080> psychic<00:01:26.350> leader<00:01:26.800> in<00:01:27.010> the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
it's about the psychic leader in the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.380 
it's about the psychic leader in the
thick<00:01:27.400> ring<00:01:27.640> what<00:01:27.790> I<00:01:27.820> do<00:01:27.970> first<00:01:28.390> is<00:01:28.720> just

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
thick ring what I do first is just

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.760 
thick ring what I do first is just
flatten<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.480> top<00:01:31.690> out<00:01:31.960> with<00:01:32.110> his<00:01:32.230> finger<00:01:32.590> so

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
flatten the top out with his finger so

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.890 
flatten the top out with his finger so
you<00:01:32.860> get<00:01:32.980> like<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.160> sharp<00:01:33.880> white<00:01:34.450> edge<00:01:34.630> like

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
you get like a sharp white edge like

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.010 
you get like a sharp white edge like
that<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.670> start<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.270> then<00:01:37.420> you'll<00:01:37.810> see

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
that for a start and then you'll see

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.530 
that for a start and then you'll see
what<00:01:38.230> I'm<00:01:38.320> sweatin

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
what I'm sweatin

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.390 
what I'm sweatin
I'm<00:01:40.540> just<00:01:40.750> gonna<00:01:40.870> form<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.320> fault<00:01:41.650> just<00:01:42.280> by

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
I'm just gonna form the fault just by

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.380 
I'm just gonna form the fault just by
pushing<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:48.430> form<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.790> ball<00:01:49.000> so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
pushing in to form the ball so

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.900 
pushing in to form the ball so
everything<00:01:49.660> again<00:01:49.870> I'm<00:01:49.930> just<00:01:50.020> gonna<00:01:50.910> stretch

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
everything again I'm just gonna stretch

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.090 
everything again I'm just gonna stretch
it<00:01:52.000> out<00:01:52.240> from<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.170> inside<00:01:53.320> out

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
it out from the inside out

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.420 
it out from the inside out
I<00:01:54.960> submitted<00:01:55.960> yeah<00:01:56.140> but<00:01:56.440> guesswork<00:01:56.860> first<00:01:57.250> to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
I submitted yeah but guesswork first to

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.640 
I submitted yeah but guesswork first to
find<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.850> know<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.030> try<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:58.420> guess<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.650> the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
find you know to try and guess that the

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.250 
find you know to try and guess that the
width<00:01:59.860> of<00:02:00.040> it<00:02:00.190> I<00:02:00.660> wanna<00:02:01.660> get<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.990> stage

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
width of it I wanna get to this stage

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.630 
width of it I wanna get to this stage
then<00:02:02.530> what<00:02:02.650> you<00:02:02.710> do<00:02:02.830> with<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.070> room<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:03.520> you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
then what you do with the room is you

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.600 
then what you do with the room is you
just<00:02:03.820> simply<00:02:04.450> roll<00:02:04.660> it<00:02:04.720> already<00:02:05.230> finger

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
just simply roll it already finger

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.990 
just simply roll it already finger
what's<00:02:08.030> up

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
what's up

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.110 
what's up
gives<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> impression<00:02:10.930> of<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.290> really<00:02:11.620> thick

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
gives the impression of it really thick

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.370 
gives the impression of it really thick
rim<00:02:13.120> buddy<00:02:13.360> that's<00:02:13.540> actually<00:02:13.840> not<00:02:13.990> just<00:02:14.200> a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
rim buddy that's actually not just a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.790 
rim buddy that's actually not just a
thing<00:02:14.560> one<00:02:14.770> roll<00:02:14.980> over<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.900> now<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:17.620> a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
thing one roll over so now it's just a

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.020 
thing one roll over so now it's just a
matter<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.010> checking<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.430> see<00:02:18.670> whether<00:02:18.850> I've

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
matter of checking to see whether I've

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.210 
matter of checking to see whether I've
got<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.600> right<00:02:19.780> size<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.440> believe<00:02:20.770> I'm

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
got it the right size to believe I'm

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.350 
got it the right size to believe I'm
actually<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:22.690> slightly<00:02:22.960> too<00:02:23.230> small<00:02:24.360> it's

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
actually just slightly too small it's

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.480 
actually just slightly too small it's
just<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.600> matter<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:26.280> stretching<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.340> out

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
just a matter of stretching it out

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.970 
just a matter of stretching it out
what's<00:02:27.700> option<00:02:27.850> two<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.300> right<00:02:28.480> size

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.059 

that's<00:02:32.489> back<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.090> right<00:02:33.239> size

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.040 

that's<00:02:36.610> about<00:02:36.849> me<00:02:36.969> really

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.960 

so<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.500> don't<00:02:44.680> need<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.980> use<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.190> your<00:02:45.760> little

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
so you don't need to use a your little
