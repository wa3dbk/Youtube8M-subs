is<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.520> correct<00:01:53.729> that's<00:01:54.149> possible<00:01:55.079> that's<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
is that correct that's possible that's a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020 
is that correct that's possible that's a
possibility<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.820> answer

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
possibility and we will get that answer

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.530 
possibility and we will get that answer
for<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.740> in<00:01:58.740> short<00:01:59.070> order<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.820> theoretically
