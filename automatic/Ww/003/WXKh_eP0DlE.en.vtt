00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
this so what I could do here is they can

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.770 
this so what I could do here is they can
move<00:00:56.649> with<00:00:57.010> its<00:00:57.160> legs

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
move with its legs

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.169 
move with its legs
you<00:00:58.780> see<00:00:58.960> yeah<00:00:59.109> can<00:00:59.530> move<00:00:59.710> can<00:01:00.550> move<00:01:00.699> its<00:01:00.879> arms

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
you see yeah can move can move its arms

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.740 
you see yeah can move can move its arms
and<00:01:01.500> head<00:01:02.519> can<00:01:03.519> cool<00:01:03.699> it<00:01:03.820> can<00:01:04.210> go<00:01:04.390> all<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.629> way

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
and head can cool it can go all the way

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.120 
and head can cool it can go all the way
down<00:01:04.989> but<00:01:05.259> that's<00:01:05.410> more<00:01:05.830> for<00:01:05.890> the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
down but that's more for the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.919 
down but that's more for the
transformation<00:01:06.820> not<00:01:07.090> for<00:01:07.300> it's<00:01:07.420> just<00:01:07.720> live

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929 
transformation not for it's just live

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:10.139 
transformation not for it's just live
mode<00:01:08.259> if<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:08.800> can<00:01:09.070> swing<00:01:09.399> it<00:01:09.490> up<00:01:09.610> a<00:01:09.789> little<00:01:09.940> bit

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
mode if you can swing it up a little bit

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.719 
mode if you can swing it up a little bit
so<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.720> looks<00:01:10.869> kind<00:01:11.050> of<00:01:11.140> like<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.429> t-rex<00:01:12.429> they're

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
so it looks kind of like a t-rex they're

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.340 
so it looks kind of like a t-rex they're
like<00:01:13.119> just<00:01:13.300> trying<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.570> search<00:01:13.780> for<00:01:13.960> food<00:01:14.110> on

this<00:04:56.560> horn<00:04:57.790> goes<00:04:58.330> well<00:04:58.660> with<00:04:58.810> the

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
this horn goes well with the

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.260 
this horn goes well with the
functioning<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.980> Fang<00:05:00.790> memory<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.180> the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
functioning of the Fang memory in the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.330 
functioning of the Fang memory in the
double<00:05:01.480> driver<00:05:01.690> it<00:05:02.170> activates<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.830> three

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
double driver it activates the three

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.730 
double driver it activates the three
different<00:05:03.640> attacks<00:05:04.360> that<00:05:04.810> Fang<00:05:05.230> Joker<00:05:05.470> does

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
different attacks that Fang Joker does

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.790 
different attacks that Fang Joker does
one<00:05:06.670> tap<00:05:07.000> of<00:05:07.270> that<00:05:07.600> will<00:05:07.840> activate<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.500> arm

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
one tap of that will activate the arm

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.630 
one tap of that will activate the arm
Fang

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
Fang

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:19.680 
Fang
so<00:05:09.820> let's<00:05:10.000> show<00:05:10.180> you<00:05:17.550> two<00:05:18.550> taps<00:05:18.820> on<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.090> on<00:05:19.450> the

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
so let's show you two taps on the on the

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:29.090 
so let's show you two taps on the on the
horn<00:05:19.870> will<00:05:20.050> activate<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.620> shoulders<00:05:21.100> agna

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.070 

and<00:05:30.100> three<00:05:30.820> will<00:05:31.000> activate<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.540> maximum

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
and three will activate the maximum

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.270 
and three will activate the maximum
drive<00:05:32.320> which<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:33.130> famous<00:05:33.760> Teresa

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
drive which is the famous Teresa

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:48.840 
drive which is the famous Teresa
random-ass<00:05:36.280> name<00:05:36.580> but<00:05:36.790> whatever

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.830 

very<00:05:49.850> very<00:05:50.240> cool

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
very very cool

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.990 
very very cool
so<00:05:51.110> now<00:05:51.350> we'll<00:05:51.530> insert<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:51.920> Joker<00:05:52.640> memory

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
so now we'll insert the Joker memory

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:07.810 
so now we'll insert the Joker memory
into<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:53.450> maximum<00:05:53.960> drive<00:05:54.260> slots<00:06:06.670> pad<00:06:07.670> you<00:06:07.790> see

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
into the maximum drive slots pad you see

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.700 
into the maximum drive slots pad you see
does<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.360> same<00:06:08.540> exact<00:06:08.900> sound<00:06:09.110> like<00:06:09.380> the

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
does the same exact sound like the

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.770 
does the same exact sound like the
original<00:06:10.460> nerville<00:06:10.790> we<00:06:10.910> have<00:06:11.060> the<00:06:11.330> exclusive

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
original nerville we have the exclusive

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.050 
original nerville we have the exclusive
cyclone<00:06:12.560> memory<00:06:12.860> and<00:06:13.070> the<00:06:13.310> exclusive<00:06:13.790> Joker

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
cyclone memory and the exclusive Joker

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.690 
cyclone memory and the exclusive Joker
memory<00:06:14.510> let's<00:06:15.080> see<00:06:15.260> how<00:06:15.350> they<00:06:15.560> sound<00:06:15.800> in<00:06:16.160> the

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
memory let's see how they sound in the

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.880 
memory let's see how they sound in the
double<00:06:17.060> driver<00:06:17.300> they're<00:06:17.930> gonna<00:06:18.410> be<00:06:18.590> a<00:06:18.620> little

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
double driver they're gonna be a little

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.660 
double driver they're gonna be a little
bit<00:06:19.100> off<00:06:19.250> sync<00:06:20.200> it's<00:06:21.200> because<00:06:21.590> mainly<00:06:22.010> for<00:06:22.430> at

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
bit off sync it's because mainly for at

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.280 
bit off sync it's because mainly for at
least<00:06:22.850> in<00:06:23.060> my<00:06:23.240> opinion<00:06:23.330> mainly<00:06:23.900> is<00:06:24.050> because

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
least in my opinion mainly is because

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.350 
least in my opinion mainly is because
the<00:06:24.410> Joker<00:06:24.620> memory<00:06:24.980> was<00:06:25.190> made<00:06:25.400> to<00:06:25.910> sync<00:06:26.150> better

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
the Joker memory was made to sync better

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.420 
the Joker memory was made to sync better
with<00:06:26.570> the<00:06:26.750> Fang<00:06:27.080> memory<00:06:27.500> not<00:06:28.070> with<00:06:28.310> the

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
with the Fang memory not with the

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.740 
with the Fang memory not with the
cyclone<00:06:28.850> memory<00:06:29.150> if<00:06:29.270> you<00:06:29.330> want<00:06:29.510> to<00:06:29.570> do<00:06:29.630> it

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
cyclone memory if you want to do it

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.200 
cyclone memory if you want to do it
correctly<00:06:29.840> all<00:06:30.560> you<00:06:30.770> have<00:06:30.890> to<00:06:31.010> do<00:06:31.130> is<00:06:31.370> insert

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
correctly all you have to do is insert

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.270 
correctly all you have to do is insert
the<00:06:32.420> cyclone<00:06:32.870> memory<00:06:33.230> then<00:06:33.650> as<00:06:33.860> soon<00:06:34.010> as<00:06:34.190> you

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
the cyclone memory then as soon as you

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.670 
the cyclone memory then as soon as you
open<00:06:34.730> the<00:06:34.760> double<00:06:34.970> driver<00:06:35.330> insert<00:06:36.320> the<00:06:36.470> Joker

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
open the double driver insert the Joker

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.080 
open the double driver insert the Joker
memory<00:06:37.070> so<00:06:37.280> here<00:06:37.430> we'll<00:06:37.580> demonstrate<00:06:37.730> how

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
memory so here we'll demonstrate how

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.960 
memory so here we'll demonstrate how
that<00:06:38.120> happened<00:06:39.250> let's<00:06:40.250> see<00:06:40.400> if<00:06:40.520> I<00:06:40.580> can<00:06:40.730> do<00:06:40.790> this

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
that happened let's see if I can do this

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:54.330 
that happened let's see if I can do this
correctly<00:06:41.960> anyone<00:06:42.950> tape<00:06:43.190> so<00:06:43.550> let's<00:06:43.880> henshin
