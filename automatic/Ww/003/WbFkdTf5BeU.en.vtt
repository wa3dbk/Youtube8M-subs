00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
20s up to 44 then back down so I mean

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.569 
20s up to 44 then back down so I mean
just<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.209> get<00:03:50.329> $100<00:03:51.019> or<00:03:51.200> $200<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.190> mean<00:03:52.489> if

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
just to get $100 or $200 I mean if

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:53.800 
just to get $100 or $200 I mean if
you've<00:03:52.700> got<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:53.000> be<00:03:53.269> able<00:03:53.329> to<00:03:53.510> deal<00:03:53.629> with<00:03:53.780> a

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
you've got to be able to deal with a

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.920 
you've got to be able to deal with a
fluctuation<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:55.700> stocks<00:03:55.970> do<00:03:56.180> pay<00:03:56.420> dividend

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
fluctuation this stocks do pay dividend

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.080 
fluctuation this stocks do pay dividend
so<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.709> mean<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.099> can<00:03:58.220> hold<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.459> for<00:03:58.579> long<00:03:58.760> term

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
so I mean you can hold it for long term

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.000 
so I mean you can hold it for long term
if<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.480> cruise<00:03:59.780> more<00:04:00.170> often<00:04:00.440> like<00:04:00.590> that

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
if you cruise more often like that

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.069 
if you cruise more often like that
there<00:04:01.700> are<00:04:01.819> definitely<00:04:02.239> reasons<00:04:02.599> to<00:04:02.750> hold<00:04:02.930> the

there are definitely reasons to hold the

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.080 
there are definitely reasons to hold the
stock<00:04:03.319> but<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:03.709> wouldn't<00:04:04.430> necessarily<00:04:04.549> buy<00:04:05.030> it

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090

just<00:04:05.239> for<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.959> credit<00:04:06.609> but<00:04:07.609> if<00:04:07.700> you<00:04:07.849> do<00:04:08.000> it

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
just for the credit but if you do it

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.720 
just for the credit but if you do it
would<00:04:08.329> be<00:04:08.480> for<00:04:08.690> each<00:04:08.810> sailing<00:04:09.200> that<00:04:09.319> you<00:04:09.410> go<00:04:09.530> on
