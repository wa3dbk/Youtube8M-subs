00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
nothing out of the ordinary but it's

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.940 
nothing out of the ordinary but it's
good<00:03:31.330> coming<00:03:31.989> up<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.260> materials<00:03:32.739> along

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
good coming up to the materials along

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.710 
good coming up to the materials along
the<00:03:33.070> upper<00:03:33.220> we've<00:03:34.000> got<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> hyperfuse

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
the upper we've got a hyperfuse

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.740 
the upper we've got a hyperfuse
construction<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:35.980> we've<00:03:36.130> got<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.750> diffuse

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
construction so we've got a diffuse

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.260 
construction so we've got a diffuse

the<00:04:08.250> materials<00:04:09.250> used<00:04:09.519> aren't<00:04:10.150> very

the materials used aren't very

the materials used aren't very
me<00:04:10.690> let's<00:04:11.080> just<00:04:11.140> did<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.500> aren't<00:04:11.710> very<00:04:11.830> well

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
me let's just did that aren't very well

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.500 
me let's just did that aren't very well
ventilated<00:04:12.520> they'll<00:04:12.940> just<00:04:13.060> put<00:04:13.240> it<00:04:13.330> that<00:04:13.360> way

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
ventilated they'll just put it that way

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.380 
ventilated they'll just put it that way
and<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:15.190> know<00:04:15.310> you've<00:04:15.490> got<00:04:15.520> areas<00:04:16.000> of<00:04:16.180> mesh

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
and you know you've got areas of mesh

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.470 
and you know you've got areas of mesh
where<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.410> areas<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:17.890> mesh<00:04:18.100> are<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:19.030> top<00:04:19.450> of

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
where the areas of mesh are on top of

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.990 
where the areas of mesh are on top of
the<00:04:19.720> fuse<00:04:19.959> itself<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:21.040> really<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.850> only

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
the fuse itself so really the only

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.430 
the fuse itself so really the only
ventilation<00:04:22.660> you're<00:04:22.750> ever<00:04:22.930> going<00:04:23.170> to<00:04:23.230> really

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
ventilation you're ever going to really

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.290 
ventilation you're ever going to really
get<00:04:23.710> may<00:04:23.920> be<00:04:23.980> coming<00:04:24.310> slightly<00:04:24.730> from<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:24.940> toll

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
get may be coming slightly from the toll

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.540 
get may be coming slightly from the toll
and<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:26.230> know<00:04:26.350> very<00:04:26.680> slightly<00:04:27.130> through<00:04:27.430> the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
and you know very slightly through the

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.430 
and you know very slightly through the
tongue<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:28.390> like<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:28.570> said<00:04:28.690> there<00:04:29.020> isn't<00:04:29.170> many

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
tongue but like I said there isn't many

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.530 
tongue but like I said there isn't many
areas<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.920> ventilation<00:04:30.370> but<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.300> does

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
areas of ventilation but that does

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.290 
areas of ventilation but that does
assist<00:04:31.960> in<00:04:32.110> breaking<00:04:32.530> time<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.640> heat<00:04:33.910> and

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
assist in breaking time and the heat and

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.030 
assist in breaking time and the heat and
moisture<00:04:34.510> which<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.440> know<00:04:35.470> created

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
moisture which is you know created

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.280 
moisture which is you know created
inside<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.520> shoe<00:04:36.730> helps<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.600> shoot<00:04:37.810> breaking

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
inside the shoe helps to shoot breaking

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.640 
inside the shoe helps to shoot breaking
quicker<00:04:38.770> so<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.460> suppose<00:04:39.790> you<00:04:40.240> know<00:04:40.270> is<00:04:40.690> you

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
quicker so I suppose you know is you

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.170 
quicker so I suppose you know is you
know<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.830> can't<00:04:42.130> use<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.490> decent<00:04:42.790> balance<00:04:42.910> I

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
know you can't use the decent balance I

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.580 
know you can't use the decent balance I
suppose<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:46.000> know<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.180> use<00:04:46.900> this<00:04:47.170> issue<00:04:47.440> that

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
suppose you know you use this issue that

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.920 
suppose you know you use this issue that
needs<00:04:47.770> to<00:04:47.860> be<00:04:47.950> broken<00:04:48.130> in<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.420> course<00:04:49.480> the

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
needs to be broken in so of course the

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.120 
needs to be broken in so of course the
little<00:04:50.200> ventilation<00:04:50.470> that's<00:04:50.890> there

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
little ventilation that's there

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.850 
little ventilation that's there
obviously<00:04:52.000> how<00:04:52.150> did<00:04:52.360> she<00:04:52.480> break<00:04:52.690> in<00:04:52.960> so<00:04:53.530> in

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
obviously how did she break in so in

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.590 
obviously how did she break in so in
terms<00:04:54.070> of<00:04:54.190> ventilation<00:04:54.610> it's<00:04:55.060> not<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.240> good

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
terms of ventilation it's not that good

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.210 
terms of ventilation it's not that good
it's<00:04:56.170> nothing<00:04:56.320> to<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.680> point<00:04:56.890> where<00:04:57.010> it<00:04:57.100> gave

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
it's nothing to the point where it gave

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.070 
it's nothing to the point where it gave
me<00:04:57.310> blisters<00:04:57.520> so<00:04:58.210> that's<00:04:58.390> also<00:04:58.540> a<00:04:58.690> good<00:04:58.750> thing

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
me blisters so that's also a good thing

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.990 
me blisters so that's also a good thing
but<00:04:59.740> what<00:04:59.830> do<00:04:59.920> I<00:04:59.980> think<00:05:00.010> about<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.460> Nike<00:05:00.760> carry

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
but what do I think about the Nike carry

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.190 
but what do I think about the Nike carry
one<00:05:01.270> well<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.800> shoe<00:05:03.010> itself<00:05:03.630> is<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.690> good<00:05:04.990> she

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
one well the shoe itself is a good she

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.200 
one well the shoe itself is a good she
ran<00:05:05.320> for<00:05:05.350> me<00:05:05.650> it<00:05:05.860> performs<00:05:06.310> above<00:05:06.550> average<00:05:06.760> I

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
ran for me it performs above average I

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.780 
ran for me it performs above average I
know<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.690> ventilation<00:05:08.560> is<00:05:08.680> issue<00:05:08.890> everything

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
know the ventilation is issue everything

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.200 
know the ventilation is issue everything

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
because for me perform better than say

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.880 
because for me perform better than say
the<00:05:18.610> CP<00:05:19.000> 3.8<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:20.020> performed<00:05:20.410> better<00:05:20.530> than<00:05:20.620> that
