well<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.259> started<00:00:04.590> mortar<00:00:05.130> racing<00:00:06.300> let's<00:00:06.720> take

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
well I started mortar racing let's take

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.950 
well I started mortar racing let's take
the<00:00:07.109> example<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.560> one<00:00:07.890> corner<00:00:08.780> there<00:00:09.780> would<00:00:09.930> be

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
the example of one corner there would be

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.860 
the example of one corner there would be
three<00:00:10.350> parts<00:00:10.770> to<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.070> corner<00:00:11.750> there<00:00:12.750> would

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
three parts to that corner there would

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.600 
three parts to that corner there would
be<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.920> entry<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:15.330> EEP<00:00:15.540> X<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.349> then<00:00:17.009> the<00:00:17.189> exit

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
be the entry the EEP X and then the exit

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.839 
be the entry the EEP X and then the exit
three<00:00:18.570> parts<00:00:19.099> by<00:00:20.099> the<00:00:20.130> time<00:00:20.489> I<00:00:20.520> had<00:00:20.820> finished

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
three parts by the time I had finished

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.339 
three parts by the time I had finished
my<00:00:21.680> career<00:00:23.000> they<00:00:24.000> will<00:00:24.180> eat<00:00:24.390> parts<00:00:25.020> to<00:00:25.169> that

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
my career they will eat parts to that

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.609 
my career they will eat parts to that
corner<00:00:25.849> because<00:00:26.849> from<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.360> time<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:28.320> take

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
corner because from the time you take

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.490 
corner because from the time you take
your<00:00:28.860> foot<00:00:29.130> off<00:00:29.309> the<00:00:29.489> gas<00:00:29.669> pedal<00:00:30.500> to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
your foot off the gas pedal to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.750 
your foot off the gas pedal to
decelerate<00:00:31.919> for<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> corner<00:00:33.570> that's<00:00:34.140> one

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
decelerate for the corner that's one

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.800 
decelerate for the corner that's one
then<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.450> hit<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.720> brake<00:00:36.930> pedal<00:00:37.320> that's<00:00:37.860> two

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
then you hit the brake pedal that's two

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.440 
then you hit the brake pedal that's two
then<00:00:39.810> you<00:00:40.440> start<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.160> into<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:41.700> apex<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
then you start to go into the apex so

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.120 
then you start to go into the apex so
you<00:00:42.510> take<00:00:42.870> off<00:00:43.080> the<00:00:43.290> brake<00:00:43.530> pedal<00:00:43.920> that's

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
you take off the brake pedal that's

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.540 
you take off the brake pedal that's
three<00:00:44.690> you<00:00:45.690> hit<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.110> apex<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> corner<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
three you hit the apex of the corner a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.510 
three you hit the apex of the corner a
crucial<00:00:48.090> part<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> corner<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:50.250> then

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
crucial part of the corner you then

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.050 
crucial part of the corner you then
start<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:51.000> accelerate<00:00:51.450> very<00:00:52.550> slowly<00:00:54.710> then<00:00:56.060> you

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
start to accelerate very slowly then you

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.380 
start to accelerate very slowly then you
start<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> unlock<00:00:57.810> the<00:00:58.320> steering<00:00:58.829> angle

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
start to unlock the steering angle

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.310 
start to unlock the steering angle
because<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.510> missed<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> steering<00:01:01.200> angle

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
because I missed the steering angle

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.030 
because I missed the steering angle
going<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.750> then<00:01:03.750> finally<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
going in and then finally you get to the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.950 
going in and then finally you get to the
exit<00:01:05.479> now<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.380> very<00:01:07.710> smoothly

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
exit now if you do that very smoothly

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.410 
exit now if you do that very smoothly

way you gives you less performance if
you<00:01:24.229> caress<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:27.030> gentle<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
you caress it and now gentle with it and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.789 
you caress it and now gentle with it and
lead<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.140> into<00:01:31.710> its<00:01:32.040> next<00:01:32.400> piece<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.210> motion<00:01:33.799> it

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
lead it into its next piece of motion it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
lead it into its next piece of motion it
responds<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.720> does

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
responds very well to you and it does

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.510 
responds very well to you and it does
those<00:01:37.229> things<00:01:37.260> very<00:01:37.979> efficiently<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:40.520> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
those things very efficiently and you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.230 
those things very efficiently and you
therefore<00:01:42.060> get<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.360> faster<00:01:43.140> corner<00:01:43.880> with<00:01:44.880> less

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
therefore get a faster corner with less

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.020 
therefore get a faster corner with less
tire<00:01:45.659> wear<00:01:46.080> with<00:01:46.470> less<00:01:46.799> abuse<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.000> the

suspension with less sweat from the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.750 
suspension with less sweat from the
