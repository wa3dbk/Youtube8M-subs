00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.870
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.520
 new guide of champions 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.670
 in this case we will return to the jungle and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.460
 we will see a forgotten helix the queen 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.440
 of the helix spiders since he came to 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 the league of legends showed me that it was 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.819
 a formidable champion dominating 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.130
 widely the top lane in your 

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:22.169
 most glorious stage visiting the lane 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.599
 inferior in the support role and giving 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.789
 terror in the jungle stage where 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.550
 shared the jungle top 3 with leasing 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.199
 and Evelyn after several changes in her 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.609
 and in jungle objects many 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.890
 champions without south stopped their place 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:37.230
 leaving it in the well as for 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.210
 competitive is concerned but the queen of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.489
 the spiders are not happy with this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.230
 many times we look for guides of champions 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.749
 that is nope or that they are simply 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.089
 strong during the current goal but not 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.829
 it's a game and having fun is part of 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.629
 him and if we can use a champion 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.909
 fun to be a good challenge to 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.179
 dominate and that's really not bad 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.399
 because what then he and we are given this and 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.019
 much more will bring us a good 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.120
 cleanliness in the rules thanks to their 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.009
 percentage damage skills while 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.870
 that the spiders are part of the 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.490
 damage that also generates us 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.620
 we will do so we will not lose either 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.050
 a lot of life has a good control of 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.300
 Mobility mobility damage escape mode 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.940
 flexibility when it comes to setting up your 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.920
 win and how to play with them not 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.050
 let's forget that from level 3 and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 We will have 6 skills that will be 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.770
 very fun to use when making us 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 the jungle when doing combos in the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.820
 hacking and fighting or taking advantage 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.030
 over our rivals generating damage 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.040
 constant 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.380
 but before seeing all this in game 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.510
 let's see runes and masters in ruins 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.790
 we will carry hybrid penetration marks 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.470
 glyphs power armor seals of 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.280
 skill and quintessence of power of 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.810
 ability 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.310
 if you do not have the penetration marks 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.200
 hybrid can use speed 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.869
 attack that go very well with propeller and 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.880
 that will boost your double in the jungle in 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.260
 masters we will use this 21 90 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.030
 enhancing its hybrid damage 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.370
 once the game has started 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.440
 we will try to start in the toad to 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.970
 make us the fastest the blue clean 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.130
 easy the jungle and have the corn 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.350
 again in the red to make sure 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.330
 before crawling if we go against jungle 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.220
 that can invade us like a sack or a 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.020
 1 we will start directly on the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.960
 group opposed to the one that begins our 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.060
 rival at level 1 we will give a point to the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.770
 double in order not to lose lives 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.930
 from the first amount in the jungle 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.090
 we will launch the volatile spider in our 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.910
 human form we will use the r and activate 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.040
 the frenzy raudo level 2 give you a 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.260
 point to the cv and in level 3 to the air 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.090
 maximize to Moscow then double and for 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.870
 last the giving him his respective points 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.610
 on air in levels 6 11 and 16 all 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.230
 the propeller skills will serve us 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.240
 in the jungle either to shorten 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.310
 distance with the abseiling study with the 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.960
 cocoon to receive less damage or 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.360
 just kill the monsters with 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.370
 the other skills equally if not 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.100
 you have the blue bust is preferable to use 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.260
 only the spider shape since it does not spend 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.990
 manna and we will save in week for 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.850
 bankers the guns in initial minutes 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.920
 are the most important for the isr by 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.370
 this reason we will go through the open roads 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.200
 of the guard 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.000
 in our jungle object that we 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.040
 will help to clear the jungle quickly and 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.620
 to keep life and mana for the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.420
 bankers in the jungle when you go to 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.549
 do some camping try always 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.409
 step back after attacking 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.360
 to these monsters so that this 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.700
 way are the spiders the one that tank 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.769
 in the damage and thus keep more life in 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.290
 the jungle before a possible invade or 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.459
 when they make gangs 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.470
 we will begin in human form 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.829
 we will start with the e to study the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.409
 rival 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.000
 then we will use the doubles and the coop if 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.890
 well the cv generates damage when more life 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.599
 has the goal we will launch it after 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.579
 double it because the castle of this one is 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.650
 much faster then we will become 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.989
 in spider and we will complete the combo with 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.060
 juice and double leaving the e to jump 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.709
 some miñón and shorten distances and the 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.520
 enemy tries to escape running or 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.110
 planning 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:04:14.130
 so the big one I would want to be wv and 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:15.860
 rqw6n6jgvp0 http of snowing the of the 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.970
 split the same with the boots 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.590
 recommended the mercury boots but 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.299
 if we go ahead the boots of 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.280
 mobility will help us to be more 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.410
 present in the rails in another way 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.760
 the enchantment of the giant ash will be 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.070
 our standard enchantment for 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.840
 our June project still like that if 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.910
 we go for the enchantment of the magician 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.710
 defensive objects can not miss in 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.960
 this champion because thanks to her damage 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.400
 percentage of the cv in its two forms and 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.560
 the ability to harass with self 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.810
 attacks with the w we do not need so much 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.060
 year but is alive to do everything 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.800
 that is also important to know the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.260
 strong points of this champion and in the 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.000
 I made those with charges are essential for 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.500
 what the obvious stone not only 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.060
 will serve to give you information of 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.360
 where jungle team are 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.159
 above 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.319
 and the rotations of the other champions 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.539
 but it will allow you to counteract the 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.479
 rival bankers and thus take advantage 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.000
 canceling your opponent jungle item 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.370
 boots and sighted stone will be objects that 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.990
 we will prioritize before everything then we will look for 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.729
 armor with the omen of randin 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.069
 Magic resistance with appearance 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.199
 spiritual and we will complete with elevation 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.569
 fine for more advance armor or veil 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.370
 and for more magical resistance remember 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.740
 that these objects are recommended for 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.719
 standard items so we can not 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.430
 forget the visual center as an object 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.990
 defensive to increase the magic damage 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.550
 of our action team from the 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.099
 solar iron against composition of 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.229
 double or magical damage raised the heart 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.060
 of ice against hyper carris and armor 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.520
 of rooms against mixed compositions 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.830
 know how to buy at the moment 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.360
 indicated is important in the item for 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.509
 what always observes who is 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.219
 generating more damage from the rival team a 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.840
 the game is advanced and can be 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.699
 offer several ways to play no 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.009
 looking married in the rival team 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.629
 making use of the cocoon doing the 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.400
 front line thanks to our build 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.990
 tank and rappel that will help you 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.969
 let's avoid mortal damage or that the enemy 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.660
 lose focus on fights or 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.940
 we will seek to protect 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.230
 in this way the and can be fulfilled 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.630
 role that is missing in our 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.280
 team composition but you must 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.110
 identify what they need most 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.150
 your companions and try to supply what 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.430
 always try to be together as a team 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.380
 uses all year volatile in bushes 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.510
 where you have no vision to detect 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.610
 some possible trap do not forget 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.620
 guardian and stay attentive in the area 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.210
 of the fights in the rails using 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.040
 rappel about a child can give you the 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.870
 distance needed to get out of the 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.850
 danger area or shorten distances in 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.410
 a house does not matter in the area of 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.860
 jungle since activating rappel 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.480
 you will get vision even behind the walls 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.190
 propeller demands a lot of vision in 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.110
 fights to get the most out of him 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.970

 a thousand and one ways 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.880
 you just need creativity and obviously 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.920
 a lot of practice 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.750
