00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.139
 i 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 for a year the extension of two to 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.570
 four lanes of the road that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.490
 communicates tabasco chiapas and campeche has 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.320
 left as balance the death of animals 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.329
 whose species protected by the laws 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.660
 Mexicans for being in danger of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.660
 extinction 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.719
 the most affected is the population 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.530
 araguatos monkeys at least 15 have been 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.530
 run over 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 in this area the measures were not taken 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.960
 appropriate to do the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.180
 prevention of this type of phenomena what 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.900
 ideal it would have been that they had 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.790
 placed speed reducers and 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.790
 also place wildlife steps 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.689
 another 44 monkeys that lived on the shore 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.689
 of the asphalt have disappeared 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.860
 love 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.080
 an environmental impact 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.180
 consultant g or element did not report the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.100
 presence of its species so it does not 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.010
 They raised mitigation measures to 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 avoid harm to the animals the study 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.380
 of origin was poorly made and was the basis 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.050
 to make a ruling by part 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.880
 of the environmental authority that was 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.700
 deficient in that sense because it does not 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.490
 They detected that there was wildlife 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.050
 monkeys and there were other species that have 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.050
 been suffering the run over 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.720
 when 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.240
 here 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.020
 on Facebook 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.200
 animal run-over phenomena 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.390
 that should have been prevented and that 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.880
 you can still prevent it from expanding 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.030
 four-lane road they knocked down the 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.340
 vegetation on one of the sides and what 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.320
 did is that already that natural bridge 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.350
 break the way it's going to 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.970
 have to solve this is with steps 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.950
 artificial let's say it so they're going to 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.860
 have to be designed that is a challenge 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.530
 quite interesting because they are more than 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.270
 60 meters away for this 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.140
 road from villahermosa towards 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.300
 escÃ¡rcega campeche crosses on average 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.520
 3,500 daily vehicles some of them 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.320
 heavy load on this road it 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.660
 carry out the expansion works of 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.300
 two to four lanes and they are barely 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.060
 meters away those that separate the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.650
 asphalt tape of trees where 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.650
 they inhabit the saraguatos monkeys 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.590
 although from the beginning of the works the 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.480
 environmental authorities received the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.070
 first complaint for taking advantage of 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.110
 the species protected by the norm 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.790
 Mexican official until now 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.300
 they began to plan the measures of 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.300
 protection 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.510
 but what they did was reforest 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:31.530
 we can all do a double 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.810
 functionality because it 's the first 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.660
 authorization that the sct obtains in 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.430
 regarding environmental impact the grant 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:45.040
 Sea hand and mitigation measures will 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.960
 he said there is a program according to reports 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.360
 of central offices that is already 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.290
 authorized and that is a very program 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.360
 solid that uses the monkey of keys that is 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.690
 like something hanging so close 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.430
 trees are passed from the endorsement and once 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.080
 they removed all the super monkeys 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.970
 they started 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.550
 so run over the cars because 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.820
 they had to go down there was no more 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.820
 where is it as it circulates for the other side 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.549
 with images in this line which of 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.090
 tabasco for millennium news
