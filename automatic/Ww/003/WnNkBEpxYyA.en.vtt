00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
like anything prohibited but I suggest

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.670 
like anything prohibited but I suggest
not<00:05:07.690> doing<00:05:08.020> that<00:05:08.050> when<00:05:08.320> you're<00:05:08.410> going<00:05:08.560> online

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
not doing that when you're going online

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.860 
not doing that when you're going online
because<00:05:09.070> that'll<00:05:09.310> get<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:09.580> instantly<00:05:10.570> band

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
because that'll get you instantly band

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.210 
because that'll get you instantly band
and<00:05:11.140> it<00:05:11.290> gives<00:05:11.500> you<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.650> higher<00:05:11.830> risk<00:05:12.040> of

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
and it gives you a higher risk of

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.610 
and it gives you a higher risk of
getting<00:05:12.340> banned<00:05:12.580> but<00:05:13.300> 343<00:05:14.020> is<00:05:14.169> always<00:05:14.440> what<00:05:14.590> I

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
getting banned but 343 is always what I

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.610 
getting banned but 343 is always what I
like<00:05:14.860> what<00:05:15.130> you<00:05:15.970> know<00:05:16.110> if<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.230> don't<00:05:17.410> want<00:05:17.530> to
