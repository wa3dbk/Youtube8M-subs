not<00:03:12.920> gonna<00:03:13.070> change<00:03:13.370> what<00:03:13.490> he's<00:03:13.790> got<00:03:14.060> here<00:03:14.420> I

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
not gonna change what he's got here I

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.530 
not gonna change what he's got here I
want<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:14.990> ruin<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.380> vintage<00:03:15.650> vibe

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
want to ruin that vintage vibe

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.960 
want to ruin that vintage vibe
I<00:03:19.630> think<00:03:20.630> they<00:03:20.780> sound<00:03:21.110> best<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.890> I<00:03:22.250> actually

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
I think they sound best and I actually

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.000 
I think they sound best and I actually
had<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.630> trim<00:03:23.870> with<00:03:24.050> mine<00:03:24.260> when<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.500> got<00:03:24.740> it<00:03:24.890> and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
had the trim with mine when I got it and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.290 
had the trim with mine when I got it and
sold<00:03:25.190> off<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.610> trim<00:03:25.880> because<00:03:26.060> they're

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
sold off the trim because they're

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.810 
sold off the trim because they're
valuable

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.420 

I<00:03:28.870> think<00:03:29.870> they<00:03:29.959> sound<00:03:30.230> best<00:03:30.530> wraparound<00:03:31.040> style

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
I think they sound best wraparound style

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.370 
I think they sound best wraparound style
if<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:31.940> feed<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.390> strings<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.870> backwards

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
if you feed the strings and backwards

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.320 
if you feed the strings and backwards
and<00:03:34.959> you<00:03:35.959> get<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.140> little<00:03:36.380> more<00:03:36.470> sustain<00:03:37.330> no

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
and you get a little more sustain no

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.810 
and you get a little more sustain no
tuning<00:03:38.810> issues<00:03:38.990> that<00:03:39.470> way<00:03:39.740> or<00:03:40.010> less<00:03:40.400> tuning

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820

issues<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.330> way<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.540> should<00:03:41.930> say
