00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.060
 television is very easy 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.549
 and we are going to make one this very complicated 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.490
 giant very well let's chop 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.720
 america capers alca for 7 that I 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.720
 they like and I do not like them 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.340
 Paris 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.930
 our goal and nelore every and good this 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.969
 country and I'm going to start chopping the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.969
 little capers not much 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.050
 and we are explaining the aid to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.080
 Foreman are the smallest the most 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.150
 little girls are much richer they are 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.510
 foreman and they are much better the taste is 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.670
 richer much more tenuous but not the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.020
 we suddenly find the people of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.090
 habitat 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.860
 a lot of people do not like the taste of 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.320
 the caper but I think it's 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.720
 very rich 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.400
 but in certain dishes in certain 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.370
 example prices when they give it to me in 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.979
 salad albÃ©niz the examination room not unique 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.620
 I like I do not like them because I think 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.890
 that the taste predominates a lot 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.540
 we are applying it to my chopping boards 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
 now they are a little more modern they are from 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.800
 plastic you know how are the kitchen 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 They send me strange things but always 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.830
 we are stinging it is very important that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.410
 so that you do not move them to always put 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.620
 a damp cloth below is the technique of 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.620
 kitchen 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.820
 ready we have now now we have 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.820
 salmon there is no no move no one waits 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.210
 and it 's finally minced 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.210
 because they go from the heart 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.460
 yes but they do not go out long ago and I'm going to 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.680
 be a few slices of this lemon 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.300
 yellow that is called lemon yellow 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.920
 ureca 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.230
 well it's called or yellow lemon 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.750
 we found in the super and its flavor is 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.340
 much less bitter that's why we're 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.210
 using salmon for salmon is a 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.000
 Very delicate flavor at the level 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.990
 we are what if we do not need these 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.470
 bones 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.470
 we do not want them we are already 23 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.610
 you have help techniques exactly 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.700
 it's the same lemon they use for 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.709
 exactly lemon ska desserts 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.689
 there is a very fashionable dessert that famously 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.030
 pay a dance exactly what is called 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.549
 yellow lemon country that is that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.480
 now you have a term that you are going to do 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.480
 you grab a piece of paper 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.960
 preferably flipped oil in 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.720
 aerosol 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.450
 how are your cooking classes 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.450
 you are going to take a salmon very well 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.150
 very well the medium in the middle always down 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.440
 salt please call await I slept 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.940
 pepper pot 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.940
 you want to put it had to expose 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.810
 I do not know why someone has something is the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.950
 color that is black 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.470
 ok big I had a great time now you're going to 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.739
 put capers to your liking on top of 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.739
 Salmon 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.750
 according to your family liking 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.840
 it's a bit much 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.470
 well you're going to put a slice of 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.470
 lemon 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.790
 about two more or less nothing more 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.080
 exactly and we need to put direct 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.910
 milligrams ex to close 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.170
 to calculate we are going to put a little bit 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.170
 white wine itself not 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.050
 very complicated to make complicated 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.050
 very complicated 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.430
 we are and this is going to be a fish 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.560
 papered and is a technique that is a 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.879
 steaming technique and this is 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.310
 one of the best technical techniques 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.019
 for with we are dieting is the best that 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.400
 we can do until the other heart I 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.830
 are missing more of my queens we have the wine 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.300
 White others you can skip I 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.949
 I also put a stable flavor 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.770
 but you can put up a touch of 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.080
 tequila the best are very little this one 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.600
 you can put the dry sherry for example 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.370
 A touch of brandy can also be no 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.080
 but very little because it looks good 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.669
 its salmon the flavor is very delicate 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.930
 then we want it we do not want 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.120
 Exceed exposed by using a wine 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.130
 preferably dry white not to fruit 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.020
 donated floating looks is already doing 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.199
 single legs high moving eating 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.139
 is doing this you are already with strikes 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.400
 healthy and I forget about things very 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.930
 well you keep doing that let's see 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.180
 how is our look just now they are 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.310
 happening I like when you like soups 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.820
 that are nothing more than a single dish 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.820
 they look for me 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.589
 We knew that our meat balls 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:11.699
 they are already starting to cook, they are already 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.699
 turning more rositas 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.260
 this does know we do not eat very well the 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.000
 technique of wrapping these perfect but 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.160
 the one that gets as pretty as this 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.260
 then wrap as if you are given the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.210
 win as you want 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:33.290
 paris of silver that scares us 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.290
 all very well 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.310
 very good for you perfect until the other 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.860
 third not at once if we go to 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.539
 converse moment to the truth and what 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.659
 we are going to ignore an average temperature 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:48.719
 nothing more than 10 to 12 minutes 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:51.000
 you do not need more remember that salmon 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:53.069
 must be built with the center 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.960
 slightly raw like all the 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.280
 fish the exact moment to know that 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.319
 us the fish is ready is that it 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.919
 begins to defoliate so called is the 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:03.990
 term is soy and is ready by bolt 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.960
 they're not going to overdo things if I overdo it 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.550
 bake you will see the shoe sole 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.090
 and look at the hours of the day of view 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:15.659
 very modern and what a beautiful country 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.039
 thank you very much is beautiful see if you look 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.659
 the sole of my shoes that is venezuela 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.300
 mixed for everything is very funny the day 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:24.050
 today look 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.050
 exists 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:35.819
 it is said in my house that it seems that as 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:37.500
 a car to this car mother grain by 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:40.169
 down who is not going to walk well then 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.409
 I am going to see my shoes very well very 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:46.530
 well and a little bit of your wine if there are children 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.490
 preferably do not put wine I'm from 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.500
 the idea that children should not 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.430
 consume a drop of alcohol or be in 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.930
 are sent but it goes by highs more 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.940
 but there is some alcohol cough does not 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:01.129
 needs so that children do not 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.129
 they need nothing like what for 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:09.399
 exactly and then until you look through 

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:11.889
 example if you are going to put wine to what 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:13.899
 then it 's a different figurine 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.119
 it is better to do them as 

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:18.339
 If it were a cake 

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:19.869
 better participation of children and that 

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:22.209
 It is very nice, very good, very good idea 

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:23.769

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:26.919
