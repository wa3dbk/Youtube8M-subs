00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.800
 - Rafael Nadal 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.280
 less evil minor 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.590
 cardiotrophin-1 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.590
 you may have control of body weight 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:26.219
 a study recently published in the journal cell metabolism shows that 

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:31.429
 This protein regulates the metabolism of sugars and lipids. 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.469
 scientific work of the Center for Applied Medical Research and the 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.760
 faculty of pharmacy of the University of Navarre have shown that the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.979
 cardiotrophin-1 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.219
 is able to reverse obesity and some of the main alterations 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.220
 associated metabolic 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
 like for example type 2 diabetes 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.940
 our studies in animal models of obesity 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.330
 have shown p actions 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.210
 gene desire is cardiotrophin-1 of bilbao of the skill that has 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.760
 cardiotrophin-1 of decreasing intake regrets that energy expenditure 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.370
 in fact we have sat down that the administration of afternoon another final 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.560
 index an increase in cellular oxygen consumption as a consequence of the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 combustion of nutrients mainly from fat 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.430
 the excess weight that CaquetÃ¡ causes 100 to 1 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.720
 it is mostly due to a decrease in fatty deposits 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.300
 of the organism 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.760
 de vido the ability of this protein to stimulate 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.740
 the burning of stored fat not only at the level of fatty deposits 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.920
 if not also at the muscular level 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.860
 we have seen that the car of another end to one 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.110
 besides having effects 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.070
 very marked on the metabolism of fat 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.520
 strengthens the action of insulin already lowers 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 blood glucose levels 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.380
 animals that can not produce pork 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.380
 with the passage of time they become obese 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.520
 they develop hypercholesterolemia 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.449
 and they become diabetics 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.179
 why our studies 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:15.379
 They shed light on the mechanisms responsible for diabetes obesity 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.489
 at the same time 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.479
 which enables 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.829
 provide new ways of treating these processes 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.979
 until now this group of researchers had demonstrated the full potential of 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.979
 Cardiotrophin-1 against acute liver damage 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:36.379
 but now they go much further can be converted with the help of the 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.289
 biotech biotech worthy company in an important tool against the 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.420
 obesity cholesterol 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.180
 and diabetes
