alright folks just wanted to do a quick
video<00:00:06.899> here<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.529> these<00:00:07.799> ultra<00:00:08.099> fire<00:00:08.250> batteries

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
video here on these ultra fire batteries

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.299 
video here on these ultra fire batteries
we're<00:00:09.059> going<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.240> do<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.719> milliamp<00:00:10.230> test<00:00:11.160> on

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
we're going to do a milliamp test on

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.379 
we're going to do a milliamp test on
these<00:00:11.429> batteries<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:11.969> find<00:00:12.090> out<00:00:12.210> what<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
these batteries and find out what the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.509 
these batteries and find out what the
true<00:00:12.540> capacity<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:13.200> I've<00:00:14.040> already<00:00:14.250> done<00:00:14.370> some

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
true capacity is I've already done some

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
true capacity is I've already done some
videos<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:14.790> these<00:00:15.210> being<00:00:15.599> less<00:00:16.109> than

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
videos about these being less than

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.710 
videos about these being less than
quality<00:00:16.680> batteries<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.400> about<00:00:18.119> them<00:00:18.300> being

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
quality batteries and about them being

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.140 
quality batteries and about them being
fake<00:00:19.080> or<00:00:19.260> counterfeit<00:00:19.680> batteries<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.910> anyhow

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
fake or counterfeit batteries so anyhow

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.359 
fake or counterfeit batteries so anyhow
when<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.689> picked<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:21.990> up<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.410> fox<00:00:22.949> novo

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
when I picked this up the fox novo

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
when I picked this up the fox novo
digital<00:00:23.850> charger<00:00:24.210> 4s<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.869> allows<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
digital charger 4s and allows you to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980 
digital charger 4s and allows you to
measure<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.310> capacity<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.000> battery<00:00:27.029> so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
measure the capacity of a battery so

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.089 
measure the capacity of a battery so
what<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> do<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.039> to

drop these in here sorry about that was
getting<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.559> pop<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.160> iPad<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:40.350> what<00:00:40.440> I'm

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
getting a pop up on my iPad so what I'm

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.389 
getting a pop up on my iPad so what I'm
going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.129> drop<00:00:41.250> these

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
going to do is I'm going to drop these

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.520 
going to do is I'm going to drop these
in<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.030> I'm<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> charge<00:00:43.170> them<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
in here and I'm going to charge them to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
in here and I'm going to charge them to
capacity<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> start<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
capacity and then I'm going to start the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.889 
capacity and then I'm going to start the
process<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:46.309> draining<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.940> capacity<00:00:48.780> out

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
process of draining all the capacity out

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.630 
process of draining all the capacity out
of<00:00:49.050> them<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.590> recharging<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
of them and then recharging and that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.600 
of them and then recharging and that
will<00:00:50.789> give<00:00:50.940> us<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:53.010> correct<00:00:53.340> milliamp

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
will give us the correct milliamp

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.240 
will give us the correct milliamp
capacity<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.629> batteries<00:00:57.980> keep<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.100> mind

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
capacity of these batteries keep in mind

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.990 
capacity of these batteries keep in mind
they're<00:00:59.399> marked<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.789> 3000<00:01:00.510> which<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.940> know<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
they're marked at 3000 which I know is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
they're marked at 3000 which I know is
not<00:01:03.090> true<00:01:05.750> alright<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:06.930> these<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.229> these<00:01:07.680> are

not true alright so these are these are

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.530 
not true alright so these are these are
charged<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.210> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
charged up so it's going to take a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
charged up so it's going to take a
little<00:01:09.750> while<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.830> we're<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> let<00:01:11.400> this
