 and then the friends of the lex because I already like 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.850
 carries a more mature relationship between 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.040
 well with their wives and everything then 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.260
 as they already get a bit to the 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.640
 monotony and álex then it is living as 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:28.240
 that a very father love very very very nice 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.570
 but as of dream is this nick and then 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.700
 She is a very extroverted girl very 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.050
 I like to talk and all the fences 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.060
 different then a couple can 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.680
 sales is more quiet super dedicated to 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.530
 work then do a great 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.780
 combination a good couple then 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.390
 that's a bit of sending friends 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.770
 of álex and well this álex just 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.360
 end a relationship at the beginning of the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.930
 good story to all those who 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.270
 I count because then that is basic x 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.430
 then it is then that the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.380
 new love story with this and then 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.790
 there we will see several things that are going to 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.650
 go through the story that does not 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.360
 I count a lot but they are more a story 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.600
 very beautiful 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.830
 different because then because of the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.590
 age differences that are being 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.200
 driving here for 37 years and almost things 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.500
 They are 20 years apart, because neither 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.050
 that 17 and this Álex of 27 years 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.760
 so I really liked this book and I 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.950
