00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.219 
driving it plenty room in the cargo bay
and<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:19.060> you'd<00:01:19.210> expect<00:01:19.600> plenty<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.900> room<00:01:20.110> in

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229

and as you'd expect plenty of room in
the<00:01:20.290> back<00:01:20.439> as<00:01:20.619> well<00:01:22.680> ok<00:01:23.680> let's<00:01:23.920> see<00:01:24.070> how<00:01:24.100> it

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
the back as well ok let's see how it

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
the back as well ok let's see how it
draws

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.760 

start<00:01:29.460> snow<00:01:29.670> isn't<00:01:29.820> easy

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.899 

so<00:01:33.770> what's<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.009> like<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.280> draw<00:01:34.460> in<00:01:34.640> an<00:01:34.729> ordinary

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
so what's it like to draw in an ordinary

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.679 
so what's it like to draw in an ordinary
road<00:01:35.270> that's<00:01:36.109> pretty<00:01:36.380> good<00:01:36.560> it's<00:01:37.399> smooth<00:01:37.759> it's

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
road that's pretty good it's smooth it's

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.539 
road that's pretty good it's smooth it's
comfortable<00:01:39.079> you<00:01:40.039> gotta<00:01:40.189> remember<00:01:40.340> you're

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
comfortable you gotta remember you're

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.399 
comfortable you gotta remember you're
still<00:01:40.609> driving<00:01:40.939> a<00:01:41.210> big<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.719> know<00:01:41.750> 2<00:01:42.140> ton

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
still driving a big you know 2 ton

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.469 
still driving a big you know 2 ton
vehicle<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.310> it's<00:01:43.460> not<00:01:43.549> like<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.759> car<00:01:44.119> you've

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
vehicle so it's not like a car you've

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.969 
vehicle so it's not like a car you've
got<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.689> remember<00:01:44.899> it's<00:01:45.229> probably<00:01:45.770> not<00:01:45.890> going

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
got to remember it's probably not going

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.859 
got to remember it's probably not going
to<00:01:46.039> stop<00:01:46.130> quite<00:01:46.490> as<00:01:46.609> well<00:01:46.759> as<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:46.939> car<00:01:47.210> certainly

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
to stop quite as well as a car certainly

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.440 
to stop quite as well as a car certainly
doesn't<00:01:48.319> handle<00:01:48.649> like<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:48.829> car<00:01:49.159> but<00:01:50.090> all<00:01:50.209> in<00:01:50.360> all

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
doesn't handle like a car but all in all

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.419 
doesn't handle like a car but all in all
I<00:01:50.750> mean<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.439> can<00:01:51.590> live<00:01:51.740> with<00:01:51.860> these<00:01:52.009> every<00:01:52.280> day

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
I mean you can live with these every day

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.760 
I mean you can live with these every day
if<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.729> decide<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.090> get<00:01:53.329> one<00:01:53.539> I<00:01:53.750> mean<00:01:54.679> this

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
if you decide to get one I mean this

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
one's 14 years old and it still draws

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.190 
one's 14 years old and it still draws
pretty<00:01:56.659> good<00:01:57.909> don't<00:01:58.909> be<00:01:59.030> fooled<00:01:59.270> but<00:01:59.479> by<00:02:00.020> its

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
pretty good don't be fooled but by its

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.630 
pretty good don't be fooled but by its
softness<00:02:00.530> on<00:02:00.709> the<00:02:00.859> road<00:02:01.039> because<00:02:01.369> these<00:02:01.490> are

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
softness on the road because these are

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.099 
softness on the road because these are

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.360 

so<00:03:57.140> we're<00:03:57.290> doing<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.590> hundred<00:03:57.890> kilometres<00:03:58.280> an

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370

so we're doing a hundred kilometres an
hour<00:03:58.459> now<00:03:58.989> it's<00:03:59.989> still<00:04:00.170> fairly<00:04:00.469> quiet<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:01.099> can

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
hour now it's still fairly quiet I can

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.099 
hour now it's still fairly quiet I can
