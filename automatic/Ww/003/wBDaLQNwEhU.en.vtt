00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.129
 here it is a question of reminding you of the 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.309
 semi conservative replications of dna 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.830
 so I'm leaving here with DNA molecule 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.119
 made of two chains of brown is called 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.130
 often by catenary there are two chains 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.080
 with complementarity of nucleotides 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.880
 or nitrogen bases you know that the 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.519
 thymine is complementary to adenine 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.519
 and that guanine is complementary to 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.839
 the cytosine I have my dna molecule 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.930
 two-channel 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:41.049
 we will have to duplicate it 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.750
 to do this we will have locally a 

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:45.549
 opening of these two chains that make 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.839
 intervene that involves this 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:48.820
 opening a number of enzymes 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.820
 who are not on the program including 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.860
 names elika this topo iso meraz etc do 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.290
 do not hold that we'll say a complex 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.739
 six years in ssii matic and so this 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.699
 set of angina will come open the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.589
 DNA molecule 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.210
 the two strands of future separated them 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.310
 so his request obviously a lot 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.020
 of energy especially that you had seen in 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.299
 second you have dna molecule 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.520
 it is made of two strands rolled on 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.979
 talk about doubling list so imagine 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.659
 rolled out locally this double helix 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:22.090
 it requires a lot of energy 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:25.090
 Briefly it opens its two strands and 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.670
 the core we have some naked claude 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.219
 a few more free nucleotides that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.670
 will come by complementarity to fix themselves 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.770
 facing the big matrix so my in 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.170
 red it is mont brown mayor montbrun 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.939
 matrix and in blue it's brown 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.729
 neoformed that is going to be being 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.439
 created by this enzymatic complex 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.350
 so you may have seen dna 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.179
 polymerase 7 it's not a single aden 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.770
 polymerase there are several but 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.579
 polymerase she goes this enzyme 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.109
 to make DNA and so we advance 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.109
 to finally get 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.689
 a replication of the dna you see here 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.899
 I had a single DNA molecule here 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.090
 have two then there we are in a stadium 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.650
 interphase laden is not visible in 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.110
 optical microscopy we talk about 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.410
 chromatin but this add-on when he goes 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.319
 to compact in pro phase during 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.940
 mitosis we will see the chromosomes with 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.800
 both their chromatic and you understand 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.050
 why my two chromatic here are 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.269
 well sisters they are rigorously 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.799
 identical and we're talking about a replication 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.110
 semi conservative because we keep one of the 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.730
 two strands matrix to copy to 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.680
 the identical are complementary 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.959
 thanks to the complementarity of 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.750
 nucleotides or nitrogen bases if I have 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.299
 a I have in front I have a cd wanning 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.799
 cytosine and if I have an ace opposite I 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.880
 finally a tea finally replication 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.000
 the entire DNA molecule and 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.380
 duplicated and they remain hooked to 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.930
 level of an area called the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.900
 center to the mayor that you also saw so 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.820
 if I resume with a graph 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.870
 the evolution of the quantity ofadadren 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.350
 of a cell cycle 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.600
 we have a phase I have a g1 it's for gap 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.109
 of times a word or quotation marks it 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.130
 nothing happens from a point of view 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.630
 amount of DNA it is obviously 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.090
 a lot of things a point of view 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.329
 transcription but here I do not duplicate 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.329
 not the dna face g1 only one chromatin 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.359
 by chromatin if you want then the phase 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.790
 ss for synthesis the dna that corresponds to 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.739
 phase two aftershocks aftershocks 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.079
 is relative to the dna so I had a 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.359
 shelter amount withdrawn from a ua and I 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.910
 double to two and then 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.310
 again a g2 latency before 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.069
 to get to the mitosis I remind you in 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.620
 pro phase of mythos you have chrome to 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.750
 this chromosome to 2 chromate id these two 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.359
 pros mathide were allowed by the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.100
 semi-conservative replication in phase s 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.790
 your dna 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.739
 these are the terms of replication 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.739
 semi conservative DNA
