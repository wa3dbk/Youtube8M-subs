00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.700 

there's<00:00:46.539> some<00:00:46.750> ringing<00:00:46.930> on<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.230> top<00:00:47.440> trace

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
there's some ringing on the top trace

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.860 
there's some ringing on the top trace
but<00:00:47.920> it's<00:00:48.039> nothing<00:00:48.309> too<00:00:48.489> bad<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:49.359> does<00:00:49.629> dip

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
but it's nothing too bad it does dip

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.369 
but it's nothing too bad it does dip
below<00:00:50.399> full<00:00:51.399> saturation<00:00:51.670> voltage<00:00:52.210> but<00:00:53.110> it

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
below full saturation voltage but it

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.200 
below full saturation voltage but it
doesn't<00:00:53.800> really<00:00:53.890> matter<00:00:54.100> this<00:00:54.489> masa<00:00:55.000> is

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
doesn't really matter this masa is

doesn't really matter this masa is
running<00:00:55.449> cool<00:00:55.629> and<00:00:55.809> it's<00:00:55.930> not<00:00:56.110> complaining

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
running cool and it's not complaining

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.040 
running cool and it's not complaining
you<00:00:57.879> can<00:00:58.000> see<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.149> little<00:00:58.300> under<00:00:58.719> shooting<00:00:58.989> on

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
you can see a little under shooting on

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.869 
you can see a little under shooting on
the<00:00:59.140> bottom<00:00:59.440> but<00:00:59.739> again<00:01:00.070> it's<00:01:00.489> just<00:01:00.640> from

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
the bottom but again it's just from

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.539 
the bottom but again it's just from
sloppy<00:01:01.860> throwing<00:01:02.860> together<00:01:02.979> kind<00:01:03.309> of<00:01:03.399> thing

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
sloppy throwing together kind of thing

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.730 
sloppy throwing together kind of thing
nothing<00:01:04.149> to<00:01:04.239> worry<00:01:04.390> about<00:01:04.710> basically<00:01:05.710> a

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
nothing to worry about basically a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
decent way for me not once the bottom

then<00:01:51.610> you're<00:01:51.729> putting<00:01:52.030> in<00:01:52.209> from<00:01:52.420> your<00:01:52.539> driver

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
then you're putting in from your driver

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.139 
then you're putting in from your driver
this<00:01:53.560> driver<00:01:53.830> is<00:01:54.009> inputting<00:01:54.399> about<00:01:54.580> 12<00:01:54.819> volts

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:01.629

bolt<00:02:01.810> kick<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:03.039> 90<00:02:03.489> volts<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:03.910> what<00:02:04.060> gives

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
bolt kick that 90 volts is what gives

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.830 
bolt kick that 90 volts is what gives
you<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.450> high<00:02:04.629> voltage<00:02:04.660> on<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.140> output

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you the high voltage on the output

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.510 
you the high voltage on the output
suggests<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.959> much<00:02:08.289> higher<00:02:08.590> primary<00:02:09.250> voltage

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
suggests a much higher primary voltage

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.550 
suggests a much higher primary voltage
yet<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.509> much<00:02:10.660> higher<00:02:10.810> secondary<00:02:11.319> voltage

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
yet a much higher secondary voltage

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.350 
yet a much higher secondary voltage
instead<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.610> what<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.790> would<00:02:12.910> normally<00:02:13.000> get

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
instead of what you would normally get

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.010 
instead of what you would normally get
which<00:02:13.930> would<00:02:14.080> be<00:02:14.170> rather<00:02:14.349> low<00:02:14.590> power

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.900 

so<00:02:19.020> by<00:02:19.170> using<00:02:19.230> flyback<00:02:19.920> topology<00:02:20.310> instead<00:02:20.820> of

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
so by using flyback topology instead of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.200 
so by using flyback topology instead of
CBS<00:02:21.390> or<00:02:21.690> half<00:02:22.530> bridge<00:02:22.830> or<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> bridge<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:24.030> get<00:02:24.180> a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
CBS or half bridge or a bridge you get a

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.330 
CBS or half bridge or a bridge you get a

input<00:05:04.270> of<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:04.870> inverter<00:05:05.830> chip<00:05:07.170> it's<00:05:08.170> only<00:05:08.320> one

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
input of the inverter chip it's only one

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.930 
input of the inverter chip it's only one
lead<00:05:08.770> by<00:05:08.980> the<00:05:09.040> way<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.400> second<00:05:09.730> lead<00:05:09.820> is

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
lead by the way the second lead is

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.560 
lead by the way the second lead is
simply<00:05:10.240> soldered<00:05:10.600> into<00:05:10.720> an<00:05:10.900> empty<00:05:11.080> pad<00:05:12.090> if<00:05:13.090> you

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
simply soldered into an empty pad if you

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.820 
simply soldered into an empty pad if you
were<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.750> start<00:05:13.960> out<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.200> ground<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:14.680> kind<00:05:14.800> of

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
were to start out to ground it kind of

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.140 
were to start out to ground it kind of
pulls<00:05:15.040> the<00:05:15.220> whole<00:05:15.370> thing<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.730> ground<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.120> the

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
pulls the whole thing to ground to the

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.810 
pulls the whole thing to ground to the
low<00:05:16.390> impedance<00:05:16.690> of<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.460> feedback<00:05:18.460> whining

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
low impedance of the feedback whining

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.580 
low impedance of the feedback whining
and<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.660> you<00:05:19.930> don't<00:05:20.080> really<00:05:20.260> get<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.500> good

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
and you you don't really get a good

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.500 
and you you don't really get a good
signal<00:05:20.800> out<00:05:21.040> of<00:05:21.160> it<00:05:21.250> it's<00:05:21.730> not<00:05:21.940> looking<00:05:22.300> for

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
signal out of it it's not looking for

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.270 
signal out of it it's not looking for
more<00:05:22.690> than<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.930> couple<00:05:23.050> micro<00:05:23.470> amps<00:05:23.800> so<00:05:24.070> it'll

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
more than a couple micro amps so it'll

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.830 
more than a couple micro amps so it'll
get<00:05:24.430> that<00:05:24.610> just<00:05:24.850> from<00:05:25.060> capacitive<00:05:25.630> coupling

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
get that just from capacitive coupling

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.960 
get that just from capacitive coupling
anyway<00:05:29.190> there<00:05:30.190> you<00:05:30.280> go<00:05:30.840> fly<00:05:31.840> backs<00:05:32.050> explain

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
anyway there you go fly backs explain

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.810 
anyway there you go fly backs explain

small voltage in from your driver get a

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.940 
small voltage in from your driver get a

large inductive kick out when your

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.950 
large inductive kick out when your

driver is currently in the off that's

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.900 
driver is currently in the off that's
the<00:05:41.200> off<00:05:42.040> phase<00:05:42.550> huh

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
the off phase huh

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.480 
the off phase huh
which<00:05:44.510> then<00:05:44.750> gives<00:05:45.290> you<00:05:45.470> a<00:05:45.500> large<00:05:45.920> output<00:05:46.280> on

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
which then gives you a large output on

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.780 
which then gives you a large output on

your secondary hope that cleared things

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.600 
your secondary hope that cleared things
up<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.150> you<00:05:50.240> enjoyed<00:05:50.480> it
