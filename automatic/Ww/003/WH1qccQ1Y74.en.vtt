 I bought a guitar of about another 10,000 yen When you go the other all the time slurping

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:28.630

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:36.040
 I'm taking the person who gets this information and then gets close to the person who suits me 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:39.910
 Because mart is a beginner, it is a reason why I can not say it naturally. 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.060

 There was as much as possible to your budget because I well that it will 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.830
 We recommend that you pick the guitar 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:09.440
 After that , it might be good to buy that high during the loan though 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:14.810
 First of all, for now 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:18.050
 I bought an affordable guitar and practiced, and then I can play it to some extent 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:23.430
