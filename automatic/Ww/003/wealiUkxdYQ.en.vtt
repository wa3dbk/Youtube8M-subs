episode was so fun doing a weird board

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.189 
episode was so fun doing a weird board
that<00:00:14.309> was<00:00:14.400> really<00:00:14.670> strange<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.420> many<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.929> you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
reached out to say that you like the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.939 
reached out to say that you like the
idea<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.720> doing<00:00:18.869> more<00:00:19.170> boards<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.710> differ

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
idea of doing more boards that differ

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.779 
idea of doing more boards that differ
from<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.279> norm

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
from the norm

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.460

so<00:00:20.939> today's<00:00:21.240> shred<00:00:21.600> nation<00:00:22.050> we're<00:00:22.199> getting

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
so today's shred nation we're getting

so today's shred nation we're getting
strange<00:00:22.920> again<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.699> first<00:00:23.850> thing<00:00:24.090> that

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
strange again the first thing that

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.790 
strange again the first thing that
struck<00:00:24.449> me<00:00:24.660> about<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.050> shape<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.560> how<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
struck me about this shape was how the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
struck me about this shape was how the
foil<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> surfboard<00:00:27.060> back<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.230> the

foil of the surfboard back here in the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.830 
foil of the surfboard back here in the
tail<00:00:28.710> almost<00:00:29.070> looks<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.119> nose<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.779> a

that we usually discuss on shred show in
fact<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.070> seems<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.460> most<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.239> on

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
fact it seems like most of what we do on

shred<00:00:45.690> show<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.200> centered<00:00:46.590> around<00:00:46.649> boards

the 12 inch mark right here this comes

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.440 
the 12 inch mark right here this comes
in<00:02:40.440> at<00:02:40.560> about<00:02:40.650> an<00:02:40.890> inch<00:02:41.069> narrower<00:02:41.760> than<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.209> mini

mail<00:02:42.690> nose<00:02:42.989> again<00:02:43.650> because<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> outline

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
mail nose again because of the outline

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.059 
mail nose again because of the outline
curve<00:02:45.269> increasing<00:02:46.140> more<00:02:46.319> towards<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.890> nose

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
curve increasing more towards the nose

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.190 
curve increasing more towards the nose
now<00:02:47.489> looking<00:02:47.790> at<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> foil<00:02:48.299> in<00:02:48.569> this<00:02:48.720> shape<00:02:48.989> we

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
now looking at the foil in this shape we

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.530 
now looking at the foil in this shape we
can<00:02:49.230> see<00:02:49.620> how<00:02:49.830> quickly<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.549> board<00:02:50.819> thins<00:02:51.269> out

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
can see how quickly the board thins out

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.559 
can see how quickly the board thins out
in<00:02:52.080> both<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.650> nose<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.340> especially<00:02:54.030> back

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
in both the nose and especially back

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.720 
in both the nose and especially back
there<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.110> tail<00:02:55.380> most<00:02:55.830> interestingly<00:02:56.160> you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
there in the tail most interestingly you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.479 
there in the tail most interestingly you
can<00:02:56.910> see<00:02:57.120> how<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.720> quickly<00:02:58.130> decreasing<00:02:59.130> foil

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
can see how that quickly decreasing foil

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.490 
can see how that quickly decreasing foil
as<00:02:59.819> it<00:02:59.970> becomes<00:03:00.239> thinner<00:03:00.599> is<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.170> helped

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
as it becomes thinner is really helped

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.130 
as it becomes thinner is really helped
along<00:03:01.769> by<00:03:01.830> how<00:03:02.340> aggressively<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.330> rocker<00:03:03.750> in

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
along by how aggressively that rocker in

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.650 
along by how aggressively that rocker in
the<00:03:04.170> tail<00:03:04.760> skyrockets<00:03:05.760> upwards<00:03:06.299> okay<00:03:06.540> I'm

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
the tail skyrockets upwards okay I'm

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.000 
the tail skyrockets upwards okay I'm
getting<00:03:06.750> carried<00:03:07.079> away<00:03:07.170> with<00:03:07.290> myself<00:03:07.620> what

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
getting carried away with myself what

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.979 
getting carried away with myself what
I'm<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.340> saying<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.299> foil<00:03:09.720> is

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
I'm really saying is that the foil is

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.530 
I'm really saying is that the foil is
obviously<00:03:10.560> thinning<00:03:11.160> out<00:03:11.280> very<00:03:11.940> extremely

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
obviously thinning out very extremely

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.599 
obviously thinning out very extremely
and<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:12.989> can<00:03:13.140> see<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.530> as<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.950> rocker<00:03:14.190> curve

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
and you can see that as the rocker curve

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.900 
and you can see that as the rocker curve
is<00:03:14.910> angling<00:03:15.480> up<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.470> by<00:03:16.769> its<00:03:16.980> nature<00:03:17.100> making

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
is angling up it is by its nature making

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.390 
is angling up it is by its nature making
the<00:03:18.180> foil<00:03:18.480> more<00:03:18.840> thin<00:03:19.230> up<00:03:19.500> close<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.190> also

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400

see that this board has quite a bit of

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.199 
see that this board has quite a bit of
deck<00:03:22.769> rocker<00:03:23.130> really<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.670> about<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.000> last

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
three to six inches or so you can

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.520 
three to six inches or so you can
actually<00:03:26.820> see<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.329> deck<00:03:27.690> curving<00:03:28.350> up

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
actually see the deck curving up

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
creating its own rocker it's not just

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.900 
creating its own rocker it's not just
rocker<00:03:31.350> curve<00:03:31.709> happening<00:03:32.190> from<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.519> bottom

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
of the board you can imagine really

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.590 
of the board you can imagine really
easily<00:03:34.920> what<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.459> does<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.209> gives<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.569> a

easily what this does it gives you a

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.990 
easily what this does it gives you a

probably likely find that you can catch
waves<00:06:43.360> and<00:06:43.720> get<00:06:43.870> to<00:06:44.020> your<00:06:44.139> feet<00:06:44.350> just<00:06:44.680> as

waves and get to your feet just as

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.520 
waves and get to your feet just as
easily<00:06:45.160> in<00:06:45.669> junk<00:06:46.060> waves<00:06:46.330> as<00:06:46.720> you<00:06:47.020> could<00:06:47.290> with

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
easily in junk waves as you could with

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.530 
easily in junk waves as you could with
the<00:06:47.680> mini<00:06:47.860> Mel<00:06:48.130> however<00:06:48.550> the<00:06:48.760> refinements<00:06:49.419> in

the mini Mel however the refinements in

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.180 
the mini Mel however the refinements in
this<00:06:49.690> shape<00:06:49.960> would<00:06:50.200> probably<00:06:50.650> let<00:06:50.800> you<00:06:50.860> hang

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
this shape would probably let you hang

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.860 
this shape would probably let you hang
back<00:06:51.220> in<00:06:51.640> the<00:06:51.730> pocket<00:06:52.150> more<00:06:52.330> with<00:06:52.570> a<00:06:52.600> bit<00:06:52.840> more

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
back in the pocket more with a bit more

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.020 
back in the pocket more with a bit more
control<00:06:53.380> to<00:06:53.500> look<00:06:53.830> at<00:06:53.950> sections<00:06:54.490> as<00:06:54.669> they<00:06:54.790> pop

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
control to look at sections as they pop

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.430 
control to look at sections as they pop
up<00:06:55.060> in<00:06:55.330> front<00:06:55.600> of<00:06:55.690> you<00:06:55.780> to<00:06:56.020> plan<00:06:56.230> out<00:06:56.410> your

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
up in front of you to plan out your

up in front of you to plan out your
options<00:06:56.740> for<00:06:57.280> different<00:06:57.400> maneuvers<00:06:58.090> that<00:06:58.270> you

options for different maneuvers that you

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.570 
options for different maneuvers that you
simply<00:06:58.750> wouldn't<00:06:58.990> have<00:06:59.200> access<00:06:59.740> to<00:06:59.980> on<00:07:00.280> a<00:07:00.310> mini

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
simply wouldn't have access to on a mini

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.159 
simply wouldn't have access to on a mini
map<00:07:00.790> lastly<00:07:01.300> I<00:07:01.330> think<00:07:01.390> this<00:07:01.690> would<00:07:01.840> be<00:07:01.930> fun<00:07:02.140> for

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
map lastly I think this would be fun for

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:03.990 
map lastly I think this would be fun for
anyone<00:07:02.530> who<00:07:02.800> wants<00:07:03.040> to<00:07:03.070> get<00:07:03.250> their<00:07:03.400> first<00:07:03.640> kind

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
anyone who wants to get their first kind

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000

of<00:07:04.060> short<00:07:04.390> board<00:07:04.660> feelings<00:07:05.260> after<00:07:05.770> learning

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
of short board feelings after learning

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.460 
of short board feelings after learning
on<00:07:06.370> a<00:07:06.430> longboard<00:07:07.180> or<00:07:07.480> a<00:07:07.510> mini<00:07:07.870> Mel<00:07:08.080> I<00:07:08.290> think

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
on a longboard or a mini Mel I think

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.900 
on a longboard or a mini Mel I think
you'd<00:07:08.590> also<00:07:08.710> enjoy<00:07:09.100> this<00:07:09.310> if<00:07:09.490> you<00:07:09.580> wanted<00:07:09.820> a
