00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.410
 hello fellow youtube people today 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.870
 I'm here to talk about the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.600
 Spinosaurus controversy 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.480
 spinosaurus was a carnivorous dinosaur 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.279
 who lived in north africa does in 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.930
 312 and 97 million years its authentic 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.020
 size was not known until well done 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.090
 little this dinosaur jumped to fame in 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.329
 2001 for his appearance in the film 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.390
 Jurassic park 3 that unlike 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.640
 its two predecessors 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.220
 they belonged to the genre of science 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.800
 fiction this is limited to being a 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.350
 adventure 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.329
 but here we will talk about spinosaurus and 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.329
 of the blunder that they committed in the 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.070
 movie with this animal to start the 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.149
 idea to include it in the movie was the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.310
 paleontologist jack horner he decided that 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.500
 it was time to get a new predator 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.410
 I had observed that in both films 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.470
 previous the tyrannosaur had been the 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.010
 main predator and thought it was already 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.620
 When I replace it, I look for a 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.650
 dinosaur that could be a rival or 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.530
 even greater 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.500
 and included it in the movie and this 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.750
 it would be fine if it were not because 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.970
 replaced in totally and the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.880
 tyrannosaurus is the dino on the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.820
 a lot of people's favorite is really 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.700
 get out of the way to the greatest danger of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.060
 the two previous films but one 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.370
 pretty painful way imagines is like 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.620
 yes in the original trilogy of star wars 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.020
 darth vader who had been the enemy 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.750
 main in Star Wars and 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.850
 the empire strikes back assassinated 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.160
 for a more powerful yes, just start 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.320
 the return of the jedi would have been very 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.619
 disappointing no, that's what happens 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.290
 in jurassic park 3 he spinosaurus 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.590
 his presence is there, but that 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.630
 arrive and be charged to the greatest danger of 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.750
 the previous films so suddenly 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.470
 it is annoying it is quite annoying 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.270
 but hey this this is in terms of what 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.510
 emotional now I'm going to get into what 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.510
 scientific 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.770
 I'm going to analyze other aspects of these 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.460
 animals of tiranosaurus and 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.740
 spinosaurus in the movie according to horner 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.750
 his theory is that the tyrannosaurus was 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.650
 scavenger thing that I can not believe 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.970
 but good is your theory is respectable 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.560
 although it is not very likely 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.050
 and spinosaurus was definitely a predator 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.120
 ok is your theory now I'm going to say 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.150
 because I do not think in the movie 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.220
 work according to him in the movie the 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.860
 tyrannosaurus acts like a scavenger is 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.480
 if I'm not wrong and I'm not going to do it 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.230
 because I've seen the movie several times 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.110
 Sometimes the tyrannosaurus chases the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.940
 human beings and by eating them until 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.760
 faces a spinosaurus that is a 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.700
 pretty big dinosaur to you 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.000
 it looks like a scavenger behavior to 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.990
 me certainly not according to horner 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.340
 spinosaurus behaves like a 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.850
 true predator someone who 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.660
 kill for surviving 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.110
 I see him the animal that by the way is 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.370
 very well created digitally can that 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.740
 have a scene where you notice a 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.050
 little the computer but in general 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.020
 It's very well done but I see the 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.730
 animal and does not have a very behavior 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.700
 real the whole movie is passed 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.990
 chasing humans seriously this 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.970
 it is the behavior of a great 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.660
 predator over does not eat a donut 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.090
 they eat kills 12 at the beginning and then already 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.440
 is the whole movie chasing the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.960
 the rest 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.000
 I do not think it's a great behavior 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.190
 predator besides having others 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.210
 So big dinosaurs have coritos 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.000
 auroux has to sauro what fuzz and not the 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.800
 bent on humans this is what I find 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.739
 quite weird that's the behavior 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.160
 of a predator according to jack horner 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.670
 it seems that if now I want to analyze the 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.800
 jaws of the two we see that nothing else 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.930
 start the fight the tyrannosaurus will 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.120
 takes a bite to the spinosaurus in the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.420
 neck of that bite would have killed him 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.970
 already and I do not say it because I like more the 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.550
 t-rex would not have killed him because he has 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.630
 a lot stronger teeth is a lot 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:47.610
 sharper has predator teeth 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:51.220
 they are 15 cm teeth with saw 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.920
 on the edges and they put a lot 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.080
 and with a mouthful like that 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.520
 those jaws had strength to 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.700
 start more than 100 kilos of a bite 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.290
 I would have killed him it is true that espinoza 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.270
 bruce is bigger is a dinosaur more 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.000
 big I do not argue but the jaws 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.570
 of the t-rex are the strongest that 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.310
 they know in the animal kingdom alive or dead 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.940
 after that we do not know how but 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.470
 spinosaurus is saved from that bite 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.630
 the same is because the screenwriters gave them 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.670
 the good wins what or lists a 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.090
 curiosity the movie started to 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.050
 roll with 20 pages of script only 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:32.870
 see what we're doing there was no script 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.050
 but good after that spinosaurus 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.820
 Attacks the Terek gets a bite on 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.770
 the neck and also grabs it with the 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.020
 hands to grab it with your hands is 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.360
 a pretty sensible move because 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.840
 the jaws of the spinosaurus are not 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.120
 so strong but his claws yes so 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.450
 I could have beaten such a scratch 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.100
 time but with a bite in the neck not 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.830
 spinosaurus teeth are made 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.480
 to catch by elusive expresses 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.390
 are not 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.430
 to kill big animals in fact 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.620
 spinosaurus is more likely to 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.950
 despite its size as a scavenger 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.470
 I usually ate fish and things like that are 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.420
 well that's it's jaws made for 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.400
 Elusive dams not for the neck of 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.380
 a t rex that is quite more robust than 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.660
 the spinosaurus spinosaurus is more 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.710
 big but it's thinner 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.960
 and good according to the movie spinosaurus 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.210
 kills the rex yes that showdown 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.360
 it would have been real it would never have happened 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.520
 but good the things of the cinema the truth 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.340
 is that that fight caused enough 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.700
 debates between expert scientists in the 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.910
 topic 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:45.750
 and now the fans of this saga jurassic to 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:48.210
 we have the doubt of what is going to happen with 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.390
 spinosaurus in the logo of the fourth 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.790
 movie after jurassic world comes out the 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.670
 t-rex as main animal comes out 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:07:00.060
 tyrannosaurus but we say that 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:02.400
 going to happen with a spinosaurus will come out 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.980
 it will come out but it will not be the most 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:10.670
 important will be forgotten we do not know 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:13.640
 but I guess we'll know in June 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:16.070
 2015 a hug to everyone and tell me and 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.030
 Tell me what you think about this fight we 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.030
 we see the next video
