00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
you'll need one piece set is seven and a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.119 
you'll need one piece set is seven and a
quarter<00:00:43.680> by<00:00:44.010> 1/2<00:00:44.610> inch<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.379> one<00:00:46.379> piece<00:00:46.680> that

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
quarter by 1/2 inch and one piece that

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.850

sponged side down and push them into the
sticky<00:03:04.110> strip<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.739> stays<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.890> looks

when we're all done we're gonna have to

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.819 
when we're all done we're gonna have to
do<00:03:24.360> some<00:03:24.570> manipulating<00:03:25.079> of<00:03:25.170> those<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.680> those

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
do some manipulating of those of those

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.640 
do some manipulating of those of those
pieces<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.780> see<00:03:27.959> how<00:03:28.110> I'm<00:03:28.230> lining<00:03:28.410> that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
pieces but you see how I'm lining that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.280 
pieces but you see how I'm lining that
up<00:03:29.570> all<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:31.140> way<00:03:31.260> around<00:03:32.720> lining<00:03:33.720> up<00:03:33.810> my<00:03:33.930> tops

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
up all the way around lining up my tops

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.420 
up all the way around lining up my tops
and<00:03:34.650> then<00:03:34.980> these<00:03:35.430> two<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:37.860> is<00:03:38.010> right<00:03:38.190> so

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
and then these two and this is right so

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.949 
and then these two and this is right so
talk<00:03:38.610> about<00:03:38.670> manipulating<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.630> then<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.840> got

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
talk about manipulating so then you got

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.130 
talk about manipulating so then you got
to<00:03:40.049> kind<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.260> push<00:03:40.500> them<00:03:40.650> through<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:42.630> form<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
to kind of push them through to form the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.900 
to kind of push them through to form the
basket

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.540 

and<00:03:50.910> then<00:03:51.209> bring<00:03:51.420> those<00:03:51.600> together

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.059 

and<00:03:56.700> there's<00:03:56.880> your<00:03:57.000> basket<00:03:57.680> pretty<00:03:58.680> easy<00:03:58.890> to

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
and there's your basket pretty easy to

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:07.310 
and there's your basket pretty easy to
do<00:03:59.959> um<00:04:00.959> then<00:04:01.950> what<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.220> did<00:04:05.480> is<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.080> stuck<00:04:07.290> it

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
it down until I got it to the shape that

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.750 
it down until I got it to the shape that
I<00:04:12.060> wanted<00:04:12.330> to<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:13.010> then<00:04:14.010> on<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.400> one<00:04:14.459> I

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
it so on this one I cut out a circle

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.659 
it so on this one I cut out a circle
punch<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.650> I'll<00:04:19.709> tell<00:04:19.890> you<00:04:19.950> what<00:04:20.100> size<00:04:20.430> that
