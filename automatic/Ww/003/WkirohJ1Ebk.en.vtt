limits put this on of I don't suggest
you<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.159> put<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:55.090> on<00:02:55.420> because<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.439> what<00:02:56.680> is

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
you to put it on because it's what is

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.770 
you to put it on because it's what is
going<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.099> do<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.489> going<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.790> use<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.569> more

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
going to do is going to use the more

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.910 
going to do is going to use the more
memory<00:02:59.140> than<00:02:59.230> your<00:02:59.560> GPU<00:02:59.980> has<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.970> it's

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
memory than your GPU has so it's

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.849 
memory than your GPU has so it's
obviously<00:03:02.920> going<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.480> damage<00:03:04.480> your<00:03:04.739> GPU<00:03:05.739> or

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
obviously going to damage your GPU or

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.490 
obviously going to damage your GPU or
causing<00:03:06.730> blackouts<00:03:06.939> or<00:03:07.480> pressure<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.049> I<00:03:08.140> don't

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
causing blackouts or pressure so I don't

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.880

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
profit cut so as you can see when I

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.300 
profit cut so as you can see when I
select<00:03:33.909> the<00:03:34.000> population<00:03:34.480> variety<00:03:34.930> my<00:03:35.680> traffic

are<00:04:40.380> just<00:04:40.560> for<00:04:40.800> me<00:04:41.010> this<00:04:41.370> is<00:04:41.580> just<00:04:41.850> for<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.090> gtx

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
are just for me this is just for the gtx

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.580 
are just for me this is just for the gtx
750ti<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:44.580> may<00:04:44.940> work<00:04:45.210> for<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.690> GPUs<00:04:46.170> but<00:04:46.470> if

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
750ti it may work for the GPUs but if

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.290 
750ti it may work for the GPUs but if
you<00:04:46.710> have<00:04:46.890> more<00:04:47.100> memory<00:04:47.580> than<00:04:47.670> and

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
you have more memory than and

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.570 
you have more memory than and
suggestibility<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.350> traffic<00:04:50.100> settings<00:04:50.430> are

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
suggestibility the traffic settings are

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.150 
suggestibility the traffic settings are
very<00:04:50.820> high<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:52.080> can<00:04:52.290> play<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.710> game<00:04:52.890> very
