I'm gonna make sure that's white too so
we<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> keep<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.899> consistent<00:01:52.409> looking<00:01:52.920> on

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
we kind of keep it consistent looking on

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.030 
we kind of keep it consistent looking on
the<00:01:53.130> front<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.840> case<00:01:55.049> itself<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.799> all

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the front the case itself is all

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.160 
the front the case itself is all
aluminium<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.000> very<00:01:57.180> large<00:01:57.390> case<00:01:57.719> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
aluminium it's a very large case you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.600 
aluminium it's a very large case you
need<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.560> make<00:01:58.680> sure<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.009> either<00:01:59.100> fits<00:01:59.399> under

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
need to make sure it either fits under

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.010 
need to make sure it either fits under
your<00:01:59.759> desk<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.540> appropriate

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
size room to fit this in its gonna sit

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.130 
size room to fit this in its gonna sit
next<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:06.030> desk<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.750> won't<00:02:06.869> sit

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
next to my desk because it won't sit

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.639 
next to my desk because it won't sit
under<00:02:07.429> I've<00:02:08.429> put<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.929> casters<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
under I've put the the casters on the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.940 
under I've put the the casters on the
bottom<00:02:11.180> for<00:02:12.180> my<00:02:12.330> purposes<00:02:12.900> basically<00:02:13.230> because

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
my radiators that are going to sit along

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.720 
my radiators that are going to sit along
the<00:02:16.319> bottom<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.890> top<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.459> bottom

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
ones are going to actually be intakes so

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.650 
ones are going to actually be intakes so
I<00:02:20.129> need<00:02:20.400> some<00:02:20.550> space<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:21.090> there<00:02:21.300> in<00:02:21.420> order<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
I need some space in there in order to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.170 
I need some space in there in order to
get<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.620> air<00:02:22.739> flowing<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.849> just<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
get the the air flowing it's just the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.000 
get the the air flowing it's just the
back<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.510> case<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:25.140> think<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.500> talked<00:02:25.709> about<00:02:25.800> it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
back the case I think I talked about it

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.240 
back the case I think I talked about it
before<00:02:26.129> dual<00:02:26.670> power<00:02:26.910> supplies<00:02:27.590> fits<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.739> sr2

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
before dual power supplies fits the sr2

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.030 
before dual power supplies fits the sr2
there's<00:02:30.000> ten<00:02:30.300> slots<00:02:30.599> back<00:02:31.080> there<00:02:31.319> for<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> PC

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
there's ten slots back there for the PC

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.110 
there's ten slots back there for the PC
eyes<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:34.310> yeah<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.580> beautiful<00:02:35.910> case

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120

been painting things up those are the
four<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:43.019> 480<00:02:43.590> rads<00:02:43.890> with<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.090> Xigmatek

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
four to 480 rads with the Xigmatek

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.229 
four to 480 rads with the Xigmatek
crystal<00:02:46.290> blue<00:02:46.470> fans<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.069> those<00:02:47.220> will<00:02:47.370> be<00:02:47.400> led's

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
crystal blue fans so those will be led's

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.759 
crystal blue fans so those will be led's
led's<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.200> blue<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.709> then<00:02:50.580> inside<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> case

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
led's and blue and then inside the case

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.420 
led's and blue and then inside the case
again<00:02:53.030> basically<00:02:54.030> I'm<00:02:54.239> going<00:02:54.540> with<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:55.470> 360<00:02:56.340> at

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
again basically I'm going with a 360 at

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.610 
again basically I'm going with a 360 at
the<00:02:56.519> bottom<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.299> 480<00:02:57.750> at<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.049> top<00:02:58.290> and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
everything's going to be in a push-pull

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.080 
everything's going to be in a push-pull
