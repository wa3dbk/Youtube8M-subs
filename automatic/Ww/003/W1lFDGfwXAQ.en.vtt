starting<00:00:28.009> the<00:00:28.130> slide<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.489> we're<00:00:29.060> sliding<00:00:29.359> it

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
starting the slide and we're sliding it

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.770 
starting the slide and we're sliding it
all<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.810> way<00:00:29.929> around<00:00:30.519> which<00:00:31.519> is<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:32.300> motion

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
all the way around which is the motion

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.560 
all the way around which is the motion
of<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.050> car<00:00:33.290> but<00:00:33.649> at<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:33.980> same<00:00:34.220> time<00:00:34.570> we're

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
of the car but at the same time we're

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.140 
of the car but at the same time we're
going<00:00:35.870> to<00:00:35.930> disassemble<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.860> car<00:00:37.070> into<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
going to disassemble the car into the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.410 
going to disassemble the car into the
millions<00:00:38.990> of<00:00:39.260> paths<00:00:39.470> that<00:00:39.770> it<00:00:39.950> becomes<00:00:40.460> down

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
millions of paths that it becomes down

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.030 
millions of paths that it becomes down
to<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.630> bare<00:00:41.870> chassis<00:00:42.170> in<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.620> middle<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:42.980> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.650 
to a bare chassis in the middle of the
turn<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:43.670> we're<00:00:43.940> going<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.090> reassemble

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
turn and then we're going to reassemble

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.210 
turn and then we're going to reassemble
it<00:00:44.780> on<00:00:44.870> this<00:00:45.080> side<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:45.320> have<00:00:45.590> a<00:00:45.650> drive<00:00:45.950> away

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
it on this side and have a drive away

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.400 
it on this side and have a drive away
all<00:00:46.610> in<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.940> space<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:47.180> that<00:00:47.510> one<00:00:47.840> power

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
shot some live action high-speed passes

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.570 
shot some live action high-speed passes
at<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.149> hundred<00:01:02.570> twenty<00:01:02.930> frames<00:01:03.109> a<00:01:03.289> second<00:01:03.710> of<00:01:04.280> a

at a hundred twenty frames a second of a

at a hundred twenty frames a second of a
part<00:01:04.850> coming<00:01:05.089> in<00:01:05.299> doing<00:01:05.509> a<00:01:05.600> power<00:01:05.810> slide<00:01:06.140> the

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
part coming in doing a power slide the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.590 
part coming in doing a power slide the
first<00:01:06.890> pass<00:01:07.070> we<00:01:07.280> did<00:01:07.490> was<00:01:07.670> with<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.880> sedan<00:01:08.210> and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
first pass we did was with the sedan and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.630 
first pass we did was with the sedan and
then<00:01:09.140> we<00:01:09.200> did<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.530> few<00:01:09.680> other<00:01:09.830> second<00:01:10.220> passes

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
then we did a few other second passes

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.600 
then we did a few other second passes
with<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.270> wagon<00:01:11.690> these<00:01:12.170> marks<00:01:12.530> here<00:01:12.619> we've

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
with the wagon these marks here we've

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.270 
with the wagon these marks here we've
taken<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.270> live<00:01:14.570> action<00:01:14.780> plates<00:01:15.470> loader<00:01:16.070> them

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
taken the live action plates loader them

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.480 
taken the live action plates loader them
to<00:01:16.520> our<00:01:16.549> computer<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.740> plot<00:01:18.740> out<00:01:18.890> our<00:01:19.070> points

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
to our computer to plot out our points

to our computer to plot out our points
for<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.729> animation<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.960> these<00:01:21.110> little<00:01:21.649> dots

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
for the animation so these little dots

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.609 
for the animation so these little dots
here<00:01:22.220> basically<00:01:22.700> represent<00:01:23.479> one<00:01:23.899> frame<00:01:24.259> here

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
here basically represent one frame here

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.649 
here basically represent one frame here
we<00:01:24.740> have<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.920> very<00:01:25.220> scientific<00:01:25.580> method<00:01:26.420> of

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
we have a very scientific method of

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.779 
we have a very scientific method of
registering<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.259> car<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:28.369> little<00:01:28.610> laser

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
registering the car the little laser

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.160 
registering the car the little laser

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 so that distance

17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 so that distance
right<00:01:49.429> there<00:01:49.640> would<00:01:49.789> represent<00:01:50.090> 24<00:01:50.959> frames

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
right there would represent 24 frames

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.039 
right there would represent 24 frames
per<00:01:51.470> second<00:01:51.979> which<00:01:52.549> equals<00:01:53.149> one<00:01:53.390> second<00:01:53.990> of

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
per second which equals one second of

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.320 
per second which equals one second of

screen time with this process the car

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.660 
screen time with this process the car
can't<00:01:56.810> physically<00:01:57.200> drive<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.340> we've<00:01:58.489> had<00:01:58.520> to
