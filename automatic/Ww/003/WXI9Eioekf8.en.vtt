of bar ons this one here is a little

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840 
of bar ons this one here is a little
more<00:00:47.079> common<00:00:47.320> it's<00:00:48.190> most<00:00:48.370> likely<00:00:48.430> what<00:00:48.820> a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
more common it's most likely what a

inches in diameter it tends to be not
quite<00:00:53.859> as<00:00:54.190> expensive<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:55.390> it's<00:00:55.539> got<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.690> little

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
quite as expensive and it's got a little

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.630 
quite as expensive and it's got a little
bit<00:00:55.989> shallower<00:00:56.289> rim<00:00:56.559> than<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.160> drum<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:57.489> saw

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
me playing in the intro there this

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.619 
me playing in the intro there this
particular<00:00:59.890> one<00:01:00.219> was<00:01:00.519> the<00:01:00.760> what<00:01:01.269> was<00:01:01.359> actually

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
particular one was the what was actually

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.240 
particular one was the what was actually
the<00:01:01.719> first<00:01:01.870> one<00:01:02.079> I<00:01:02.109> ever<00:01:02.199> had<00:01:02.469> so<00:01:02.890> it's<00:01:03.039> a<00:01:03.129> good

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
the first one I ever had so it's a good

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.940 
the first one I ever had so it's a good
20<00:01:04.120> plus<00:01:04.300> years<00:01:04.510> old<00:01:04.750> but<00:01:04.960> it's<00:01:05.379> not<00:01:05.560> tunable

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
20 plus years old but it's not tunable

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.220 
20 plus years old but it's not tunable
and<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.640> have<00:01:06.790> removed<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.540> crossbars<00:01:07.990> in<00:01:08.080> the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
and I have removed the crossbars in the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.940 
and I have removed the crossbars in the
back<00:01:08.910> if<00:01:09.910> you<00:01:10.510> do<00:01:10.810> have<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.020> drum<00:01:11.260> that's<00:01:11.740> got

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
back if you do have a drum that's got

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.640 
back if you do have a drum that's got
crossbars<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:13.600> this<00:01:13.780> one<00:01:13.960> here<00:01:14.230> the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
crossbars like this one here the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.230 
crossbars like this one here the
important<00:01:15.040> thing<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.280> remember<00:01:15.340> is<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:15.880> you

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
important thing to remember is that you

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.630 
important thing to remember is that you
don't<00:01:16.420> hold<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.840> like<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.410> cross<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:18.070> actually

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
don't hold it like a cross you actually

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.700 
don't hold it like a cross you actually
turn<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:19.840> it's<00:01:19.960> like<00:01:20.050> an<00:01:20.170> X<00:01:20.380> and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
turn it so that it's like an X and

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.380 
turn it so that it's like an X and
that's<00:01:21.220> for<00:01:21.400> later<00:01:21.550> on<00:01:21.640> when<00:01:21.910> we<00:01:21.940> get<00:01:22.090> into

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
that's for later on when we get into

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.480 
that's for later on when we get into
some<00:01:22.570> more<00:01:22.660> advanced<00:01:22.960> playing<00:01:23.370> you'll<00:01:24.370> be

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
some more advanced playing you'll be

trough of the scan so I can make it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.990
