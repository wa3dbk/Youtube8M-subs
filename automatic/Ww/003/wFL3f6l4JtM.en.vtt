00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
works pretty well I know it's hard for

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:17.150 
works pretty well I know it's hard for
you<00:03:04.860> guys<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.069> hear<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.310> sound<00:03:05.549> quality

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.830 

and<00:03:18.160> what's<00:03:18.670> cool<00:03:18.880> about<00:03:18.940> these<00:03:19.180> guys<00:03:19.420> is<00:03:19.480> we

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
and what's cool about these guys is we

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.650 
and what's cool about these guys is we
do<00:03:19.990> have<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> separate<00:03:20.880> volume<00:03:21.880> knob<00:03:22.090> that's

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
do have a separate volume knob that's

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.140 
do have a separate volume knob that's
independent<00:03:23.410> from<00:03:23.650> this<00:03:23.830> volume<00:03:24.280> actually<00:03:24.760> so

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
independent from this volume actually so

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.970 
independent from this volume actually so
it<00:03:25.510> kind<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.810> gives<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.200> ability<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.650> give

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
it kind of gives you the ability to give

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.890 
it kind of gives you the ability to give
it<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.130> extra<00:03:27.400> boost<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.569> volume

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
it that extra boost of volume

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.780 
it that extra boost of volume
and<00:03:31.900> they<00:03:32.379> do<00:03:32.439> get<00:03:32.680> pretty<00:03:32.920> loud<00:03:33.069> and<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.400> don't

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
and they do get pretty loud and I don't

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.890 
and they do get pretty loud and I don't
even<00:03:33.879> have<00:03:33.970> them<00:03:34.209> turned<00:03:34.420> up<00:03:34.540> all<00:03:34.689> the<00:03:34.780> way

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
even have them turned up all the way

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.720 
even have them turned up all the way
just<00:03:35.409> simply<00:03:35.799> based<00:03:35.980> off<00:03:36.159> the<00:03:36.280> fact<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.579> it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
just simply based off the fact that it

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.920 
just simply based off the fact that it
would<00:03:36.849> be<00:03:37.000> hard<00:03:37.180> for<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.420> guys<00:03:37.629> to

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
would be hard for you guys to

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.869 
would be hard for you guys to
distinguish<00:03:38.920> how<00:03:39.069> loud<00:03:39.310> anything<00:03:39.700> was

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
distinguish how loud anything was

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.309 
distinguish how loud anything was
anyways<00:03:40.360> but<00:03:41.290> these<00:03:41.620> are<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.819> d<00:03:43.299> best<00:03:43.569> London

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
anyways but these are the d best London

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.949 
anyways but these are the d best London
bluetooth<00:03:45.010> speakers<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.450> mean<00:03:46.870> they're
