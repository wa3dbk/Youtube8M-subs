September<00:00:41.330> ok<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:41.750> this<00:00:42.350> will<00:00:42.530> be<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.740> change

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
September ok so this will be the change

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.000 
September ok so this will be the change
that<00:00:43.550> they'll<00:00:43.850> see<00:00:44.150> out<00:00:44.330> in<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.540> field<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:45.230> I

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
that they'll see out in the field and I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.680 
that they'll see out in the field and I
know<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.670> first<00:00:46.850> phone<00:00:47.090> call<00:00:47.120> is<00:00:47.390> going<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.600> be

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
know the first phone call is going to be

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.280 
know the first phone call is going to be
you<00:00:48.110> guys<00:00:48.260> forgot<00:00:48.680> one<00:00:48.980> of<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.100> filters<00:00:50.290> and

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
you guys forgot one of the filters and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.470 
you guys forgot one of the filters and
then<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:52.070> course<00:00:52.280> our<00:00:52.430> silver<00:00:52.880> can't<00:00:53.120> design

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
then of course our silver can't design

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.770 
then of course our silver can't design
that<00:00:53.690> we<00:00:53.810> have<00:00:54.640> reduces<00:00:55.640> friction

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
that we have reduces friction

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.230 
that we have reduces friction
well<00:00:57.290> consumption<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.240> virtually<00:00:59.240> nothing

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
well consumption is virtually nothing

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.950 
well consumption is virtually nothing
because<00:01:02.240> we<00:01:02.390> get<00:01:02.570> such<00:01:02.840> complete<00:01:03.140> combustion

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
because we get such complete combustion

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.560 
because we get such complete combustion
the<00:01:05.960> days<00:01:06.260> of<00:01:06.290> silk<00:01:07.010> in<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:07.280> oil<00:01:07.550> are<00:01:07.820> not<00:01:08.540> a

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the days of silk in the oil are not a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.100 
the days of silk in the oil are not a
problem<00:01:08.900> we're<00:01:09.470> talking<00:01:09.680> earlier<00:01:10.190> about<00:01:10.250> oil

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
problem we're talking earlier about oil

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.780 
problem we're talking earlier about oil
and<00:01:12.110> right<00:01:12.710> now<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.220> would<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:13.490> have<00:01:13.670> to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
and right now that would you have to

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.430 
and right now that would you have to
look<00:01:13.940> at<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.750> thing<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.320> we

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
look at and this is a thing that we

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.170 
look at and this is a thing that we
really<00:01:15.800> emphasize<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.550> how<00:01:16.670> well<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.940> truck

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
really emphasize to how well the truck

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.700 
really emphasize to how well the truck
owners<00:01:17.510> when<00:01:17.720> they're<00:01:17.840> doing<00:01:17.960> while<00:01:18.260> sampling

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
owners when they're doing while sampling

owners when they're doing while sampling
for<00:01:18.979> us<00:01:19.100> that<00:01:19.760> it's<00:01:20.119> not<00:01:20.360> common<00:01:21.050> in<00:01:21.320> your

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
for us that it's not common in your

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.320 
for us that it's not common in your
country<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.130> look<00:01:22.340> at<00:01:22.520> tan<00:01:22.820> which<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.119> the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
country to look at tan which is the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.530 
country to look at tan which is the
total<00:01:23.540> massive<00:01:24.140> moment<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.940> in<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.210> US

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
total massive moment and in the US

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.850 
total massive moment and in the US
they've<00:01:26.750> been<00:01:26.900> doing<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:27.290> for<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.530> few<00:01:27.619> years

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
they've been doing it for a few years

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.400 
they've been doing it for a few years
but<00:01:28.310> acid<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> byproduct<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.990> combustion

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
but acid is a byproduct of combustion

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.070 
but acid is a byproduct of combustion
and<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.770> diesel<00:01:31.160> engine<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:31.910> what<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.600> look<00:01:32.869> at

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
and a diesel engine so what you look at

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.960 
and a diesel engine so what you look at
is<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.500> look<00:01:33.680> at<00:01:33.770> your<00:01:33.830> total<00:01:34.100> base<00:01:34.400> number<00:01:34.820> up

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
is you look at your total base number up

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.540 
is you look at your total base number up
here<00:01:35.000> starts<00:01:35.540> your<00:01:36.380> tan<00:01:36.650> starts<00:01:37.100> down<00:01:37.310> here

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
here starts your tan starts down here

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.630 
here starts your tan starts down here
when<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.180> two<00:01:38.360> cross<00:01:39.070> that's<00:01:40.070> when<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:40.460> say

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
when the two cross that's when you say

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.450 
when the two cross that's when you say
okay<00:01:40.940> oil<00:01:41.300> is<00:01:41.479> done<00:01:41.690> as<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.770> reach<00:01:42.979> this<00:01:43.220> life

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
okay oil is done as you reach this life

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.230 
okay oil is done as you reach this life
so<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.450> better<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.110> oil<00:01:45.380> holes<00:01:46.039> that<00:01:46.940> took

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
so the better the oil holes that took

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.990 
so the better the oil holes that took
the<00:01:47.390> total<00:01:47.720> base<00:01:47.869> number<00:01:48.410> and<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.729> better

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
the total base number and the the better

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.350 
the total base number and the the better
the<00:01:50.420> additive<00:01:51.110> package<00:01:51.429> works<00:01:52.429> on<00:01:52.700> absorbing

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
the additive package works on absorbing

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
the additive package works on absorbing
the<00:01:53.479> acid<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.590> Walker<00:01:54.830> goes<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.479> it's<00:01:57.200> just

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the acid the Walker goes so it's just

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.910 
the acid the Walker goes so it's just
not<00:01:57.619> there<00:01:59.830> maybe<00:02:00.830> 50<00:02:01.340> life<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:03.500> guys<00:02:03.619> know

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
not there maybe 50 life you guys know

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.660 
not there maybe 50 life you guys know
what<00:02:04.100> these<00:02:04.280> 50<00:02:04.670> life<00:02:04.850> is<00:02:05.119> but<00:02:06.190> these<00:02:07.190> empty
