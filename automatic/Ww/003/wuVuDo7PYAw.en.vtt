00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
learn this trick you're going to learn

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.980 
learn this trick you're going to learn
it<00:01:38.649> off<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.920> end<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.429> Ledge<00:01:39.719> right<00:01:40.719> at<00:01:40.869> the

to pop yourself off of the ledge and be
able<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.749> land

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
able to land

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.109 
able to land
so<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.830> trick<00:02:07.040> at<00:02:07.190> first<00:02:07.460> feels<00:02:07.730> really

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
so this trick at first feels really

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.660 
so this trick at first feels really
weird<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.619> got<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.860> kind<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.100> be<00:02:10.220> balancing

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
weird so you got to kind of be balancing

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.370 
weird so you got to kind of be balancing
a<00:02:10.790> little<00:02:11.090> bit<00:02:11.210> on<00:02:11.330> your<00:02:11.510> toes<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:12.110> want<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.320> be

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
a little bit on your toes you want to be

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.440 
a little bit on your toes you want to be
on<00:02:12.470> this<00:02:12.680> side<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.250> board<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:14.210> that<00:02:14.240> you

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
on this side of the board so that you

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.240 
on this side of the board so that you
have<00:02:14.660> enough<00:02:14.930> force<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.590> be<00:02:15.800> able<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.980> nudge

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
have enough force to be able to nudge

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.270 
have enough force to be able to nudge
yourself<00:02:16.730> back<00:02:17.060> off<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.780> ledge<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.380> don't

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
yourself back off of the ledge you don't

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.940 
yourself back off of the ledge you don't
even<00:02:19.430> have<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.970> pop<00:02:20.240> but<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.110> can<00:02:21.620> just

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
even have to pop but you can just

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.040 
even have to pop but you can just
accomplish<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:22.940> nudging<00:02:23.240> yourself<00:02:23.780> back

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
accomplish just nudging yourself back

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.440 
accomplish just nudging yourself back
and<00:02:24.470> then<00:02:25.010> being<00:02:25.190> able<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.490> land<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.090> pull<00:02:26.300> off

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
and then being able to land and pull off

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.750 
and then being able to land and pull off
the<00:02:26.600> ledge<00:02:26.780> correctly<00:02:27.460> but<00:02:28.460> this<00:02:28.580> is

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
the ledge correctly but this is

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.920 
the ledge correctly but this is
definitely<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.270> part<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.690> trick<00:02:29.900> that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
definitely the part of the trick that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.650 
definitely the part of the trick that
you<00:02:30.170> need<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.410> get<00:02:30.560> down<00:02:30.710> is<00:02:31.510> bouncing<00:02:32.510> like

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
you need to get down is bouncing like

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.830 
you need to get down is bouncing like
this<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.200> then<00:02:33.550> popping<00:02:34.550> off<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.450> then<00:02:35.720> you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
this and then popping off and then you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:03:09.869 
this and then popping off and then you
can<00:02:35.870> land<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.440> roll<00:02:36.560> away

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.759 

so<00:03:10.879> you're<00:03:11.360> going<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.540> approach<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.230> ledge<00:03:12.470> at

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
so you're going to approach the ledge at

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.740 
so you're going to approach the ledge at
a<00:03:12.799> slight<00:03:13.220> angle<00:03:13.489> with<00:03:14.060> your<00:03:14.239> feet<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
a slight angle with your feet in the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.240 
a slight angle with your feet in the
Ollie<00:03:14.900> position<00:03:16.269> pop<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.510> tail<00:03:18.010> slide<00:03:19.010> your

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
front foot goes up into the ollie

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.949 
front foot goes up into the ollie
while<00:03:25.220> also<00:03:25.489> accomplishing<00:03:26.299> landing<00:03:26.810> with

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
while also accomplishing landing with

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.440

going to want to land on the ledge with

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.750 
going to want to land on the ledge with
this<00:03:32.480> part<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.900> your<00:03:32.989> truck<00:03:33.290> grinding<00:03:33.859> so<00:03:34.700> you

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
this part of your truck grinding so you

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.460 
this part of your truck grinding so you
want<00:03:34.909> to<00:03:35.000> be<00:03:35.090> right<00:03:35.480> here<00:03:35.840> with<00:03:36.109> your<00:03:36.290> wheels

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
slammed up tight against it so in that

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.259 
slammed up tight against it so in that
position<00:03:39.769> then<00:03:40.730> you're<00:03:40.879> going<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.060> grind

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
position then you're going to grind

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.830

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
be leaning too far back you're going to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.890 
be leaning too far back you're going to
go<00:03:50.989> into<00:03:51.200> 50/50<00:03:51.940> if<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.120> have<00:03:53.299> your<00:03:53.480> nose<00:03:53.629> down

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
grinding in this position right here now

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.619 
grinding in this position right here now
this<00:04:01.069> is<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.430> part<00:04:01.639> where<00:04:01.790> this<00:04:01.909> trick<00:04:02.150> begins

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
this is the part where this trick begins

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.629 
this is the part where this trick begins
to<00:04:02.840> get<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:03.019> little<00:04:03.319> difficult<00:04:03.829> is<00:04:04.010> actually

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
to get a little difficult is actually

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.149 
to get a little difficult is actually
popping<00:04:04.970> out<00:04:05.299> get<00:04:06.139> into<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.739> nose<00:04:06.920> grind

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
popping out get into the nose grind

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.460 
popping out get into the nose grind
position<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.879> have<00:04:08.569> your<00:04:08.810> balance<00:04:09.170> really
