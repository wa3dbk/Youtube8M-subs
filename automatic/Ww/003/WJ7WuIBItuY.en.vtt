cooker so I highly recommend investing

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.120 
cooker so I highly recommend investing
in<00:00:30.110> one<00:00:30.230> of<00:00:30.320> those<00:00:30.439> if<00:00:30.739> you're<00:00:30.829> going<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.070> be

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.009 
certainly speeds up the process
considerably<00:00:36.429> and<00:00:37.429> they<00:00:37.609> go<00:00:37.789> really<00:00:38.239> really

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
considerably and they go really really
