00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
apparently I did a boo-boo and managed

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.100 
apparently I did a boo-boo and managed
to<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> bit<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.700> water<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.090> there<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to get a bit of water in there in one of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.789 
to get a bit of water in there in one of
the<00:02:04.290> new<00:02:04.439> growths<00:02:05.270> it's<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> lot<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.439> just

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
the new growths it's not a lot it's just

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.499 
the new growths it's not a lot it's just
I<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.220> drop<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.910> very<00:02:09.149> very<00:02:09.239> small

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
I think a drop with a very very small

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
I think a drop with a very very small
drop<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.379> was<00:02:10.530> enough<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> kill<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
drop it was enough to kill it so the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790 
drop it was enough to kill it so the
sicker<00:02:12.239> an<00:02:12.450> orchid<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:12.959> caveat<00:02:13.470> work<00:02:13.590> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
sicker an orchid is the caveat work is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.949 
sicker an orchid is the caveat work is
the<00:02:14.069> more<00:02:14.220> prone<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.239> these<00:02:15.390> types<00:02:15.780> of

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
the more prone it is to these types of

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.220 
the more prone it is to these types of
rots<00:02:16.290> no<00:02:16.950> matter<00:02:17.129> how<00:02:17.459> far<00:02:18.090> along<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:19.110> new
