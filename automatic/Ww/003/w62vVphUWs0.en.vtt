gonna roll like a custom role of about

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.760 
gonna roll like a custom role of about
five<00:00:40.620> shots<00:00:41.190> into<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.420> then<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.559> then<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
five shots into here and then and then I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
five shots into here and then and then I
don't<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.160> waste<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.460> roll<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.760> 36<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.510> can

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
don't have to waste a roll of 36 I can

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
don't have to waste a roll of 36 I can
just<00:00:45.930> develop<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.680> five<00:00:46.860> exposures<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> see

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
just develop the five exposures and see

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520 
just develop the five exposures and see
if<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.940> camera<00:00:48.120> worked<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:48.989> could<00:00:49.379> even

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
if the camera worked or you could even

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.520 
if the camera worked or you could even
go<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> other<00:00:51.270> side<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.140> could<00:00:52.289> roll

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
go to the other side and you could roll

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.160 
go to the other side and you could roll
I<00:00:52.860> think<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.969> more<00:00:54.239> than<00:00:54.300> 40<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
I think you can get more than 40 on a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.189 
I think you can get more than 40 on a
roll<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.270> if<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.750> roll<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
roll if you if you really roll it in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
roll if you if you really roll it in
there<00:00:58.350> I'm<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.500> sure<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> exact<00:00:59.370> limit

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
there I'm not sure what the exact limit

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
Watson bulk loader and so bulk loaders

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.370 
Watson bulk loader and so bulk loaders
even<00:01:21.360> though<00:01:21.450> there's<00:01:21.630> lots<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.080> different

itself actually I've loaded this our own
way<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:59.149> once<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.479> there<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.079> know

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
way but once it's in there you you know

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.010 
way but once it's in there you you know
you<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.860> tape<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:02.640> fix<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.869> there

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you have to tape it or fix it on there

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.440 
you have to tape it or fix it on there
somehow<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.549> close<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.030> guy<00:02:06.210> then

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
somehow and then you close this guy then

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.630 
somehow and then you close this guy then
it's<00:02:06.479> light<00:02:06.719> safe<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.530> open<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
it's light safe you actually open the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.940 
it's light safe you actually open the
door<00:02:08.940> between<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.599> two<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.080> start

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
door between the two and you start

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.520 
door between the two and you start
rolling<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.400> film<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.330> you'll<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:13.080> this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
rolling your film on and you'll on this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.530 
rolling your film on and you'll on this
model<00:02:13.740> you'll<00:02:13.950> see<00:02:14.100> clicks<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:15.150> I'll<00:02:15.270> show<00:02:15.450> you

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
model you'll see clicks so I'll show you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.900 
model you'll see clicks so I'll show you
how<00:02:15.690> many<00:02:15.750> exposures<00:02:16.140> are<00:02:16.530> presently<00:02:16.950> loaded

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
how many exposures are presently loaded

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.040 
how many exposures are presently loaded
in<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.750> goes<00:02:18.900> up<00:02:19.170> -<00:02:20.390> yeah<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.600> goes<00:02:21.780> up<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
in and it goes up - yeah it goes up to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.680 
in and it goes up - yeah it goes up to
40<00:02:22.440> actually<00:02:22.590> are<00:02:22.890> 39<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.120> yeah<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.600> just

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
40 actually are 39 and yeah you just

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.650 
40 actually are 39 and yeah you just
rolled<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:27.830> with<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.980> film<00:02:29.220> itself

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
rolled it in so with the film itself

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.180 
rolled it in so with the film itself
keep<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.810> mind<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.470> let's<00:02:31.920> see<00:02:32.130> ya<00:02:33.950> open<00:02:34.950> in

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
keep in mind that let's see ya open in

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.920 
keep in mind that let's see ya open in
total<00:02:35.459> darkness<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.300> wasn't<00:02:36.569> sure<00:02:36.750> if

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
total darkness so I wasn't sure if

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.240 
total darkness so I wasn't sure if
there's<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> canister<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:37.950> here<00:02:38.130> or

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
there's like a canister in here or

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.270 
there's like a canister in here or
something<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.760> believe<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.300> like

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
something but I believe it's just like

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.809 
something but I believe it's just like
inside<00:02:41.280> here<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.800> black<00:02:44.130> plastic<00:02:44.400> bag

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
inside here it's in a black plastic bag

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.130 
inside here it's in a black plastic bag
and<00:02:45.090> we'll<00:02:45.239> have<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.870> complete

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
and we'll have to do that in complete

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.009 
and we'll have to do that in complete
darkness<00:02:47.300> open<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.840> load<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:51.019> into

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
darkness open that up and load it into

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.449 
darkness open that up and load it into
the<00:02:52.230> bulk<00:02:52.470> loader<00:02:52.739> here<00:02:53.010> take<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.880> look<00:02:55.040> yeah<00:02:56.040> so

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
the bulk loader here take a look yeah so

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.160 
the bulk loader here take a look yeah so
previously<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.510> previous<00:02:57.840> spool

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
previously this is the previous spool

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.630 
previously this is the previous spool
that<00:02:58.350> was<00:02:58.500> in<00:02:58.650> there<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.010> there's<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.220> hundred

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
that was in there and there's a hundred

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.199 
that was in there and there's a hundred
feet<00:02:59.819> just<00:03:00.060> wrapped<00:03:00.330> around<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:02.090> I'm<00:03:03.090> gonna

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
feet just wrapped around it so I'm gonna

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.650 
feet just wrapped around it so I'm gonna
go<00:03:03.390> into<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.660> dark<00:03:03.870> I'm<00:03:04.650> going<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.510> load<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
go into the dark I'm going to load the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.570 
go into the dark I'm going to load the
spool<00:03:06.930> into<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.380> area<00:03:07.650> or<00:03:07.800> rather<00:03:07.950> load<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
spool into this area or rather load the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.720 
spool into this area or rather load the
hundred<00:03:09.300> feet<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.720> film<00:03:10.100> into<00:03:11.100> this<00:03:11.250> area<00:03:11.519> here

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
hundred feet of film into this area here

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.130 
hundred feet of film into this area here
and<00:03:11.870> then<00:03:12.870> also<00:03:13.260> make<00:03:13.739> sure<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.390> pull<00:03:15.930> a

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
and then also make sure that I pull a

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.660 
and then also make sure that I pull a
liter<00:03:16.470> out<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:17.010> there's<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.250> little<00:03:17.519> bit<00:03:17.640> of

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
liter out so there's a little bit of

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.100 
liter out so there's a little bit of
film<00:03:17.910> here<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:19.019> once<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.070> goes<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:21.989> the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
film here and once this goes on in the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.569 
film here and once this goes on in the
dark<00:03:22.760> we're<00:03:23.760> going<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.180> tighten<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.260> on<00:03:26.360> and

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
dark we're going to tighten that on and

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.300 
dark we're going to tighten that on and
make<00:03:29.579> sure<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:31.019> film<00:03:31.530> gate<00:03:31.799> here<00:03:32.070> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
make sure that the film gate here the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.910 
make sure that the film gate here the
opening<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.660> going<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> be<00:03:34.290> nice<00:03:34.650> and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
opening that is going to be nice and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.810 
opening that is going to be nice and
secure<00:03:35.040> closed<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.890> then<00:03:37.890> we<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.519> take<00:03:38.670> it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
secure closed and then we can take it

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.060 
secure closed and then we can take it
out<00:03:38.910> into<00:03:39.150> daylight<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:40.230> pull<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.769> little

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
out into daylight and just pull a little

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.110 
out into daylight and just pull a little
bit<00:03:41.160> more<00:03:41.430> out<00:03:41.610> fix<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> canister<00:03:43.500> and

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
bit more out fix it to the canister and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.199 
bit more out fix it to the canister and
then<00:03:45.120> start<00:03:45.690> winding<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.049> on<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:47.130> let's<00:03:47.700> give

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
then start winding it on so let's give

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.009 
then start winding it on so let's give
that<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.359> try<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.910> also<00:03:51.060> keep<00:03:51.359> in<00:03:51.510> mind<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.780> not

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
that a try so also keep in mind that not

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.229 
that a try so also keep in mind that not
every<00:03:52.260> 35<00:03:52.709> millimeter<00:03:53.220> canister<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.940> be<00:03:54.060> used

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
every 35 millimeter canister can be used

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.180 
every 35 millimeter canister can be used
with<00:03:54.420> bulk<00:03:54.630> loading<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:55.829> case<00:03:56.010> I'm<00:03:56.160> using

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
with bulk loading in this case I'm using

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.300 
with bulk loading in this case I'm using
an<00:03:56.489> old<00:03:56.640> egg<00:03:56.880> for<00:03:57.269> chrome<00:03:57.540> canister<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.590> in

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
an old egg for chrome canister and in

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.650 
an old egg for chrome canister and in
this<00:03:59.459> case<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.850> can<00:03:59.970> see<00:04:00.120> right<00:04:00.299> at<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.510> top

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
this case you can see right at the top

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.819 
this case you can see right at the top
here<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.930> way<00:04:01.109> it's<00:04:01.260> crimped<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.680> will

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
here the way it's crimped it will

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.440 
here the way it's crimped it will
actually<00:04:02.160> allow<00:04:02.400> us<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.850> open<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.239> canister

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
actually allow us to open the canister

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.190 
actually allow us to open the canister
and<00:04:04.130> load<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.310> spool<00:04:05.579> or<00:04:06.390> just<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> edge<00:04:06.959> of

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
and load the spool or just the edge of

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.050 
and load the spool or just the edge of
it<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.950> we<00:04:08.040> can<00:04:08.190> start<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.549> boat<00:04:08.670> loading

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
it so that we can start the boat loading

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.630 
it so that we can start the boat loading
and<00:04:09.239> then<00:04:09.329> you<00:04:09.450> put<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.750> back<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.640> this

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
and then you put it back in and this

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.620 
and then you put it back in and this
should

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.150 

clip<00:04:17.630> back<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.260> you're<00:04:18.380> nice<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:18.860> light

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
clip back on and you're nice and light

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.100 
clip back on and you're nice and light
tight<00:04:19.400> there<00:04:19.640> and<00:04:20.120> then<00:04:20.269> we<00:04:20.660> start<00:04:20.930> rolling

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
tight there and then we start rolling

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.230 
tight there and then we start rolling
the<00:04:21.350> film<00:04:21.560> into<00:04:21.860> it<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.280> inside<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.060> bulk

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
the film into it and inside the bulk

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.320 
the film into it and inside the bulk
loader<00:04:23.480> with<00:04:24.320> newer<00:04:24.590> canisters<00:04:25.160> there<00:04:26.150> are

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
loader with newer canisters there are

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.210 
loader with newer canisters there are
ways<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.570> do<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:26.930> for<00:04:27.320> example<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.860> can<00:04:28.010> leave

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
ways to do it for example you can leave

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.600 
ways to do it for example you can leave
a<00:04:28.250> little<00:04:28.730> bit<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:28.940> film<00:04:29.150> remaining<00:04:29.660> when<00:04:29.870> you

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
a little bit of film remaining when you

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.950 
a little bit of film remaining when you
when<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:31.700> get<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.030> film<00:04:32.390> developed<00:04:32.480> or

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
when you get the film developed or

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.720 
when you get the film developed or
developing<00:04:32.990> yourself<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.920> then<00:04:34.010> tape<00:04:34.340> your

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
developing yourself and then tape your

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.240 
developing yourself and then tape your
new<00:04:34.910> film<00:04:35.180> onto<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:35.960> then<00:04:36.080> have<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:37.010> rolled

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
new film onto it and then have it rolled

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.520 
new film onto it and then have it rolled
back<00:04:37.490> in<00:04:37.730> but<00:04:38.420> you<00:04:38.660> can<00:04:38.810> see<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.110> top<00:04:39.320> and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
back in but you can see the top and

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.960 
back in but you can see the top and
bottom<00:04:39.650> of<00:04:39.920> this<00:04:40.010> won't<00:04:40.340> allow<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:40.700> to

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
bottom of this won't allow you to

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.450 
bottom of this won't allow you to
actually<00:04:41.470> open<00:04:42.470> out<00:04:42.800> without<00:04:42.950> kind<00:04:43.340> of

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
actually open out without kind of

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.890 
actually open out without kind of
destroying<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.940> canister<00:04:44.420> so<00:04:44.600> it's<00:04:44.750> much

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
destroying the canister so it's much

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.410 
destroying the canister so it's much
easier<00:04:45.230> to<00:04:45.380> get<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.530> reloadable<00:04:46.190> canister<00:04:47.090> and

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
easier to get a reloadable canister and

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.240 
easier to get a reloadable canister and
well<00:04:48.260> this<00:04:48.380> one<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:48.590> an<00:04:48.680> old<00:04:48.860> one<00:04:49.010> you<00:04:49.040> can

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
well this one is an old one you can

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.730 
well this one is an old one you can
actually<00:04:49.400> get<00:04:49.640> purpose<00:04:50.740> purpose-made

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
actually get purpose purpose-made

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.560 
actually get purpose purpose-made
reloadable<00:04:52.430> canisters<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.150> that's<00:04:53.300> probably

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
reloadable canisters and that's probably

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.280 
reloadable canisters and that's probably
your<00:04:53.660> best<00:04:53.780> bet

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
your best bet

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.710 
your best bet
so<00:04:55.160> yeah<00:04:55.310> let's<00:04:55.580> open<00:04:56.180> this<00:04:56.780> guy<00:04:56.870> up<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:58.720> load

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
so yeah let's open this guy up and load

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.330 
so yeah let's open this guy up and load
it<00:04:59.840> up

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
it up

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.250 
it up
so<00:05:01.700> I<00:05:01.970> just<00:05:02.240> finished<00:05:02.540> putting<00:05:02.690> film<00:05:03.050> in<00:05:03.200> the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
so I just finished putting film in the

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.830 
so I just finished putting film in the
bulkloader<00:05:03.650> and<00:05:03.980> this<00:05:04.100> is<00:05:04.250> what<00:05:04.400> I've<00:05:04.490> got<00:05:04.840> you

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
bulkloader and this is what I've got you

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.380 
bulkloader and this is what I've got you
can<00:05:05.960> see<00:05:06.170> here<00:05:06.530> that<00:05:06.560> we've<00:05:07.250> got<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:08.030> strip<00:05:08.270> of

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
can see here that we've got the strip of

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.750 
can see here that we've got the strip of
film<00:05:08.540> sticking<00:05:09.020> out<00:05:09.170> but<00:05:09.800> if<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:10.580> look

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
film sticking out but if you look

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.760 
film sticking out but if you look
carefully<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.330> can<00:05:11.570> see<00:05:11.750> that<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.650> actual

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
carefully you can see that the actual

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.530 
carefully you can see that the actual
hundred<00:05:13.280> feet<00:05:13.430> of<00:05:13.550> film<00:05:13.760> is<00:05:13.970> back<00:05:14.180> in<00:05:14.390> this

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
hundred feet of film is back in this

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.660 
hundred feet of film is back in this
section<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.110> it's<00:05:15.710> protected<00:05:16.520> by<00:05:16.610> this

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
section and it's protected by this

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.570 
section and it's protected by this
little<00:05:16.970> foam<00:05:17.780> gate<00:05:18.050> that's<00:05:18.260> closed<00:05:18.590> when<00:05:19.430> we

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
little foam gate that's closed when we

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.850 
little foam gate that's closed when we
put<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.970> film<00:05:20.240> canister<00:05:20.810> in<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.290> attach<00:05:21.590> it

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
put the film canister in and attach it

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.500 
put the film canister in and attach it
we're<00:05:22.280> gonna<00:05:22.400> close<00:05:22.730> this<00:05:23.000> so<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.300> stays

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
we're gonna close this so it stays

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.020 
we're gonna close this so it stays
completely<00:05:24.110> dark<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.710> we're<00:05:25.340> gonna<00:05:25.430> lock<00:05:25.760> it

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
completely dark and we're gonna lock it

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.580 
completely dark and we're gonna lock it
closed<00:05:26.360> and<00:05:26.660> what<00:05:26.810> that<00:05:26.990> does<00:05:27.260> is<00:05:27.470> actually

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
closed and what that does is actually

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.920 
closed and what that does is actually
opens<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.310> film<00:05:28.520> gate<00:05:28.790> inside<00:05:29.150> so<00:05:29.750> now<00:05:29.870> I've

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
opens that film gate inside so now I've

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.080 
opens that film gate inside so now I've
got<00:05:30.080> a<00:05:30.110> totally<00:05:30.710> dark<00:05:30.920> environment<00:05:31.520> here<00:05:31.790> and

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
got a totally dark environment here and

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.570 
got a totally dark environment here and
you<00:05:32.300> can<00:05:32.450> start<00:05:32.690> taking<00:05:33.170> up<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:34.010> unexposed

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
you can start taking up the unexposed

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.970 
you can start taking up the unexposed
film<00:05:34.910> into<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.870> canister<00:05:36.260> so<00:05:36.680> let's<00:05:36.860> give

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
film into the canister so let's give

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.000 
film into the canister so let's give
that<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:37.160> try<00:05:37.340> now<00:05:38.350> so<00:05:39.350> now<00:05:39.500> we<00:05:39.560> need<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.830> attach

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
that a try now so now we need to attach

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.650 
that a try now so now we need to attach
the<00:05:40.400> film<00:05:40.640> from<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:40.910> bulkloader

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
the film from the bulkloader

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.230 
the film from the bulkloader
onto<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.440> spool<00:05:42.740> this<00:05:43.550> can<00:05:43.730> be<00:05:43.850> a<00:05:43.880> little<00:05:44.030> bit

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
onto the spool this can be a little bit

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.520 
onto the spool this can be a little bit
tricky<00:05:44.540> you<00:05:44.690> just<00:05:44.870> need<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.110> make<00:05:45.260> sure<00:05:45.290> it's

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
tricky you just need to make sure it's

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.150 
tricky you just need to make sure it's
aligned<00:05:45.890> properly<00:05:46.100> and<00:05:46.640> then<00:05:47.920> you'll<00:05:48.920> see

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
aligned properly and then you'll see

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.770 
aligned properly and then you'll see
actually<00:05:49.580> that<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:49.760> film<00:05:50.090> isn't<00:05:50.240> quite<00:05:50.540> long

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
actually that the film isn't quite long

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.660 
actually that the film isn't quite long
enough<00:05:50.810> well<00:05:51.290> we<00:05:51.410> can<00:05:51.590> carefully<00:05:51.860> pull<00:05:52.130> out

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
enough well we can carefully pull out

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:03.540 
enough well we can carefully pull out
more<00:05:53.030> and<00:05:53.240> will<00:05:53.390> still<00:05:53.720> remain<00:05:54.050> light<00:05:54.320> safe

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.740 

that's<00:06:04.550> very<00:06:04.670> attaching<00:06:05.150> it<00:06:05.210> to<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:05.420> spool

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
that's very attaching it to the spool

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.480 
that's very attaching it to the spool
I'd<00:06:06.020> usually<00:06:06.320> use<00:06:06.650> something<00:06:06.680> like<00:06:06.980> scotch

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
I'd usually use something like scotch

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.910 
I'd usually use something like scotch
tape<00:06:07.790> but<00:06:08.420> in<00:06:08.660> this<00:06:08.780> case<00:06:09.020> I'm<00:06:09.230> in<00:06:09.350> a<00:06:09.380> jam<00:06:09.710> so

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
tape but in this case I'm in a jam so

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:30.330 
tape but in this case I'm in a jam so
I'm<00:06:09.980> going<00:06:10.100> to<00:06:10.190> try<00:06:10.400> with<00:06:10.460> gaff<00:06:10.850> day

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.240 

so<00:06:31.210> that<00:06:31.330> seems<00:06:31.570> pretty<00:06:31.780> secure<00:06:32.080> so<00:06:32.980> the<00:06:33.070> next

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
so that seems pretty secure so the next

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:42.930 
so that seems pretty secure so the next
step<00:06:33.520> is<00:06:33.790> to<00:06:34.000> put<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.660> canister<00:06:35.080> back<00:06:35.530> on<00:06:41.940> and

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
step is to put the canister back on and

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:53.879 
step is to put the canister back on and
the<00:06:43.210> lid

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:59.439 

there<00:06:54.889> we<00:06:54.979> go<00:06:57.039> so<00:06:58.039> now<00:06:58.220> the<00:06:58.280> last<00:06:58.819> thing<00:06:59.090> to<00:06:59.270> do

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
there we go so now the last thing to do

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:11.469 
there we go so now the last thing to do
is<00:07:07.090> let's<00:07:08.090> take<00:07:08.330> a<00:07:08.360> look<00:07:08.599> here<00:07:10.060> so<00:07:11.060> now<00:07:11.180> you<00:07:11.240> can

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 
is let's take a look here so now you can

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:12.700 
is let's take a look here so now you can
just<00:07:11.569> test<00:07:11.900> to<00:07:12.050> make<00:07:12.199> sure<00:07:12.380> that<00:07:12.560> it's

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
just test to make sure that it's

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.730 
just test to make sure that it's
actually<00:07:13.099> going<00:07:13.280> to<00:07:13.370> be<00:07:13.460> taking<00:07:13.849> in<00:07:13.970> fun<00:07:14.740> that

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
actually going to be taking in fun that

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.180 
actually going to be taking in fun that
looks<00:07:15.889> good<00:07:16.220> and<00:07:17.349> the<00:07:18.349> last<00:07:18.500> step<00:07:18.740> is<00:07:18.979> to

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
looks good and the last step is to

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.339 
looks good and the last step is to
actually<00:07:19.310> just<00:07:20.349> close<00:07:21.349> that<00:07:21.410> up<00:07:23.259> open<00:07:24.259> the

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:24.349 
actually just close that up open the

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:26.890 
actually just close that up open the
film<00:07:24.590> gate<00:07:24.830> and<00:07:25.150> start<00:07:26.150> taking<00:07:26.300> up<00:07:26.539> the<00:07:26.659> film

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
film gate and start taking up the film

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.879 
film gate and start taking up the film
and<00:07:28.389> in<00:07:29.389> this<00:07:29.509> case<00:07:29.750> every<00:07:30.139> click<00:07:30.440> is<00:07:30.740> an

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:30.889 
and in this case every click is an

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:34.600 
and in this case every click is an
exposure<00:07:32.319> so<00:07:33.319> I'm<00:07:33.710> gonna<00:07:33.830> play<00:07:34.039> it<00:07:34.130> safe<00:07:34.310> put

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.610 
exposure so I'm gonna play it safe put

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:40.210 
exposure so I'm gonna play it safe put
about<00:07:36.009> 12<00:07:37.009> exposures<00:07:37.610> in<00:07:37.759> there<00:07:37.909> and<00:07:39.220> when

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220 
about 12 exposures in there and when

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.100 
about 12 exposures in there and when
you're<00:07:40.370> ready<00:07:40.520> just<00:07:41.240> remember<00:07:41.720> you<00:07:41.930> need<00:07:42.050> to

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 
you're ready just remember you need to

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:50.260 
you're ready just remember you need to
close<00:07:42.440> that<00:07:42.680> foam<00:07:42.889> gate<00:07:47.530> and<00:07:48.880> you<00:07:49.880> open<00:07:50.090> it<00:07:50.180> up

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270 
close that foam gate and you open it up

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.300 
close that foam gate and you open it up
now<00:07:50.569> this<00:07:50.810> section<00:07:51.259> here<00:07:51.590> is<00:07:51.650> already<00:07:52.009> exposed

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.310 
now this section here is already exposed

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.149 
now this section here is already exposed
so<00:07:52.490> that's<00:07:52.669> going<00:07:52.849> to<00:07:52.909> be<00:07:52.970> your<00:07:53.120> leader<00:07:53.330> but
