this<00:00:06.450> video<00:00:06.750> we're<00:00:07.049> going<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.350> take<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.560> look<00:00:07.799> at

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
this video we're going to take a look at

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.830 
this video we're going to take a look at
using<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.490> move<00:00:08.700> tool<00:00:08.730> as<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.510> see<00:00:09.690> we're

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
using the move tool as you see we're

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.650 
using the move tool as you see we're
currently<00:00:10.080> doing<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:11.280> nudge<00:00:11.610> around<00:00:11.969> vertices

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
currently doing to nudge around vertices

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.629 
currently doing to nudge around vertices
on<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> very<00:00:13.290> low<00:00:13.590> poly<00:00:13.889> model<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.549> we

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
on the very low poly model that we

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.650 
on the very low poly model that we
created<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.120> part<00:00:15.389> 1i<00:00:17.300> use<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.449> Move<00:00:18.630> tool

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
created in part 1i use the Move tool

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
created in part 1i use the Move tool
with<00:00:19.170> symmetry<00:00:19.740> turned<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.250> across<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
with symmetry turned on across the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.480 
with symmetry turned on across the
x-axis<00:00:21.410> because<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.680> allows<00:00:22.980> me<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
make sure that before I even start

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.290 
make sure that before I even start
sculpting<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.279> you'll<00:00:26.400> see<00:00:26.550> them<00:00:26.640> down<00:00:27.119> at

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
sculpting and you'll see them down at

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.990 
sculpting and you'll see them down at
that<00:00:27.420> level<00:00:27.750> one<00:00:28.170> right<00:00:28.470> now<00:00:28.710> before<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.849> can

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that level one right now before you can

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.429 
that level one right now before you can
start<00:00:30.150> sculpting<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.869> need<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> make<00:00:31.320> some

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
start sculpting I need to make some

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.520 
start sculpting I need to make some
changes<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> silhouette<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.500> using<00:00:34.500> my

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
changes to the silhouette and using my

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.990 
changes to the silhouette and using my
background<00:00:35.130> image<00:00:35.399> which<00:00:35.579> I'd<00:00:35.760> previously

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
background image which I'd previously

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900 
background image which I'd previously
crop<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.870> filled<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:38.280> start<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> see<00:00:38.879> some

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
crop and filled I can start to see some

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.740 
crop and filled I can start to see some
of<00:00:39.149> those<00:00:39.450> ideas<00:00:41.149> now<00:00:42.149> i'm<00:00:42.239> using<00:00:42.329> sort<00:00:42.690> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
of those ideas now i'm using sort of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.569 
of those ideas now i'm using sort of
rough<00:00:42.930> guidelines<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> i<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.280> head

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
rough guidelines that i have in my head

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.549 
rough guidelines that i have in my head
when<00:00:44.789> doing<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.930> creating<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.260> form

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
when doing this for creating the form

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
when doing this for creating the form
but<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.340> feel<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.520> having<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.000> drawn-out

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
but if you feel like having a drawn-out

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
but if you feel like having a drawn-out
plan<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.320> well<00:00:49.440> never<00:00:49.770> hurts<00:00:50.010> maybe

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
plan for this as well never hurts maybe

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.430 
plan for this as well never hurts maybe
you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.460> crop<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.090> fill<00:00:51.270> multiple<00:00:51.510> images<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you can crop and fill multiple images to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
you can crop and fill multiple images to
the<00:00:52.469> background<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.730> i'm<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.030> working<00:00:54.149> with

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the background but i'm just working with

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.689 
the background but i'm just working with
the<00:00:54.539> side<00:00:55.250> looking<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.399> i'm<00:00:56.489> kind<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the side looking here i'm kind of

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
the side looking here i'm kind of
noticing<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.360> prominence<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.140> lower<00:00:58.500> jaw<00:00:58.859> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
noticing the prominence of lower jaw and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.849 
noticing the prominence of lower jaw and
how<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> upper<00:01:00.570> jaw<00:01:00.809> juts<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:01.680> bit

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
how the upper jaw juts out a little bit

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.789 
how the upper jaw juts out a little bit
i<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:02.760> want<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> move<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> side<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
i also want to move in the side of the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.240 
i also want to move in the side of the
head<00:01:05.100> ever<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.760> slightly<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.710> pull<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
head ever so slightly and pull out that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.090 
head ever so slightly and pull out that
nose<00:01:12.049> remove<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> jawline<00:01:13.560> down<00:01:13.799> i<00:01:13.830> found<00:01:14.040> out

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
nose remove the jawline down i found out

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.200 
nose remove the jawline down i found out
we<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.310> need<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.580> kind<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> crease<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
we really need to kind of crease that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.109 
we really need to kind of crease that
jawline<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> bit<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:17.070> moving<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.520> down<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
jawline a bit so by moving it down and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.870 
jawline a bit so by moving it down and
then<00:01:18.420> pulling<00:01:18.810> those<00:01:19.590> vertices<00:01:20.040> backwards

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
then pulling those vertices backwards

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.050 
then pulling those vertices backwards
and<00:01:21.229> tucking<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.470> line<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.950> behind<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.549> i<00:01:23.700> can

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and tucking the line in behind it i can

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.370 
and tucking the line in behind it i can
really<00:01:24.240> start<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.540> create<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> shading

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
really start to create that shading

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.800 
really start to create that shading
crease<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.220> drawing<00:01:26.810> even

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
crease that you see on the drawing even

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:36.280 
crease that you see on the drawing even
in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> low-poly<00:01:28.380> model

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.370 

so<00:01:36.950> let's<00:01:37.070> do<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.250> little<00:01:37.610> bit<00:01:37.820> larger<00:01:38.380> brush

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
so let's do a little bit larger brush

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.220 
so let's do a little bit larger brush
size<00:01:39.740> now<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:40.430> I<00:01:40.490> can<00:01:40.640> control<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.630> couple<00:01:42.050> more

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
size now so I can control a couple more

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.470 
size now so I can control a couple more
vertices<00:01:42.650> inside<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.430> brush<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.940> I'm<00:01:44.420> just

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
vertices inside the brush and I'm just

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.530 
vertices inside the brush and I'm just
going<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.810> continue<00:01:45.220> tweaking<00:01:46.220> my<00:01:46.520> arms<00:01:47.360> still

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
going to continue tweaking my arms still

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:56.170 
going to continue tweaking my arms still
have<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.780> sitting<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.260> I

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.180 

it<00:01:56.810> nudged<00:01:57.110> these<00:01:57.320> points<00:01:57.680> around<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.070> little

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
it nudged these points around a little

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.750 
it nudged these points around a little
bit<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:58.640> build<00:01:59.090> out<00:01:59.330> my<00:01:59.660> sloths<00:02:00.760> trapezius

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
bit to build out my sloths trapezius

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.230 
bit to build out my sloths trapezius
essentially<00:02:03.370> i'm<00:02:04.370> working<00:02:04.730> with<00:02:04.760> a<00:02:04.880> slightly

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
essentially i'm working with a slightly

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.000 
essentially i'm working with a slightly
imagined<00:02:05.960> anatomy<00:02:06.410> because<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:06.980> a

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
imagined anatomy because this is a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.180 
imagined anatomy because this is a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
bit off of human anatomy as well I've

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.350 
bit off of human anatomy as well I've
switched<00:02:26.990> now<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.680> standard<00:02:28.220> brush<00:02:28.520> and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
switched now to the standard brush and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.260 
switched now to the standard brush and
I've<00:02:29.510> gone<00:02:29.900> up<00:02:29.959> one<00:02:30.560> more<00:02:30.800> resolution<00:02:31.520> level

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
I've gone up one more resolution level

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.600 
I've gone up one more resolution level
of<00:02:32.360> detail<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.080> now<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:33.800> can<00:02:34.070> start<00:02:34.190> doing<00:02:34.400> a

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
of detail and now I can start doing a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.960 
of detail and now I can start doing a
little<00:02:34.640> bit<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.180> sculpting<00:02:36.100> just<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.340> again

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
little bit of sculpting just to again

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.300 
little bit of sculpting just to again
get<00:02:38.330> some<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.720> those<00:02:38.810> more<00:02:39.110> major<00:02:39.560> forms<00:02:40.160> I'm

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
get some of those more major forms I'm

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.550 
get some of those more major forms I'm
not<00:02:40.910> looking<00:02:41.209> at<00:02:41.300> any<00:02:41.450> details<00:02:41.989> I'm<00:02:42.380> really

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
not looking at any details I'm really

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.800 
not looking at any details I'm really
just<00:02:42.770> looking<00:02:42.890> at<00:02:43.190> where<00:02:43.459> i<00:02:43.489> can<00:02:43.730> create<00:02:43.970> shade

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
just looking at where i can create shade

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
draw tool move brush I can start to

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.610 
draw tool move brush I can start to
define<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:16.910> upper<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.900> lower<00:03:18.080> jaw<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.470> little

define that upper and lower jaw a little

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.550 
define that upper and lower jaw a little
bit<00:03:18.980> by<00:03:19.549> pulling<00:03:19.970> them<00:03:20.090> out<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.450> be<00:03:20.540> ever<00:03:20.780> so

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
bit by pulling them out to be ever so

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.000 
bit by pulling them out to be ever so
much<00:03:21.739> more<00:03:21.970> prominent<00:03:23.650> it's<00:03:24.650> kind<00:03:24.830> of<00:03:24.860> got<00:03:24.980> a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
much more prominent it's kind of got a

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.860 
much more prominent it's kind of got a
little<00:03:25.070> goofy<00:03:25.400> smile<00:03:25.910> right<00:03:26.209> now<00:03:26.360> but<00:03:26.690> that's

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
little goofy smile right now but that's

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.039 
little goofy smile right now but that's
cool<00:03:27.910> i'm<00:03:28.910> also<00:03:29.120> going<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.450> shade<00:03:29.690> increase

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
cool i'm also going to shade increase

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.840 
cool i'm also going to shade increase
along<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.500> cheek<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.040> i'm<00:03:31.459> going<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.640> try<00:03:31.760> and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
along the cheek and i'm going to try and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.610 
along the cheek and i'm going to try and
achieve<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.450> using<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:32.989> move<00:03:33.170> tool<00:03:33.200> as<00:03:33.590> well

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
achieve that using the move tool as well

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.920 
achieve that using the move tool as well
by<00:03:34.340> moving<00:03:34.700> just<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.120> few<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.510> those<00:03:35.630> points

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
by moving just a few of those points

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.680 
by moving just a few of those points
forward<00:03:36.350> with<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.560> very<00:03:36.860> small<00:03:37.280> move<00:03:38.269> brush

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
forward with a very small move brush

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.229 
forward with a very small move brush
setting<00:03:39.260> i<00:03:39.440> can<00:03:40.250> really<00:03:40.579> start<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:40.880> define

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
setting i can really start to define

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.490 
setting i can really start to define
that<00:03:41.299> line<00:03:41.959> pretty<00:03:42.470> easily<00:03:44.320> working<00:03:45.320> on<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
that line pretty easily working on the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.110 
that line pretty easily working on the
chest<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:46.130> little<00:03:46.310> bit<00:03:46.459> again<00:03:46.790> moving

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
chest just a little bit again moving

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:57.990 
chest just a little bit again moving
points<00:03:47.600> forward<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.530> backwards

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.490 

he<00:03:59.000> returned<00:03:59.270> to<00:03:59.330> define<00:03:59.570> out<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.840> pectoral

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
he returned to define out the pectoral

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.230 
he returned to define out the pectoral
muscle<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:00.950> deltoids<00:04:01.460> start<00:04:01.700> to<00:04:01.790> stretch<00:04:02.000> out

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
muscle and deltoids start to stretch out

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.360 
muscle and deltoids start to stretch out
onto<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.510> arm<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:03.650> again<00:04:03.890> all<00:04:04.070> I'm<00:04:04.250> looking

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
onto the arm and again all I'm looking

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.360 
onto the arm and again all I'm looking
at<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.450> major<00:04:05.930> sort<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:06.530> shading<00:04:06.920> creases

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
at is the major sort of shading creases

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.550 
at is the major sort of shading creases
and<00:04:07.630> silhouette<00:04:08.630> changes<00:04:09.140> that<00:04:09.290> need<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.440> be

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
and silhouette changes that need to be

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.550

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
it looking like the outline we see in

I'm going to use the move brush and pull
the<00:04:45.990> tip<00:04:46.199> of<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.470> tail<00:04:46.770> back<00:04:47.160> a<00:04:47.190> little<00:04:47.580> bit

this<00:04:48.630> is<00:04:48.720> going<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.900> allow<00:04:48.960> me<00:04:49.139> a<00:04:49.169> much<00:04:49.380> more

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
this is going to allow me a much more

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.080 
this is going to allow me a much more
pointed<00:04:50.340> look<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:51.870> kind<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.110> help<00:04:52.259> out<00:04:52.530> with<00:04:52.800> my

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
pointed look to kind of help out with my

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.040 
pointed look to kind of help out with my
silhouette<00:04:54.090> it's<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.360> little<00:04:54.569> bit<00:04:54.660> longer<00:04:54.780> than

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050

silhouette it's a little bit longer than
my<00:04:55.139> drawing<00:04:55.410> but<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.740> think<00:04:56.039> that's<00:04:56.190> going<00:04:56.340> to

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
my drawing but I think that's going to

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:05.620 
my drawing but I think that's going to
work<00:04:56.490> pretty<00:04:56.789> nicely<00:04:57.090> still

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630
