00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 good morning friends subscribers of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.080
 youtube today we will talk about hair break 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.809
 but from the same shirt that she wears on 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.789
 the last video in this video we are going to 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.219
 talk exclusively about what is 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.960
 jailbreak and the latest update but 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.830
 let's use the same strategy as in 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.480
 the previous video 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.369
 I want that if the video pauses 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.349
 You know how I explained my rival 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.599
 but the server stops right now 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.099
 it's because the jailbreak is available 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.140
 so you are going to go to the 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.360
 annotations that are right here or go to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.730
 go to the links in the description of this 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.160
 same video and there you can see 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.050
 how to do the servei that is follows the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.730
 video stops now I want 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.530
 remind you that I've made 10 videos in 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.149
 this same topic and in this video I 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.129
 I'm just going to cover what happened 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.750
 after those 10 videos if you 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.699
 understand something I recommend you go to 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.859
 the list of the video that will be true here 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.070
 in the description and see all those 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:57.170
 videos are only 10 videos and you 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.399
 will understand more of what the scene is 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.039
 of youtube and what is happening 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.140
 actually as I said here I'm just going 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.030
 to cover what happened after 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.950
 those ten videos good one of the things 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.500
 most recent and important within the 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.340
 world of yorley is that fate has 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.930
 separated 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.810
 now we have a new group 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.540
 it's called the words of worcester and a 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.540
 new group is composed of bach 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.300
 planet bing bing six and moscow 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.500
 and this group is separated from what 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.810
 it was destiny 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.790
 we have to understand something the dep inga has 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.130
 been the group that has brought us your 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.170
 best since 2009 along with these 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.510
 hackers have now separated now 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.820
 we only have these four these 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.860
 four already registered their page 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.600
 internet they made their twitter account 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.000
 which by the way has almost 30,000 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.340
 followers are already the group that 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.920
 they are currently working on this 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.830
 jailbreak on the other side I think it's 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.690
 possible and you have to go snow have not said 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.130

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.619
 focusing on the future and is trying 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.399
 to forget the past and said to rest 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.380
 in peace the destiny 2009 2002 so with 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.080
 we already see how the testing has 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.989
 separate now we have a new group 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.550
 what are the bears and logs the glasses like 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.660
 is not yet I do not know very well how it 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.180
 pronounce because it's a group 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.050
 completely new and this is the group 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.410
 no way 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.120
 working on it, I 'm going to leave you 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.890
 link here below in case you 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.870
 want to follow it or that now we are going to 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.880
 go back to talk about how you guys 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.190
 you know in my previous video I told them that 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.760
 plan is bing said that he already had the ior 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.560
 break on your iphone 5 running on 6.0 2 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.790
 If you have seen this video, see the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.800
 video list that I'm going to leave 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.570
 here as I said he said he already has 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.640
 the ior bng on his iphone 5 and that 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.040
 he's just waiting for it to go by 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.320
 the 6.1 as you all know 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.230
 we were in ios 6.1 beira 4 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.770
 waiting for apple to launch the last of 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.860
 day in the last update before 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.630
 him of the official before the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.080
 official update then that does 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.460
 support for portland show yesterday 26th 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.330
 january saturday throws the beira 5 so that 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.070
 did not launch the gm and in the gold master 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.750
 station which makes everything a lot 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.470
 waiting because after that 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.410
 release after we have the gm 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.390
 in two or three days we have the official 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.280
 for everyone and we will have the servei 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.560
 then they did not do that they 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.690
 they launched 6.1 beira 5 what do you mean 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.100
 that now how I wrote an article 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.630
 I'm going to leave them here below 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.210
 also that means yet 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.960
 we have to wait for the gm 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.300
 but many hackers mod eat planet 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.240
 been patchouli have said that this 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.300
 update is not a beira although it 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.410
 call beira but it is not a beira is more 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.390
 as the gm lake master is diction the 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.750
 update that we wanted it to come out 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.490
 before the update comes out 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.930
 official now let's see if you 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:11.290
 understand by spear 6.1 beira 5 the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.390
 hackers are thinking because of what 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.730
 have seen in the system like for example 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.370
 they say that this version does not have a day 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.070
 so it is to expire this version 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.960
 hard you can go down without needing to be 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.419
 a developer, you can install it 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.710
 on your iphone or what it looks like 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.819
 has all roads 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.770
 to be the only m is the name 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.380
 this the final version that we are going to 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.849
 throw a gm that's what I say that 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.560
 does that mean for us what 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.440
 we are waiting for the jobbik that wants 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.150
 say that we are still even closer 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.949
 but I want to know that many of 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.300
 you are going to ask me more 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.370
 when are we going to have the xerez when 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.669
 let's have the servei the me but let's go 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.949
 to have once we have the official 6.1 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.870
 for all of us we still do not have to 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.569
 broche will ask me when are we going to 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.080
 have the official 6.1 and that's only what 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.750
 knows 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.120
 Japan never says when it will launch its 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.190
 operating system always a lot of people 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.380
 speculating when we're going to have it up 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.250
 I myself thought it was for this Monday 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.639
 but nobody really has that date of 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.800
 when will 6.1 come out but how do you 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.830
 I saw in the previous video once we have 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.159
 6.1 we will have the iosper only 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.159
 we'll be hours away from having the jailbreak 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.810
 hunter for 6.1 now I want to answer you 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.639
 one of your questions that a lot of people 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.440
 says max is no longer going to be available for 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.040
 the iphone 4 is going to be available for the 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.470
 iphone 3g 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.410
 as I said in my previous videos a 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.080
 once we have the joe wright enter for the 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.390
 most recent device as per 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.470
 example in this case the iphone 5 that 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.170
 it means that we are going to have the 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.090
 jailbreak untethered for all 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.630
 devices and I'll repeat it again 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.600
 once the boil comes out with 36.1 for 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:59.260
 iphone 5 let's have the jailbreak 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.570
 counter 6.1 for all devices 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.520
 less for positivity zapote v 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.710
 take out what no one is yet 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.900
 working on that good device already 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.430
 this is environment in conclusion we have 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.200
 a new group that is the group that is 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.940
