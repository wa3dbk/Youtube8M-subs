going<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:03.959> do<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.140> review<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.740> my<00:00:05.339> custom<00:00:06.029> coach

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
going to do a review of my custom coach

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.379 
going to do a review of my custom coach
car<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:07.470> go<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:07.770> my<00:00:07.950> passenger<00:00:08.580> train<00:00:08.880> set

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
car to go with my passenger train set

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.470 
car to go with my passenger train set
seven<00:00:09.960> nine<00:00:10.200> three<00:00:10.650> eight<00:00:11.210> you've<00:00:12.210> probably

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
seven nine three eight you've probably

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.299 
seven nine three eight you've probably
seen<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:13.019> passenger<00:00:13.469> train<00:00:13.769> all<00:00:13.950> over<00:00:14.250> I

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
seen this passenger train all over I

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.709 
seen this passenger train all over I
think<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:14.639> one<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.969> best<00:00:15.299> deals<00:00:15.540> that

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
think it's one of the best deals that

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.300 
think it's one of the best deals that
you<00:00:15.929> could<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.470> best<00:00:16.680> train<00:00:17.010> deals

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
you could one of the best train deals

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.179 
you could one of the best train deals
you<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:17.550> buy<00:00:17.820> why<00:00:18.770> because<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.890> comes<00:00:20.130> with

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
you can buy why because it comes with

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.349 
you can buy why because it comes with
power<00:00:20.490> functions

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
power functions

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.689 
power functions
I<00:00:21.390> think<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> scent<00:00:22.170> retails<00:00:22.680> at<00:00:23.100> somewhere

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
I think the scent retails at somewhere

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.340 
I think the scent retails at somewhere
just<00:00:23.910> over<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> hundred<00:00:24.420> dollars<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.080> think<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
just over a hundred dollars I think the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.800 
just over a hundred dollars I think the
power<00:00:25.619> functions<00:00:26.130> alone<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.449> comes<00:00:27.689> with

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
power functions alone that it comes with

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.859 
power functions alone that it comes with
is<00:00:28.170> about<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.470> 50<00:00:28.859> or<00:00:28.980> $60<00:00:29.490> value<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> think

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
is about a 50 or $60 value so I think

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.269 
is about a 50 or $60 value so I think
it's<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> real<00:00:31.349> great<00:00:31.590> deal<00:00:31.769> because<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it's a real great deal because of the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.580 
it's a real great deal because of the
power<00:00:32.520> functions<00:00:33.059> well<00:00:33.930> we're<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> talk

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
power functions well we're going to talk

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.760 
power functions well we're going to talk
about<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.489> coach<00:00:35.820> custom<00:00:36.809> car<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
about is this coach custom car that I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.360 
about is this coach custom car that I
built<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.950> saw<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> guy<00:00:42.000> had<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.809> sale

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
built so I saw a guy had this for sale

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.760 
built so I saw a guy had this for sale
and<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.789> think<00:00:45.059> he<00:00:45.210> wanted<00:00:45.539> around<00:00:46.879> $80<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
and I think he wanted around $80 for it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.130 
and I think he wanted around $80 for it
and<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.890> figured<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.370> could<00:00:50.399> build<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.809> lot

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and I figured I could build it a lot

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.100 
and I figured I could build it a lot
cheaper<00:00:52.440> than<00:00:52.620> $80<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> made<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> couple

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
cheaper than $80 so I made a couple

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.229 
cheaper than $80 so I made a couple
orders<00:00:55.350> off<00:00:55.590> brick<00:00:55.920> link<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.789> pretty<00:00:57.000> neat

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
orders off brick link it's pretty neat

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.000 
orders off brick link it's pretty neat
because<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.899> may<00:00:58.020> had<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> make<00:00:58.410> three

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
because I think I may had to make three

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.010 
because I think I may had to make three
or<00:00:59.190> four<00:00:59.370> orders<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.210> know<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.840> buy<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
or four orders you know you you buy a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.900 
or four orders you know you you buy a
couple<00:01:01.379> pieces<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.070> realize<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> need<00:01:02.699> some

about<00:01:25.439> how<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> organize<00:01:26.119> it's<00:01:27.119> pretty<00:01:27.330> good

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
about how to organize it's pretty good

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.620 
about how to organize it's pretty good
videos<00:01:27.900> make<00:01:28.229> sure<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:28.619> check<00:01:28.650> him<00:01:29.040> out<00:01:29.630> so

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.899 
videos make sure you go check him out so
this<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.869> kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.439> based<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> coach<00:01:32.579> car

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this is kind of based on the coach car

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.609 
this is kind of based on the coach car
that<00:01:33.119> goes<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> Metroliner

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that goes with the Metroliner

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.289 
that goes with the Metroliner
I<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> Metroliner<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.210> have

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
I have the Metroliner but I don't have

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.179 
I have the Metroliner but I don't have
the<00:01:36.420> coach<00:01:36.630> car<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.170> I've<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.530> refused<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the coach car and I've just refused to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.649 
the coach car and I've just refused to
pay<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.400> amount<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.820> money<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.119> they<00:01:39.479> want

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
pay the amount of money that they want

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.800 
pay the amount of money that they want
for<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> decided<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.340> build<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.000> as

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
for it so I decided to build this one as

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.450 
for it so I decided to build this one as
you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:42.990> see<00:01:43.110> from<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.500> from<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> outside

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
you can see from that from the outside

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.660 
you can see from that from the outside
and<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.829> it's<00:01:46.829> pretty<00:01:47.280> much<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and it's kind of it's pretty much the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.940 
and it's kind of it's pretty much the
same<00:01:47.880> size<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.750> little<00:01:48.960> taller<00:01:49.200> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
same size it's just a little taller so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.969 
same size it's just a little taller so
if<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.100> take<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> roof<00:01:50.670> off<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.979> it

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
if we take the roof off right here it

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.469 
if we take the roof off right here it
has<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.340> design<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.180> pretty<00:01:54.390> much

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
has the design and this is pretty much

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.840 
has the design and this is pretty much
all<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:54.869> off<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.619> Metroliner<00:01:56.130> coach<00:01:56.520> car

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
all right off the Metroliner coach car

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.719 
all right off the Metroliner coach car
it's<00:01:57.630> got<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> removable<00:01:58.229> deck<00:01:58.799> where<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it's got a removable deck where the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.520 
it's got a removable deck where the
seats<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.100> tables<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.729> and

seats are and the little tables are and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.350 
seats are and the little tables are and
then<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> inside<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.729> basically<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
then on the inside it's basically a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.190 
then on the inside it's basically a
sleep<00:02:06.750> car<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.680> has<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> little<00:02:08.429> sink<00:02:08.989> two<00:02:09.989> of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
sleep car it has a little sink two of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.869 
sleep car it has a little sink two of
them<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.800> got<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.129> little<00:02:11.370> steps<00:02:11.640> down

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
them it's got the little steps down

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.550 
them it's got the little steps down
right<00:02:12.150> there<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.660> get<00:02:12.810> from<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.170> entry

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
right there to get from the entry

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.890 
right there to get from the entry
down<00:02:13.890> into<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:15.060> got<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.239> little<00:02:15.510> TV

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
down into there it's got a little TV

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.330 
down into there it's got a little TV
going<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.349> there<00:02:16.500> if<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.770> can<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:16.950> Lego

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
going in there if you can see Lego

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.190 
going in there if you can see Lego
spaceman<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.660> TV<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.080> was<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
spaceman on the TV and I just it was a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.260 
spaceman on the TV and I just it was a
pretty<00:02:22.470> neat<00:02:22.680> build<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.459> didn't<00:02:23.940> count<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
pretty neat build I didn't count the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.979 
pretty neat build I didn't count the
pieces<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:26.120> don't<00:02:27.120> know<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.209> probably<00:02:27.450> cost<00:02:27.810> me

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
pieces I don't know I probably cost me

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.740 
pieces I don't know I probably cost me
somewhere<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> neighborhood<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.010> about

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
somewhere in the neighborhood of about

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.210 
somewhere in the neighborhood of about
$30<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.900> guess<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.290> build<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.709> one<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.040> most

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
$30 I guess to build it one of the most

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.970 
$30 I guess to build it one of the most
expensive<00:02:32.519> pieces<00:02:32.880> was<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.540> actual<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
expensive pieces was the actual the the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.350 
expensive pieces was the actual the the
base<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:36.180> train<00:02:36.480> base<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:38.519> sink<00:02:39.000> tile

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
base the train base and that sink tile

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.020 
base the train base and that sink tile
down<00:02:39.780> there<00:02:40.250> see<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.459> can<00:02:41.580> get<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.790> out<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
down there see if I can get it out and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.720 
down there see if I can get it out and
I'll<00:02:42.120> show<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:43.099> take<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.250> whole<00:02:44.459> bit

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
I'll show it to you take the whole bit

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:54.259 
I'll show it to you take the whole bit
off<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:52.190> tile<00:02:53.190> right<00:02:53.549> there

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
off that tile right there

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.360 
off that tile right there
it's<00:02:54.900> hard<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.380> find<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.799> don't<00:02:55.860> know<00:02:56.069> how<00:02:56.220> many

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
it's hard to find I don't know how many

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.089 
it's hard to find I don't know how many
sets<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.850> comes<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.450> but<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.260> must<00:02:58.470> not<00:02:58.560> be<00:02:58.860> too

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
sets it comes in but it must not be too

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.559 
sets it comes in but it must not be too
many<00:03:00.319> because<00:03:01.319> it's<00:03:01.950> $1<00:03:02.580> something<00:03:03.209> up<00:03:03.330> I

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
many because it's $1 something up I

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.509 
many because it's $1 something up I
think<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.170> was<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.380> dollar<00:03:04.620> 30<00:03:05.250> or<00:03:05.489> a

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
think it was like a dollar 30 or a

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.210 
think it was like a dollar 30 or a
dollar<00:03:05.730> 40<00:03:06.239> apiece<00:03:06.630> that's<00:03:07.620> one<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.040> most

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
dollar 40 apiece that's one of the most

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.039 
dollar 40 apiece that's one of the most
expensive<00:03:08.670> other<00:03:09.060> than<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.510> base<00:03:09.720> plate

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
expensive other than the base plate

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.570 
expensive other than the base plate
that's<00:03:10.290> probably<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.709> most<00:03:10.830> expensive<00:03:11.370> piece

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
that's probably the most expensive piece

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.070 
that's probably the most expensive piece
on<00:03:11.790> here<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:13.470> that's<00:03:13.680> my<00:03:13.890> coach<00:03:14.190> car<00:03:14.900> just<00:03:15.900> give

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
on here so that's my coach car just give

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.720 
on here so that's my coach car just give
you<00:03:16.230> guys<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> few<00:03:16.739> ideas<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:17.310> something

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
you guys a few ideas of something

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.789 
you guys a few ideas of something
something<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.780> build<00:03:19.130> I'm<00:03:20.130> not<00:03:20.400> too<00:03:21.180> good<00:03:21.510> at

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
something to build I'm not too good at

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.620 
something to build I'm not too good at
designing<00:03:22.799> stuff<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.340> mice<00:03:23.549> by<00:03:23.940> myself<00:03:24.390> but

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
designing stuff on mice by myself but

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.840 
designing stuff on mice by myself but
I'm<00:03:24.720> pretty<00:03:24.930> good<00:03:25.049> at<00:03:25.109> copying<00:03:25.410> things<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.250> as

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
I'm pretty good at copying things so as

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.460 
I'm pretty good at copying things so as
you<00:03:27.120> can<00:03:27.239> see<00:03:27.299> I'll<00:03:27.630> put<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.930> back<00:03:28.109> in<00:03:28.290> line
