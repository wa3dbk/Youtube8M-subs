00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
about like a five second exposure I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.800 
about like a five second exposure I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.270 
think and there was also time during
this<00:02:09.960> exposure<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.710> where<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.980> had<00:02:11.160> two

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
flashlights pointing at my face so we

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.230 
flashlights pointing at my face so we
have<00:02:13.740> all<00:02:13.890> these<00:02:14.070> different<00:02:14.280> types<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.880> lights

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
have all these different types of lights

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.330 
have all these different types of lights
coming<00:02:15.750> into<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.020> picture<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:17.010> makes<00:02:17.160> it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
coming into this picture it makes it

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.930 
coming into this picture it makes it
pretty<00:02:17.550> cool<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.830> first<00:02:20.340> discovered<00:02:20.730> this

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
pretty cool and I first discovered this

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.750 
pretty cool and I first discovered this
technique<00:02:21.390> when<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.380> was<00:02:22.740> driving<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.489> car

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
technique when I was driving in a car

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.699 
technique when I was driving in a car
and<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:24.720> taking<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.080> picture<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.410> her<00:02:25.530> house

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
and I was taking a picture of her house

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.910 
and I was taking a picture of her house
with<00:02:25.980> Christmas<00:02:26.400> lights<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.680> my<00:02:28.680> hand

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
with Christmas lights on it and my hand

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.610 
with Christmas lights on it and my hand
bumped<00:02:29.400> when<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> took<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.420> picture<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:31.410> got

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
bumped when I took the picture and I got

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.530 
bumped when I took the picture and I got
this<00:02:31.980> picture<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.420> what<00:02:33.660> came<00:02:33.840> out<00:02:34.220> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
this picture this is what came out and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.479 
this picture this is what came out and
this<00:02:36.540> was<00:02:36.780> years<00:02:37.110> ago<00:02:37.320> back<00:02:37.620> when<00:02:37.890> digital

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
this was years ago back when digital

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.110 
this was years ago back when digital
cameras<00:02:38.850> were<00:02:38.970> first<00:02:39.390> coming<00:02:39.810> out<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:42.060> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
cameras were first coming out and I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.990 
cameras were first coming out and I
wasn't<00:02:42.300> even<00:02:42.510> he<00:02:42.840> integrity<00:02:43.709> back<00:02:43.830> then<00:02:44.100> but

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
wasn't even he integrity back then but

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.880 
wasn't even he integrity back then but
after<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.480> discovered<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.020> technique<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.680> kept

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
after I discovered this technique I kept

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.040 
after I discovered this technique I kept
doing<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.489> doing<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.850> doing<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.239> I'm<00:02:48.840> fell

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
doing it and doing and doing it I'm fell

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.890 
doing it and doing and doing it I'm fell
in<00:02:49.170> love<00:02:49.320> with<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.520> kept<00:02:51.090> refining<00:02:51.780> it

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
in love with it and I kept refining it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.840 
in love with it and I kept refining it
and<00:02:52.110> refining<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.860> until<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.370> got<00:02:53.520> really

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
and refining it until I got really

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.050 
and refining it until I got really
really<00:02:54.060> good<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:56.010> also<00:02:56.280> branched<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.880> into

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
really good and I also branched out into

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.150 
really good and I also branched out into
different<00:02:57.239> areas<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.930> photography<00:02:58.080> -<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.920> did

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
different areas of photography - and did

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.460 
different areas of photography - and did
different<00:02:59.280> techniques<00:02:59.850> like<00:03:00.060> infrared<00:03:00.470> stuff

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
different techniques like infrared stuff

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.530 
different techniques like infrared stuff
like<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.400> kind<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.120> put<00:03:03.300> everything

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
like that and kind of put everything

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.880 
like that and kind of put everything

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
form in and of itself and I've made my

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.090 
form in and of itself and I've made my
eBook<00:03:50.670> into<00:03:51.670> three<00:03:52.030> different<00:03:52.150> parts<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:53.100> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
eBook into three different parts so the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.560 
eBook into three different parts so the
light<00:03:54.280> painting<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.790> long<00:03:54.970> explosion

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
light painting and long explosion

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.020 
light painting and long explosion
effects<00:03:55.810> is<00:03:55.990> the<00:03:56.020> first<00:03:56.470> part<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.070> then<00:03:57.880> the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
effects is the first part and then the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.030 
effects is the first part and then the
second<00:03:58.480> part<00:03:58.660> because<00:03:59.170> I've<00:03:59.530> been<00:03:59.709> doing<00:03:59.950> this

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
second part because I've been doing this

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.370 
second part because I've been doing this
for<00:04:00.250> so<00:04:00.370> long<00:04:00.550> I've<00:04:00.940> been<00:04:01.240> experimenting<00:04:02.200> with

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
for so long I've been experimenting with

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.570 
for so long I've been experimenting with
all<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.770> different<00:04:03.040> types<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.310> different

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
all the different types of different

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.479 
all the different types of different
techniques<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.209> different<00:04:05.040> tricks<00:04:06.040> and

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
techniques and different tricks and

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.270 
techniques and different tricks and
special<00:04:06.940> effects<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:08.320> that's<00:04:08.620> what<00:04:08.860> the

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
special effects so that's what the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.960 
special effects so that's what the
second<00:04:09.970> part<00:04:10.120> is<00:04:10.239> all<00:04:10.390> about<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:12.430> third<00:04:12.640> part

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
second part is all about the third part

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.760 
second part is all about the third part
is<00:04:13.150> all<00:04:13.270> about<00:04:13.480> using<00:04:13.630> Photoshop<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.500> get<00:04:14.620> some

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
is all about using Photoshop to get some

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.030 
is all about using Photoshop to get some
pretty<00:04:14.950> cool<00:04:15.160> results<00:04:15.700> so<00:04:18.329> here's<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:19.390> result

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
pretty cool results so here's a result

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.950 
pretty cool results so here's a result
that<00:04:21.040> you'll<00:04:21.190> you'll<00:04:22.090> learn<00:04:22.419> how<00:04:22.480> to<00:04:22.750> take<00:04:22.930> a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
that you'll you'll learn how to take a

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.730 
that you'll you'll learn how to take a
picture<00:04:23.200> like<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.900> second<00:04:26.590> part

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740
