we<00:02:04.170> did<00:02:04.200> before<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.260> he's<00:02:07.530> all<00:02:07.650> done<00:02:07.860> we

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
we did before and then he's all done we

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.120 
we did before and then he's all done we
painted<00:02:08.820> our<00:02:08.880> stony<00:02:09.179> lion<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.710> build<00:02:10.979> it

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
painted our stony lion we just build it

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.730 
painted our stony lion we just build it
up<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.610> matter<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.880> glazes<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.740> graining

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
up in a matter of glazes and graining

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.880 
up in a matter of glazes and graining
and<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:15.060> think<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.720> most<00:02:15.870> important<00:02:16.410> thing<00:02:16.590> is

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and I think the most important thing is

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.990 
and I think the most important thing is
that<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.520> paint<00:02:18.450> how<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:20.000> because

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that you paint how you like and because

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.510 
that you paint how you like and because
it's<00:02:21.180> all<00:02:21.300> about<00:02:21.450> artistic<00:02:21.900> license<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.950> you

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
it's all about artistic license and you

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.040 
it's all about artistic license and you
can<00:02:23.700> paint<00:02:23.910> with<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> reference<00:02:24.630> or<00:02:24.780> without<00:02:25.020> a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
can paint with a reference or without a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.960 
can paint with a reference or without a
reference<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.040> important<00:02:26.340> thing<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.700> have

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
reference the important thing is to have

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.130 
reference the important thing is to have
a<00:02:27.000> good<00:02:27.209> time<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:30.390> stop<00:02:30.660> trying<00:02:30.840> and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
a good time and to not stop trying and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.720 
a good time and to not stop trying and
don't<00:02:31.200> see<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.560> as<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.709> mistake<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.400> look<00:02:32.640> at

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
don't see it as a mistake just look at
