00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
be a look not as sharp like a 2200 so if

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.270 
be a look not as sharp like a 2200 so if

you have a slower net this will still be

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.250 
you have a slower net this will still be
very<00:03:11.519> watchable<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:12.120> 2200<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:12.870> each<00:03:13.049> one<00:03:13.230> of

these very watchable but if you have the
bandwidth<00:03:16.319> I'd<00:03:16.859> recommend<00:03:17.359> 3000<00:03:18.359> 3000<00:03:19.230> just

frames as you can see my computer can do

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.310 
frames as you can see my computer can do
this<00:04:39.910> because<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.150> have<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.330> good<00:04:40.810> computer<00:04:41.080> so

and again I'm gonna say yes audio you
don't<00:04:47.260> have<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.410> test<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.650> audio<00:04:47.950> at<00:04:48.400> all<00:04:48.820> the

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
don't have to test the audio at all the

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.400 
don't have to test the audio at all the
one<00:04:49.120> thing<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.360> would<00:04:49.420> recommend<00:04:49.600> doing<00:04:50.050> is

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
one thing I would recommend doing is

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.590 
one thing I would recommend doing is
maybe<00:04:51.250> boosting<00:04:51.790> your<00:04:51.820> mic<00:04:52.150> if<00:04:52.390> you're

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
maybe boosting your mic if you're

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.380 
maybe boosting your mic if you're
getting<00:04:53.050> breathing<00:04:53.470> or<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.880> know<00:04:55.000> hearing<00:04:55.240> a

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
getting breathing or you know hearing a

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.880

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
lot of background sounds one thing to as

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.490 
lot of background sounds one thing to as
well<00:04:57.100> is<00:04:57.400> I'd<00:04:57.670> recommend<00:04:57.970> is<00:04:58.300> going<00:04:59.140> to<00:04:59.290> your

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.290 
thing I noticed for me on my headset is
I<00:05:11.560> can't<00:05:12.190> run<00:05:12.340> my<00:05:12.490> headset<00:05:12.850> at<00:05:13.000> a<00:05:13.030> hundred

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.200 
I can't run my headset at a hundred
percent<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:14.380> I<00:05:14.410> run<00:05:14.680> my<00:05:14.830> microphone<00:05:15.370> about<00:05:15.640> 48

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
percent so I run my microphone about 48

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.330 
percent so I run my microphone about 48
otherwise<00:05:16.870> people<00:05:17.140> here<00:05:17.470> my<00:05:17.590> breathing<00:05:18.070> and

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.909 
it's just bad and I try to make sure I
set<00:05:21.640> this<00:05:21.820> all<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.180> time<00:05:22.210> at<00:05:22.540> half<00:05:23.200> microphone

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.710 
set this all the time at half microphone
strength<00:05:24.360> so<00:05:25.360> it<00:05:25.480> doesn't<00:05:25.690> pick<00:05:25.780> up<00:05:25.930> all<00:05:26.080> my
