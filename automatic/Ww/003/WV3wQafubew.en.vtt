00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
everything in the pot I got too excited

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.690 
everything in the pot I got too excited
okay<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.170> they're<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.440> one<00:02:37.680> large<00:02:37.980> yellow

okay and they're just one large yellow
onion<00:02:38.850> chopped<00:02:39.510> up<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:40.590> here's<00:02:40.980> again<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
onion chopped up now here's again the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.010 
onion chopped up now here's again the
original<00:02:42.060> recipe<00:02:42.930> was<00:02:43.650> stovetop<00:02:44.720> was<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
original recipe was stovetop was for the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.229 
original recipe was stovetop was for the
stovetop<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.830> called<00:02:47.160> for<00:02:47.430> seven<00:02:47.790> cups<00:02:48.060> of

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
stovetop and it called for seven cups of

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.670 
stovetop and it called for seven cups of
water<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.720> thought<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.930> don't<00:02:49.230> need<00:02:49.350> seven

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
water and I thought I don't need seven

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.740 
water and I thought I don't need seven
cups<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.980> water<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.700> just<00:02:51.000> started<00:02:51.360> out<00:02:51.540> with

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
cups of water so I just started out with

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.650 
cups of water so I just started out with
four<00:02:52.380> cups<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.950> water<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.550> then<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.090> put<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
four cups of water and then I put the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.590 
four cups of water and then I put the
lid<00:02:54.690> on<00:02:54.840> set<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.920> regulator<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.970> pressure<00:02:57.269> and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
lid on set the regulator to pressure and

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.370 
lid on set the regulator to pressure and
then<00:02:58.170> use<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.769> manual<00:02:59.010> mode<00:02:59.959> which<00:03:00.959> sets<00:03:01.260> it

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
then use the manual mode which sets it

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.960 
then use the manual mode which sets it
automatically<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> high-pressure<00:03:02.400> case<00:03:02.880> you

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
automatically the high-pressure case you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.580 
automatically the high-pressure case you
don't<00:03:03.150> have<00:03:03.180> an<00:03:03.360> insta<00:03:03.570> pot<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.989> then<00:03:04.560> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
don't have an insta pot and then I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.670 
don't have an insta pot and then I
adjusted<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.190> time<00:03:05.519> for<00:03:06.450> 15<00:03:06.989> minutes<00:03:07.440> and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
adjusted the time for 15 minutes and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.150 
adjusted the time for 15 minutes and
that<00:03:07.890> number<00:03:08.280> comes<00:03:08.640> from<00:03:08.989> reading<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.260> beans

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
that number comes from reading the beans

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.800 
that number comes from reading the beans
chart<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.420> recipe<00:03:13.140> book<00:03:13.730> ok<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.090> after<00:03:15.360> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
chart in the recipe book ok so after the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.990 
chart in the recipe book ok so after the
15<00:03:16.170> minutes<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.709> still<00:03:16.980> waited<00:03:17.489> for<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
15 minutes I still waited for the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.970 
15 minutes I still waited for the
pressure<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.450> go<00:03:18.570> down<00:03:18.750> naturally<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.680> then

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
pressure to go down naturally and then

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.430 
pressure to go down naturally and then
took<00:03:20.220> off<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.519> lid<00:03:20.670> now<00:03:21.060> check<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.450> out<00:03:21.660> two

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
took off the lid now check this out two

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.039 
took off the lid now check this out two
and<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.680> half<00:03:22.860> cups<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.340> red<00:03:23.579> lentils<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.329> four

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
and a half cups of red lentils and four

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:25.850 
and a half cups of red lentils and four
cups<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.440> water

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
cups of water

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.250 
cups of water
produces<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.780> great<00:03:28.019> thing<00:03:28.230> about

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
produces this the great thing about

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.470 
produces this the great thing about
pressure<00:03:29.190> cooking<00:03:29.489> in<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.790> insta<00:03:30.060> pot<00:03:30.239> is

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
pressure cooking in the insta pot is

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.030 
pressure cooking in the insta pot is
that<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.870> will<00:03:30.989> pressure<00:03:31.260> cook<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.799> then<00:03:31.920> when

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
that it will pressure cook and then when

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.710 
that it will pressure cook and then when
it's<00:03:32.190> when<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.579> time<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:32.850> up<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.510> goes

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
it's when the time is up it just goes

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.170 
it's when the time is up it just goes
right<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.230> keep<00:03:34.440> warm<00:03:34.709> mode<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:36.060> know

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
right in to keep warm mode so you know

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.000 
right in to keep warm mode so you know
this<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:36.930> probably<00:03:37.320> like<00:03:37.410> 30<00:03:37.739> minutes

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
this this is probably like 30 minutes

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.330 
this this is probably like 30 minutes
later<00:03:38.570> okay<00:03:39.570> but<00:03:39.720> see<00:03:39.900> how<00:03:40.049> thick<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.709> okay

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
later okay but see how thick it is okay

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.650 
later okay but see how thick it is okay

and

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.100 
and
really<00:06:41.729> thinking<00:06:42.090> it<00:06:42.240> looks<00:06:42.569> just<00:06:42.750> like<00:06:42.930> it

did<00:06:43.289> in<00:06:43.620> the<00:06:43.770> picture<00:06:44.130> the<00:06:44.880> next<00:06:45.090> day<00:06:45.509> it<00:06:45.990> gets

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
did in the picture the next day it gets

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.529 
did in the picture the next day it gets
thicker<00:06:46.740> actually<00:06:47.250> in<00:06:47.430> a<00:06:47.490> couple<00:06:47.759> of<00:06:47.789> hours<00:06:48.300> it

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
thicker actually in a couple of hours it

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:49.939 
thicker actually in a couple of hours it
gets<00:06:48.630> even<00:06:48.990> thicker<00:06:49.199> because<00:06:49.380> this<00:06:49.650> was<00:06:49.830> our

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:49.949 
gets even thicker because this was our

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.420 
gets even thicker because this was our
lunch<00:06:50.340> and<00:06:50.699> then<00:06:51.210> by<00:06:51.449> dinnertime<00:06:51.840> the<00:06:52.770> lentils

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
lunch and then by dinnertime the lentils

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.939 
lunch and then by dinnertime the lentils
I<00:06:53.699> guess<00:06:54.090> because<00:06:54.300> of<00:06:54.449> all<00:06:54.660> the<00:06:54.780> starches<00:06:55.169> got

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
I guess because of all the starches got

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.309 
I guess because of all the starches got
thicker<00:06:56.340> and<00:06:56.639> thicker<00:06:56.910> and<00:06:57.180> it<00:06:57.389> was<00:06:57.539> so<00:06:58.020> for

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 
thicker and thicker and it was so for

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.920 
thicker and thicker and it was so for
