my eight inch cast iron pan and we're
going<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.439> working<00:00:26.010> short<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.720> focal

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
going to be working short is the focal

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.330 
going to be working short is the focal
point<00:00:27.750> I'm<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> small<00:00:28.830> pan<00:00:29.070> because

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
point I'm going with a small pan because

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.510 
point I'm going with a small pan because
it<00:00:29.490> loses<00:00:29.730> less<00:00:30.090> heat<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.619> only<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.489> one

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
it loses less heat so I only have one

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.780 
it loses less heat so I only have one
season<00:00:32.850> tilapia<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.250> here's<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.370> olive<00:00:35.670> oil

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
season tilapia so here's some olive oil

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.560 
season tilapia so here's some olive oil
I<00:00:37.190> really<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.340> using<00:00:38.520> olive<00:00:38.940> oil<00:00:39.239> because<00:00:39.300> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I really like using olive oil because it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.260 
I really like using olive oil because it
has<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> higher<00:00:40.020> smoke<00:00:40.410> point<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.940> doesn't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
has a higher smoke point and it doesn't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.529 
has a higher smoke point and it doesn't
burn<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.629> easily<00:00:44.210> we're<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.480> ahead

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
burn as easily we're going to go ahead

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.930 
burn as easily we're going to go ahead

and push that in to the focal point heat

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.010 
and push that in to the focal point heat
