00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
see I've got it drawn out on a piece of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.139 
see I've got it drawn out on a piece of
MDF<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.919> thickness<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> MDF<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
MDF the thickness of the MDF is a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.930 
MDF the thickness of the MDF is a
centimeter<00:00:35.450> I've<00:00:36.450> made<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> 15<00:00:38.100> centimetres

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
centimeter I've made it 15 centimetres

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.819 
centimeter I've made it 15 centimetres
square<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.890> step<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.930> 7-up<00:00:42.930> sorry

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
square and the step is 7-up sorry

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.930 
square and the step is 7-up sorry
11<00:00:44.520> centimeters<00:00:44.969> squared<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.609> gives<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
11 centimeters squared so that gives it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.649 
11 centimeters squared so that gives it
a<00:00:48.050> two<00:00:49.050> centimeter<00:00:49.469> step<00:00:51.109> and<00:00:52.109> I'm<00:00:52.379> gonna<00:00:53.659> I'm

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
a two centimeter step and I'm gonna I'm

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.660 
a two centimeter step and I'm gonna I'm
gonna<00:00:54.809> paint<00:00:55.319> it<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.920> did<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.609> about

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
gonna paint it I did think about

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.189 
gonna paint it I did think about
printing<00:00:57.359> out<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:59.519> actual<00:00:59.999> middle<00:01:00.420> part<00:01:00.749> with

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
printing out the actual middle part with

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.729 
printing out the actual middle part with
the<00:01:01.319> crown<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.729> decided<00:01:03.149> I'm<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:04.019> do

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739

you could see that there is one on the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.330 
you could see that there is one on the
side<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.890> I've<00:01:32.010> decided<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.610> leave<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.880> out

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
side but I've decided to leave that out

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.750 
reference images and yeah it's all drawn
out<00:01:40.950> ready<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.370> be<00:01:41.550> cut<00:01:41.940> out<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:43.740> did<00:01:44.250> start<00:01:44.580> to

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
out ready to be cut out I did start to

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.870 
out ready to be cut out I did start to
draw<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.480> sword<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.710> MDF<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.550> was<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880

use<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.050> podium<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:51.000> decided<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
use for the podium but decided that the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.430 
use for the podium but decided that the
thickness<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.940> MDF<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.900> too<00:01:55.140> thick

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
thickness of the MDF is just too thick

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.070 
thickness of the MDF is just too thick
so<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:56.040> got<00:01:56.610> an<00:01:56.670> old<00:01:56.820> piece<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> off<00:01:57.480> cut<00:01:57.810> plywood

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
so I got an old piece of off cut plywood

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.980 
so I got an old piece of off cut plywood
it's<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> bit<00:01:59.250> thinner<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.910> it's<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.870> be

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
it's a bit thinner and it's going to be

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.790 
it's a bit thinner and it's going to be
perfect<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.510> yeah<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:03.810> next<00:02:04.110> stage<00:02:04.350> cut<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
perfect and yeah so next stage cut this

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.580 
perfect and yeah so next stage cut this
out<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:06.170> clean<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.290> up

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
out and clean it up

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.580 
out and clean it up
so<00:02:07.879> I'll<00:02:08.879> get<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.149> done<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.690> I'll<00:02:10.289> show<00:02:10.530> you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so I'll get that done and I'll show you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.050 
so I'll get that done and I'll show you
the<00:02:10.679> result<00:02:13.099> okay<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.310> that's<00:02:14.550> all<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.790> parts

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the result okay so that's all the parts

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.190 
the result okay so that's all the parts
cut<00:02:15.300> out<00:02:15.480> with<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.110> scroll<00:02:16.379> saw<00:02:17.989> so<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.050> next

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
cut out with the scroll saw so the next

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.809 
cut out with the scroll saw so the next
stage<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.159> give<00:02:20.909> a<00:02:20.940> bit<00:02:21.720> for<00:02:21.900> sanding<00:02:22.819> get

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
stage is to give a bit for sanding get

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.009 
stage is to give a bit for sanding get
all<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> rough<00:02:24.210> edges<00:02:24.390> off

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
all the rough edges off

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.089 
all the rough edges off
as<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.620> see<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.969> little<00:02:27.969> pops<00:02:28.299> I<00:02:28.480> made<00:02:28.689> I

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
as you can see the little pops I made I

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.280 
as you can see the little pops I made I
just<00:02:30.099> zoom<00:02:30.579> in<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.170> turned<00:02:32.170> out

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
just zoom in on that turned out

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.470 
just zoom in on that turned out
reasonably<00:02:32.769> well<00:02:33.010> really<00:02:33.879> quite<00:02:34.090> happy<00:02:34.389> with

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
reasonably well really quite happy with

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.599 
reasonably well really quite happy with
those<00:02:34.599> that<00:02:34.840> pretty<00:02:35.620> awesome<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:37.299> bones

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
those that pretty awesome and the bones

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.390 
those that pretty awesome and the bones
certainly<00:02:39.609> look<00:02:39.790> like<00:02:39.939> bones<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.250> they<00:02:42.250> are

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
certainly look like bones and they are

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.050 
certainly look like bones and they are
the<00:02:42.519> right<00:02:42.639> size<00:02:44.280> I've<00:02:45.280> seen<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.670> reference

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
the right size I've seen the reference

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.580 
the right size I've seen the reference
images<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:47.019> not<00:02:47.200> perfectly<00:02:47.889> square<00:02:48.040> and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
images that not perfectly square and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.740 
images that not perfectly square and
they<00:02:50.590> are<00:02:50.739> like<00:02:51.040> brick<00:02:51.609> slabs<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.569> like

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
they are like brick slabs if you like

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.640 
they are like brick slabs if you like
and<00:02:53.999> I<00:02:54.999> will<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.359> rounding<00:02:55.870> these<00:02:55.989> off<00:02:56.260> as<00:02:56.499> you

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
and I will be rounding these off as you

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.050 
and I will be rounding these off as you
can<00:02:56.739> see<00:02:56.829> I've<00:02:56.950> drawn<00:02:57.219> them<00:02:57.459> in<00:02:57.639> there<00:02:57.819> roughly

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
can see I've drawn them in there roughly

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.849 
can see I've drawn them in there roughly
and<00:02:59.609> I'll<00:03:00.609> be<00:03:00.760> cutting<00:03:01.000> little<00:03:01.569> tiny<00:03:02.560> little

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
and I'll be cutting little tiny little

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.580 
and I'll be cutting little tiny little
kinks<00:03:03.340> out<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:04.389> here<00:03:04.719> to<00:03:05.189> represent<00:03:06.189> each<00:03:06.579> slab

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
kinks out of here to represent each slab

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.059 
kinks out of here to represent each slab
and<00:03:09.299> I've<00:03:10.299> literally<00:03:10.629> copied<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.650> off<00:03:11.889> the

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
and I've literally copied that off the

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.500 
and I've literally copied that off the
reference<00:03:12.459> image<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.650> yeah<00:03:14.829> I<00:03:15.329> signed<00:03:16.329> these

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
reference image so yeah I signed these

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.729 
reference image so yeah I signed these
down<00:03:17.310> Douce<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.519> little<00:03:19.060> bit<00:03:19.209> more<00:03:19.500> detail<00:03:20.500> in

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
down Douce a little bit more detail in

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.640 
down Douce a little bit more detail in
cut<00:03:21.159> in<00:03:21.510> rounding<00:03:22.510> them<00:03:22.629> off<00:03:22.840> getting<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
cut in rounding them off getting the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.659 
cut in rounding them off getting the
bricks<00:03:23.889> slabs<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:26.310> we're<00:03:27.310> taking<00:03:27.459> from

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
bricks slabs in and we're taking from

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.390 
bricks slabs in and we're taking from
there<00:03:28.409> okay<00:03:29.409> so<00:03:29.469> that's<00:03:29.709> all<00:03:29.799> my<00:03:29.919> parts<00:03:30.220> all

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
there okay so that's all my parts all

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.740 
there okay so that's all my parts all
signed<00:03:30.699> it<00:03:30.819> up<00:03:30.939> and<00:03:31.120> filed<00:03:33.389> give<00:03:34.389> it<00:03:34.479> a<00:03:34.599> bit

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
signed it up and filed give it a bit

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.749 
signed it up and filed give it a bit
more<00:03:34.900> detail<00:03:35.379> as<00:03:35.979> you<00:03:36.099> can<00:03:36.220> see<00:03:36.370> I've<00:03:36.459> rounded

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:36.759 
more detail as you can see I've rounded

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:40.319 
more detail as you can see I've rounded
off<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.150> edges<00:03:37.769> got<00:03:38.769> little<00:03:39.129> kinks<00:03:39.879> where<00:03:40.150> the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
off the edges got little kinks where the

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.640 
off the edges got little kinks where the
actual<00:03:41.169> stone<00:03:42.000> lines<00:03:43.000> are<00:03:43.329> once<00:03:44.109> I<00:03:44.259> painted

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
actual stone lines are once I painted

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.569 
actual stone lines are once I painted
I'll<00:03:44.859> paint<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.370> little<00:03:45.519> lines<00:03:45.849> in<00:03:46.090> here<00:03:46.449> so

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
I'll paint the little lines in here so

I'll paint that then and literally get
bit<00:04:42.970> PVA<00:04:43.419> glue<00:04:43.509> get<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:44.620> on<00:04:44.770> there<00:04:45.000> I'll

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
bit PVA glue get that on there I'll

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.430 
bit PVA glue get that on there I'll
clamp<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.419> down<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:48.430> yeah<00:04:49.389> so<00:04:49.750> I'll<00:04:50.139> get<00:04:50.320> on

clamp that down and yeah so I'll get on

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.230 
clamp that down and yeah so I'll get on
with<00:04:50.590> our<00:04:50.680> minute<00:04:51.009> and<00:04:51.250> I'll<00:04:51.789> show<00:04:52.120> the

results in sec okay so the platform

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.730 
results in sec okay so the platform
should<00:04:56.560> be<00:04:56.680> dry<00:04:56.919> by<00:04:57.100> now<00:04:58.380> so<00:04:59.380> I'll<00:04:59.440> get<00:04:59.590> those
