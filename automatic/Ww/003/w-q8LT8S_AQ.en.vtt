that's<00:02:11.550> about<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:11.940> close<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.510> go

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
that's about as close as I can go

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.720 
that's about as close as I can go
without<00:02:12.900> you're<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.770> out<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.130> focus<00:02:14.280> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
without you're going out of focus and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.520 
without you're going out of focus and
some<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.510> other<00:02:15.660> see<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.110> other<00:02:16.230> tubes

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
some of the other see the other tubes

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.970 
some of the other see the other tubes
here

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
here

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.850 
here
they're<00:02:17.520> full<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.170> leafcutter<00:02:19.320> uses

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
they're full of so the leafcutter uses

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.700 
they're full of so the leafcutter uses
leaps<00:02:20.070> but<00:02:20.250> mason<00:02:20.700> bees<00:02:20.880> will<00:02:21.600> use<00:02:21.840> mostly<00:02:22.410> mud

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
leaps but mason bees will use mostly mud

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.650 
leaps but mason bees will use mostly mud
but<00:02:22.980> there's<00:02:23.160> also<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.670> couple<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.240> these<00:02:24.420> that

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
but there's also a couple of these that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.450 
but there's also a couple of these that
look<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.080> they've<00:02:25.710> been<00:02:25.860> filled<00:02:26.160> up<00:02:26.340> with

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
look as if they've been filled up with

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:35.530 
look as if they've been filled up with
resin<00:02:27.980> but<00:02:28.980> there's<00:02:29.190> another<00:02:29.340> one<00:02:29.520> coming

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.150 

so<00:02:36.540> she's<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:36.960> come<00:02:37.140> back<00:02:37.260> with<00:02:37.410> pollen<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
so she's just come back with pollen and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.310 
so she's just come back with pollen and
the<00:02:38.580> these<00:02:39.180> bees<00:02:39.450> collect<00:02:39.720> their<00:02:39.990> pollen

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
the these bees collect their pollen

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.410 
the these bees collect their pollen
underneath<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> abdomens<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.730> could<00:02:42.240> maybe

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
underneath the abdomens you could maybe

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.290 
underneath the abdomens you could maybe
just<00:02:42.570> see<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> one<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.440> came<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.650> there

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
just see with the one that came in there

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.660 
just see with the one that came in there
so<00:02:45.300> bumble<00:02:45.630> bees<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.080> honey<00:02:47.040> bees<00:02:47.280> collect

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
so bumble bees and honey bees collect

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.110 
so bumble bees and honey bees collect
their<00:02:47.940> pollen<00:02:48.300> on<00:02:49.170> their<00:02:49.380> rear<00:02:49.560> legs<00:02:50.120> in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
their pollen on their rear legs in

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.460 
their pollen on their rear legs in
pollen<00:02:51.510> baskets<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.140> are<00:02:52.230> called

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
pollen baskets that are called

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.270 
pollen baskets that are called
colliculus

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
colliculus

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.010 
colliculus
oh<00:02:53.310> that's<00:02:53.970> another<00:02:54.180> tiny<00:02:54.450> one<00:02:54.690> that's<00:02:54.870> just

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
oh that's another tiny one that's just

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.720 
oh that's another tiny one that's just
come<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.320> here<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.430> one<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.640> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
come in here so this is one of the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.720 
come in here so this is one of the
smaller<00:02:57.030> ones<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:59.040> hole<00:02:59.220> there<00:02:59.430> but<00:02:59.460> they

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
smaller ones in the hole there but they

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.460 
smaller ones in the hole there but they
much<00:03:00.030> prefer<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.600> bamboos<00:03:00.960> they've<00:03:01.230> chosen

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
much prefer the bamboos they've chosen

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.560 
much prefer the bamboos they've chosen
the<00:03:01.680> bamboos<00:03:02.010> first<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:03.330> then<00:03:03.450> they're

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
the bamboos first and then they're

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.450 
the bamboos first and then they're
moving<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> holes<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:07.340> can't<00:03:08.340> really

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
moving on to the holes I can't really

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.300 
moving on to the holes I can't really
see<00:03:08.810> I'm<00:03:09.810> standing<00:03:10.380> on<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> chair<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.010> leaning

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
see I'm standing on a chair and leaning

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.310 
see I'm standing on a chair and leaning
forward<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.820> it's<00:03:11.940> not<00:03:12.030> going<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.270> work<00:03:12.450> anyway

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
forward so it's not going to work anyway

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.610 
forward so it's not going to work anyway
so<00:03:13.500> those<00:03:14.100> are<00:03:14.400> leaf<00:03:14.640> cutters<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.510> they<00:03:16.320> are

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
so those are leaf cutters and they are

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.550 
so those are leaf cutters and they are
in<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:18.209> bee<00:03:18.840> hotel<00:03:19.320> on<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.770> side<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:22.380> log

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
in the bee hotel on the side of the log

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
in the bee hotel on the side of the log
cabin<00:03:22.830> at<00:03:23.300> bumblebee<00:03:24.300> from<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:25.430> hopefully<00:03:26.430> I'll

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
cabin at bumblebee from I hopefully I'll

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.630 
cabin at bumblebee from I hopefully I'll
come<00:03:26.760> back<00:03:26.880> later<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.300> do<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.420> bit<00:03:27.600> more
