00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.420
 hello dear wow friends here is the 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.670
 Body already does not welcome you to one 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.460
 another small talk video here 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.430
 our mm from the channel and today are 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.560
 we were in high field yes last night 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.330
 yes or yesterday not last night 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.640
 but yesterday high field was opened 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.920
 but I was in there yesterday, and that was true 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.330
 with three of my or us 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.180
 There were three of my guild 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.890
 on the way and otherwise have us here 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.769
 a race group was actually looking for 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.210
 we were huge and just in there 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:50.589
 personally, my guild is only on 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.239
 weekend going on in the hc content and yes we 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.640
 have us the whole goal ever 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.010
 looked at the whole is also relative 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.260
 just with the id you get then stop 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.030
 just no more blood when you just stop 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.860
 this bus now normally 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.229
 has placed and then clean again here 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.870
 Definitely going to find a very 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.490
 Great beginner bus and also the 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.410
 slaughterers for example after or 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.300
 the other buses are mine 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.640
 in any case well done 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.950
 and I have to say yes now after the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.070
 few weeks and even before this 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.410
 infinite long time in the program has 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.850
 you miss the raiden already bad 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.770
 At least I personally am now 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.010
 no problem players such as 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.500
 excel very or cento but i am yes 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.620
 more so the kerschl raider I take 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.300
 So it's time we go the content already 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.220
 with a certain seriousness 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.730
 but it's mostly actually 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.409
 for the fun and yes, our goal 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.409
 Completely clam and then we'll see 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.350
 which is mythical but we set 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.540
 We do not currently aim for top world one 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.280
 hundred or so but it was all right 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.580
 comfortable as probably many 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.380
 from you out there to everyone 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.120
 case the raid itself i personally like 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.650
 the setting very much I like it very much 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.600
 how to start here in this one too 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.220
 arena and also the abilities of 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.039
 I find cackling cool in any case 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.410
 I was here as a farmer now 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.640
 my huntress the whole time 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.440
 but below I am not 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.180
 come up with chat fling 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.940
 We have left that to others 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.720
 But must say that is partial here 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.050
 in the random group some 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.730
 communication problems 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.500
 that's always such a thing dear people 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.660
 if you are random on the way then 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.760
 Also speak quietly for that 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.980
 definitely can only help if 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.150
 it recognizes any dangers it is yes 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.520
 not bad if you have a mistake 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.740
 But it makes important if you then 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.750
 sometimes something says to my opinion 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.130
 to 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.780
 otherwise, as I said eat beautiful 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.860
 Beginners in my opinion not 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.520
 especially difficult 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.530
 you can get to know the raid here well 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.060
 quotes his abilities 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.560
 I like that, for example 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.010
 aim that you then through them 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.670
 has to pull fire is very cool has short 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.130
 Took our competitors to do that 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.810
 again, boss has worked 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.640
 Of course you can find that on our website 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.500
 page in a detailed written 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.720
 guide on the other hand here on the canal 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.610
 Of course there is also a guide 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.480
 In any case you should have video about it 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.370
 let's see 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.620
 if you are now at the weekend maybe 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.900
 Let's go to have no plan what 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.459
 ever off goes here in high field then 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.930
 Just take a look 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.670
 but not only from the bosses 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.250
 but also from the optics I find that 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.069
 high field a very successful rates 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.349
 it is something different than these dark ones 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.610
 gloomy masonry in which we are very 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.370
 are often on the road 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.989
 i have to say it was for comparison 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.120
 also a very good raid of the 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.890
 skills of bosses in the sea should 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.110
 However, it was like a bus 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.000
 I do not know a little bit more so he 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.340
 was ok but i think gaga has now 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.870
 for example, really spectacular here 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.599
 you are somehow right in the middle of it 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.280
 the action with him he should it was so 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.349
 the boss's rise slightly 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.970
 difficulties gradually and here 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.890
 you actually have the same feeling 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.450
 burkhardt after we give now 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.250
 first neat on the mouth that is 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.560
 a great personality that you can 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.050
 Do not forget here and at the end of the 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.420
 fight respect spoiler still appears 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.340
 so gall that is definitely schonmal 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.500
 story-technically, I find essential 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.759
 hotter than in south africa 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.099
 and now your opinion is in demand 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.110
 So how is it with you? 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.969
 wait right now on the first evening in there 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.249
 and have the first experiences 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.770
 you are collecting or waiting until now 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:30.160
 weeks 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.150
 maybe if your raid days are or 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.099
 you may not even talk 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.720
 why that could also be in 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.729
 the comments would write me down 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.770
 Every case is very interesting to you 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.389
 now like this world or too 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.120
 Of course, that's not always the case 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.639
 a very subjective matter of taste 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.080
 yes she would tell me the comments would 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.669
 I am very happy I then click 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.289
 again in the discussion wishes 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.520
 Have a nice day until 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.319
 there until next time 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.669
 See you in the world of warcraft 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.669
 or kabasi
