00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.409
 our hands 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.869
 we already give you the versions for x box of 60 remove the same title and you can 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.140
 see the and analysis we made of him months ago 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.699
 that version cotino has presented the lights and shadows and we discussed 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.909
 Regarding its other versions the quality of some textures have improved 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.240
 although some elements of swat to give greater solidity regarding what 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.750
 represent 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.130
 the environment can suffer the influence of our attacks although not so 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.010
 interactive as it might seem 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.220
 the interaction with the rest of the classmates is very easy 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.040
 pressing the r1 button to locate the place we want the 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.140
 objective that we want them to eliminate or the door that we want them to open but not 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.070
 We can give you concrete orders, nor can you cure them, they will be cured of their 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.070
 own wounds after a few seconds 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.910
 the design and animation of the characters is not as fluid as 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.660
 should 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.660
 with slight sudden movements and some enemies 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.680
 precisely p artificial intelligence 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.050
 the use of the arriaga engine and allows the whole title to have a

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.350
 the centenarians take us so much for this agency 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.870
 exterior and spacious places 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.130
 Ricardo Costa 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.909
 colleagues to face the different threats that the mission holds 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.510
 the voices located with a good dubbing and an implantation exaggerate the 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.380
 sound of weapons when firing 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.069
 they give even more intensity of sarria that combines very intense moments 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.230
 too easy 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.500
