00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.859
 then ragazzuoli practically on a 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.700
 funky accompaniment we want 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.620
 review we do an accompaniment 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.889
 selected by these agreements we are in b 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:19.170
 dominant partner is the basic agreement 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.550
 selected this the agreements that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.390
 let's go to select can be 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.390
 this 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.960
 see that I'm selecting 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.009
 hearings related to these nights 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.009
 example take dominates 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.290
 an octopus always dominates all the states 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.100
 fundamental 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.890
 tria seems to you from there contextualizes 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.950
 always linked to the formats to dominate 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.670
 but I think I connect them through a 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.670
 gerit module 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.290
 ok let's see the riots there 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.290
 recollection is pau, which intends to reintroduce 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.780
 then the agreements I use in 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.000
 in the displacement they are clearly 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.950
 clear mine as we see if you 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.110
 remember the state well 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.850
 fundamental later we have 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.150
 this is the face where we clearly have 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:59.330
 reversed inverted athlete's st 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.820
 tetrade followed and consequently 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.750
 we clearly have the tonic in this 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.090
 position for which we have 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.790
 this other one you find the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.710
 fingerings where we explain is it 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.290
 unrolling of the up stones 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.430
 then to clearly have this other 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.190
 situation of the other acts and between 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.290
 next for which I use 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.549
 I'm 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.010
 these all use a lot 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:37.250
 often also the king because clearly the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.410
 re is the seventh minor in fact you see it 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.100
 clearly maybe 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.340
 a position like this where you see ad 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.459
 always an example of the ground state 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.629
 vidic is always exposed my first 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:58.580
 turned we have the second turn that 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:03.040
 then it is the agreement that very often comes 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.950
 played also at the start allows 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.620
 ok then you would have this 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:16.590
 basically that would be greater 7 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:19.489
 however moved the seventh to the lower bass 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.489
 see how it sounds 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.890
 is something that I never invite you to do that 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.890
 not that you shouldn't do in the fans 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.020
 move the guests to the low ie also 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.020
 in this position 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.450
 of the bass so how they fill up too much 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.450
 you see 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.979
 whose me
