episode<00:01:41.579> 4<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> very<00:01:42.540> back<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.259> forth

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
episode 4 it was a very back and forth

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.160 
episode 4 it was a very back and forth
between<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.950> two<00:01:43.979> teams<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.939> usual<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
between the two teams as usual but it

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.649 
between the two teams as usual but it
was<00:01:46.320> over<00:01:46.799> five<00:01:47.070> minutes<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.820> still<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.570> it's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
was over five minutes I still think it's

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.210 
was over five minutes I still think it's
a<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:48.899> too<00:01:48.930> short<00:01:49.409> though<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:49.920> six

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
a bit too short though I think six

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190 
a bit too short though I think six
minutes<00:01:50.640> should<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.240> minimum<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:51.960> maybe

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
minutes should be the minimum but maybe

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.080 
minutes should be the minimum but maybe
next<00:01:52.439> episode<00:01:52.890> we'll<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
next episode we'll get it but I have to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.950 
next episode we'll get it but I have to
say<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.540> am<00:01:54.630> liking<00:01:55.320> season<00:01:55.950> 11<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.719> lot<00:01:57.719> more

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
say I am liking season 11 a lot more

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
say I am liking season 11 a lot more
than<00:01:58.170> 9<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.770> 10<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.340> think<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.000> better<00:02:00.240> than

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
than 9 and 10 I think it's better than

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.090 
than 9 and 10 I think it's better than
nine<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.780> ten<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.200> far<00:02:01.409> because<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:01.920> none

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
nine in ten so far because we have none

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.679 
nine in ten so far because we have none
of<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> biggest<00:02:03.270> issue<00:02:03.420> with

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
of this I think the biggest issue with

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.870 
of this I think the biggest issue with
10<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:04.920> was<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.430> on

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
10 was that there was so much going on

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.570 
10 was that there was so much going on
that<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.780> spent<00:02:07.079> way<00:02:07.200> too<00:02:07.229> much<00:02:07.380> time<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
that they spent way too much time on the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.800 
that they spent way too much time on the
reds<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.000> blues<00:02:09.209> when<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.569> should<00:02:09.720> have

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
reds and blues when they should have

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.360 
reds and blues when they should have
been<00:02:09.840> spending<00:02:10.229> time<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> actual<00:02:10.979> story

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
been spending time on the actual story

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.710 
been spending time on the actual story
and<00:02:11.520> they<00:02:11.610> didn't<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.480> one

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and they didn't do that and this one

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.850 
and they didn't do that and this one
they're<00:02:12.930> actually<00:02:13.200> spending<00:02:13.440> time<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
they're actually spending time on the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.050 
they're actually spending time on the
reds<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.099> blues<00:02:14.220> because<00:02:14.520> it's<00:02:14.819> all<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.030> got

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
reds and blues because it's all we got

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.030 
reds and blues because it's all we got
the<00:02:15.270> time<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.540> spend<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.020> there's<00:02:16.770> no<00:02:16.890> more

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the time to spend on there's no more

the time to spend on there's no more

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
wondering like who that is what is going

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.520 
wondering like who that is what is going
on<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:39.540> if<00:02:39.629> all<00:02:39.720> those<00:02:39.810> very<00:02:40.080> clever<00:02:40.440> and

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
on but if all those very clever and

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.809 
on but if all those very clever and
since<00:02:40.769> caboose<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.129> stupid<00:02:41.519> he<00:02:41.550> doesn't

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
since caboose is stupid he doesn't

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.580 
since caboose is stupid he doesn't
notice<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.330> someone<00:02:42.569> else<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:43.410> I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
notice that it's someone else but I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.080 
notice that it's someone else but I
thought<00:02:43.709> they'd<00:02:43.890> they<00:02:44.129> did<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.670> echo<00:02:44.940> back

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
thought they'd they did the echo back

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.570 
thought they'd they did the echo back
and<00:02:45.269> forth<00:02:45.450> pretty<00:02:45.750> well<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.260> i<00:02:46.620> thought<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.519> was

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
and forth pretty well I i thought it was

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.150 
and forth pretty well I i thought it was
both<00:02:47.730> comedic<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:48.360> also<00:02:48.510> kind<00:02:49.019> of<00:02:49.080> creepy<00:02:49.470> as

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
both comedic but also kind of creepy as

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.250 
both comedic but also kind of creepy as
usual<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.819> voice<00:02:50.970> acting<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.480> top<00:02:51.690> notch<00:02:52.019> for

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
usual the voice acting is top notch for

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.660 
usual the voice acting is top notch for
all<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.470> characters<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:52.920> think<00:02:53.129> Tucker<00:02:53.400> and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
all the characters I think Tucker and

all<00:04:34.819> like<00:04:35.819> i<00:04:35.909> said<00:04:36.090> even<00:04:36.270> though<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.509> still

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
all like i said even though it's still

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.330 
all like i said even though it's still
being<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:36.960> little<00:04:37.139> bit<00:04:37.259> under<00:04:37.800> time<00:04:38.039> I<00:04:38.069> think

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
being a little bit under time I think

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.219 
being a little bit under time I think
six<00:04:38.550> minutes<00:04:38.849> is<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.270> minimum<00:04:39.659> and<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:40.110> know

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
six minutes is the minimum and you know

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.320 
six minutes is the minimum and you know
it<00:04:40.440> cause<00:04:40.979> like<00:04:41.009> you're<00:04:41.490> waiting<00:04:41.699> every<00:04:42.180> week

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
it cause like you're waiting every week

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.580 
it cause like you're waiting every week
to<00:04:42.479> see<00:04:42.629> you<00:04:42.690> episode<00:04:43.169> you<00:04:43.289> know<00:04:43.349> it's<00:04:43.530> not

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
to see you episode you know it's not

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.080 
to see you episode you know it's not
like<00:04:43.770> you're<00:04:43.889> watching<00:04:44.099> an<00:04:44.370> episode<00:04:44.400> back<00:04:44.879> and

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
like you're watching an episode back and

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.210 
like you're watching an episode back and
forth<00:04:45.300> back<00:04:45.479> and<00:04:45.509> forth<00:04:45.750> you're<00:04:46.650> sure<00:04:46.949> you're

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
forth back and forth you're sure you're

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.830 
forth back and forth you're sure you're
waiting<00:04:47.580> another<00:04:47.819> seven<00:04:48.270> days<00:04:48.449> to<00:04:48.690> see

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
waiting another seven days to see

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.809 
waiting another seven days to see
another<00:04:48.990> episode<00:04:49.289> and<00:04:49.650> I<00:04:49.740> think<00:04:49.979> under<00:04:50.250> like

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
another episode and I think under like

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.730 
another episode and I think under like
under<00:04:51.060> six<00:04:51.330> minutes<00:04:51.479> is<00:04:51.780> unacceptable<00:04:52.650> I

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
under six minutes is unacceptable I

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.439 
under six minutes is unacceptable I
think<00:04:52.770> it's<00:04:53.009> completely<00:04:53.190> too<00:04:53.639> short<00:04:53.970> but<00:04:54.180> I

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
think it's completely too short but I

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.210 
think it's completely too short but I
did<00:04:54.900> like<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.169> episode<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.590> just<00:04:55.740> thought<00:04:55.860> it's

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
did like the episode I just thought it's

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.950 
did like the episode I just thought it's
still<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.729> little<00:04:56.940> bit<00:04:57.090> too<00:04:57.240> short<00:04:57.569> just<00:04:57.659> a

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
still a little bit too short just a

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.930 
still a little bit too short just a
little<00:04:58.440> little<00:04:58.800> more<00:04:59.069> please<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.460> little<00:04:59.639> more

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.029 
little little more please a little more
another<00:05:00.720> 30<00:05:00.990> seconds<00:05:01.409> isn't<00:05:01.770> that<00:05:01.800> much

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
another 30 seconds isn't that much

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.800 
another 30 seconds isn't that much
because<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.490> can<00:05:02.639> do<00:05:02.729> a<00:05:02.759> lot<00:05:02.970> more<00:05:03.030> in<00:05:03.419> 30

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810

think<00:05:58.469> the<00:05:58.529> pacing<00:05:58.889> is<00:05:58.949> still<00:05:59.219> very<00:05:59.370> slow<00:05:59.819> but

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150
