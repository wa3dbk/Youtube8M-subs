radiators video today we're going to
look<00:00:08.750> at<00:00:08.900> how<00:00:09.200> you<00:00:09.260> and<00:00:09.740> inhibitors<00:00:10.490> your

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
look at how you and inhibitors your

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.340 
look at how you and inhibitors your
heating<00:00:11.090> system<00:00:11.120> there's<00:00:11.870> a<00:00:11.930> few<00:00:12.139> different

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.350 
heating system there's a few different

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.810 
heating system there's a few different
ways<00:00:12.379> you<00:00:12.650> can<00:00:12.740> do<00:00:12.920> this<00:00:12.950> ranging<00:00:13.550> from<00:00:13.670> this

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
ways you can do this ranging from this

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.310 
ways you can do this ranging from this
very<00:00:14.030> basic<00:00:14.360> way<00:00:14.719> that<00:00:14.750> I'm<00:00:14.960> going<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.170> show

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
very basic way that I'm going to show

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.010 
very basic way that I'm going to show
you<00:00:15.380> now<00:00:15.679> to<00:00:16.309> use<00:00:16.849> any<00:00:17.060> proper<00:00:17.480> pressurized

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
you now to use any proper pressurized

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.960 
you now to use any proper pressurized
pumps<00:00:18.349> to<00:00:18.470> actually<00:00:18.860> get<00:00:19.160> your<00:00:19.310> inhibitor

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
pumps to actually get your inhibitor

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.090 
pumps to actually get your inhibitor
into<00:00:20.240> a<00:00:20.270> pressurized<00:00:20.810> system<00:00:20.960> now<00:00:21.439> as<00:00:21.680> I<00:00:21.859> said

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
into a pressurized system now as I said

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.950 
into a pressurized system now as I said
we're<00:00:22.820> going<00:00:22.970> to<00:00:23.060> go<00:00:23.210> through<00:00:23.390> do<00:00:23.600> a<00:00:23.630> few

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
we're going to go through do a few

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.689 
we're going to go through do a few
different<00:00:24.199> ways<00:00:24.380> over<00:00:24.680> a<00:00:24.830> few<00:00:25.039> series<00:00:25.430> of

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
different ways over a few series of

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.400 
different ways over a few series of
videos<00:00:26.029> this<00:00:26.570> is<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:26.810> first<00:00:27.019> way<00:00:27.199> I'm<00:00:27.260> going

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
videos this is the first way I'm going

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.870 
videos this is the first way I'm going
to<00:00:27.470> show<00:00:27.529> you<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:28.039> it<00:00:28.160> is<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.460> most<00:00:28.640> simple

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
to show you and it is the most simple

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.609 
to show you and it is the most simple
most<00:00:29.599> of<00:00:29.810> you<00:00:29.930> will<00:00:30.050> find<00:00:30.080> that<00:00:30.439> you've

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
most of you will find that you've

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.109 
most of you will find that you've
probably<00:00:30.830> got<00:00:31.160> a<00:00:31.189> towel<00:00:31.550> rather<00:00:31.820> in<00:00:31.970> your

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
probably got a towel rather in your

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.000 
probably got a towel rather in your
house<00:00:32.330> and<00:00:32.629> most<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.379> you<00:00:33.470> will<00:00:33.590> find<00:00:33.620> as<00:00:33.860> well

house and most of you will find as well

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.110 
house and most of you will find as well
that<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.250> towel<00:00:34.489> rail<00:00:34.760> will<00:00:34.940> have<00:00:35.090> a

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
that the towel rail will have a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.630 
that the towel rail will have a
removable<00:00:35.540> air<00:00:36.080> vent<00:00:36.320> at<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.530> top<00:00:36.680> if<00:00:37.309> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.710 
coming out of here because those two
valves<00:01:34.070> below<00:01:34.310> are<00:01:34.460> closed<00:01:34.730> now<00:01:35.390> what<00:01:35.570> we're

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
valves below are closed now what we're

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.940 
valves below are closed now what we're
going<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.900> do<00:01:36.050> is<00:01:36.230> we're<00:01:36.350> gonna<00:01:36.409> slack<00:01:36.800> them

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
going to do is we're gonna slack them

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.310 
going to do is we're gonna slack them
off<00:01:37.040> this<00:01:37.250> nut<00:01:37.490> here<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:37.909> use<00:01:38.420> our<00:01:38.659> tub<00:01:38.990> and

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
off this nut here and use our tub and

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.470 
off this nut here and use our tub and
our<00:01:39.800> town<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.460> catch<00:01:40.700> as<00:01:40.820> much<00:01:41.060> water<00:01:41.300> as

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
our town to catch as much water as

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.160 
our town to catch as much water as
possible

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
possible

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.540 
possible
the<00:01:42.350> good<00:01:42.500> thing<00:01:42.650> about<00:01:42.680> this<00:01:42.980> method<00:01:43.190> is<00:01:43.430> we

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
the good thing about this method is we

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.580 
the good thing about this method is we
know<00:01:43.700> exactly<00:01:44.210> how<00:01:44.390> much<00:01:44.570> more<00:01:44.840> water<00:01:45.140> we<00:01:45.470> want

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
know exactly how much more water we want

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.860 
know exactly how much more water we want
to<00:01:45.740> add<00:01:45.980> I<00:01:46.280> know<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:46.940> fits<00:01:47.180> roughly<00:01:47.690> into

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
to add I know that fits roughly into

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.200 
to add I know that fits roughly into
there<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:48.620> all<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:48.979> really<00:01:49.130> need<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.520> do<00:01:49.760> is<00:01:49.970> fill

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
there so all I really need to do is fill

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.360 
there so all I really need to do is fill
this<00:01:50.390> tub<00:01:50.690> up<00:01:50.840> once<00:01:51.170> as<00:01:51.710> soon<00:01:51.770> as<00:01:52.010> I<00:01:52.100> filled

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
this tub up once as soon as I filled

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.800 
this tub up once as soon as I filled
this<00:01:52.490> up<00:01:52.700> once<00:01:52.940> I<00:01:53.090> know<00:01:53.150> that<00:01:53.390> then<00:01:53.540> I've<00:01:53.659> got

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
this up once I know that then I've got

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.330 
this up once I know that then I've got
enough<00:01:54.050> room<00:01:54.290> in<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.470> top<00:01:54.650> of<00:01:54.800> my<00:01:54.920> radiator

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
enough room in the top of my radiator

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.310 
enough room in the top of my radiator
the<00:01:55.820> reason<00:01:56.120> this<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.450> simplest<00:01:56.840> way<00:01:56.930> for

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
the reason this is the simplest way for

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.719 
the reason this is the simplest way for
us<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.530> actually<00:01:57.680> add<00:01:57.950> inhibitor<00:01:58.430> is<00:01:58.610> it

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
us to actually add inhibitor is it

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.860 
us to actually add inhibitor is it
doesn't<00:01:59.030> mean<00:01:59.120> we<00:01:59.240> have<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.420> turn<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.690> heating

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
doesn't mean we have to turn the heating

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.570 
doesn't mean we have to turn the heating
system<00:02:00.260> off<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:00.830> lot<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.190> time<00:02:01.400> it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
system off and a lot of the time it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.890 
system off and a lot of the time it
doesn't<00:02:01.790> mean<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.420> actually

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
doesn't mean that we have to actually

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.840 
doesn't mean that we have to actually
alter<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.409> pressures<00:02:03.860> or<00:02:03.979> top<00:02:04.190> up<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.460> system

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
alter the pressures or top up the system

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.370 
alter the pressures or top up the system
all<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:05.330> need<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.479> do<00:02:05.630> usually<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:06.049> put<00:02:06.260> our

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
all we need to do usually is put our

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.320 
all we need to do usually is put our
small<00:02:06.620> tub

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
small tub

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.270 
small tub
in<00:02:07.600> there<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:07.990> put<00:02:08.350> up<00:02:08.410> these<00:02:08.560> two<00:02:08.770> valves

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
in there I put up these two valves

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.100 
in there I put up these two valves
letting<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.880> air<00:02:10.030> around<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.600> then<00:02:10.720> that's

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
letting the air around and then that's

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.630 
letting the air around and then that's
it<00:02:11.290> we're<00:02:11.440> really<00:02:11.620> ready<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.890> go<00:02:12.130> there's<00:02:12.520> not

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
it we're really ready to go there's not

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.460 
it we're really ready to go there's not
usually<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> drop<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.390> pressure<00:02:13.570> so<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.320> watch

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
usually a drop in pressure so just watch

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.320 
usually a drop in pressure so just watch
us<00:02:14.650> now<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.190> watch<00:02:15.460> how<00:02:15.640> we<00:02:15.700> do<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.180> and

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
us now and watch how we do it and

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.430 
us now and watch how we do it and
hopefully<00:02:16.660> that'll<00:02:16.840> make<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> lot<00:02:17.290> more

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
hopefully that'll make you a lot more

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.170 
hopefully that'll make you a lot more
confident<00:02:17.920> about<00:02:17.980> trying<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.910> your<00:02:19.090> own

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
confident about trying this in your own

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.000 
confident about trying this in your own
home<00:02:19.210> so<00:02:19.990> we're<00:02:20.140> all<00:02:20.200> ready<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.500> go<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.800> see

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
home so we're all ready to go you see

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.380 
home so we're all ready to go you see
the<00:02:21.100> main<00:02:21.280> thing<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.700> we've<00:02:21.820> done<00:02:21.850> here

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
the main thing that we've done here

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.960 
the main thing that we've done here
there<00:02:23.020> was<00:02:23.110> more<00:02:23.290> time<00:02:23.800> spent<00:02:24.010> preparing<00:02:24.340> this

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
there was more time spent preparing this

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.940 
there was more time spent preparing this
job<00:02:25.300> than<00:02:25.720> there<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:25.900> actually<00:02:26.320> doing<00:02:26.650> it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
job than there is actually doing it

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.550 
job than there is actually doing it
so<00:02:27.580> you're<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.120> gonna<00:02:28.390> slacken<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.380> bit

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
so you're just gonna slacken this bit

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.070 
so you're just gonna slacken this bit
off<00:02:29.680> here<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.210> see<00:02:34.420> waters<00:02:34.900> starting

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
off here so as you see waters starting

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.230 
off here so as you see waters starting
to<00:02:35.230> come<00:02:35.350> out<00:02:35.460> it's<00:02:36.460> something<00:02:36.730> coming<00:02:36.910> out<00:02:37.090> as

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
to come out it's something coming out as

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:47.449 
to come out it's something coming out as
we've<00:02:37.390> left<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.750> air<00:02:37.930> vent<00:02:38.230> at<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.440> top<00:02:38.590> open

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.380 

what<00:02:48.459> we're<00:02:48.610> getting<00:02:48.700> towards<00:02:49.120> getting<00:02:49.300> a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
what we're getting towards getting a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.240 
what we're getting towards getting a
nice<00:02:49.540> full<00:02:49.810> tub<00:02:50.140> down<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.950> I'm<00:02:51.040> just<00:02:51.160> gonna

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
nice full tub down so I'm just gonna

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.540 
nice full tub down so I'm just gonna
shut<00:02:51.610> this<00:02:51.790> nut<00:02:52.440> knit<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.590> up<00:02:53.770> my<00:02:53.920> hand<00:02:54.190> just

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
shut this nut knit this up my hand just

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.390 
shut this nut knit this up my hand just
then<00:02:54.820> just<00:02:55.240> give<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.720> little<00:02:55.870> nip<00:02:56.140> up<00:02:56.400> now

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
then just give that a little nip up now

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.520 
then just give that a little nip up now
we<00:02:57.459> can<00:02:57.670> take<00:02:57.880> our<00:02:58.120> tub<00:02:58.390> away<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.959> flush<00:02:59.350> that

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
we can take our tub away and flush that

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.550 
we can take our tub away and flush that
down<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.980> loo<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.330> all<00:03:01.630> we've<00:03:01.810> done<00:03:02.050> there<00:03:02.290> is

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
down the loo so all we've done there is

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.380 
down the loo so all we've done there is
there<00:03:02.830> enough<00:03:03.220> water<00:03:03.459> out<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.970> bring<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
there enough water out to bring the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.180 
there enough water out to bring the
water<00:03:04.570> level<00:03:04.959> down<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.290> here<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.770> that's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
water level down to here and that's

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.250 
water level down to here and that's
enough<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.790> take<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.390> bottle<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.840> inhibitor

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
enough to take the bottle of inhibitor

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
can see that was really really easy to

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.100 
can see that was really really easy to
do<00:04:41.410> we<00:04:41.680> had<00:04:41.830> no<00:04:42.040> problems<00:04:42.580> there<00:04:42.760> at<00:04:42.940> all<00:04:43.150> we've

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
do we had no problems there at all we've

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.390 
do we had no problems there at all we've
had<00:04:44.260> no<00:04:44.410> problems<00:04:44.440> with<00:04:44.800> links<00:04:45.220> we've

had no problems with links we've

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.460 
had no problems with links we've
controlled<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.940> water<00:04:46.150> pretty<00:04:46.450> well<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:47.170> as

controlled the water pretty well and as

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.500 
controlled the water pretty well and as
you<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.770> see<00:04:47.980> it's<00:04:48.280> so<00:04:48.730> easy<00:04:48.760> if<00:04:49.210> you've<00:04:49.360> got

you can see it's so easy if you've got
one<00:04:49.690> of<00:04:49.780> these<00:04:49.900> particular<00:04:50.320> types<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.980> tower

tower out if you haven't got one they'll

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
tower out if you haven't got one they'll
be<00:05:00.670> looking<00:05:00.940> for<00:05:00.970> a<00:05:01.120> different<00:05:01.450> type<00:05:01.600> of
