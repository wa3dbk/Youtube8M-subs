carefully drop one seed in the center of

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.370 
carefully drop one seed in the center of
each<00:01:11.700> cell

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.860 

now<00:01:17.380> I<00:01:17.410> just<00:01:17.560> need<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.970> put<00:01:18.970> approximately<00:01:19.840> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
what the germination rates will be like

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.500 
what the germination rates will be like
and<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.860> they<00:02:00.010> are<00:02:00.210> under<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.240> light
