00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 no no 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.010
 and more layoffs 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.429
 i 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.740
 those here will be welcome to this video 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.450
 new very special because I who is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.370
 especially since it is long boxing 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.320
 of the camera that well in the editing of 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.120
 collection of each tour and coast and good 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.350
 they are not my hands, it's not my 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.790
 video but you can also see in their 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.470
 screens that I have permission to 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.480
 team art to upload on my channel 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.220
 flight since I saw him a week ago already 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 I said definitely I have to ask 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.450
 his permission because I when I saw the camera 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.980
 television I said anyway that 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.380
 interesting but when you see the price 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.540
 I said no, then, better, I do not want it 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.540
 but later I will comment 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.900
 because I think it's not so bad and price 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.620
 at this point even watching the camera 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.720
 they probably think I'm crazy 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.640
 because if it's a rather high price I think 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.650
 which is about four thousand pesos or five 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.360
 minutes of very safe but good is the 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.910
 camera itself friends 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.140
 as you can see it is very very small it does not give 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.690
 the impression that I can record in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.759
 1080p but as I say experience 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.229
 yourselves are going to see the quality is 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.970
 a button that we have so they can 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.040
 put what is the 4 gig card 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.960
 which is included even for 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.820
 that connect the cables that come 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.380
 be there is a power button and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.320
 off I'm going to tell you there are two 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.030
 but he came to appreciate that it is nothing more 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.520
 in this case it is the same to do 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.850
 and turn off after that we have three 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.830
 stands the first one is static the second 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.229
 but in the first moves the second 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.580
 what is this is static and the third is 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.200
 the same as the second with the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.450
 Unlike having a sticker below 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.250
 it occurs to me that this may be this is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.290
 can serve as to serve the crazy 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.180
 imagine that they go on their skateboard what 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.650
 they stick or they stick their camera in the helmet 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.660
 imagine the videos that they can do 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.160
 friends be amazing after that 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.979
 we have the cable that he mentioned to them 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.479
 while and also the memory of 4 gb to me 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.000
 I liked it too as I tell you 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.160
 the price is not a memory of 8 of 16 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.930
 but but in the end friends is what's coming 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.060
 obviously also they could not miss 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.649
 the instructive and now it is the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.420
 quality of the camera that is in this 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.850
 moment still does not convince me much more 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.160
 go ahead when topic goes to your yard not 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.260
 I know it because it will appreciate a little 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.480
 better and now I'm going to take advantage of 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.760
 tell you because I think this camera 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.840
 it's worth it but before that the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.850
 I invite you to put the video in 1080p 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.190
 so that they reach, by the way, the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.510
 better definition and now yes friends like 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.940
 can see is a camera that has a 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.530
 fisheye effect fisheye is a 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.060
 lens that in itself is 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.370
 very, very expensive when I was studying 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.900
 audiovisual production this was the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.300
 things that I managed to learn before 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.980
 get out of that career that's why a lens 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.860
 but as I say very, very pro 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.350
 medicated and talking about 5000 up 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.780
 then it is a camera that effectively 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.640
 ok is not the same quality as a canon 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.370
 of 3 yo that one nor with what I know 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.170
 but of that effect and you go is father not 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.209
 have a viewing angle of more than 180 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.580
 degrees that look like sphere type the the 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.800
 camera is is very father friends that's why 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.239
 I tell them it's not that expensive and finally 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.070
 we have what is the bracelet that also 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.900
 will deny the fact that the laying 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.820
 adjust now if not like black ops 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.620
 is that literally friends I say for the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.170
 with the wrist a bit thick not 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.150
 they have so much trouble but we know that 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.459
 we have a smaller wrist and 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.680
 we have the opportunity to adjust this 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.360
 so you can see is what I liked and 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.830
 Well, friends, I'm leaving, I'm waiting 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.480
 that you liked this video I ask you 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.030
 let them like it because it's a video that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.830
 I think our very safe but I think 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.930
 which is the first video showing this 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.060
 of the Spanish speaking so please 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.340
 they appreciate many independently if 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.560
 they are fanatics or not of caudor and if the 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.540
 video served as information 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.580
 helps decide to leave their like and good and 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.239
 I say goodbye and they give us just following 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.239
 video bay
