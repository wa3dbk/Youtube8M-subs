00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
lot more in here I haven't had a lot of

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.710 
lot more in here I haven't had a lot of
course<00:01:52.640> when<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.850> video<00:01:53.119> cameras<00:01:53.479> on<00:01:53.600> it

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
course when the video cameras on it

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.870 
course when the video cameras on it
never<00:01:53.899> works<00:01:54.280> but<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.369> program<00:01:55.700> actually

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
never works but the program actually

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.279 
never works but the program actually
works<00:01:56.210> better<00:01:56.330> than<00:01:56.570> this<00:01:56.690> let's<00:01:56.960> keep<00:01:57.110> trying

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
works better than this let's keep trying

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:07.390 
works better than this let's keep trying
here

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.660 

my

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:31.920 

let's<00:02:15.240> get<00:02:15.420> me

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.440 

I<00:02:32.189> can't<00:02:33.189> get<00:02:33.370> Jake<00:02:33.640> let's<00:02:33.939> try<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:37.329> I

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
I can't get Jake let's try this and I

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.780 
I can't get Jake let's try this and I
being<00:02:38.290> come<00:02:38.829> from<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.099> legal<00:02:39.250> background<00:02:39.489> I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
being come from a legal background I

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.759 
being come from a legal background I
have<00:02:39.939> very<00:02:40.359> terrible<00:02:40.870> handwriting<00:02:41.200> but<00:02:41.650> you

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
have very terrible handwriting but you

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.000 
have very terrible handwriting but you
can<00:02:41.920> see<00:02:42.359> how<00:02:43.359> this<00:02:43.540> could<00:02:43.780> really<00:02:44.049> develop

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
can see how this could really develop

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.890 
can see how this could really develop
into<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> program<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.909> could<00:02:46.000> be<00:02:46.150> very<00:02:46.480> handy

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
into a program that could be very handy

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.379 
into a program that could be very handy
to<00:02:47.829> return<00:02:48.219> here<00:02:48.519> again<00:02:50.549> is<00:02:51.549> that<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:51.909> return

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
to return here again is that the return

00:02:52.389 --> 00:03:00.030 
to return here again is that the return
right<00:02:52.629> here<00:02:53.819> no<00:02:54.819> that's<00:02:55.030> not<00:02:55.209> working<00:02:57.569> as<00:02:59.040> you

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.589 
can see i'm not very good there's a
return<00:03:02.319> is<00:03:02.439> looking<00:03:02.709> for<00:03:03.329> basically<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.419> can

return is looking for basically you can

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.300 
return is looking for basically you can
go<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> lot<00:03:08.139> of<00:03:08.169> people<00:03:08.310> really

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.219 
so essentially when you're doing emails
or<00:03:39.489> whatever<00:03:39.819> if<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.120> prefer<00:03:40.569> handwriting<00:03:41.169> or

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
or whatever if you prefer handwriting or

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.289 
or whatever if you prefer handwriting or
if<00:03:41.349> you<00:03:41.470> even<00:03:41.500> have<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.859> stylus<00:03:42.370> pen<00:03:42.669> or

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
if you even have a stylus pen or

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.610 
if you even have a stylus pen or
something<00:03:43.449> like<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:43.780> would<00:03:44.079> even<00:03:44.470> work

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
something like that would even work

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.189 
something like that would even work
better<00:03:44.859> than<00:03:45.069> my<00:03:45.519> fat<00:03:45.790> fingers<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.750> can<00:03:46.930> say

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
better than my fat fingers you can say

00:03:47.199 --> 00:04:06.059 
better than my fat fingers you can say
hello<00:03:53.939> let's<00:03:54.939> meet

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.920 

what's<00:04:07.069> that

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:21.009 

tonight

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.780 

and<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.530> goes<00:04:22.680> ahead<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.040> types<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:23.520> for

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
and it goes ahead and types it in for

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.030 
and it goes ahead and types it in for
you<00:04:23.870> like<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:24.990> said<00:04:25.230> my<00:04:25.380> fat<00:04:25.590> fingers<00:04:25.740> aren't

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
you like I said my fat fingers aren't

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.160 
you like I said my fat fingers aren't
having<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.340> lot<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.580> luck<00:04:26.930> giving<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.020> an

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
having a lot of luck giving you an

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.490 
having a lot of luck giving you an
example<00:04:28.530> but<00:04:28.770> basically<00:04:29.160> if<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.930> can<00:04:31.140> spell

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
example but basically if you can spell

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.130 
example but basically if you can spell
it<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:31.950> either<00:04:32.610> cursive<00:04:33.270> or<00:04:33.450> in<00:04:33.690> bass<00:04:33.840> can

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
it and either cursive or in bass can

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.570 
it and either cursive or in bass can
writing<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.560> will<00:04:34.710> type<00:04:34.920> it<00:04:35.100> out<00:04:35.190> for<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.520> and

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
writing it will type it out for you and

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.640 
writing it will type it out for you and
I<00:04:35.670> think<00:04:35.760> you<00:04:36.420> know<00:04:36.540> this<00:04:36.810> program<00:04:37.260> as<00:04:37.470> it

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
I think you know this program as it

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.290 
I think you know this program as it
develops<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.190> being<00:04:38.400> given<00:04:38.490> away<00:04:38.700> free<00:04:39.090> right

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
develops is being given away free right

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700 
develops is being given away free right
now<00:04:39.330> they<00:04:39.660> want<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.080> test<00:04:40.290> if<00:04:40.440> they<00:04:40.530> want

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
now they want you to test if they want

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.470 
now they want you to test if they want
you<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.890> give<00:04:41.010> them<00:04:41.190> feedback<00:04:41.400> could<00:04:42.120> really

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
you to give them feedback could really

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.000 
you to give them feedback could really
be<00:04:42.600> an<00:04:42.720> exciting<00:04:42.990> app<00:04:43.290> for<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.530> iPhone

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
be an exciting app for the iPhone

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.560 
be an exciting app for the iPhone
because<00:04:44.730> a<00:04:44.760> lot<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:44.970> people<00:04:45.090> can<00:04:45.360> write

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
because a lot of people can write

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.260 
because a lot of people can write
cursive<00:04:45.960> Lee<00:04:46.290> or<00:04:46.500> even<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:47.520> know<00:04:47.550> just<00:04:47.820> basic

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
cursive Lee or even you know just basic

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.090 
cursive Lee or even you know just basic
letters<00:04:48.660> much<00:04:48.960> faster<00:04:49.410> than<00:04:49.560> they<00:04:49.680> can<00:04:49.740> type

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
letters much faster than they can type

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.340 
letters much faster than they can type
on<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:51.000> keyboard<00:04:51.180> I've<00:04:51.570> become<00:04:51.840> pretty<00:04:51.990> quick

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
on the keyboard I've become pretty quick

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.990 
on the keyboard I've become pretty quick
on<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.620> keyboard<00:04:53.040> but<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:53.310> still<00:04:53.580> find<00:04:53.820> this

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
on the keyboard but I still find this

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.930 
on the keyboard but I still find this
program<00:04:54.480> very<00:04:55.380> interesting<00:04:56.040> let's<00:04:56.430> go<00:04:56.730> down

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
program very interesting let's go down

how<00:05:31.370> you<00:05:32.370> know<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.520> learn<00:05:32.850> the<00:05:33.030> program<00:05:33.240> and

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
how you know to learn the program and

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.400 
how you know to learn the program and
overall<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:35.550> know<00:05:35.640> the<00:05:35.760> program<00:05:36.380> has<00:05:37.380> a

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
overall the you know the program has a

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.290 
overall the you know the program has a
heck<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.890> a<00:05:37.979> lot<00:05:38.100> of<00:05:38.160> potential<00:05:38.520> I<00:05:38.820> think<00:05:39.120> and

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
heck of a lot of potential I think and

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:47.330 
heck of a lot of potential I think and
it's<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:40.640> fun<00:05:41.990> to<00:05:42.990> use<00:05:43.430> or<00:05:44.430> Finn<00:05:45.360> if<00:05:45.950> you<00:05:46.950> have<00:05:47.130> my

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
it's a fun to use or Finn if you have my

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.969 
it's a fun to use or Finn if you have my
handwriting<00:05:50.300> but<00:05:51.300> overall<00:05:52.140> I<00:05:52.290> would<00:05:52.560> say<00:05:52.710> this

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
handwriting but overall I would say this

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.740 
handwriting but overall I would say this
application<00:05:53.610> has<00:05:53.640> a<00:05:53.760> lot<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.030> potential<00:05:54.390> a<00:05:54.600> lot

mine obviously the program does have a

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
little bit of work to be done on it but
