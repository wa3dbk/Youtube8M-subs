performance is what they are gunning for

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.039 
performance is what they are gunning for
but<00:03:18.220> honestly<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:19.120> doesn't<00:03:19.480> look<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.019> bad

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
but honestly it doesn't look so bad

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.860 
but honestly it doesn't look so bad
either<00:03:20.530> from<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.519> sides<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:22.090> seems<00:03:22.600> like<00:03:22.840> a

look<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.410> little<00:03:34.560> closer<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.610> will<00:03:35.760> notice

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
look a little closer and you will notice

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.270 
look a little closer and you will notice
the<00:03:36.300> icons<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.900> decks<00:03:37.200> are<00:03:37.410> smaller<00:03:37.950> and

the icons and decks are smaller and

the icons and decks are smaller and

sharper than those on the galaxy s2 and

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.700 
sharper than those on the galaxy s2 and
that's<00:03:41.550> because<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.090> xolo<00:03:42.360> x900<00:03:43.290> has<00:03:43.680> a

that's because the xolo x900 has a

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.550 
that's because the xolo x900 has a

which is really impressive to test the

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
processor for its performance we decided

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.790 
processor for its performance we decided

to turn to games and videos first up was
a<00:03:58.860> car<00:03:59.190> racing<00:03:59.610> game<00:03:59.640> which<00:04:00.270> is<00:04:00.390> not<00:04:00.570> bad<00:04:00.600> in

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
terms of graphics then we decided to

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.750 
terms of graphics then we decided to

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
took Intel so long to come up with that

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.379 
took Intel so long to come up with that
first<00:06:27.840> smartphone<00:06:28.410> given<00:06:29.190> that<00:06:29.389> the

first smartphone given that the

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.689 
first smartphone given that the

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
smartphone segment and given that it's

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.400 
smartphone segment and given that it's
still<00:06:34.860> in<00:06:35.010> its<00:06:35.130> nascent<00:06:35.250> stage<00:06:35.900> I'm<00:06:36.900> not<00:06:37.110> too

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
still in its nascent stage I'm not too

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.590 
still in its nascent stage I'm not too
worried<00:06:37.770> about<00:06:37.860> being<00:06:38.250> late<00:06:38.370> I<00:06:38.820> think<00:06:39.389> what's

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
worried about being late I think what's

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.110 
worried about being late I think what's
important<00:06:40.260> here<00:06:40.350> is<00:06:40.770> to<00:06:41.370> have<00:06:41.610> the<00:06:41.880> right

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
important here is to have the right

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.810 
important here is to have the right
technology<00:06:42.930> that<00:06:43.650> will<00:06:44.039> have<00:06:44.340> the<00:06:44.580> maximum

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
technology that will have the maximum

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.629 
technology that will have the maximum
impact<00:06:45.570> on<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:46.020> user<00:06:46.229> experience<00:06:46.680> and<00:06:47.070> that's

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
impact on the user experience and that's

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.510 
impact on the user experience and that's
what<00:06:47.910> we<00:06:48.030> needed<00:06:48.210> to<00:06:48.360> do<00:06:48.600> and<00:06:48.979> I'm<00:06:49.979> pretty

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
what we needed to do and I'm pretty

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.550 
what we needed to do and I'm pretty
comfortable<00:06:50.789> that<00:06:51.449> the<00:06:51.600> roadmap<00:06:52.110> that<00:06:52.139> we

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
comfortable that the roadmap that we

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.310 
comfortable that the roadmap that we
have<00:06:52.830> in<00:06:53.130> the<00:06:53.520> smartphone<00:06:53.880> space<00:06:54.389> will<00:06:54.990> allow

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
have in the smartphone space will allow

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.439 
have in the smartphone space will allow
us<00:06:55.350> to<00:06:55.650> do<00:06:55.770> that<00:06:55.800> it<00:06:56.370> will<00:06:56.669> allow<00:06:56.789> us<00:06:56.970> to<00:06:57.300> bring

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449 
us to do that it will allow us to bring

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:00.710 
us to do that it will allow us to bring
the<00:06:57.750> best<00:06:57.780> of<00:06:58.620> Intel<00:06:59.160> technologies<00:06:59.880> into<00:07:00.510> this

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
the best of Intel technologies into this

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.710 
the best of Intel technologies into this
segment<00:07:01.310> and<00:07:02.310> be<00:07:02.550> able<00:07:02.699> to<00:07:03.000> provide<00:07:03.180> users

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
segment and be able to provide users

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.540 
segment and be able to provide users
with<00:07:03.750> an<00:07:04.050> experience<00:07:04.680> that's<00:07:05.039> better<00:07:05.340> than

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
with an experience that's better than

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.870 
with an experience that's better than
what<00:07:05.580> they<00:07:05.880> are<00:07:06.030> getting<00:07:06.270> so<00:07:07.310> not<00:07:08.310> too<00:07:08.520> worried

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 
what they are getting so not too worried

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.550 
what they are getting so not too worried
about<00:07:08.940> playing<00:07:09.449> catch-up<00:07:09.720> I<00:07:10.110> think<00:07:10.410> what's

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
about playing catch-up I think what's

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.409 
about playing catch-up I think what's
important<00:07:11.130> here<00:07:11.190> is<00:07:11.400> whenever<00:07:11.699> you<00:07:12.030> come<00:07:12.270> and

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 
important here is whenever you come and

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:13.700 
important here is whenever you come and
you<00:07:12.539> need<00:07:12.720> to<00:07:12.870> have<00:07:12.990> a<00:07:13.020> differentiating

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
you need to have a differentiating

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.800 
you need to have a differentiating
strategy<00:07:14.190> and<00:07:14.610> you<00:07:14.970> need<00:07:15.150> to<00:07:15.330> have<00:07:15.450> a<00:07:15.510> product

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
strategy and you need to have a product

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.050 
strategy and you need to have a product
that<00:07:16.020> is<00:07:16.139> good<00:07:16.470> right<00:07:17.070> and<00:07:17.310> the<00:07:17.910> right

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
that is good right and the right

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.480 
that is good right and the right
ecosystem<00:07:18.780> so<00:07:19.139> I<00:07:19.470> think<00:07:19.830> we<00:07:19.950> it's<00:07:20.130> all<00:07:20.340> the

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
ecosystem so I think we it's all the

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.279 
ecosystem so I think we it's all the
pieces<00:07:20.700> of<00:07:21.000> the<00:07:21.090> puzzle<00:07:21.120> have<00:07:21.599> fallen<00:07:21.990> well<00:07:22.139> in

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:22.289 
pieces of the puzzle have fallen well in

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:24.770 
pieces of the puzzle have fallen well in
place<00:07:22.500> together<00:07:22.849> performance<00:07:23.849> I<00:07:23.940> agree<00:07:24.419> Intel

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
place together performance I agree Intel

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.150 
place together performance I agree Intel
is<00:07:24.930> up<00:07:25.050> there<00:07:25.200> with<00:07:25.260> performance<00:07:25.800> what<00:07:26.039> about

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 
is up there with performance what about

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.100 
is up there with performance what about
battery<00:07:26.700> life<00:07:26.729> because<00:07:27.360> most<00:07:27.599> of<00:07:27.690> these<00:07:27.780> smart

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110 
battery life because most of these smart

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.690 
battery life because most of these smart
