00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
dipping out now you don't want to go a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.729 
dipping out now you don't want to go a
little<00:00:36.000> bit<00:00:36.450> further<00:00:36.660> than<00:00:36.870> tip<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.680> is

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
little bit further than tip this is

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.889 
little bit further than tip this is
useful<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.190> several<00:00:38.640> reasons<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.420> once

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
useful for several reasons because once

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.209 
useful for several reasons because once
your<00:00:40.050> nail<00:00:40.170> starts<00:00:40.530> growing<00:00:40.739> its<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
your nail starts growing its going to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.139 
your nail starts growing its going to
look<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> little<00:00:41.520> bit<00:00:41.730> old

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
look a little bit old

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.360 
look a little bit old
once<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.660> actual<00:00:42.960> nail<00:00:43.530> bed<00:00:43.800> starts<00:00:44.190> shining

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
once the actual nail bed starts shining

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.389 
once the actual nail bed starts shining
so<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> go<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.210> bit<00:00:45.420> further

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
so you want to go a little bit further

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.680 
so you want to go a little bit further
as<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> color<00:00:48.180> doesn't<00:00:48.480> stick

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
as you can see the color doesn't stick

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.940 
as you can see the color doesn't stick
forever<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.200> you're<00:00:49.320> probably<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> have

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
forever so you're probably going to have

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.290 
forever so you're probably going to have
to<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> few<00:00:50.550> coats<00:00:50.789> waiting<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.420> between

blue and although it doesn't look much
darker<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> lighting

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
darker it is it's just the lighting
