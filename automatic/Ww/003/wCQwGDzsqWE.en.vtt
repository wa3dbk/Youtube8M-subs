00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.649
 Hello dear friends with you necrosis 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.260
 and today I will show you really 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.090
 something special 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.839
 remember sometime I thought about how 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.080
 it would be cool if in mortal kombat x 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.180
 it was the fatality of the scorpion from the first part 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.500
 where he took off his mask and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.050
 from the skull set fire to the enemy with fire 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.940
 introduced friends introduced classic fatalities 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.500
 in honor of this i am doing this vidos and 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.000
 at the same time I will choose the classic 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 character costumes 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.430
 that everything looked classic 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 so the third classic fatality 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.440
 scorpion is done up up two almost 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.920
 as in the first part just up there 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.920
 up doing 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.330
 up up 2 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.380
 how do you think of my super-duper 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.710
 chic i think 10 surprised not 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.890
 Crosses from 10 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.979
 Now we will look further now 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.979
 Sabro Zero will retaliate for their clan 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.979
 scorpion 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.689
 if not subscribers by the way 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.819
 today's vidosa would not be because 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:47.170
 what exactly the subscriber told me about 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:52.840
 I donâ€™t know why but until now 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.649
 I somehow did not notice either today 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.219
 this supplement came out whether it has long been 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.720
 It was uploaded to the incentive that 1 0 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:06.880
 3 but even it is not believed so friends then 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.650
 the most classic pulling 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:21.640
 spine forward-down forward 2 up but 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:25.060
 in my opinion, this was done rather quickly 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.250
 done faster than usual but this 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.260
 here everything should be a classic 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.560
 simple and tasteful 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.639
 I like though of course fatalities 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.880
 scorpion cooler sorry lovers 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.880
 sub Zero 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:48.180
 next we look at johnny cage too 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.180
 take a classic suit 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.790
 if he is of course but I do not have it 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.280
 the most classic version is probably 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.790
 all the same tournament because the team is not 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:12.730
 fits and take some 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.730
 but not for the classic reptile let's say 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.950
 decapitation 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.340
 near forward forward down up very 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.340
 easy 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:47.360
 also very quickly notice gestures and postures 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.300
 and gestures and postures are exactly the same as in 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.370
 the first part especially you will notice 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.320
 when i show you last 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.260
 classic fatalities in this set 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.150
 called fatality classic until one 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.040
 it seems he came out 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.630
 I repeat, I may not say it 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.450
 By the way, I honestly do not remember in honor 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:15.410
 the appearance of a predator is true I do not know with what 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.440
 this is why it was done that way but 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.580
 apparently predator and the old school and type 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.510
 classic fatality is also an old school 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.790
 so sleepy blade 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.360
 and if you call a classic suit for her 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:34.700
 it should be 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:43.970
 mk1 yes cool yes this is that sony 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:49.490
 the very first mortal kombat I don't know 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:52.690
 John Nicky graze will do so 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.960
 by the way can be a classic shark has 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:01.240
 no he has no classics no carl weathers 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.240
 such a suit is interesting to have jax 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:03.719
 about 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:12.099
 classic raiden tournament costume then 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:13.289
 there is a tournament when it just started on 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.329
 deadly duel 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:22.049
 let him be such a raiden and he is 

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:27.909
 classic if i'm not mistaken we will do 

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:31.029
 here in the heavenly temple here now I 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:33.219
 I'll show you sony fatalities and see 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:38.259
 pay attention to winning rack she 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:40.659
 that's exactly the same as the first 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:46.929
 parts on a suit look he is fine 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:49.409
 traced super ska kiss that death 

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:52.629
 the most legendary kiss 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.819
 who passed from generation to 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.739
 generation from first second to third 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:01.449
 my 

00:05:55.739 --> 00:06:05.279
 up and up back down and away 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.279
 apparently through the block somehow began to do 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:13.279
 also pretty simple posture 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:21.080
 the only thing I somehow didn't notice myself 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:25.589
 kiss and did not hear the sound of it than the eye 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.360
 but I already find fault with it a little 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:29.550
 all friends are very personal to me 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.389
 I liked it I was pleased I hope you 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:36.110
 also if so put your finger up 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:39.089
 subscribe to my channel and 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:43.669
