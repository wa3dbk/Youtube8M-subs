00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.740
 today we are going to talk about one of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.790
 the best 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.910
 simulation all times to do poco eat 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.910
 something 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.820
 hey, I think, was quite a floor 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.350
 horses because I remember that with my 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.440
 last year 2013 came one 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.600
 rollercoaster tycoon out for the 3ds me 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.690
 was really so oh my god who is shoe 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.670
 I used to be so horrible 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.710
 it and then it turned out to be those 3ds 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.150
 verses to be really super cup and now 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.600
 so we have about rollercoaster tycoon 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.540
 one and now I change my mind again 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.520
 what do you mean what is not it 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.140
 is her late it would say 8 years 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.310
 think eight received eight years ago 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.620
 ago was just a thing with 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.470
 simulators in the eye a bit 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.790
 do you live coach tycoon you had 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.620
 I think even a fucking cruise 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.479
 cruise ship tycoon 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.520
 yes yes we had suddenly what the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.470
 was such an incredible hype and I seemed 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.600
 or as I still went to the Bart Smit 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.210
 or any other random store and me 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.009
 saw that row with simulator 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.300
 that was one of the first to be short as 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.040
 roller coaster tycoon it was just 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.369
 I even had such a great game 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.259
 before that I downloaded the demo and 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.569
 this concept is just very simple 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.130
 just have quite park that you get here 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.940
 do you have space 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.250
 construction area own parking now that is possible 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.560
 incredible depth of yours from that on 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.539
 just you can build your own roller coasters 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.780
 and your goal is ultimately to 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.660
 successful tycoon or meet so that the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.500
 successful company as the canal 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.350
 heart to build 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.750
 yes amusement park indeed but and there 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.580
 is it just what the game is so cool 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.350
 is that you also just total 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.450
 so could not have so you could have one 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.950
 rollercoaster make that was not entirely off 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.160
 one the all people died on you 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.289
 chance of putting on a piece of water and 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.030
 went is we drink or your own pathetic 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.950
 make sure they all went puke in you 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.050
 park and don't clean up there, you know 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.959
 arms of that shit that makes it whole 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.160
 cool that say Yeah right of the goal 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.410
 the game is very clear 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.209
 but the freedom therein is quite high 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.920
 red you know and that keeps the 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.590
 I think yes and indeed attention 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.940
 I must say so 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.290
 if i do i do it before had it 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.390
 I also often get it from my classmates 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.520
 convinced 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.800
 it was still primary school and we 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.840
 always discussed the situations of 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.520
 yo what do you have today in your amusement park 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.680
 done you know it was really me 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.540
 I built a roller coaster that really just 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.550
 impossible is you up down 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.470
 then goes up again and I used one 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.990
 water is built and then it falls 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.340
 things and everyone dead in chaos 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.590
 and that was a bit of the power 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.380
 the same incidentally myopia koen 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.750
 a little bit of construction fence stops a tigress and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.580
 throw what people went and then you are there 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.130
 to laugh 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.150
 18 computer also includes pixels you drove 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.010
 but 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.230
 but I said good is just very cool 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.959
 yes what i say very honest they come 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.530
 today with rollercoaster tycoon 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.480
 a 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.160
 on the ipad I would kill that shit 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.230
 really play it up to him 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.720
 I finish such a one I find very cool 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.110
 give up with at 3 I know I deeply 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.970
 also played and was a whole kind of 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.530
 step forward so you look now 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.660
 probably is a very fun game 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.280
 but goodies of expensive I have always found that 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.820
 you in a kind of first person maud 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.980
 could sit 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.440
 john and then you really say cargo selge 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.209
 as if you were the instant one people so fat 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.290
 because if you build your own roller coaster one 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.700
 all impossible things 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.799
 but in the end we had to go too 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.049
 click where you bolt at the starting point 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.579
 starting position and the end must always be 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.739
 initially fit which is still 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.750
 a challenge a spark it was so cool 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.390
 just be the first person camera 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.519
 just my own roller coaster 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.110
 do you really know about it or whatever 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.420
 So it was great that she was finally real 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.670
 things like disney land and six for ajax 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.070
 and all that amusement park because they were in the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.600
 game after made by their own name and then 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.269
 You actually come to follow your skin 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.760
 us but where a serious offer from 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.230
 from users who had it that you 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.420
 a list the cage they download somewhere 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.489
 and that you back then already that ever 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.530
 still six flags indeed and that you really 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.140
 just all that cool de robin soot and 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.820
 follow my de and welcome you to by 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.200
 I would know I am much better but that 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.000
 were all recreated and a sperm whale 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.979
 so that you could actually do it 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.180
 just all existing wondering why you 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.240
 just to build in the end you could 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.700
 a cruel epic fucking but what 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.680
 what him what the word she says with 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.030
 graphic disadvantage 3 would indeed not 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.370
 more so very good looking because there with 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.669
 try them from the pixel there earth 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.470
 but why is the game what I am 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.199
 it really would not mind useful 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.790
 but that is because of that pixel 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.199
 style what I remember even 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.710
 in the past with my classmates 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.300
 what a fucking big a4 or a5 beer and 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.030
 we just went to the amusement park there 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.010
 t yes ok yes that is kind of too much 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.930
 it wants to add not done but soon 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.520
 so then you don't just have your own 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.979
 amusement park but also your own 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.440
 designs that was almost I think I think so 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.910
 a little bit comes to play these days 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.800
 just no longer that they are games and that is 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.510
 very unfortunate well one side but if you 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.039
 marries in new sweet could yes exactly 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.900
 but indeed on that side it 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.660
 just doesn't work anymore 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.340
 to that is more 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.800
 and I thought it was about that time 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.080
 at rollercoaster Tycoon 3 she approached 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.820
 so from the pixel like really from 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.910
 seen from above that amusement park 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.800
 and when it was thus increasingly so as steam 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.410
 park that you can really walk through 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.120
 and I know what realistic 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.250
 or so and a little to do it 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.169
 for me not for the site of many or 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.000
 mask like that when I look back 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.320
 then I think it works pretty little 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.970
 played 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.669
 already and I really have to 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.260
 mention you had what can secretly be 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.710
 right and expension pack 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.570
 a good water park does oh yes yes again 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.280
 games that didn't and could really sort of 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.860
 make giant slide i am 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.110
 obsessed with kind of slides in it 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.120
 in pools tick super cool and had right 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.080
 kind of a hoop very went to like that 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.669
 down 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.699
 i know then that made i thought of 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.830
 wow this is this just external she is too 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.960
 fucking the rain of blue catty 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.910
 little played but I dare is high at 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.770
 dare to guarantee that I am sand and 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.080
 he is running and installed 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.610
 then you will sit here until about the 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.590
 yes, but I still think so too 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.150
 great I think that's a shame nowadays 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.490
 that they are games in which the age of 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.560
 empires and you have good eating spare parts 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.610
 for aids they must see how suddenly 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.320
 is my police 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.300
 but I really find such goodies 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.930
 Game Good thing you want from store 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.580
 more info chance tycoon yes very good 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.740
 memories i think look i think 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.510
 that every look this looks what i am 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.740
 tomorrow so different and I think I want 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.310
 let's see if you played it 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.110
 that I 'm already quite curious 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.090
 and let me know you have bread glasses 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.980
 played then I have 1 and I really have 2 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.890
 all in all well you had a motts move 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.140
 with three extensions analysis' henry 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.820
 and that was a bit no I think of 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.680
 that new generation depends on three 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.540
 has tried through but I recommend it 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.790
 are not more games nowadays huh 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.680
 but from then on indeed good as 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.630
 you don't care that you indicate your red 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.400
 have played then I will play one 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.170
 plus you press on coming this way I am 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.390
 you know nice filming 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.670
 well there now people indeed chose 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.220
 tycoon 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.390
 something like a bad london well i am 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.780
 I'm just trying to watch them 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.370
 go away okay i think it goes 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.820
 to happen 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.820
 get out of my way
