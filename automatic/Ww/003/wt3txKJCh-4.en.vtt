00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.670 

in<00:00:00.329> this<00:00:00.450> series<00:00:00.810> we<00:00:01.050> are<00:00:01.079> going<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.589> be

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
in this series we are going to be

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.220 
in this series we are going to be
learning<00:00:01.800> how<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.100> create<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.939> to-do<00:00:03.600> list<00:00:03.629> app

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
learning how to create a to-do list app

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.639 
learning how to create a to-do list app
with<00:00:04.830> PHP<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.990> we're<00:00:06.990> going<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.140> take<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> look

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
with PHP and we're going to take a look

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.400 
with PHP and we're going to take a look
also<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.790> next<00:00:09.090> video<00:00:09.480> how<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.809> style<00:00:10.290> up

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
also in the next video how to style up

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.190 
also in the next video how to style up
the<00:00:10.559> front<00:00:10.889> end<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.910> looks<00:00:12.090> like<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.570> you

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the front end so it looks like this you

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.509 
the front end so it looks like this you
don't<00:00:13.290> obviously<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.309> you

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
don't obviously have to do that you

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.550 
don't obviously have to do that you
might<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.849> your<00:00:14.969> own<00:00:15.179> design<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:16.320> we'll<00:00:16.440> be

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
might have your own design but we'll be

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 
might have your own design but we'll be
doing<00:00:16.740> both<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.340> can<00:00:17.490> choose<00:00:17.820> whether<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
doing both so you can choose whether to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.570 
doing both so you can choose whether to
skip<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.869> last<00:00:18.990> part<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.070> will<00:00:20.430> be

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
skip to the last part what we will be

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.910 
skip to the last part what we will be
focusing<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.600> PHP<00:00:22.140> side<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.590> things

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
focusing on just the PHP side of things

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.950 
focusing on just the PHP side of things
and<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.180> video<00:00:24.359> we're<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
and in this video we're going to have a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.689 
and in this video we're going to have a
look<00:00:25.080> at<00:00:25.230> how<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.500> works<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.220> important<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
look at how this works it's important to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.759 
look at how this works it's important to
note<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.119> does<00:00:27.390> simulate<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> user<00:00:28.470> being

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
note this does simulate a user being

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.980 
note this does simulate a user being
signed<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> don't<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.689> include

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
signed in but you don't have to include

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.630 
signed in but you don't have to include
this<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.560> could<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.980> use<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:32.579> own

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this you could just use it for your own

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.569 
this you could just use it for your own
to-do<00:00:33.270> list<00:00:33.540> or<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:34.410> course<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.770> build<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
to-do list or of course just build it to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.139 
to-do list or of course just build it to
learn<00:00:35.730> more<00:00:36.000> about<00:00:36.059> PHP<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:38.910> have

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
learn more about PHP so if you do have

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.630 
learn more about PHP so if you do have
some<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.020> sign-in<00:00:40.640> authentication

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
some kind of sign-in authentication

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.819 
some kind of sign-in authentication
system<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.780> hook<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.559> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
system you can hook it up to this so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.549 
system you can hook it up to this so
when<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.309> set<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.760> user<00:00:45.030> ID<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.780> perhaps

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
when you do set your user ID in perhaps

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.459 
when you do set your user ID in perhaps
a<00:00:46.950> session<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.629> you'll<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.320> can

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
a session here you'll know that you can

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.100 
a session here you'll know that you can
use<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.579> user<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.750> case<00:00:51.930> it's

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
use that as the user in this case it's

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.810 
use that as the user in this case it's
user<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.250> take<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.550> inside

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
user one if we just take a look inside

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
user one if we just take a look inside
of<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:54.030> database<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.320> Alex<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:55.920> if

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of my database this will be Alex but if

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.500 
of my database this will be Alex but if
we<00:00:56.100> did<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.399> say<00:00:56.670> another<00:00:56.879> record<00:00:57.270> called

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
we did have say another record called

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
we did have say another record called
Billy<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.500> obviously<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:59.010> Billy<00:00:59.219> signs<00:00:59.550> in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
Billy then obviously if Billy signs in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.689 
Billy then obviously if Billy signs in
this<00:00:59.940> would<00:01:00.120> hold<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.539> user<00:01:00.840> ID<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.199> two

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
this would hold a user ID of two

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.560 
this would hold a user ID of two
well-loved<00:01:02.699> forget<00:01:03.030> about<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.510> now

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
well-loved forget about that for now

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.800 
well-loved forget about that for now
though<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:05.210> let's<00:01:06.210> take<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> look<00:01:06.510> at<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:06.689> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
though so let's take a look at how this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
though so let's take a look at how this
works<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.340> see<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.610> we've

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
works and here you can see that we've

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.390 
works and here you can see that we've
got<00:01:09.000> no<00:01:09.299> items<00:01:09.960> added<00:01:10.200> we've<00:01:10.860> got<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> nice<00:01:11.159> font

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
got no items added we've got a nice font

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.770 
got no items added we've got a nice font
up<00:01:11.610> here<00:01:11.820> which<00:01:11.939> we'll<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.119> including<00:01:12.659> we've

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
up here which we'll be including we've

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
up here which we'll be including we've
got<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> nice<00:01:13.140> body<00:01:13.409> font<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:13.950> well<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.280> we'll

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
got a nice body font as well which we'll

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.100 
got a nice body font as well which we'll
be<00:01:14.520> including<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.840> doing<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
be including I'm going to be doing that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.469 
be including I'm going to be doing that
from<00:01:16.290> google<00:01:16.680> fonts<00:01:17.070> API<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.240> we'll<00:01:18.360> be

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
from google fonts API so we'll be

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.090 
from google fonts API so we'll be
integrating<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> front<00:01:19.409> end<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
integrating that in the front end and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.800 
integrating that in the front end and
we've<00:01:20.280> got<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.549> input<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
we've got this input here which is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.260 
we've got this input here which is
styled<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> pretty<00:01:22.710> much<00:01:22.920> look<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:24.030> one

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
styled to pretty much look like at one

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.179 
styled to pretty much look like at one
of<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> two<00:01:24.689> do's<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.259> underline<00:01:25.830> here

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
of the two do's with this underline here

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.760 
of the two do's with this underline here
we<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.180> type<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.630> new<00:01:27.750> item<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.380> so

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
we can just type a new item in here so

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.170 
we can just type a new item in here so
we<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:28.979> type<00:01:29.159> anything<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.909> could<00:01:30.030> say

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
we can type anything so we could say

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.330 
we can type anything so we could say
something<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.860> go<00:01:31.860> vegan<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.659> hit<00:01:33.810> add

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
something like go vegan and we hit add

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.440 
something like go vegan and we hit add

and you can see now that that's been

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.499 
and you can see now that that's been
listed<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:38.000> let's<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.150> something

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
listed in this to do let's do something

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.340 
listed in this to do let's do something
like<00:01:39.950> turn<00:01:40.950> off<00:01:41.189> lights<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.479> save<00:01:42.659> energy

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
like turn off lights to save energy

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
like turn off lights to save energy
all<00:01:44.070> good<00:01:44.310> things<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> might<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
all good things that you might want to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.800 
all good things that you might want to
do<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:47.130> adds<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.700> well<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.479> so

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
do and that adds that as well up here so

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.679 
do and that adds that as well up here so
what<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.740> also<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.460> hit<00:01:51.119> add<00:01:51.329> that's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
what we can also do is hit add that's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.639 
what we can also do is hit add that's
going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> give<00:01:52.049> us<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.259> little<00:01:52.470> bit<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
going to give us a little bit of

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.770 
going to give us a little bit of
front-end<00:01:53.070> validation<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.750> course

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
front-end validation but we do of course

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.920 
front-end validation but we do of course
have<00:01:54.990> back-end<00:01:55.649> validation<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.399> well<00:01:56.780> just<00:01:57.780> in

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
have back-end validation as well just in

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.630 
have back-end validation as well just in
case<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:59.240> this<00:02:00.240> required<00:02:00.810> attribute<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:02.369> not

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
case is this required attribute is not

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.499 
case is this required attribute is not
supported

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
supported

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.440 
supported
now<00:02:04.439> obviously<00:02:04.920> from<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
now obviously from here you can see that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.869 
now obviously from here you can see that
as<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.630> hover<00:02:06.869> over<00:02:07.229> each<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:07.729> we<00:02:08.729> have

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
as I hover over each of these we have

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.780 
as I hover over each of these we have
this<00:02:09.000> mark<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.599> done<00:02:09.660> option<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.310> example

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
this mark as done option so for example

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.620 
this mark as done option so for example
you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
you

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.320 
you
if<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.840> once<00:02:13.830> mark<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.250> one<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.580> done<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.970> just

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
if I once mark this one is done I just

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.990 
if I once mark this one is done I just
hit<00:02:15.510> mark<00:02:15.780> done<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.710> then<00:02:16.890> hits<00:02:17.520> strike

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
hit mark done and that then hits strike

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.120 
hit mark done and that then hits strike
through<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:19.110> doesn't<00:02:19.380> delete<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
through that it doesn't delete it you

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.560 
through that it doesn't delete it you
can<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.400> ahead<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.640> add<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.180> functionality

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
can go ahead and add the functionality

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.420 
can go ahead and add the functionality
to<00:02:21.840> remove<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.500> from<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.770> list<00:02:22.890> later<00:02:23.190> on

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
to remove it from the list later on

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.310 
to remove it from the list later on
that's<00:02:23.970> really<00:02:24.390> really<00:02:24.690> straightforward<00:02:24.960> to

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
that's really really straightforward to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.890 
that's really really straightforward to
do<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.980> altering<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.940> very<00:02:27.270> small<00:02:27.570> query

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
do just be altering a very small query

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.240 
do just be altering a very small query
and<00:02:28.200> there<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:28.920> go

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
and there we go

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.190 
and there we go
so<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.910> pretty<00:02:30.090> much<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.360> it's<00:02:30.930> really

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
so that is pretty much it it's really

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.320 
so that is pretty much it it's really
simple<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.770> do<00:02:31.920> app<00:02:32.070> we're<00:02:33.000> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.270> be

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
simple to do app we're going to be

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.290 
simple to do app we're going to be
wearing<00:02:33.600> some<00:02:34.340> front<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.550> backing<00:02:35.910> code<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
wearing some front and backing code to

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.240 
wearing some front and backing code to
get<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.510> working<00:02:36.750> let's<00:02:37.680> go<00:02:37.830> ahead<00:02:37.950> and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
get this working let's go ahead and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.590 
get this working let's go ahead and
start<00:02:38.520> with<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> front<00:02:39.000> end<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.360> next

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
start with the front end in the next

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.810 
start with the front end in the next
