00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.440
 show you setting up your 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.990
 microphone I found several videos very 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.059
 at times it was not around 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.390
 I found one that I think I can 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.750
 one better managed to get a kick 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.699
 one because the majority is not the same 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.849
 Setup my computer 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.019
 So I hope this video of ours 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:42.809
 You could only record the video. 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:54.660

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:55.649
 changed the owner of nothing but let's go to the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.670
 what matters 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.180
 You come here as all the talking videos 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.280
 recording device must be clicked 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.420
 here the people on our side I go 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.840
 show so loud in this market 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.259
 as standard and digital audio and from 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.080
 as the first as standard 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.850
 it will get marked this one will stay in 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.560
 according to your device's default 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:31.950
 communication or microphone microphone 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.250
 an audi a default device is what gives 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.070
 right on my these other entries 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.130
 input then what is helping 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.369
 enough and it was that I have a box of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.369
 sound 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:58.920
 mine is from and she has an amplification of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:02.369
 connected sound and the volume also 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.740
 not only did she take it back from the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.920
 I microphone with my headphones 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.819
 with microphone coming 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.290
 it's all built- in internet buy in 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.349
 stores in brazil an average 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.659
 everyone's role is bound to be 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.090
 tax here in Brazil speaks possible but 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.430
 This is not a subject right now, just click on 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.890
 much the microphone twice to attack 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.849
 panel microphones standard panel 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:34.290
 has 3.5 mil connector 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.959
 the zÃ© this device is activated and 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.150
 Go to listen to this device I 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.579
 not like a crowd because my in it 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.980
 time of the video comes out with the voice then 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.470
 came out talking another other voice speaking 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.169
 together then do not like to continue 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.260
 running on a module 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:56.579
 to save energy without 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.220
 positive speaker of entity 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.730
 audio definition in the second option menu 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.919
 I leave this microphone here leaving 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:12.799
 100 percent 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:15.299
 I think better channel 26 20 996 thousand h 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.189
 quality of the studio in the 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.620
 The options I marked is alright. 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.629
 the number has many more options than it is 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.729
 people I was seeing 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.010
 but the chance was good the others did not 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:29.519
 I tested it will also give an ok or 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.290
 to apply it, there comes the sound that you do not 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.389
 You need to do something right. 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.979
 to reproduce the volume of other dreams in 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:43.949
 80% 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:47.099
 I leave nothing and that's it, let's stay with 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:51.449
 a little noise is normal that sometimes 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:53.459
 Mine makes a noise but it's the cpu 's 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.620
 other devices and not interference that 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.720
 is normal and as the room has two 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.459
 computers in a fourth not of my 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:07.019
 brother because my still get a 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.729
 studio but then you can not 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.259
 keep the two founded has been more 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:14.519
 one but let's go 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:16.250
 then when you have gone to a video of the 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.659

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:24.349

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.349
 Oh, you see. 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.069
 nor the noise of the song when you 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.500
 You're not going to be a bad month like this. 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:36.020

 voice I leave 6969 on staff 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.900
 the horrible voice-only game music that is 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:56.110
 better to be more serious than the 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:05:00.560
 well the noise goes away then it's just that they are 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.250
