00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.619
 the calculation and the presentation 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.259
 on the part of the us government try to 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.320
 convey that thon attacks very much 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:31.960
 Precisely, they are terrorists and 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.790
 militants meet what they document 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.620
 not only is the drone 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.200
 kill terrorists but they too 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.719
 many others kill civilians kill 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.280
 They killed women and children 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.280
 are twice to be examined 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.630
 the result of our investigations is 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:01:00.850
 a report titled life 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:03.310
 under drones and we are particular 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.199
 worried about the drone attacks because 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.970
 our own government in this policy 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.189
 is involved and we are of opinion 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.780
 that there is no proper supervision 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.310
 about the operations and the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:23.620
 fundamental decisions about it 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:25.750
 who gets killed when and where we got 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.600
 access to the people in the so-called 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.670
 father region of pakistan that there is one 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.380
 area that is sealed off because that 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.299
 nobody really can 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.460
 we were able to out with people 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.799
 speak this area in one 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.520
 other part of pakistan and afford us 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.520
 gave interviews 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.540
 carlotta cares is with ours 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.540
 motto stoppa winner duo 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.369
 david works with the revision 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.830
 a fact that we find out 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.840
 could was that there are whole villages 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.060
 you are in those areas where 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.220
 The drone sometimes 24 hours a day 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.240
 seven days a week without interruption 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.890
 circle in the sky 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.930
 and these people do not know when 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.890
 These drones attack and they know 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.890
 not whom it will meet 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.200
 as a result , the symptoms of 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.140
 psychological disorders traumata 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.340
 strong anxiety states and 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.230
 behavioral disorder we have stories 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.590
 Of people who are no longer from the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.590
 go house 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:29.230
 the modules are probably better 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.230
 on each other 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.970
 when he becomes the psychiatrist and trains 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.189
 those who treated these symptoms 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.579
 They had us a row 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.569
 Patients have very severe symptoms of 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.730
 Post-traumatic disorders 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.500
 we may not have pakistan 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.420
 open the war explains but the 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.590
 People are taking their northwest Pakistan under 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.790
 live these drones 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.450
 they know that they are in one 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.310
 war zone live one of the things the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.109
 we found out and also documented 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.730
 have been incidents of double per 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.260
 Attack and what in the span of time 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.959
 between the first and the second 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.700
 Attack happened that people were off 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.799
 the neighborhood in or people the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.019
 Nearby were family members 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.209
 or in some cases doctors too 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.150
 have come to those like maybe 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.460
 have survived and become her 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.750
 The next drones will do that 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.580
 people with whom we live in 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.380
 affected areas have almost spoken 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.210
 invariably said that they are after 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.070
 a drone attack no longer to the 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.360
 place of the attack dare and we have 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.010
 even of people belongs to the 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.010
 medical field work out 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.319
 a 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.160
 It has people lying extremely down 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.540
 the usa has made the new york times 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.130
 drone in a recent 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.500
 published article as the new one 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.810
 Guantanamo describes the new tool 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.810
 to become recruits for al-Qaida 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.700
 a statement for several people 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.500
 heard that they did not know 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.020
 What the US was before it threatened 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.550
 because what you know now is the usa 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.550
 Drone death and terror 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.330
 a person we have interviews 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:58.969
 I wondered if people in the US 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.069
 Know what the drone attacks are doing 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:04.039
 that the drone attacks here are civilians 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.719
 and people said we want that 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.429
 her head back goes after her with 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:08.990
 have spoken to us and the people 

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:17.959
 reports what we impact the 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:19.879
 drone policy has with our report 

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:22.249
 do we want to reach the us 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.259
 Population understands that what they do 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.959
 reported on drones does not get 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.669
 right is that drone dead civilians 

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:31.129
 as a result they have the entire 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.860
 terrorize the population and that they 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.929
 be counterproductive on several levels 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.719
 can 

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:40.539
 we have to rethink our politics 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:43.369
 in the face of disastrous results 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:47.709
 the threatening politics on the people 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:47.709
 has to live with that
