anyway<00:00:55.920> here's<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.850> first

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
day instead of my fitness pal for a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.840 
day instead of my fitness pal for a
little<00:01:01.140> bit<00:01:01.320> higher<00:01:01.559> than<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.609> me

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850

and set each macro percentage to as

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
and set each macro percentage to as
close<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> ones<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.619> want

without going under so let's say I want
200<00:01:16.590> grams<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.860> protein<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.220> day<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.610> set<00:01:18.060> my

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
200 grams of protein a day I set my

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.270 
200 grams of protein a day I set my
percentage<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.530> least<00:01:19.770> 200

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
percentage so that it's at least 200

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.980 
percentage so that it's at least 200
grams<00:01:20.460> protein<00:01:20.670> you'll<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.570> why<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
grams protein you'll see why this is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.050 
grams protein you'll see why this is
important<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> second<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.790> change

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
important in just a second I then change

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.940 
important in just a second I then change
the<00:01:24.210> name<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.479> my<00:01:24.600> first<00:01:24.810> meal<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.409> macro

the name of my first meal to macro
profile<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:27.150> i<00:01:27.270> create<00:01:27.330> foods<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
profile and then i create foods that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.600 
profile and then i create foods that
will<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.439> off<00:01:28.650> sense<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.189> each<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.460> my<00:01:29.549> day

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
cutting day which is 200 grams of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.350 
cutting day which is 200 grams of
protein<00:01:45.829> 275<00:01:46.829> grams<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.280> carbs<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.700> 60<00:01:48.149> grams

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
protein 275 grams of carbs and 60 grams

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.109 
protein 275 grams of carbs and 60 grams
fat<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.869> works<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.310> 24<00:01:50.310> 40<00:01:50.700> cavities

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
fat and that works out to 24 40 cavities

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.330 
fat and that works out to 24 40 cavities
so<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.899> make<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> food<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.710> each<00:01:52.890> one<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> these

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so I make a food for each one of these

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.760 
so I make a food for each one of these
and<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:54.299> each<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.659> these<00:01:54.810> foods<00:01:55.140> it's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and in each one of these foods it's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.069 
and in each one of these foods it's
going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.790> number<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.240> calories<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
going to have the number of calories the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.580 
going to have the number of calories the
number<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.909> protein<00:01:59.909> carbs<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.020> fat<00:02:01.290> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
number of protein carbs and fat that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
number of protein carbs and fat that
will<00:02:02.009> subtract<00:02:02.520> from<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> total<00:02:03.270> number<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
will subtract from the total number that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.440 
will subtract from the total number that
i<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.229> 3,500<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.729> will<00:02:05.909> make<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.240> so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
i have one at 3,500 that will make it so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.600 
i have one at 3,500 that will make it so
that<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:06.750> i<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:06.899> remaining<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:08.039> each<00:02:08.429> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
that when i see remaining of each of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.029 
that when i see remaining of each of
them<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.970> works<00:02:09.420> out<00:02:09.569> for<00:02:09.840> me<00:02:09.869> alright<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.770> he's
