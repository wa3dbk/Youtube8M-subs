with<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.540> black<00:05:07.840> eyeliner<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.680> this<00:05:09.310> can<00:05:09.550> be<00:05:09.669> a

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
with a black eyeliner and this can be a

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.420 
with a black eyeliner and this can be a
little<00:05:10.000> hard<00:05:10.270> because<00:05:10.780> your<00:05:11.290> skin<00:05:11.650> kind<00:05:12.220> of

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
little hard because your skin kind of

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.730 
little hard because your skin kind of
pulls<00:05:12.790> as<00:05:13.090> you<00:05:13.270> can<00:05:13.419> tell<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:14.169> just<00:05:14.440> practice

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
pulls as you can tell so just practice

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:35.840 
pulls as you can tell so just practice
before<00:05:15.550> Halloween<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.360> you<00:05:16.540> should<00:05:16.720> be<00:05:16.840> fine

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.660 

so<00:05:36.850> now<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.240> am<00:05:37.630> just<00:05:37.660> using<00:05:38.020> my<00:05:38.440> clinic<00:05:38.980> mascara

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
so now I am just using my clinic mascara

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.570 
so now I am just using my clinic mascara
and<00:05:40.000> applying<00:05:40.780> this<00:05:41.020> on<00:05:41.230> my<00:05:41.470> top<00:05:41.770> lashes<00:05:42.160> and

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
and applying this on my top lashes and

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.640 
and applying this on my top lashes and
I'm<00:05:43.030> not<00:05:43.330> going<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.690> put<00:05:43.900> this<00:05:44.020> on<00:05:44.260> my<00:05:44.470> bottom

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
I'm not going to put this on my bottom

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.680 
I'm not going to put this on my bottom
lashes<00:05:45.040> because<00:05:45.430> I<00:05:45.610> think<00:05:45.970> it'll<00:05:46.120> take<00:05:46.420> away

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
lashes because I think it'll take away

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.990 
lashes because I think it'll take away
the<00:05:47.170> effect<00:05:47.590> of<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:47.950> eyelashes<00:05:48.550> I<00:05:48.700> already

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
the effect of the eyelashes I already

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.210 
the effect of the eyelashes I already
drew<00:05:49.270> on<00:05:49.450> so<00:05:50.170> just<00:05:50.440> put<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:50.740> on<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.980> top<00:05:51.190> and

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
drew on so just put it on the top and

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.060 
drew on so just put it on the top and
