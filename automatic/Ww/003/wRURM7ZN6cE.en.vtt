for you guys and you guys will be some
of<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.559> first<00:00:10.769> people<00:00:10.950> outside<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.179> our<00:00:12.450> team

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
of the first people outside of our team

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:36.670 
of the first people outside of our team
and<00:00:12.990> outside<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.320> Google<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.830> ever<00:00:13.950> ride<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.460> it

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.210 

there's<00:00:37.680> no<00:00:37.860> steering<00:00:38.280> wheel<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.820> there<00:00:43.220> it

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
there's no steering wheel in there it

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.799 
there's no steering wheel in there it
was<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.400> big<00:00:44.610> decision<00:00:44.699> for<00:00:45.120> us<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
was a big decision for us to go and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.270 
was a big decision for us to go and
start<00:00:46.290> building<00:00:46.680> our<00:00:46.800> purpose-built

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
start building our purpose-built

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.070 
start building our purpose-built
vehicles<00:00:47.400> for<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.420> really<00:00:48.870> they're

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
vehicles for this and really they're

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.960 
vehicles for this and really they're
their<00:00:49.350> prototype<00:00:49.769> vehicles<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.790> were<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
their prototype vehicles they were a

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.930 
their prototype vehicles they were a
chance<00:00:51.330> for<00:00:51.570> us<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.739> explore<00:00:52.739> what<00:00:53.670> does<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
chance for us to explore what does it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.100 
chance for us to explore what does it
really<00:00:54.090> mean<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.540> have<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> self-driving

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
really mean to have a self-driving

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.590 
really mean to have a self-driving
vehicle<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> small<00:00:57.059> amount<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.420> time

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
vehicle but in the small amount of time

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
vehicle but in the small amount of time
we've<00:00:57.870> been<00:00:57.989> working<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.070> have

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
we've been working on it and we have

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.830 
we've been working on it and we have
functional<00:00:59.760> prototypes<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.570> exciting

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
functional prototypes and it's exciting

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.060 
functional prototypes and it's exciting
oh<00:01:02.210> it's<00:01:03.210> really<00:01:03.450> cool<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.680> really

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.580

than<00:01:22.759> my<00:01:23.060> own<00:01:23.210> car<00:01:23.479> yes<00:01:24.280> what<00:01:25.280> she<00:01:25.490> really

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
than my own car yes what she really

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.240 
than my own car yes what she really
liked<00:01:26.119> was<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.719> slowed<00:01:27.140> down<00:01:27.469> before<00:01:28.130> it

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
liked was that it slowed down before it

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.580 
liked was that it slowed down before it
went<00:01:28.429> around<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.789> curve<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.119> then<00:01:29.869> accelerated

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
went around a curve and then accelerated

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.010 
went around a curve and then accelerated
in<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.610> curve<00:01:31.850> she's<00:01:32.240> always<00:01:32.450> trying<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.869> get

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
in the curve she's always trying to get

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.020 
in the curve she's always trying to get
me<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.289> do<00:01:33.439> do<00:01:33.799> it<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.130> way<00:01:34.310> that's<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.880> way<00:01:35.000> I

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
me to do do it that way that's the way I

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.330 
me to do do it that way that's the way I
learned<00:01:35.329> in<00:01:35.539> high<00:01:35.689> school<00:01:35.719> drivers<00:01:39.159> so<00:01:40.159> if<00:01:40.250> I

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
learned in high school drivers so if I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.859 
learned in high school drivers so if I
had<00:01:40.459> a<00:01:40.490> self-driving<00:01:40.880> car<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.479> could<00:01:41.659> spend

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
had a self-driving car I could spend

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.080 
had a self-driving car I could spend
more<00:01:41.989> time<00:01:42.049> hanging<00:01:42.950> out<00:01:43.130> with<00:01:43.280> my<00:01:43.399> kids<00:01:43.700> or

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
more time hanging out with my kids or

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.120 
more time hanging out with my kids or

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
I'll be good human feeling of it is very

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.440 
I'll be good human feeling of it is very
well-engineered<00:01:54.739> and<00:01:55.459> it<00:01:55.579> is<00:01:55.759> very<00:01:55.970> smooth

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
well-engineered and it is very smooth

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
concept no our our lives are made up of

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.619 
concept no our our lives are made up of
lots<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.469> lots<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.709> little<00:02:06.890> things<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.579> a<00:02:08.450> lot
