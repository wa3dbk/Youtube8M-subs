one of the tricks that I'd like to share
with<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:22.030> is<00:01:22.240> an<00:01:22.810> old<00:01:22.960> seamstress<00:01:23.680> trick<00:01:24.040> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
with you is an old seamstress trick and

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560 
with you is an old seamstress trick and
if<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.780> look<00:01:26.590> at<00:01:26.770> this<00:01:26.950> very<00:01:27.250> closely<00:01:27.610> if<00:01:28.119> you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
if you look at this very closely if you

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.210 
if you look at this very closely if you
have<00:01:28.720> long<00:01:29.020> fingernails<00:01:29.409> you'll<00:01:29.829> have<00:01:30.040> to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
have long fingernails you'll have to

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.380 
have long fingernails you'll have to
learn<00:01:30.369> to<00:01:30.430> all<00:01:30.640> your<00:01:30.850> fingers<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.240> little

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
learn to all your fingers a little

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.420 
learn to all your fingers a little
differently<00:01:31.960> than<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:32.320> do<00:01:32.380> but<00:01:32.799> it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
differently than I do but it's

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.730 
differently than I do but it's
essentially<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:34.720> are<00:01:34.750> pulling<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.560> thread

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
essentially you are pulling the thread

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.249 
essentially you are pulling the thread
until<00:01:36.130> there's<00:01:36.430> just<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.329> speck<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.840> pepper

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
keep pushing line the needle up so that

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.480 
keep pushing line the needle up so that
the<00:01:45.159> eye<00:01:45.189> is<00:01:45.310> right<00:01:46.210> over<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:47.130> push<00:01:48.130> push<00:01:48.460> push

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
and I'm in if you I'm going to do it one

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.889 
and I'm in if you I'm going to do it one
more<00:01:53.200> time<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:54.820> if<00:01:54.969> you<00:01:55.119> practice<00:01:55.689> this

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
more time because if you practice this

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.410 
more time because if you practice this
you<00:01:56.259> can<00:01:56.500> thread<00:01:56.920> any<00:01:57.189> beading<00:01:57.880> needle<00:01:58.180> with

you can thread any beading needle with

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.670 
you can thread any beading needle with
fire<00:01:58.810> line<00:01:59.140> or<00:01:59.409> thread<00:01:59.799> or<00:02:00.130> wildfire<00:02:01.469> takes<00:02:02.469> a

fire line or thread or wildfire takes a

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.160 
fire line or thread or wildfire takes a
little<00:02:03.460> bit<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.759> practice<00:02:04.180> but<00:02:04.329> not<00:02:04.509> much<00:02:04.750> so

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
little bit of practice but not much so

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.859 
little bit of practice but not much so
I'm<00:02:05.290> squeezing<00:02:05.619> really<00:02:06.100> hard<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
I'm squeezing really hard I have the

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.469 
I'm squeezing really hard I have the
needle<00:02:08.170> over<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.679> bring<00:02:09.519> it<00:02:09.640> on<00:02:09.759> down<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.390> you

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
needle over it bring it on down and you

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.210 
needle over it bring it on down and you
can<00:02:10.630> see<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.340> threaded<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.410> get<00:02:14.650> started

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
can see it's threaded so the get started

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.750 
can see it's threaded so the get started
with<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.489> basic<00:02:15.970> herringbone<00:02:16.390> stitch<00:02:17.760> I'm

going<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.239> using<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.780> double<00:02:20.470> thread<00:02:21.280> today

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.580 
going to be using a double thread today
primarily<00:02:22.359> because<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.139> the

primarily because of the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.110 
primarily because of the

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
begin either of these bracelets we're

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.119 
begin either of these bracelets we're
going<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.290> pick<00:02:35.470> up<00:02:35.500> for<00:02:36.340> beads<00:02:37.920> bring<00:02:38.920> them

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
going to pick up for beads bring them

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.890 
going to pick up for beads bring them
down<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.700> know<00:02:39.879> you're<00:02:40.120> always<00:02:40.330> going<00:02:40.810> to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
down you know you're always going to

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.000 
down you know you're always going to
leave<00:02:41.110> at<00:02:41.290> least<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.769> six<00:02:42.040> inch<00:02:42.280> tail<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.970> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
leave at least a six inch tail and the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.699 
leave at least a six inch tail and the
ladder<00:02:45.010> stitch<00:02:45.430> involves<00:02:46.349> lining<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.440> beads

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
ladder stitch involves lining the beads

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.720 
ladder stitch involves lining the beads
up<00:02:48.180> two<00:02:49.180> by<00:02:49.420> two<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.110> case<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:51.549> the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
up two by two in this case so the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.640 
up two by two in this case so the
easiest<00:02:51.849> way<00:02:52.299> of<00:02:52.330> doing<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:52.989> pass<00:02:53.410> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
easiest way of doing it is pass the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.130 
easiest way of doing it is pass the
needle<00:02:53.799> back<00:02:54.250> up<00:02:54.549> through<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.299> first<00:02:55.599> two

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
needle back up through the first two

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:05.330 
needle back up through the first two
beads<00:02:57.750> and<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:01.120> back<00:03:01.540> down<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.970> second<00:03:04.690> set

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
beads and then back down the second set

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.819 
beads and then back down the second set
now<00:03:06.340> they're<00:03:06.519> looking<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:07.060> little<00:03:07.569> there<00:03:08.500> you

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
now they're looking a little there you

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.009 
now they're looking a little there you
can<00:03:08.860> see<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.450> looking<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.540> little<00:03:10.750> out<00:03:10.989> of

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
can see it looking a little out of

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.039 
can see it looking a little out of
alignment<00:03:11.440> but<00:03:11.980> we<00:03:12.160> can<00:03:12.400> easily<00:03:12.970> fix<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:13.540> by

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
alignment but we can easily fix that by

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.259 
alignment but we can easily fix that by
going<00:03:14.620> back<00:03:15.040> around<00:03:15.640> again<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:18.269> just

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
going back around again and just

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.990 
going back around again and just
reinforcing<00:03:20.230> it'll<00:03:20.739> tidy<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.459> up<00:03:21.900> okay<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:24.489> to

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
reinforcing it'll tidy it up okay so to

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.110 
reinforcing it'll tidy it up okay so to
these<00:03:25.329> two<00:03:25.750> sets<00:03:26.079> I'll<00:03:26.829> pick<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.340> two<00:03:28.090> more

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
these two sets I'll pick up two more

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.110 
these two sets I'll pick up two more
beads<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.049> you'll<00:03:29.739> notice<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.280> you'll<00:03:30.819> take

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
beads and you'll notice that you'll take

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.210 
beads and you'll notice that you'll take
the<00:03:31.840> needle<00:03:32.049> toward<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.980> thread<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:35.230> sew<00:03:35.590> the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the needle toward the thread to sew the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.759 
the needle toward the thread to sew the
new<00:03:36.489> set<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.940> beads<00:03:37.150> onto<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.340> last<00:03:39.340> set<00:03:40.769> pick

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
new set of beads onto the last set pick

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:50.879 
new set of beads onto the last set pick
up<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:43.500> go<00:03:44.500> toward<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.340> thread<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:48.190> then<00:03:49.889> back

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
up to go toward the thread and then back

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.599 
up to go toward the thread and then back
down<00:03:50.920> again<00:03:51.220> it's<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.849> two-step<00:03:52.329> process
