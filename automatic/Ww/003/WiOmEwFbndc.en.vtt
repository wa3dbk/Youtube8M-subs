00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.810 
different shock Pistons then we've got
bagged<00:03:19.330> a<00:03:19.890> which<00:03:20.890> looks<00:03:21.100> like<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.340> has<00:03:21.489> the

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
bagged a which looks like it has the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.050 
bagged a which looks like it has the
side<00:03:22.120> skirts<00:03:22.480> for<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.750> chassis<00:03:23.730> some<00:03:24.730> servo

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
side skirts for the chassis some servo

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.580 
side skirts for the chassis some servo
parts<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.650> turnbuckles<00:03:31.290> then<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.440> have

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
parts and the turnbuckles then you have

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.729 
parts and the turnbuckles then you have
bagby<00:03:33.430> which<00:03:34.300> looks<00:03:34.540> like<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:34.720> has<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.470> shock

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
bagby which looks like it has the shock

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.430 
bagby which looks like it has the shock
towers<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.330> arms<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.260> some<00:03:38.620> bearings

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
towers and the a arms and some bearings

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.630 
towers and the a arms and some bearings
then<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.560> have<00:03:41.709> bag<00:03:42.370> d<00:03:42.810> which<00:03:43.810> has<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.860> shocks

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
then you have bag d which has the shocks

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.539 
then you have bag d which has the shocks
and<00:03:46.030> shock<00:03:46.299> fluid<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:47.709> can<00:03:47.830> see<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.160> aluminum

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
and shock fluid you can see the aluminum

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.690 
and shock fluid you can see the aluminum
shocks<00:03:49.110> look<00:03:50.110> awesome<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:54.010> finally<00:03:54.400> we<00:03:54.519> have

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
shocks look awesome and finally we have

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.759 
shocks look awesome and finally we have
bag<00:03:54.940> see<00:03:55.299> which<00:03:55.989> looks<00:03:56.260> like<00:03:56.380> the

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
bag see which looks like the

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:05.340 
bag see which looks like the
differential<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:59.739> bumper<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:04.600> then

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
differential and and the bumper and then

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.140 
differential and and the bumper and then
we<00:04:05.440> have<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.709> aluminum<00:04:06.070> chassis<00:04:06.250> plate<00:04:06.760> which

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
we have the aluminum chassis plate which

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.350 
we have the aluminum chassis plate which
I<00:04:07.360> can't<00:04:07.690> believe<00:04:07.870> how<00:04:08.170> light<00:04:08.410> this<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:09.360> I've

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
I can't believe how light this is I've

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.759 
I can't believe how light this is I've
never<00:04:10.570> felt<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.959> piece<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.140> aluminum<00:04:11.620> this

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
never felt a piece of aluminum this

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.490 
never felt a piece of aluminum this
light<00:04:11.980> before<00:04:12.160> it's<00:04:12.700> really<00:04:13.030> really<00:04:13.269> nice<00:04:13.500> you

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
light before it's really really nice you

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.080 
light before it's really really nice you
can<00:04:14.560> see<00:04:14.709> it's<00:04:14.860> got<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.100> tlr<00:04:15.519> logo<00:04:15.910> in<00:04:16.030> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
can see it's got the tlr logo in the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.570 
can see it's got the tlr logo in the
middle<00:04:16.150> of<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:19.709> then<00:04:20.709> finally<00:04:20.950> we<00:04:21.400> have

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
middle of it and then finally we have

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.250 
middle of it and then finally we have
the<00:04:21.609> instruction<00:04:22.450> manual<00:04:24.660> antenna<00:04:25.660> tube<00:04:25.900> and

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
the instruction manual antenna tube and

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:37.100 
the instruction manual antenna tube and
it<00:04:26.530> looks<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.800> bunch<00:04:26.979> of<00:04:27.100> stickers

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.590 

so<00:04:37.740> tune<00:04:37.950> back<00:04:38.160> in<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.700> I'll<00:04:39.330> do<00:04:39.510> another

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
so tune back in and I'll do another

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.210 
so tune back in and I'll do another
video<00:04:39.900> once<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.440> get<00:04:40.590> this<00:04:40.770> thing<00:04:40.950> put<00:04:41.130> together

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
video once I get this thing put together

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.360 
video once I get this thing put together
I<00:04:41.700> might<00:04:42.540> even<00:04:42.690> do<00:04:42.900> kind<00:04:43.260> of<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.500> little<00:04:44.040> montage

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
I might even do kind of a little montage

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.360 
I might even do kind of a little montage
showing<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:46.020> pieces<00:04:46.440> as<00:04:46.620> they<00:04:46.830> they<00:04:47.220> get

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
showing the pieces as they they get

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.870 
showing the pieces as they they get
assembled<00:04:48.530> but<00:04:49.530> until<00:04:49.770> next<00:04:49.920> time<00:04:50.190> this<00:04:50.820> is

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
assembled but until next time this is

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.190 
assembled but until next time this is
