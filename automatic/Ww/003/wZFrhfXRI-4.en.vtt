here<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.250> as<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.460> can<00:00:11.550> see<00:00:11.759> I've<00:00:11.969> got<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> new

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
here and as you can see I've got a new

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.030 
here and as you can see I've got a new
series<00:00:12.719> started<00:00:13.049> up<00:00:13.170> today<00:00:13.410> called<00:00:13.769> quick

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
series started up today called quick

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.189 
series started up today called quick
tips<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.849> series<00:00:15.210> will<00:00:15.389> probably<00:00:15.900> be

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
tips this series will probably be

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.800 
tips this series will probably be
focused<00:00:16.710> around<00:00:16.830> beginners<00:00:17.520> because<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.570> not

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
focused around beginners because I'm not

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.300 
focused around beginners because I'm not
really<00:00:19.020> advanced<00:00:19.529> enough<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.770> help<00:00:19.949> people

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
really advanced enough to help people

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.460 
really advanced enough to help people
out<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.760> are<00:00:20.850> really<00:00:20.880> fast<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.779> if<00:00:22.020> you're<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
out that are really fast so if you're a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.920 
out that are really fast so if you're a
super<00:00:22.859> advanced<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.850> know<00:00:23.880> probably<00:00:24.750> won't

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
super advanced you know probably won't

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.599 
super advanced you know probably won't
be<00:00:25.080> much<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.500> help<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> lot<00:00:26.519> of

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
be much to help you here but a lot of

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279 
be much to help you here but a lot of
people<00:00:26.880> are<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.090> starting<00:00:27.539> out<00:00:27.810> or<00:00:27.869> they're

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
people are just starting out or they're

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.470 
people are just starting out or they're
around<00:00:28.590> 30<00:00:28.890> seconds<00:00:29.460> or<00:00:29.580> 25<00:00:30.060> seconds

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
around 30 seconds or 25 seconds

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.999 
around 30 seconds or 25 seconds
something<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.830> might

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
something like that so I think I might

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.560 
something like that so I think I might
be<00:00:32.040> able<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.369> help<00:00:32.520> them<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> first

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
be able to help them out so the first

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.940 
be able to help them out so the first
thing<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.840> wanted<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> talk<00:00:34.260> about<00:00:34.290> today<00:00:34.739> was

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
thing I wanted to talk about today was

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.709 
thing I wanted to talk about today was
smooth<00:00:35.340> turning<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.969> how<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.660> actually

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
smooth turning and how that can actually

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
smooth turning and how that can actually
help<00:00:37.170> yourselves<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.100> let's<00:00:38.280> say<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
help yourselves so let's say that the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.569 
help yourselves so let's say that the
typical<00:00:39.030> co-op<00:00:39.629> solve<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.320> around<00:00:40.590> 65<00:00:41.070> moves

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
typical co-op solve is around 65 moves

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.389 
typical co-op solve is around 65 moves
just<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.629> example<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.219> do

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
just for this example so what you can do

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.819 
just for this example so what you can do
is<00:00:44.670> take<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.930> take<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.260> time<00:00:46.590> that

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
is take that and take the time that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
is take that and take the time that
you're<00:00:46.950> wanting<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.280> beat<00:00:47.550> let's<00:00:47.879> say<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.719> 30

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
you're wanting to beat let's say it's 30

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.790 
you're wanting to beat let's say it's 30
today

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
today

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.950 
today
so<00:00:50.190> take<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> number<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.030> moves<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.510> average

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
so take the number of moves on average

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.220 
so take the number of moves on average
65<00:00:52.699> divide<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.879> by<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.120> 30<00:00:54.629> seconds<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
65 divide it by the 30 seconds that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.229 
65 divide it by the 30 seconds that
you're<00:00:55.379> shooting<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.940> gives<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you're shooting for and that gives you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.200 
you're shooting for and that gives you
around<00:00:57.480> 2.1<00:00:58.199> seven<00:00:58.649> turns<00:00:58.980> per<00:00:59.280> second<00:00:59.730> which

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
around 2.1 seven turns per second which

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.630 
around 2.1 seven turns per second which
is<00:01:00.239> pretty<00:01:00.420> slow<00:01:00.899> right<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.430> then

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
is pretty slow right so what you do then

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.289 
is pretty slow right so what you do then
is<00:01:02.670> multiply<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.899> by<00:01:04.339> 60<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.090> gives

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
is multiply that by 60 and that gives

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.030 
is multiply that by 60 and that gives
you<00:01:06.420> roughly<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.869> hundred<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.470> thirty<00:01:07.680> turns

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
you roughly a hundred and thirty turns

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.090 
you roughly a hundred and thirty turns
per<00:01:08.340> minute<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> from<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.080> point<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> did

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
per minute so from that point all I did

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.010 
per minute so from that point all I did
was<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> went<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.820> downloaded<00:01:12.020> simple

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
was I went and downloaded simple

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
was I went and downloaded simple
metronome<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> app<00:01:14.130> store<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:15.060> whatever

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
metronome from the app store or whatever

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.510 
metronome from the app store or whatever
cell<00:01:16.049> phone<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.439> using<00:01:16.470> I'm<00:01:16.979> sure<00:01:17.220> there

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
cell phone you're using I'm sure there

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730 
cell phone you're using I'm sure there
is<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.670> simple<00:01:18.090> metronome<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.200> set<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
is a simple metronome and I set it to a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
is a simple metronome and I set it to a
hundred<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.159> thirty<00:01:20.430> beats<00:01:20.939> per<00:01:21.210> minute<00:01:21.540> so

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
hundred and thirty beats per minute so

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.840 
hundred and thirty beats per minute so
let's<00:01:22.650> turn<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.310> see<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
let's turn that on and see what that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.410 
let's turn that on and see what that
sounds<00:01:24.210> like

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.670 

see<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.990> bad<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.439> when<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
see that's not that bad but when you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.080 
see that's not that bad but when you
typically<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.280> people<00:01:35.640> trying<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> get

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
typically see people trying to get

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.240 
typically see people trying to get
sub-30<00:01:36.509> they're<00:01:36.840> turning<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.619> fast<00:01:37.740> once

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
sub-30 they're turning really fast once

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.800 
sub-30 they're turning really fast once
they<00:01:38.369> find<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.700> piece<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> would<00:01:39.659> just

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
they find a piece but if you would just

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.170 
they find a piece but if you would just
slow<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.650> look<00:01:40.950> ahead<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.880> times

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
slow down and look ahead your times

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.490 
slow down and look ahead your times
would<00:01:42.390> improve<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.020> that's<00:01:43.170> how<00:01:43.320> I've

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
would improve and that's how I've

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.260 
would improve and that's how I've
actually<00:01:43.710> been<00:01:43.979> improving<00:01:44.369> lately<00:01:44.790> not

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
actually been improving lately not

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.850 
actually been improving lately not
necessarily<00:01:45.780> using<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> metronome<00:01:46.470> all<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
necessarily using the metronome all the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.100 
necessarily using the metronome all the
time<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.759> use<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.479> beginning<00:01:48.930> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
time but just use it at the beginning to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.590 
time but just use it at the beginning to
get<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.290> good<00:01:49.590> feel<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.100> what<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> good<00:01:50.729> turning

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
get a good feel of what a good turning

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.780 
get a good feel of what a good turning
rate<00:01:51.810> would<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:53.310> I'm<00:01:53.579> going

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
rate would be for you so now I'm going

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.700 
rate would be for you so now I'm going
to<00:01:53.850> show<00:01:54.000> how<00:01:54.210> bad<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.509> am<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.409> I'm

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
to show how bad I am at this and I'm

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.209 
to show how bad I am at this and I'm
gonna<00:01:55.920> try<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:57.020> 30-second<00:01:58.020> solve<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.500> 130

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
gonna try to do a 30-second solve at 130

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.690 
gonna try to do a 30-second solve at 130
beats<00:01:59.759> per<00:02:00.030> minute<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.630> let's<00:02:00.899> see<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.700> I'm

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
beats per minute so let's see here I'm

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.480 
beats per minute so let's see here I'm
going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.930> my<00:02:04.079> timer<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.500> all<00:02:05.100> right<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
going to get my timer out all right so

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
going to get my timer out all right so
we've<00:02:05.640> got<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> cube<00:02:06.000> scrambled<00:02:06.509> here<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
we've got the cube scrambled here it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.580 
we've got the cube scrambled here it
looks<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.580> pretty<00:02:09.179> decently<00:02:09.869> easy<00:02:10.140> cross

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
looks like a pretty decently easy cross

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.430 
looks like a pretty decently easy cross
nothing

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
nothing

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.640 
nothing
spectacular<00:02:12.990> let's<00:02:13.990> see

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
spectacular let's see

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.520 
spectacular let's see
all<00:02:14.890> right<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:16.300> blue<00:02:16.540> down<00:02:16.750> D<00:02:17.200> red<00:02:17.920> green<00:02:18.310> D<00:02:18.580> -<00:02:18.820> I

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
all right so blue down D red green D - I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.730 
all right so blue down D red green D - I
think

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
think

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.220 
think
let's<00:02:20.950> hope<00:02:21.130> right<00:02:21.370> okay<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.660> you're<00:02:23.140> probably

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
let's hope right okay so you're probably

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.410 
let's hope right okay so you're probably
getting<00:02:23.470> ready<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.800> see<00:02:23.980> me<00:02:24.130> fail<00:02:24.400> on<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.060> but

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
getting ready to see me fail on this but

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.180 
getting ready to see me fail on this but
that's<00:02:25.750> not<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.020> big<00:02:26.230> deal<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.650> just<00:02:26.860> want<00:02:27.040> to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
that's not a big deal I just want to

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.580 
that's not a big deal I just want to
show<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.430> guys<00:02:27.670> how<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.570> actually<00:02:29.140> get<00:02:29.560> your

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
show you guys how you actually get your

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.100 
show you guys how you actually get your
turning<00:02:30.130> style<00:02:30.340> down<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> good<00:02:31.300> smooth

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
turning style down to a good smooth

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.020 
turning style down to a good smooth
turning<00:02:32.680> style<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.310> hopefully<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.880> will

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
turning style so hopefully this will

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.840 
turning style so hopefully this will
help<00:02:34.090> but<00:02:34.420> let's<00:02:34.600> see<00:02:34.810> one<00:02:35.800> turn<00:02:36.280> per<00:02:36.610> beat

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
help but let's see one turn per beat

00:02:36.850 --> 00:03:17.410 
help but let's see one turn per beat
that's<00:02:37.240> going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.540> be<00:02:37.630> difficult

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.850 

alright<00:03:18.350> looks<00:03:18.650> like<00:03:18.710> I<00:03:19.040> got<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:20.140> 35<00:03:21.140> second

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
alright looks like I got a 35 second

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.130 
alright looks like I got a 35 second
solve<00:03:22.100> but<00:03:22.490> that<00:03:23.030> was<00:03:23.150> pretty<00:03:23.330> inefficient

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
solve but that was pretty inefficient

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.020 
solve but that was pretty inefficient
and<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.470> skipped<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:24.950> couple<00:03:25.130> steps<00:03:25.520> and<00:03:25.850> then<00:03:25.970> I

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
and I skipped a couple steps and then I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.850 
and I skipped a couple steps and then I
missed<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.360> couple<00:03:26.510> steps<00:03:26.870> but<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.440> guys<00:03:27.560> get

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
missed a couple steps but you guys get

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.220 
missed a couple steps but you guys get
the<00:03:27.920> gist<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.819> this<00:03:29.060> what<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:29.569> want<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.810> do<00:03:29.959> is

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
the gist of this what you want to do is

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.860 
the gist of this what you want to do is
practice<00:03:30.920> with<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.400> metronome<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.420> see<00:03:32.630> what

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
practice with this metronome to see what

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.260 
practice with this metronome to see what
your<00:03:33.050> turning<00:03:33.440> needs<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.190> be<00:03:34.430> under<00:03:34.850> to<00:03:35.060> get<00:03:35.240> a

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
your turning needs to be under to get a

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.240 
your turning needs to be under to get a
typical<00:03:35.840> solve<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.470> what<00:03:36.890> you're<00:03:37.040> shooting

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
typical solve and what you're shooting

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.190 
typical solve and what you're shooting
for<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.940> just<00:03:38.300> listen<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.810> even<00:03:38.959> you'd

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
for and just listen to it even you'd

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.930 
for and just listen to it even you'd
only<00:03:39.320> have<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.620> do<00:03:39.740> practice<00:03:40.130> like<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:40.490> you

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
only have to do practice like this you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.690 
only have to do practice like this you
just<00:03:41.060> want<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.330> get<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.630> where<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:42.470> know<00:03:42.800> where

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
just want to get to where you know where

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.550 
just want to get to where you know where
to<00:03:43.850> hold<00:03:44.060> back<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.540> where<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.110> turn<00:03:45.380> really

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
to hold back and where to turn really

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.620 
to hold back and where to turn really
fast<00:03:45.709> because<00:03:46.370> if<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.670> have<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.910> step<00:03:47.270> that<00:03:47.480> you

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
fast because if you have a step that you

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.300 
fast because if you have a step that you
already<00:03:47.989> know<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.560> know<00:03:48.590> an<00:03:48.830> algorithm<00:03:49.100> for

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
already know you know an algorithm for

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.850 
already know you know an algorithm for
it<00:03:49.580> maybe<00:03:49.760> an<00:03:49.880> f2l<00:03:50.300> case<00:03:50.540> it's<00:03:51.200> best<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.620> do<00:03:51.830> it

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
it maybe an f2l case it's best to do it

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.030 
it maybe an f2l case it's best to do it
a<00:03:52.040> little<00:03:52.220> bit<00:03:52.459> more<00:03:52.670> slowly<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.830> pick<00:03:54.830> up

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
a little bit more slowly and pick up

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.590 
a little bit more slowly and pick up
what<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.519> need<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.820> do<00:03:55.940> next<00:03:56.180> while<00:03:56.450> you're

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
what you need to do next while you're

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.330 
what you need to do next while you're
doing<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:56.900> rather<00:03:57.110> than<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:57.350> corn<00:03:57.980> as<00:03:58.100> fast

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
doing it rather than just corn as fast

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.820 
doing it rather than just corn as fast
as<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.610> can<00:03:58.820> because<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.959> typically<00:04:00.560> will

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
as you can because that typically will

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.440 
as you can because that typically will
slow<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.160> down<00:04:01.370> in<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:01.640> long<00:04:01.760> run<00:04:02.000> but<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.269> hope

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
slow you down in the long run but I hope

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.270 
slow you down in the long run but I hope
this<00:04:02.600> helped<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:02.959> guys<00:04:03.019> out<00:04:03.320> it's<00:04:03.830> just<00:04:03.950> a

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
this helped you guys out it's just a

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.430 
this helped you guys out it's just a
demonstration<00:04:04.459> on<00:04:05.180> turning<00:04:05.750> smoother<00:04:06.230> and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
demonstration on turning smoother and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.410 
demonstration on turning smoother and
how<00:04:06.860> that's<00:04:07.040> definitely<00:04:07.610> better<00:04:07.760> than<00:04:07.910> quick

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
how that's definitely better than quick

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.199 
how that's definitely better than quick
bursts<00:04:09.110> followed<00:04:09.500> by<00:04:09.620> long<00:04:09.890> pauses<00:04:10.190> but<00:04:11.030> if

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
bursts followed by long pauses but if

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.820
