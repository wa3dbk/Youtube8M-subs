00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
private server you can actually do stuff

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.090 
private server you can actually do stuff
on<00:01:08.329> it<00:01:08.479> like<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.990> know<00:01:09.109> you<00:01:09.139> start<00:01:09.590> with<00:01:09.649> items

gonna try turning up seconds just gonna
try<00:01:36.079> turning<00:01:36.319> up<00:01:36.679> the<00:01:36.859> resolution<00:01:37.159> here<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:39.159> lot

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
try turning up the resolution here a lot

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:54.240 
try turning up the resolution here a lot
of<00:01:40.310> capture<00:01:40.670> area

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.980 

this<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.030> first<00:01:55.270> time<00:01:55.420> I've<00:01:55.540> been<00:01:55.630> able<00:01:55.780> to

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
this is the first time I've been able to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.940 
this is the first time I've been able to
get<00:01:56.230> a<00:01:56.260> game<00:01:56.650> running<00:01:57.040> out<00:01:58.260> over<00:01:59.550> 30<00:02:00.550> fps<00:02:01.090> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
get a game running out over 30 fps and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.240 
get a game running out over 30 fps and
it<00:02:02.950> runs<00:02:03.870> quite<00:02:04.870> nicely<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.500> be<00:02:05.620> honest<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
it runs quite nicely to be honest and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.000 
it runs quite nicely to be honest and
yes<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.600> guy<00:02:10.899> who<00:02:10.960> made<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.320> said<00:02:11.530> it's<00:02:11.680> 30%

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
yes the guy who made that said it's 30%

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.720 
yes the guy who made that said it's 30%
done<00:02:12.550> whatever<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.570> means

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
done whatever that means

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.930 
done whatever that means
but<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:17.310> might<00:02:18.310> expect<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.610> be<00:02:18.730> able<00:02:18.820> to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
but really I might expect to be able to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.310 
but really I might expect to be able to
play<00:02:19.120> anything<00:02:19.360> on<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.900> looks<00:02:20.140> from

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
Daisy on my PC yeah there's not much log

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.660 
Daisy on my PC yeah there's not much log
in<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> bum<00:02:34.630> presses<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.140> mean<00:02:35.580> very<00:02:36.580> much

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
in the bum presses I mean very much

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
instant you can see there which is quite

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.070 
instant you can see there which is quite
good<00:02:42.300> considering<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.720> all<00:02:43.870> done

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
good considering this is all done

through my Wi-Fi my Wi-Fi so crap

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.420 
through my Wi-Fi my Wi-Fi so crap
it's<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.710> latency<00:02:48.100> isn't<00:02:48.640> about<00:02:49.150> at<00:02:49.300> all

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.910 

I'm<00:02:54.430> still<00:02:54.700> under<00:02:54.940> mother's<00:02:55.060> know<00:02:55.360> that

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
I'm still under mother's know that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.550 
I'm still under mother's know that
PlayStation<00:02:56.920> 3<00:02:57.220> thingy<00:02:58.140> mostly<00:02:59.140> this<00:02:59.230> isn't

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
PlayStation 3 thingy mostly this isn't

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.810 
PlayStation 3 thingy mostly this isn't
that<00:02:59.680> good<00:02:59.830> that's<00:03:00.040> probably<00:03:00.340> why<00:03:00.489> there's<00:03:00.700> no

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
that good that's probably why there's no

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.150 
that good that's probably why there's no
ps3<00:03:01.030> remotely<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.650> they're<00:03:02.800> meant<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.010> be<00:03:03.130> a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
ps3 remotely but they're meant to be a
