 this episode of the bike check today how 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.070
 you will see 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.199
 we will clean a muddy bicycle and vi 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.170
 we will explain the tricks of the escaped of 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:23.529
 home or me and advice 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.660
 precious of the magician george but first 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.550
 to start cleaning the bicycle 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.369
 I'll show you what it is for 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.629
 obviously the bicycle gets dirty 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.550
 reed water then a degreaser one 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.130
 toothbrush for the chain you can 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.350
 well save your money and let you 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.270
 with a clothespin 2 toothbrushes e 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.430
 two cable ties you're done 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.700
 a brush a hard bristle brush 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.610
 round a soft brush to clean 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.690
 all a rag in cloth in 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.850
 microfibre is a spray either to pdf or al 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.610
 silicone and then we have also put 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.440
 adding the card because it does 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.130
 cold we must blow our nose and 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.259
 so this is so now let's start 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.819
 step by step to clean ours 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:15.009
 bicycle well the first thing to do is 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:17.259
 wash the wheels and moving parts 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.990
 this because because if we start a 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.270
 wash the frame and keep the wheels for 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.429
 last when we then wash the ciri wheels 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.039
 dirty the whole frame then the first 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.319
 what i do having first put 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.450
 a cloth on the ground not to ruin in the 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.329
 saddle the knobs and take the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.130
 so bike and turn it do you 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.579
 attention to the director's command 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.959
 of the telescopic because if you have it 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.959
 mounted above the handlebar you can 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:46.090
 damage with use giorgio va 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:48.429
 so well so I can give some advice that 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.109
 I hear it I do not take me I never 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.109
 wash the bicycle upside down kaposi 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.549
 first the hydra yoichi he big dirt 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.940
 as I have to get inside of 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.770
 record the squats on himself and they are 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.220
 a matter of care with the components 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.220
 then we turn it like this and put it on 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:16.720
 that's fine, no fat and full of fat 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.290
 for chains full of class if you leave 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.940
 of this direction here the fat makes a 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.890
 end up on the discussion of the meals 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.350
 we can start or not 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.630
 raga is more than twenty years old I don't know how long 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.760
 I ride this bike I've never heard 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.790
 I had never reflected good frater 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.330
 so we take it and turn it like this 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.460
 right basketball 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:44.620
 here is perfect we start so we take the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:50.410
 cane and begin to remove all the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.660
 big good when you have finished 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.890
 remove the bulk from one side do not do 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.300
 other than turning the bicycle e 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.330
 repeat the operation 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:07.150
 on the other side now that we have 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.700
 removed big we turn it to do well 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.880
 wheels so if you put it at home 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.709
 wife does not stress you that you leave the 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.300
 footprints turn the bike 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.750
 be careful as I told you before 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.520
 under the command of the telescopic director 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.800
 if you have mounted it, put one on it 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.650
 thickness in such a way that there is no 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.019
 rest take the cane and do well 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.019
 wheels like that 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:39.180
 the hand rotates of a thing 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.880
 only in this way can a part be quit e 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.950
 on the other hand the mud goes away either from 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.750
 one part is on the other of the piece is 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.269
 perfect but because you don't do product 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.420
 worked because before you work less 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:59.430
 we do it ok spray the product where 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:02.610
 must also on the rubber and see also 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.049
 on the disk on the very rare hub we do 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:11.040
 so in such a way that the properties 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:14.280
 active degreaser begin to act 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.209
 and how george says to work in the place 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.519
 our 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.350
 instead of struggling with elbow grease 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.109
 so now 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.780
 we will use the degreaser on the whole 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.790
 bicycle wheels included if you need it 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.850
 put the wheels in the house if you can 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.729
 also save them well finished ragan 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:41.640
 to give the degreaser we pass to the cleaning 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:43.410
 real because it does not leave the 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.140
 last transmission chapel so 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.150
 product acts a little more but gives it to him 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.180
 cathedral on the other side right in fact 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.740
 transmission is the most part 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.580
 crusted more dirty than a notebook 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.190
 what are we going to do 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.800
 let the product continue to 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.530
 act slowly and what we do 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:06.229
 blessed wheels take the brush 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.229
 hard and clean so well 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.250
 finished the wheels of everything else 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.500
 of the bicycle take the others 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.580
 your small brushes to sell the 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:25.069
 large and based on the part of the frame 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:28.400
 clean very well now we can move on 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:31.759
 to clean our chain with ours 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.819
 20 cents toothbrush we clean well 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:40.340
 the chain from one side to the other then 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:42.979
 we clean pulleys nor remove everything 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.289
 the dirty a 2 of course we go 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.680
 fast you are c on a little bit in 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:53.389
 based on the degree of dirt then take the 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.569
 brush and clean everything well in the faq 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.610
 opinions I recommend do not hold the 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.860
 chain on the smallest sprocket because 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.979
 then it's hard to have the change in the middle 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.780
 to the bales that you can not fail there 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.909
 the operation is good so keep the 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.120
 change as in this position a little 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:12.349
 higher so you can clean well 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.520
 all 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:20.300
 we always keep the chain 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.279
 very clean so just a degreaser 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.370
 not too powerful to have gods 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:28.130
 perfect results if you put so much 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.169
 oil and above all do not pass it 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.190
 with so straccino your chain 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:36.529
 when you use black, dirty black that you 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.370
 hands anointed you must use in this 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:42.370
 time a specific degreaser for 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.370
 transmission
