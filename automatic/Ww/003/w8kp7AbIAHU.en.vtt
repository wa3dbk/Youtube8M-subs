00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.220
 we are the only one who has 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.800
 chance to do that and get out 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.420
 Education Year is just like that 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.550
 sahnehäubchen these are unique 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.110
 experiences the project was also 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.240
 a unique experience i think we 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.609
 as a team, everyone is a whole 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.140
 piece came further than I was yes 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.090
 personally more for the electrics 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.740
 responsible that are no series parts 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.170
 rather 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.860
 really hand made parts and the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.070
 Subwoofer itself has a big one 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.630
 meaningfulness and of course that 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.510
 tv with the playstation in it 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.270
 that had something a little bit youthful 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.310
 what to play with it 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.220
 We now have the complete seat system 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.620
 made the door panels switch knob 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.370
 and the middle amount for me 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.350
 personally it is now 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.870
 door paneling we have now the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.390
 Wolfsburg skyline embossed in the back 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.530
 with patents and that was pretty 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.530
 elaborate but looks pretty good 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.150
 We know that we only build good cars 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.830
 will be build high quality though 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.360
 We are passionate young 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.850
 People have the skills 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.780
 you need it 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.940
 That's why we put a lot into it 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.500
 training with a lot of innovative 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.500
 projects and that's easy 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.680
 the original goal is 400 ps 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.810
 wanted to reach 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.490
 Unfortunately, that could be God with the gti 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.990
 motor now with our possibilities 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.100
 do not realize that we have each other 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.200
 then decided for the air engine 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.200
 and we are at the end at 380 hp 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.480
 So we have these people in the door 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.200
 from wolfsburg that's just me 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.200
 personally hold 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.190
 we now have a part for vw right 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.390
 so everyone sees me 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.390

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.670
 to make a car to the single piece too 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.829
 what everyone considers everyone 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.909
 See what is then here on Lake Wörthersee 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.909
 that's already a highlight 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.599
 So again congratulations to you 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:32.659
