00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.400
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.800
 I want to answer a question and 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.839
 it's all about samuele today 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.569
 Write me, I have a very important one 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:22.689
 ask to you and that is bad in the 

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:23.589
 age of 14 years biceps and abdomen 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.689
 to train 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.970
 Some say you will not grow anymore 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.339
 I would be correct on an answer from 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.220
 you are happy 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:35.590
 So first of all, if you are in the 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.470
 june at top athlete basketball 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.740
 Handball football then you have a lot 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.370
 high stress also on the joints and 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.770
 it can 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.130
 and this time makes a lot higher than 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.310
 if you practice targeted strength training 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.150
 I would say that first 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.490
 In principle, of course, if you are 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.710
 I was 14 years old at the age of 13 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.900
 started years to train 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.900
 if you do it clean and targeted 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.579
 and say short then bargain 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.299
 Do not you really need that? 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.130
 Worrying because I believe it can 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.579
 growth causes damage when in 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.420
 really young 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.549
 Performance oriented strength training 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.909
 that is, if I am operating 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.710
 performance-oriented perhaps 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.740
 performance squats 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.909
 Do something in the wrong direction 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.850
 then I can imagine 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.069
 that's negative on growth 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.259
 But I have to say that now 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.259
 to train the biceps at the age of 14 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.179
 or belly you do not need one 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.840
 Worrying I'm firm 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:41.499
 conviction because the burden at 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.929
 sports such as basketball or soccer 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:46.240
 are much higher for example 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.579
 knee or hip one has it 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.079
 much more stress than now at 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.399
 targeted weight training 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.759
 That's why I would advise it 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.829
 you want to start looking for one of the best 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.689
 Experienced people take you there 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.340
 supports a trainer on site 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.590
 because someone in the individual exercises 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.320
 introduces and then it goes in this 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.360
 old first 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.159
 therefore the movement execution too 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.200
 Master large weights before you can 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.720
 to feel the muscle first 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.280
 and then you can always say with 16 17 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.680
 Years you can still weight 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.450
 increase but it has 14 years 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.550
 I would train myself on short trade 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.920
 above all, focus and there it does 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.000
 Do not mind if you have biceps and abdomen 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.380
 then you can train 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.120
 then triceps you can also legs 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.690
 Of course, I'm doing everything in the gym 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.640
 frame 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.010
 it's really about the first time 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.900
 movement to feel the muscle man something 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.209
 to feel and that is enough 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 then you do not have to worry about it 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.209
 to make your growth 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.770
 I hope so helped with more 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.630
 just ask below the videos 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.350
 good by then your flavio 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.350
