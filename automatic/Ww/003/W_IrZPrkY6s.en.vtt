00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.420
 as well as 4th class of Brazil from all bad 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.430
 I'll tell you a bit about the care you 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.789
 we have to have an instrument or 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.119
 in the handling all the lack of metal has the 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.130
 very thin wall is a cone 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.309
 so any beat that we have 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.070
 one corner another instrument goes to a 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.160
 leaves after is hard to say but out a 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.610
 instrument losing a little value 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.260
 another important care is 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.090
 always after we play 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.739
 study after a studio session 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.860
 Use the cloth and dry the lack 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.620
 inside right 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.149
 if we do not dry up as it is 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.329
 transport 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.800
 looking at the sneakers that are these 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.440
 parts yellow lines below 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.490
 of the keys serving the sealing material 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.170
 huh 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.789
 into the holes in the flute that 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.160
 time it goes regulating goes 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.780
 deforming and the photo will not work 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.720
 that's good too 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.820
 important it will always be an instrument 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.920
 Ten minutes played. 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.720
 stop no matter in what about the same 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.189
 right way 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.189
 is also important as long as 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.320
 you have to do something for reform 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.630
 general or if a simple tightening of 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.880
 screw and it will take the flute a 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.340
 technician right 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.570
 We take a friend of our friend and it ends. 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.119
 with the instrument 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.960
 so they end up lasting as long as 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.930
 should 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.040
 It is important to always take a technician 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.470
 responsible person who 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.320
 will have the right tools 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.570
 suitable material and all right not to 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.049
 dry a net instrument in the absence of 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.240
 someone with this cleaning rod and this 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.390
 fabric may be a very absorbent fabric 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.470
 a cotton diaper a diaper of 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.060
 child is one needs to be a good tissue is 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.100
 Absorbent 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.970
 we put on the tip so that 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:24.230
 think of this farm on the tip of the stick 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.360
 and we wrap the fabric in order to pass 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.440
 inside is always important 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.510
 put the cloth on one side and take up 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.230
 Even so, we go through and take 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.730
 other side can grab may not come out 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.130
 so easy, is not it? 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.400
 this water that is inside the instrument 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.950
 right is actually in the air condensing 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.360
 instrument as it is in metal is always 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.940
 cold 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.670
 so when we just to hot the air 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.200
 ends up compensating and turning into 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.600
 water inside is important then to 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.020
 guaranteeing a long life for being a 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.420
 instrument is always cleaning by drying and 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.989
 cleaning out the faults that are 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.360
 also gives a clean 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.730
 outside to ensure integrity in the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.330
 instrument for a long time 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.130
 I would like to thank the invitation of the
