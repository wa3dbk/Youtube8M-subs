00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
with the five-seven transplant and I'm

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.299 
with the five-seven transplant and I'm
going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.810> show<00:00:06.959> you<00:00:06.990> guys<00:00:07.169> my<00:00:07.410> e<00:00:07.439> fam<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.219> I

going to show you guys my e fam and I
installed<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:09.000> replace<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:10.490> mechanical<00:00:11.490> fan

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
installed to replace the mechanical fan

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.600 
installed to replace the mechanical fan
that<00:00:11.969> brought<00:00:12.210> for<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.450> second<00:00:12.839> time<00:00:14.690> so

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
that brought for the second time so

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.640 
that brought for the second time so
there<00:00:17.610> it<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.850> there's<00:00:18.660> where<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.930> old<00:00:19.170> fan

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
there it is there's where the old fan

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.940 
there it is there's where the old fan
was<00:00:20.040> connected<00:00:20.900> there's<00:00:21.900> enough<00:00:22.590> clearance

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
was connected there's enough clearance

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.660 
was connected there's enough clearance
by<00:00:23.280> having<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> e<00:00:23.850> fan<00:00:25.130> shifted<00:00:26.130> over<00:00:26.220> towards

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
by having the e fan shifted over towards

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.310 
by having the e fan shifted over towards
the<00:00:26.760> inlet<00:00:27.000> side<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.360> radiator<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.990> can

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the inlet side of the radiator you can

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.460 
the inlet side of the radiator you can
see<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.530> still<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.270> some<00:00:30.270> exposed<00:00:30.780> radiator

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
see I still have some exposed radiator

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.380 
see I still have some exposed radiator
but<00:00:31.830> by<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.129> time<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.550> coolant<00:00:32.910> gets<00:00:33.089> to<00:00:33.269> this

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
but by the time the coolant gets to this

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.950 
but by the time the coolant gets to this
side<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.929> it<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.640> pretty<00:00:35.640> well<00:00:35.969> cooled<00:00:36.329> off<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
side of it it's pretty well cooled off I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
side of it it's pretty well cooled off I
haven't<00:00:37.890> had<00:00:38.609> any<00:00:38.789> issues<00:00:38.969> with<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.300> cooling<00:00:39.980> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
haven't had any issues with a cooling I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.880 
haven't had any issues with a cooling I
got<00:00:41.760> my<00:00:42.170> radiator<00:00:43.170> lines<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.800> my

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
got my radiator lines and my

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
got my radiator lines and my
transmission<00:00:44.519> cooler<00:00:45.559> mounted<00:00:47.719> right<00:00:48.719> back

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
transmission cooler mounted right back

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.189 
transmission cooler mounted right back
there<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.609> it<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:51.659> is<00:00:51.839> my<00:00:51.989> next

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
there I really see it this is my next

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.079 
there I really see it this is my next
project<00:00:52.739> I'm<00:00:52.890> sick<00:00:53.429> and<00:00:53.609> tired<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.940> having

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
project I'm sick and tired of having

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.970 
project I'm sick and tired of having
that<00:00:54.269> stupid<00:00:54.719> colon<00:00:55.019> filter<00:00:55.409> but<00:00:55.620> finding

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that stupid colon filter but finding

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.380 
that stupid colon filter but finding
something<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.550> actually<00:00:56.760> fits<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:59.390> isn't

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
something that actually fits and isn't

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.930 
something that actually fits and isn't
too<00:01:00.569> tight<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> stock<00:01:01.620> airbox<00:01:01.940> even

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
too tight in there the stock airbox even

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.800 
too tight in there the stock airbox even
with<00:01:04.340> one<00:01:05.340> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.489> other<00:01:05.640> guys<00:01:05.850> using<00:01:06.540> those

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
with one of the other guys using those

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
with one of the other guys using those
silicone<00:01:07.440> elbows<00:01:07.920> cut<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.760> just

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
silicone elbows cut in there just just

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.970 
silicone elbows cut in there just just
it's<00:01:09.720> too<00:01:09.930> tight<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.500> personal

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
it's too tight for my personal

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.380 
it's too tight for my personal
preference<00:01:11.430> there's<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.910> very<00:01:12.240> much

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
preference there's really not very much

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
preference there's really not very much
wiggle<00:01:12.630> room<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.140> plus<00:01:13.560> getting<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> off

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
wiggle room in there plus getting it off

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.320 
to service it and put it back on and be
a<00:01:16.020> pain<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:17.250> still<00:01:17.580> trying<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.910> figure<00:01:18.120> out

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
a pain so I'm still trying to figure out

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.630 
a pain so I'm still trying to figure out
a<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.480> to<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.870> that<00:01:19.080> better<00:01:19.430> thinking<00:01:20.430> maybe

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
a way to do that better thinking maybe

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.250 
a way to do that better thinking maybe
something<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.660> work<00:01:21.780> down<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
something that will work down in this

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.360 
something that will work down in this
cavity<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.830> better<00:01:23.100> Porsche<00:01:23.730> my<00:01:24.620> oil<00:01:25.620> filler<00:01:25.950> I

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
cavity a better Porsche my oil filler I

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.160 
cavity a better Porsche my oil filler I
moved<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.760> over<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.330> try<00:01:27.540> getting<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
moved that over to try getting it to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.370 
moved that over to try getting it to
work<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.890> was<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:29.480> on<00:01:30.480> that<00:01:30.810> hole<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
work because it was down on that hole I

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.470 
work because it was down on that hole I
drilled<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.920> new<00:01:32.040> hole<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> shift<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> over

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
drilled a new hole to shift that over

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.010 
drilled a new hole to shift that over
I've<00:01:33.930> been<00:01:34.230> clearance<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:34.890> airbox<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
I've been clearance for the airbox but I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.760 
I've been clearance for the airbox but I
got<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> figure<00:01:37.230> something<00:01:37.350> better<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.210> maybe

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
got to figure something better out maybe

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.420 
got to figure something better out maybe
find<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> different<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:42.770> don't<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.920> something

see the rest of the e fan the only thing
nice<00:01:54.690> about<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.470> move<00:01:55.620> it<00:01:55.740> easily

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
nice about that you can move it easily

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.930 
nice about that you can move it easily
and<00:01:56.810> there<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.080> it's<00:01:58.350> an<00:01:58.470> 18<00:01:58.920> inch<00:01:59.220> fan<00:01:59.640> out

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
and there it is it's an 18 inch fan out

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.080

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.910 
two-speed fan I snag the harness so I
got<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.270> circuit<00:02:06.810> breaker<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.230> 30<00:02:07.680> amp

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
got the circuit breaker the 30 amp

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.190 
got the circuit breaker the 30 amp
circuit<00:02:08.340> breaker<00:02:09.140> picked<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.409> Imperial

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
circuit breaker picked up this Imperial

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.890 
circuit breaker picked up this Imperial
adjustable<00:02:13.200> thermostat

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
adjustable thermostat

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.309 
adjustable thermostat
and<00:02:14.500> if<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.400> can<00:02:15.550> see<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.970> wire<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.810> actually

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
and if you can see this wire I actually

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.080 
and if you can see this wire I actually
routed<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.920> wire<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.550> under<00:02:19.450> behind<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.730> so

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
routed this wire in under behind that so

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.550 
routed this wire in under behind that so
that<00:02:22.239> it's<00:02:22.390> capturing<00:02:22.900> as<00:02:23.050> much<00:02:23.080> heat<00:02:23.530> as

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
that it's capturing as much heat as

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.290 
that it's capturing as much heat as
possible<00:02:23.709> because<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.610> original<00:02:24.819> thought

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
possible because the original thought

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.030 
possible because the original thought
was<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.660> have<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.840> running<00:02:26.230> up<00:02:26.440> in<00:02:26.590> here<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:26.950> it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
was to have it running up in here but it

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.259 
was to have it running up in here but it
just<00:02:27.069> wasn't<00:02:27.370> close<00:02:27.670> enough<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.120> radiator

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
just wasn't close enough to the radiator

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.720 
just wasn't close enough to the radiator
to<00:02:28.660> kick<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.080> off<00:02:30.599> effectively<00:02:31.860> I've<00:02:32.860> got<00:02:33.069> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
to kick it off effectively I've got the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.940 
to kick it off effectively I've got the
power<00:02:33.970> coming<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.830> here

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
power coming in here

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.330 
power coming in here
and<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:37.000> tap<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.599> into<00:02:37.989> our<00:02:38.260> fuse<00:02:38.560> box<00:02:38.860> up<00:02:39.099> here

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
and I tap that into our fuse box up here

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.330 
and I tap that into our fuse box up here
onto<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> ignition<00:02:40.629> only<00:02:41.019> on<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.230> inside<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:42.160> if

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
onto a ignition only on the inside so if

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.630 
onto a ignition only on the inside so if
you<00:02:42.489> pop<00:02:42.849> this<00:02:43.180> off<00:02:44.730> there's<00:02:45.730> no<00:02:45.910> actual

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
you pop this off there's no actual

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.710 
you pop this off there's no actual
difference<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.959> all<00:02:50.200> looks<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.620> same

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
difference this all looks the same

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.920 
difference this all looks the same
but<00:02:54.239> focus<00:02:56.190> make<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.370> focus<00:02:57.760> well<00:02:58.360> anyway<00:02:58.840> if

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
but focus make it focus well anyway if

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.210 
but focus make it focus well anyway if
you<00:02:59.049> look<00:02:59.230> at<00:02:59.349> this<00:02:59.560> this<00:03:00.220> role<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:01.000> actually

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
you look at this this role is actually

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.520 
you look at this this role is actually
completely<00:03:03.220> on<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.819> same<00:03:04.030> power<00:03:04.840> feed<00:03:05.260> and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
completely on the same power feed and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.339 
completely on the same power feed and
it's<00:03:06.489> controlled<00:03:06.970> all<00:03:07.209> these<00:03:07.420> are<00:03:07.870> controlled

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
it's controlled all these are controlled

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.979 
it's controlled all these are controlled
by<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.980> ignition<00:03:09.489> switch<00:03:09.700> these<00:03:10.540> are<00:03:10.750> always

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
by the ignition switch these are always

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.550 
by the ignition switch these are always
hot<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.910> tried<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.690> work<00:03:13.870> something<00:03:14.260> in

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
hot so I tried to work something in

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.979 
hot so I tried to work something in
where<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.799> could<00:03:15.099> tap<00:03:15.579> into<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:16.120> always<00:03:16.480> in<00:03:16.690> and

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
where I could tap into the always in and

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.569 
where I could tap into the always in and
then<00:03:17.079> have<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.290> fuse<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.709> all<00:03:18.069> that<00:03:18.250> stuff<00:03:18.430> but

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
then have a fuse and all that stuff but

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.740 
then have a fuse and all that stuff but
I<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:18.790> didn't<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.150> right<00:03:19.299> connectors

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
I just didn't have the right connectors

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.390 
I just didn't have the right connectors
for<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.019> here<00:03:20.290> I'd<00:03:20.440> have<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.709> go<00:03:20.799> scavenge

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
for in here I'd have to go scavenge

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.009 
for in here I'd have to go scavenge
amount<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.850> junkyard<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.600> really<00:03:22.810> didn't

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
amount of a junkyard and I really didn't

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.900 
amount of a junkyard and I really didn't
feel<00:03:23.109> like<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:23.470> all<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:23.920> tapped<00:03:24.489> into<00:03:24.760> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
feel like it's all I tapped into the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.539 
feel like it's all I tapped into the
main<00:03:24.940> line<00:03:25.359> going<00:03:25.810> into<00:03:26.049> there<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.500> then<00:03:27.340> I

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
main line going into there and then I

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.809 
main line going into there and then I
said<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.299> line<00:03:30.120> out<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.889> here<00:03:32.889> underneath

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
said that line out of here underneath

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.339 
said that line out of here underneath
and<00:03:34.120> then<00:03:34.510> out<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.900> here

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
and then out of here

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.050 
and then out of here
and<00:03:36.069> I've<00:03:36.160> got<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.370> running<00:03:36.609> over<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.389> I

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
and I've got it running over to that I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.319 
and I've got it running over to that I
got<00:03:40.060> my<00:03:40.410> main<00:03:41.410> power<00:03:41.709> line<00:03:41.970> coming<00:03:42.970> off<00:03:43.120> the

the air conditioning circuit or to a
switch<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.140> can<00:04:29.380> run<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:31.060> either

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
switch so that I can run that in either

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.980 
switch so that I can run that in either
when<00:04:31.990> I'm<00:04:32.080> towing<00:04:32.380> or<00:04:33.540> manually<00:04:34.540> turn<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.870> on

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
when I'm towing or manually turn it on

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.020 
when I'm towing or manually turn it on
if<00:04:35.230> I'm<00:04:35.380> having<00:04:35.590> an<00:04:35.830> overheating<00:04:36.430> issue<00:04:36.610> for

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
if I'm having an overheating issue for

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.610 
if I'm having an overheating issue for
whatever<00:04:37.180> reason<00:04:37.780> I<00:04:38.040> can<00:04:39.040> kick<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.640> on<00:04:40.620> the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
whatever reason I can kick that on the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.800 
whatever reason I can kick that on the
thought<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:42.100> is<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.490> run<00:04:42.670> it<00:04:42.790> actually<00:04:42.970> into

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
thought is is to run it actually into

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.540 
thought is is to run it actually into
the<00:04:44.940> 411<00:04:45.940> PCM<00:04:46.720> I<00:04:46.810> have<00:04:47.020> installed<00:04:47.550> because

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
the 411 PCM I have installed because

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.820 
the 411 PCM I have installed because
that<00:04:48.730> does<00:04:48.910> have<00:04:49.150> control<00:04:52.290> points<00:04:53.290> for<00:04:53.350> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
that does have control points for the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.650 
that does have control points for the
low<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:54.040> high<00:04:54.310> speed<00:04:54.790> on<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.030> fan<00:04:55.300> but<00:04:55.540> that

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
low and high speed on the fan but that

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.030 
low and high speed on the fan but that
has<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:55.930> be<00:04:56.020> programmed<00:04:56.290> in<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:56.950> I'm

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
has to be programmed in and I'm

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.820 
has to be programmed in and I'm
currently<00:04:57.310> not<00:04:57.490> in<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:57.790> position<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.660> get<00:04:59.590> that

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
currently not in a position to get that

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.500 
currently not in a position to get that
programmed<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.790> so<00:05:01.470> currently<00:05:02.470> it's<00:05:02.710> it's

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
programmed in so currently it's it's

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.270 
programmed in so currently it's it's
just<00:05:04.510> running<00:05:04.870> out<00:05:04.990> for<00:05:05.140> this<00:05:05.290> seventeen

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
just running out for this seventeen

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.020 
just running out for this seventeen
dollar<00:05:06.520> thermostat<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:08.670> eventually<00:05:09.670> into<00:05:10.000> a

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
dollar thermostat and eventually into a

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.790 
dollar thermostat and eventually into a
switch<00:05:10.420> on<00:05:10.660> the<00:05:10.780> dash<00:05:10.990> which<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.440> still<00:05:11.590> haven't

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
switch on the dash which I still haven't

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.950 
switch on the dash which I still haven't
figured<00:05:12.040> out<00:05:12.100> where<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.460> put<00:05:12.700> it<00:05:12.790> yet<00:05:12.970> but<00:05:13.930> I

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
figured out where to put it yet but I

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.070 
figured out where to put it yet but I
have<00:05:14.200> no<00:05:14.380> need<00:05:14.590> for<00:05:14.620> high<00:05:14.950> speed<00:05:15.310> on<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.550> fan<00:05:16.080> I

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
have no need for high speed on the fan I

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.020 
have no need for high speed on the fan I
haven't<00:05:17.830> worn<00:05:17.980> this<00:05:18.250> thing<00:05:18.460> up<00:05:18.580> so<00:05:18.760> I<00:05:18.820> won't

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
haven't worn this thing up so I won't

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.760 
haven't worn this thing up so I won't
turn<00:05:19.270> it<00:05:19.450> on<00:05:19.570> and<00:05:19.750> make<00:05:19.930> you<00:05:20.050> wait<00:05:20.260> for<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:20.560> fan

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
turn it on and make you wait for the fan

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.640 
turn it on and make you wait for the fan
to<00:05:20.890> kick<00:05:21.070> on<00:05:21.280> but<00:05:22.210> needless<00:05:22.840> to<00:05:23.140> say<00:05:23.170> when<00:05:23.560> it

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
to kick on but needless to say when it

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.550 
to kick on but needless to say when it
does<00:05:23.800> kick<00:05:24.010> on<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.520> can<00:05:24.760> feel<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:26.080> airflow

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
does kick on you can feel the airflow

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.370 
does kick on you can feel the airflow
coming<00:05:26.830> from<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:28.060> outside<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.780> van<00:05:28.990> and

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
coming from the outside of the van and

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.440 
coming from the outside of the van and
if<00:05:29.680> you're<00:05:29.800> standing<00:05:30.010> outside<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.640> door<00:05:30.910> on

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
if you're standing outside the door on

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.270 
if you're standing outside the door on

the passenger side when that high fan

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.430 
the passenger side when that high fan
kicks<00:05:33.610> in<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:34.450> can<00:05:34.630> feel<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:34.960> heat<00:05:35.110> across

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
kicks in you can feel the heat across

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.070 
kicks in you can feel the heat across
your<00:05:35.740> legs<00:05:35.950> so<00:05:36.760> I'm<00:05:37.120> pretty<00:05:37.510> happy<00:05:37.780> with<00:05:37.960> the

performance of it my problem is like
everything<00:05:41.920> I<00:05:42.040> seem<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.370> do<00:05:42.580> on<00:05:42.760> this<00:05:42.970> van<00:05:43.300> I

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
everything I seem to do on this van I

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.310 
everything I seem to do on this van I
fix<00:05:44.290> one<00:05:44.530> thing<00:05:44.800> something<00:05:45.340> else<00:05:45.790> goes<00:05:46.540> awry

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
and currently I need to figure out why

and currently I need to figure out why
I'm<00:05:50.260> getting<00:05:50.700> lean<00:05:51.700> Bank<00:05:52.090> cylinder<00:05:52.540> codes<00:05:52.780> for

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
I'm getting lean Bank cylinder codes for

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.010 
I'm getting lean Bank cylinder codes for
both<00:05:53.080> sides<00:05:53.590> of<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:55.030> engine<00:05:55.330> I'm<00:05:55.780> getting

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
both sides of the engine I'm getting

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.820 
both sides of the engine I'm getting
appeal<00:05:56.380> 71<00:05:57.070> and<00:05:57.190> 74<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.330> that<00:05:59.170> happened<00:05:59.650> right

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
appeal 71 and 74 and that happened right

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.770 
appeal 71 and 74 and that happened right
after<00:06:00.250> I<00:06:00.280> got<00:06:00.700> this<00:06:00.910> all<00:06:01.150> hooked<00:06:01.450> up<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.750> first

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
after I got this all hooked up the first

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.180 
after I got this all hooked up the first
time<00:06:02.370> so<00:06:03.370> that's<00:06:03.550> my<00:06:03.730> next<00:06:03.790> project<00:06:04.180> but<00:06:05.190> just

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
time so that's my next project but just

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.620 
time so that's my next project but just
wanted<00:06:06.400> to<00:06:06.430> show<00:06:06.520> you<00:06:06.610> guys<00:06:06.880> what<00:06:07.120> I<00:06:07.150> did

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
wanted to show you guys what I did

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.230 
wanted to show you guys what I did
installing<00:06:08.230> this<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:09.520> other<00:06:09.640> thing<00:06:09.820> I<00:06:09.910> did<00:06:09.970> do

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
installing this the other thing I did do

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.170 
installing this the other thing I did do
is<00:06:10.390> I<00:06:10.480> use<00:06:10.660> the<00:06:10.870> original<00:06:11.490> fan<00:06:12.490> shroud<00:06:12.760> you

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
is I use the original fan shroud you

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.400 
is I use the original fan shroud you
can't<00:06:13.420> see<00:06:13.600> it<00:06:13.720> down<00:06:13.840> there<00:06:14.020> at<00:06:14.140> the<00:06:14.230> bottom

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
can't see it down there at the bottom

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.040 
can't see it down there at the bottom
but<00:06:14.680> I<00:06:14.740> cut<00:06:15.040> that<00:06:15.280> off<00:06:15.490> and<00:06:15.850> I'm<00:06:16.300> using<00:06:16.510> that<00:06:16.780> as

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
but I cut that off and I'm using that as

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.980 
but I cut that off and I'm using that as
a<00:06:17.340> support<00:06:18.340> for<00:06:18.370> this<00:06:18.700> and<00:06:18.970> then<00:06:19.060> I<00:06:19.150> have<00:06:19.360> two

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
a support for this and then I have two

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.190 
a support for this and then I have two
screws<00:06:20.350> going<00:06:20.650> into<00:06:21.190> the<00:06:21.370> actual<00:06:21.990> holes<00:06:22.990> that

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
screws going into the actual holes that

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.770 
screws going into the actual holes that
are<00:06:23.260> in<00:06:23.380> the<00:06:23.530> radiator<00:06:24.000> fin<00:06:25.000> on<00:06:25.150> the<00:06:25.180> top<00:06:25.480> just

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
are in the radiator fin on the top just

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.300 
are in the radiator fin on the top just
to<00:06:25.810> hold<00:06:26.050> that<00:06:26.230> in<00:06:26.410> place<00:06:26.530> I<00:06:26.860> think<00:06:26.920> that

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
to hold that in place I think that

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.340

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
plastic and and hold that in place so

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.399
