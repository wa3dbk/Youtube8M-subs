juncture this method is probably the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.889 
juncture this method is probably the
most<00:01:59.399> complicated<00:01:59.850> unless<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.780> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
most complicated unless you are of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.870

nail because jujube seeds aren't the
easiest<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.899> handle<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.350> think<00:02:07.560> they're<00:02:07.680> like

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
easiest to handle I think they're like

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.650 
easiest to handle I think they're like
tiny<00:02:08.009> yeah<00:02:08.399> they're<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:08.759> super<00:02:09.209> small<00:02:09.450> yeah

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
tiny yeah they're like super small yeah

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.050

I'm<00:02:09.720> gonna<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.200> real<00:02:11.160> quick<00:02:11.190> seven<00:02:11.819> times

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
I'm gonna do it real quick seven times

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.150 
I'm gonna do it real quick seven times

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
by her now this is probably pretty

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.400 
by her now this is probably pretty
straightforward<00:02:17.180> way<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.420> defeat<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.110> child

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
according to the book this is a pool you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.020 
according to the book this is a pool you
the<00:02:23.630> crackling<00:02:24.500> flames<00:02:24.860> will<00:02:25.490> burn<00:02:25.640> the
