00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
it you know the chorus of an 820

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.290 
it you know the chorus of an 820
processor<00:02:04.090> probably<00:02:05.090> would<00:02:05.180> have<00:02:05.210> been

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
processor probably would have been

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.870 
processor probably would have been
better<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:05.900> for<00:02:06.200> another<00:02:06.320> 300<00:02:06.619> bucks<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.220> don't

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
better but for another 300 bucks I don't

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.680 
better but for another 300 bucks I don't
think<00:02:07.910> it<00:02:08.149> was<00:02:08.240> worth<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.580> core<00:02:10.760> i7<00:02:11.120> 720

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
think it was worth it so the core i7 720

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.100 
think it was worth it so the core i7 720

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
my password keeps blinking when it

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.819 
my password keeps blinking when it
blinks<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.919> moves<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.639> cursor<00:03:53.139> back<00:03:54.139> to<00:03:54.709> the

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
blinks that moves the cursor back to the

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.110 
blinks that moves the cursor back to the
beginning<00:03:55.090> so<00:03:56.090> I<00:03:56.419> try<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.379> type<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:58.280> watch<00:03:58.819> see

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
beginning so I try to type to watch see

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.250 
beginning so I try to type to watch see
it<00:03:59.419> moves<00:03:59.689> the<00:03:59.810> cursor<00:03:59.959> backwards<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:03.200> I

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
it moves the cursor backwards so and I

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.659 
it moves the cursor backwards so and I
thought<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.709> know<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:03.980> wasn't<00:04:04.129> accepting<00:04:04.579> my

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
thought you know it wasn't accepting my

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.640 
thought you know it wasn't accepting my
password<00:04:04.819> as<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.359> know<00:04:05.419> correct<00:04:06.319> because<00:04:06.470> it

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
password as I know correct because it

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.809 
password as I know correct because it
said<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.829> password<00:04:07.189> is<00:04:07.250> incorrect<00:04:07.340> but

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
said the password is incorrect but

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:08.830 
said the password is incorrect but
that's<00:04:08.030> because<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.359> keeps<00:04:08.450> moving<00:04:08.810> the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
that's because it keeps moving the

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.659 
that's because it keeps moving the
cursor<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:10.220> what<00:04:10.879> you<00:04:11.030> should<00:04:11.209> do<00:04:11.389> is<00:04:12.639> make<00:04:13.639> it

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
cursor so what you should do is make it

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.949 
cursor so what you should do is make it
go<00:04:13.909> to<00:04:13.970> sleep<00:04:14.299> again<00:04:16.120> nothing<00:04:17.120> wait<00:04:17.599> a<00:04:17.630> little

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
go to sleep again nothing wait a little

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.080 
go to sleep again nothing wait a little
bit<00:04:18.169> it<00:04:19.070> should<00:04:19.280> work<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.639> just<00:04:19.820> heard<00:04:19.940> the

bit it should work you just heard the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:28.460
