00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.880
 hi guys welcome back and welcome 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.299
 for a new falcon video vi 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.910
 I will present this new limited is that 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:15.360
 by assassin's creed the io version 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:22.460
 for playstation 3 but on the other hand it is 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.510
 same for all versions then 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.940
 so we can start this is the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.490
 package neither of the limited edition that in 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:34.350
 reality would be the freedom edition 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:43.950
 then we go to open our bel 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:48.210
 stage we show it here it is then 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.390
 personally I think the box of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.260
 this limited is the most beautiful anyway 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:02.670
 the most pleasant that has ever happened 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:06.180
 in short it looks great in hard cardboard 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.790
 well done but above all this 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.560
 bas-relief of the symbol of the assassins 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.830
 I really really like it since then 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.850
 we are going to open it with one hand not there 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.850
 I'll never succeed 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 behold, as you have seen, it is taken away 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 practically this cap inside 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.290
 we find now he puts it back in because 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.509
 they hunted obviously these days 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.649
 I 'm playing with it so we find it 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.460
 practically so then we have 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:51.509
 basically a few things that is 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:02:03.929
 obviously the game discounted a booklet 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:05.070
 which would then be a diary and this too 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.450
 it is very carroccio with a lot of 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.140
 bookmark play then have a letter 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.730
 with two postcards inside, nothing 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.739
 particular nothing exceptional also 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.170
 because we have these castellini but 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:24.390
 inside departure they will surely remain 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.760
 in eternal colonial America then 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.650
 late eighteenth century and finally we have one 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.680
 simple box 3 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.820
 here is the beauty where we can insert the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.799
 our game 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:43.500
 so the same nothing special e 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:45.390
 simply a replacement for the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.280
 normal plastic box of which 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.480
 however, was equipped with the game so 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.459
 if we want we put the companies there 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.350
 classic box we don't do but the thing 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.920
 main of this limited we say 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.920
 let this nice guy be here 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.550
 then he and commerce is the protagonist 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:21.100
 obviously who knows if we have then 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.720
 this flag I think I go 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.340
 attacking somewhere that the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.850
 capria but we see some together 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.850
 then 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.120
 and here it is our dear condor 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:32.070
 it's really well made it's plastic 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:33.960
 really hard plastic really cunts and if 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.810
 you have noticed but surely you have not 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:42.660
 done there is already the dedicated space on the 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:50.700
 my desk next to the duke and side 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:53.580
 a marcos then this short unboxing from 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:58.410
 just 5 minutes practically finished 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.730
 because within this limited that 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.570
 practically we were finding it 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:09.210
 still on the internet to something like 15 20 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:15.740
 euro more than the game alone in short 15 in 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:20.330
 plus you have two postcards a box in 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:23.669
 in metal a diary 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.729
 obviously the game and this box that 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:30.390
 I particularly liked but 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:33.630
 especially you have the puppet if so 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.930
 we can define it or rather statuette of 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.720
 connor that if you want to buy it you can 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.760
 buy it individually pro vendola 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.900
 gamestop and costs 29 euros 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.620
 there is also the version while holding 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.940
 the bow and costs equal 29 to a box 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.450
 undetermined 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.450
 goodbye guys
