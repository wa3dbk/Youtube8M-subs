00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.120 

we're<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.959> lab<00:00:04.170> where<00:00:04.710> Lonnie's<00:00:04.980> gonna

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
we're in the lab where Lonnie's gonna

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.889 
we're in the lab where Lonnie's gonna
show<00:00:05.370> us<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.670> reaction<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.150> alkali<00:00:06.569> metals

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
show us the reaction of alkali metals

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:07.550 
show us the reaction of alkali metals
with<00:00:07.080> water

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
with water

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.749 
with water
the<00:00:08.189> first<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.730> sodium<00:00:09.620> as<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.800> place<00:00:11.040> sodium

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the first is sodium as you place sodium

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.940 
the first is sodium as you place sodium
metal<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.179> water<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.840> reaction<00:00:13.769> will<00:00:13.920> occur

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
metal in water a reaction will occur

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.930 
metal in water a reaction will occur
where<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.969> sodium<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.870> oxidized<00:00:16.830> or<00:00:17.100> ionized

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
where the sodium is oxidized or ionized

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.470 
where the sodium is oxidized or ionized
to<00:00:18.570> sodium<00:00:19.320> plus<00:00:19.670> while<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.850> water<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
to sodium plus while the water is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.000 
to sodium plus while the water is
reduced<00:00:21.960> now<00:00:23.029> the<00:00:24.029> reduction<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.539> water

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
reduced now the reduction of water

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.429 
reduced now the reduction of water
releases<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.310> tremendous<00:00:26.939> amount<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.269> energy

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
releases a tremendous amount of energy

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.429 
releases a tremendous amount of energy
but<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:29.250> case<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.420> ionization<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
but in this case the ionization of

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.100 
but in this case the ionization of
sodium<00:00:31.859> requires<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.149> significant<00:00:33.870> amount<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
sodium requires a significant amount of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.709 
sodium requires a significant amount of
energy<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.559> fact<00:00:34.800> they<00:00:35.280> about<00:00:35.700> equalize<00:00:36.510> each

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
energy in fact they about equalize each

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.459 
energy in fact they about equalize each
other<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.800> reaction<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.370> quite<00:00:38.700> subdued

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
other so this reaction is quite subdued

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.459 
other so this reaction is quite subdued
the<00:00:40.469> energy<00:00:41.460> required<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.270> ionize<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.050> sodium

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the energy required to ionize the sodium

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.639 
the energy required to ionize the sodium
is<00:00:43.789> offset<00:00:44.789> by<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.030> energy<00:00:45.480> released<00:00:45.899> by<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
is offset by the energy released by the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
is offset by the energy released by the
reduction<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> water<00:00:50.780> now<00:00:51.780> let's<00:00:52.020> look<00:00:52.140> at

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
reduction of the water now let's look at

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.569 
reduction of the water now let's look at
the<00:00:52.350> reaction<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:52.860> potassium<00:00:55.579> potassium

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the reaction with potassium potassium

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.279 
the reaction with potassium potassium
has<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.629> lower<00:00:57.930> ionization<00:00:58.859> energy

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
has a lower ionization energy

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.820 
has a lower ionization energy
so<00:01:01.289> when<00:01:02.219> potassium<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> ionized<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:04.110> lower

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so when potassium is ionized a lower

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.429 
so when potassium is ionized a lower
amount<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.280> energy<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.729> required<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> same

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
amount of energy is required the same

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
amount of energy is required the same
amount<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> energy<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.430> released<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
amount of energy is released when the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.500 
amount of energy is released when the
water<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.140> reduced<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.820> reaction

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
water is reduced so this reaction

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.310 
water is reduced so this reaction
proceeds<00:01:13.500> more<00:01:13.860> vigorously<00:01:17.390> if<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.600> go<00:01:18.780> one

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
proceeds more vigorously if we go one

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.109 
proceeds more vigorously if we go one
element<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.189> periodic<00:01:20.640> table<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
element down the periodic table to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.160 
element down the periodic table to
rubidium<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:22.170> lower<00:01:23.130> ionization<00:01:24.030> energy<00:01:24.420> we

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
rubidium a lower ionization energy we

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.620 
rubidium a lower ionization energy we
should<00:01:25.380> see<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> energy<00:01:26.790> that's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
should see more of the energy that's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.710 
should see more of the energy that's
released<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.590> water<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.250> reduced<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
released when water is reduced for the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.160 
released when water is reduced for the
rubidium<00:01:31.079> metal<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.540> indeed<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.720> reaction

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
rubidium metal and indeed that reaction

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.219 
rubidium metal and indeed that reaction
happened<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.680> quickly<00:01:35.750> we<00:01:36.750> should<00:01:36.900> watch<00:01:37.079> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
happened so quickly we should watch it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:45.010 
happened so quickly we should watch it
again<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.590> slow<00:01:37.619> motion

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020 

the<00:01:46.020> fourth<00:01:46.290> medal<00:01:46.620> in<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.830> series<00:01:47.190> francium

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the fourth medal in this series francium

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.770 
the fourth medal in this series francium
has<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.870> lowest<00:01:49.050> ionization<00:01:49.350> energy<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.130> all

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
has the lowest ionization energy of all

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.570 
has the lowest ionization energy of all
so<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.930> should<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.350> virtually<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
so we should see virtually all the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.150 
so we should see virtually all the
energy<00:01:53.940> from<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.870> water<00:01:55.050> reduction<00:01:55.650> being

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
energy from the water reduction being

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.390 
energy from the water reduction being
released

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
released

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.080 
released
so<00:01:59.400> here's<00:01:59.670> francium<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.800> water<00:02:02.090> chemical

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
so here's francium and water chemical

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
so here's francium and water chemical
reaction
