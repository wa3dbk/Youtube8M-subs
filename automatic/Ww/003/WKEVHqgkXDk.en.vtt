maybe over the last four years has been
devoted<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.469> notion<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.040> think

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
devoted to this notion that I think

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.089

because<00:00:40.680> that's<00:00:40.920> how<00:00:41.160> our<00:00:41.370> economy<00:00:41.879> is

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
because that's how our economy is

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.270 
because that's how our economy is
growing<00:00:42.079> that's<00:00:43.079> how<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.320> built<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.100> world's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

greatest middle class and and that is

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.970 
greatest middle class and and that is
part<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.079> what's<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.440> stake<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.920> election

part of what's at stake in this election

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
part of what's at stake in this election
there's<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> fundamentally<00:00:51.239> different<00:00:51.270> vision

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

about<00:00:52.500> how<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:52.920> move<00:00:53.250> our<00:00:53.430> country<00:00:53.789> forward<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
about how we move our country forward I

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.150 
about how we move our country forward I
believe<00:00:56.039> Governor<00:00:56.399> Romney<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> good<00:00:56.940> man

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
but I also believe that when he said but

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.660 
but I also believe that when he said but
