river<00:01:51.429> on<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.670> sides<00:01:51.970> where<00:01:52.270> we're<00:01:52.360> going<00:01:52.479> to

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
river on the sides where we're going to

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.719 
river on the sides where we're going to
use<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.989> get<00:01:53.110> into<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.619> wave<00:01:53.800> or<00:01:54.220> exit<00:01:54.610> the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
use to get into the wave or exit the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.969 
use to get into the wave or exit the
river<00:01:54.910> lastly<00:01:55.539> we<00:01:55.660> have<00:01:55.840> these<00:01:56.050> shoulders<00:01:56.800> to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
river lastly we have these shoulders to

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.120 
river lastly we have these shoulders to
the<00:01:57.009> wave<00:01:57.220> here<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.910> you<00:01:58.090> can<00:01:58.119> see<00:01:58.270> feeding

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the wave here as you can see feeding

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.770 
the wave here as you can see feeding
laterally<00:02:00.130> into<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.550> wave<00:02:00.700> there<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.300> we're

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
laterally into the wave there and we're

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.600 
laterally into the wave there and we're
going<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:01.929> use<00:02:02.080> those<00:02:02.349> who<00:02:02.530> are<00:02:02.619> surfing<00:02:03.130> onto

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
going to use those who are surfing onto

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.900 
going to use those who are surfing onto
the<00:02:03.729> wave<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.539> those<00:02:04.690> are<00:02:04.810> some<00:02:04.929> River<00:02:05.140> basics

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
the wave so those are some River basics

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.279 
the wave so those are some River basics
all<00:02:06.910> right<00:02:07.119> here's<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.390> few<00:02:07.599> tips<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:08.050> pointers

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
all right here's a few tips and pointers

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.080 
all right here's a few tips and pointers
and<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.530> make<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:08.739> more<00:02:09.069> successful<00:02:09.369> for<00:02:10.030> you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
and to make it more successful for you

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.880 
and to make it more successful for you
to<00:02:10.179> get<00:02:10.300> on<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.479> wave<00:02:10.630> every<00:02:11.080> time<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:11.770> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
to get on the wave every time so the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.589 
to get on the wave every time so the
first<00:02:12.130> thing<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.550> like<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.150> pick<00:02:13.569> up

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
first thing I like to do is pick up

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.020 
first thing I like to do is pick up
speed<00:02:14.050> from<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.349> Eddy<00:02:14.590> moving<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
speed from the Eddy moving on to the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.910 
speed from the Eddy moving on to the
wave<00:02:16.150> really<00:02:16.720> important<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.260> pick<00:02:17.410> up<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.650> lot

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
wave really important to pick up a lot

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.160 
wave really important to pick up a lot
of<00:02:17.950> speed<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.580> much<00:02:18.910> as<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.180> can<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.660> maintain

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
of speed as much as you can and maintain

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.530 
of speed as much as you can and maintain
that<00:02:20.200> momentum<00:02:20.650> when<00:02:21.489> you're<00:02:21.610> busting<00:02:22.120> across

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
that momentum when you're busting across

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.270 
that momentum when you're busting across
that<00:02:22.780> wave<00:02:22.930> shoulder<00:02:23.319> onto<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.709> wave

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
that wave shoulder onto the wave

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.400 
that wave shoulder onto the wave
secondly<00:02:25.000> really<00:02:25.780> important<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.170> pick<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
secondly really important to pick the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.860 
secondly really important to pick the
sweet<00:02:26.770> spot<00:02:27.130> when<00:02:27.850> you're<00:02:27.970> peeling<00:02:28.210> onto<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
sweet spot when you're peeling onto the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.360 
sweet spot when you're peeling onto the
way<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.230> sweet<00:02:29.470> spot<00:02:29.710> is<00:02:29.740> going<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.980> be<00:02:30.040> right

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
way the sweet spot is going to be right

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.120 
way the sweet spot is going to be right
in<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.640> middle<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.940> that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
in the middle of that

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.680 
in the middle of that
shoulder<00:02:31.460> think<00:02:31.670> about<00:02:31.850> putting<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.240> nose<00:02:32.480> of

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
shoulder think about putting the nose of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.900 
shoulder think about putting the nose of
your<00:02:32.720> board<00:02:32.840> right<00:02:33.740> in<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.040> trough<00:02:34.490> or<00:02:34.820> the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
your board right in the trough or the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.790 
your board right in the trough or the
bottom<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.570> way<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.140> if<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.320> go<00:02:36.440> too<00:02:36.500> high

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
bottom of that way so if you go too high

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.930 
bottom of that way so if you go too high
in<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.010> foam<00:02:37.220> pile<00:02:37.400> you're<00:02:37.610> going<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.790> fall

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
in the foam pile you're going to fall

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.490 
in the foam pile you're going to fall
off<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.180> back<00:02:38.330> or<00:02:38.600> too<00:02:38.720> far<00:02:38.930> away<00:02:39.020> from<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
off the back or too far away from the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.020 
off the back or too far away from the
wave<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.950> you're<00:02:40.310> not<00:02:40.430> going<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.610> make<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.910> on

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
wave and you're not going to make it on

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.670 
wave and you're not going to make it on
so<00:02:41.240> really<00:02:41.360> important<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.900> get<00:02:42.020> right<00:02:42.320> in<00:02:42.560> that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
so really important to get right in that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.020 
so really important to get right in that
sweet<00:02:42.980> spot<00:02:43.010> right<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.640> middle<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
sweet spot right in the middle of the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.690 
sweet spot right in the middle of the
shoulder<00:02:44.560> lastly<00:02:45.560> it's<00:02:46.040> really<00:02:46.280> important<00:02:46.610> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
shoulder lastly it's really important to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.130 
shoulder lastly it's really important to
have<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.940> correct<00:02:47.240> angle<00:02:47.510> when<00:02:48.020> you're

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
have the correct angle when you're

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.080 
have the correct angle when you're
busting<00:02:48.920> onto<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.280> wave<00:02:49.460> so<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:49.970> think

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
busting onto the wave so if you think

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.480 
busting onto the wave so if you think
about<00:02:50.210> 12<00:02:50.660> o'clock<00:02:50.750> being<00:02:51.290> directly<00:02:51.770> upstream

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
about 12 o'clock being directly upstream

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.940 
about 12 o'clock being directly upstream
depending<00:02:53.480> on<00:02:53.570> which<00:02:53.780> side<00:02:54.020> River<00:02:54.530> left<00:02:54.740> or

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
depending on which side River left or

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.560 
depending on which side River left or
river<00:02:55.130> right<00:02:55.370> you're<00:02:55.550> coming<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:56.030> from<00:02:56.210> you're

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
river right you're coming in from you're

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.060 
river right you're coming in from you're
going<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.750> want<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.930> have<00:02:57.080> one<00:02:57.110> o'clock<00:02:57.770> or<00:02:58.010> 11

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
going to want to have one o'clock or 11

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.130 
going to want to have one o'clock or 11
o'clock<00:02:58.520> angle<00:02:59.120> keeping<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.570> angle<00:02:59.930> really

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
o'clock angle keeping that angle really

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.980 
o'clock angle keeping that angle really
high<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.130> basically<00:03:01.340> slide<00:03:02.090> right<00:03:02.630> onto

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
high so you basically slide right onto

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:16.780 
high so you basically slide right onto
the<00:03:03.080> wave

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.920 

all<00:03:17.790> right<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.120> depending<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.510> your<00:03:18.629> local

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
all right so depending on your local

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.869 
all right so depending on your local
spot<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:20.069> what<00:03:20.190> side<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.550> river<00:03:20.700> you're

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
spot and what side of the river you're

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.339 
spot and what side of the river you're
coming<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:21.420> from<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.810> going<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:21.989> make<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.140> big

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
coming in from is going to make a big

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:23.509 
coming in from is going to make a big
difference<00:03:22.500> whether<00:03:22.830> you're<00:03:22.980> regular<00:03:23.370> or

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
difference whether you're regular or

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.150 
difference whether you're regular or
goofy<00:03:23.870> ideally<00:03:24.870> goofy<00:03:25.620> footers<00:03:25.890> are<00:03:25.980> going<00:03:26.099> to

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
goofy ideally goofy footers are going to

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.500 
goofy ideally goofy footers are going to
be<00:03:26.220> paddling<00:03:26.549> in<00:03:26.640> from<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.849> river<00:03:26.970> left<00:03:27.269> side

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
be paddling in from the river left side

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.330 
be paddling in from the river left side
that<00:03:27.750> way<00:03:27.870> as<00:03:28.080> you're<00:03:28.230> paddling<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.890> you're

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
