also used an analog filter ship because

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.089 
also used an analog filter ship because
this<00:00:30.810> gives<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.050> pretty<00:00:31.260> nice<00:00:31.410> residence<00:00:31.890> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
this gives a pretty nice residence and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.020 
this gives a pretty nice residence and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
make one yourself you shouldn't have too

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
make one yourself you shouldn't have too
many<00:00:43.590> problems<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.219> without<00:00:44.820> further<00:00:44.940> ado

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
many problems so without further ado

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:55.850 
many problems so without further ado
here<00:00:45.690> she<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:53.149> right<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.870> brother

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
here she is right so here we are brother

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.490 
here she is right so here we are brother
sin<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.399> there's<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.140> introduction<00:00:58.140> screen

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
sin so there's a introduction screen

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.119 
sin so there's a introduction screen
there<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.710> synthesizes<00:01:01.710> got

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
there you can see that synthesizes got

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.429 
there you can see that synthesizes got
got<00:01:02.579> eight<00:01:02.789> tactile<00:01:03.510> knobs<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.260> can

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
got eight tactile knobs that you can

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.960 
got eight tactile knobs that you can
sort<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> turn<00:01:04.860> around<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.460> sort<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
sort of turn around and sort of

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.600 
sort of turn around and sort of
customized<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> your<00:01:06.630> own<00:01:06.720> effect<00:01:07.580> at<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
customized to your own effect at the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.230 
customized to your own effect at the
back<00:01:08.909> we've<00:01:09.270> got<00:01:09.590> we've<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.619> audio<00:01:11.100> input<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
back we've got we've got audio input and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.230 
back we've got we've got audio input and
just<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:13.170> coming<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.650> family

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.720 

so<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:23.320> we<00:01:23.470> go<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:23.710> get<00:01:23.800> started<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.370> consider

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
so if we go and get started you consider

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.950 
so if we go and get started you consider
we've<00:01:24.880> got<00:01:24.970> our<00:01:25.090> first<00:01:25.300> set<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.570> state<00:01:25.810> which

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
we've got our first set of state which

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.620 
we've got our first set of state which
is<00:01:25.990> sort<00:01:26.290> of<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.440> can<00:01:26.560> do<00:01:26.680> pitch<00:01:26.890> bender

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.330 

so<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.689> probably<00:01:34.930> wouldn't<00:01:35.229> see<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.649> other

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
so you probably wouldn't see the other

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.070 
so you probably wouldn't see the other
types<00:01:36.579> of<00:01:36.670> things<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:36.970> we<00:01:37.149> can<00:01:37.270> get<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.509> it<00:01:37.630> so

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
types of things that we can get on it so

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.480 
types of things that we can get on it so
I'll<00:01:38.200> just<00:01:38.229> launched<00:01:38.890> us<00:01:39.100> into<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.280> we<00:01:42.399> can

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
I'll just launched us into it so we can

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.160 
I'll just launched us into it so we can
sort<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:42.789> adjust<00:01:43.420> any<00:01:43.720> of<00:01:43.810> these<00:01:43.899> parameters

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
sort of adjust any of these parameters

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.109 
sort of adjust any of these parameters
through<00:01:44.710> through<00:01:45.460> outs<00:01:45.549> of<00:01:45.700> tactile

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
through through outs of tactile

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.510 
through through outs of tactile
interface<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:46.720> if<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:46.899> go<00:01:46.930> along<00:01:47.289> and<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:48.100> hit<00:01:48.310> the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
interface so if I go along and I hit the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.410 
interface so if I go along and I hit the
learn<00:01:48.970> button<00:01:49.000> here<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:51.399> can<00:01:51.520> see<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:51.729> all

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
learn button here you can see that all

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.880 
learn button here you can see that all
the<00:01:52.570> learnable<00:01:52.929> controls<00:01:53.320> have<00:01:53.439> been<00:01:53.500> so

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
the learnable controls have been so

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.580 
the learnable controls have been so
highlighted<00:01:54.429> so<00:01:54.610> if<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.759> just<00:01:54.789> go<00:01:55.090> into<00:01:55.330> there

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
highlighted so if I just go into there

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.020 
highlighted so if I just go into there
it<00:01:56.590> will<00:01:56.649> give<00:01:56.830> me<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:56.979> dialog<00:01:57.369> sort<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.759> that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
it will give me a dialog sort of that

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.570 
it will give me a dialog sort of that
set<00:01:58.960> one<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.170> these<00:01:59.229> things<00:01:59.530> up<00:01:59.770> so<00:02:00.039> if<00:02:00.189> I<00:02:00.340> now

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
set one of these things up so if I now

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.520 
set one of these things up so if I now
move<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.880> control<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.959> can<00:02:02.110> see<00:02:02.289> that<00:02:02.409> that's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
move the control you can see that that's

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.930 
move the control you can see that that's
now<00:02:02.770> moving<00:02:03.009> along<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:03.549> I<00:02:03.580> can<00:02:03.759> switch

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
now moving along so I can switch

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.090 
now moving along so I can switch
learning<00:02:04.270> mode<00:02:04.420> off<00:02:04.569> and<00:02:04.840> from<00:02:05.740> here<00:02:05.890> on<00:02:05.950> out

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
learning mode off and from here on out

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.039 
learning mode off and from here on out
you<00:02:06.310> can<00:02:06.459> see<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.880> as<00:02:07.000> I'm<00:02:07.240> moving<00:02:07.420> my<00:02:07.600> finger

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
you can see that as I'm moving my finger

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.759 
you can see that as I'm moving my finger
here<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:09.450> values<00:02:10.450> are<00:02:10.479> changing<00:02:10.989> so<00:02:11.140> i'll

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
here the values are changing so i'll

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.259 
here the values are changing so i'll
show<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.069> little<00:02:12.280> bit<00:02:12.430> about<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.819> the

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
show you a little bit about the the

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.580 
show you a little bit about the the
other<00:02:13.330> features<00:02:13.690> we've<00:02:13.810> got<00:02:14.019> here<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:17.200> first

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
other features we've got here so first

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.470 
other features we've got here so first
effect<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.069> we<00:02:18.190> first<00:02:18.760> thing<00:02:19.030> we<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.299> sort

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
effect that we first thing we can sort

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.059 
effect that we first thing we can sort
of<00:02:19.510> do<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.780> sort<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:19.989> change<00:02:20.260> change<00:02:20.860> our

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
of do is sort of change change our

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.590 
of do is sort of change change our
oscillator<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.640> at<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.790> moment<00:02:21.970> we're<00:02:22.299> all<00:02:22.420> on

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
oscillator so at the moment we're all on

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.729 
oscillator so at the moment we're all on
on<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:23.730> unsorted

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.809 

so<00:02:28.739> uh<00:02:28.769> how<00:02:29.280> much<00:02:29.459> just<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.360> them<00:02:30.450> Sir

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:46.780 

just<00:02:34.819> step<00:02:35.000> down<00:02:35.030> there

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.660 

you

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
you

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.949 
you
we've<00:02:49.670> also<00:02:49.819> got<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.390> low<00:02:50.780> frequency

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
we've also got a low frequency

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.170 
we've also got a low frequency
oscillator<00:02:51.319> so<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.010> can<00:02:52.400> just<00:02:52.579> go<00:02:52.760> along<00:02:53.000> and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
oscillator so I can just go along and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.530 
oscillator so I can just go along and
say<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.720> want<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.379> LFO<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.950> be<00:02:55.099> a<00:02:55.129> sine<00:02:55.549> wave<00:02:55.579> if

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
say I want the LFO to be a sine wave if

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.910 
say I want the LFO to be a sine wave if
I<00:02:56.689> do<00:02:56.840> that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
I do that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:23.010 
I do that
and<00:02:59.459> then<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.700> can<00:02:59.910> just<00:02:59.940> push<00:03:00.209> my<00:03:00.450> hello<00:03:00.780> foil

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.260 

remember<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:23.830> top<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.400> we've<00:03:24.670> also<00:03:24.850> got

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
remember on top of that we've also got

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.090 
remember on top of that we've also got
the<00:03:25.570> analog<00:03:25.990> filter<00:03:26.440> which<00:03:26.590> I'll<00:03:26.740> show<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:26.950> in

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
the analog filter which I'll show you in

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.130 
the analog filter which I'll show you in
here<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.790> here's<00:03:31.030> our<00:03:31.180> analog<00:03:31.510> filter<00:03:31.960> and

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
here so here's our analog filter and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.050 
here so here's our analog filter and
we've<00:03:32.830> also<00:03:32.980> got<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.490> ability<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.820> sort<00:03:34.030> of

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
we've also got the ability of sort of

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.510 
we've also got the ability of sort of
modulates<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.690> filtered<00:03:35.500> output<00:03:35.680> with<00:03:36.310> the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
modulates the filtered output with the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.540 
modulates the filtered output with the
with<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.480> input<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.590> I'll<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:38.740> well<00:03:39.190> do<00:03:39.400> is

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
with the input so I'll just well do is

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.550 
with the input so I'll just well do is
I'll<00:03:39.670> just<00:03:39.820> tell<00:03:40.330> this<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.690> learn<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.320> some<00:03:41.500> of

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
I'll just tell this to learn and some of

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.850 
I'll just tell this to learn and some of
the<00:03:41.650> controls<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.310> if<00:03:42.370> i<00:03:42.520> go<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:44.080> learn<00:03:44.530> and

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
the controls so if i go to learn and

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.950 
the controls so if i go to learn and
i'll<00:03:45.730> just<00:03:45.910> set<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.240> cutoff<00:03:46.510> frequency

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
i'll just set the cutoff frequency

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.680 
i'll just set the cutoff frequency
control<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.620> knob<00:03:47.830> up<00:03:47.950> here<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:49.330> we<00:03:49.450> go

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
control to this knob up here and we go

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.320 
control to this knob up here and we go
i'll<00:03:50.080> set<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.290> prisoners<00:03:50.770> one<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.270> one

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
i'll set the prisoners one to this one

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:09.200 
i'll set the prisoners one to this one
here<00:03:54.570> here<00:03:55.570> we<00:03:55.660> go<00:03:55.870> now<00:03:56.680> if<00:03:56.740> i<00:03:56.860> start<00:03:57.190> playing

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:19.620 

so<00:04:10.210> just<00:04:10.510> pretty<00:04:10.870> fun

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:49.810 

10<00:04:20.200> reasons

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.540 

bland<00:04:50.820> bland<00:04:51.300> bland<00:04:52.070> can't<00:04:53.070> actually<00:04:53.250> played

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
bland bland bland can't actually played

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.610 
bland bland bland can't actually played
it<00:04:53.730> very<00:04:53.880> well<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:54.510> you'll<00:04:55.140> have<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.410> bear<00:04:55.560> with

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
it very well so you'll have to bear with

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.830 
it very well so you'll have to bear with
me<00:04:55.830> on<00:04:55.950> that<00:04:56.070> one<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:57.240> next<00:04:57.480> sort<00:04:57.630> of<00:04:57.690> feature

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
me on that one the next sort of feature

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.430 
me on that one the next sort of feature
i'd<00:04:58.020> like<00:04:58.170> to<00:04:58.290> show<00:04:58.440> you<00:04:58.500> is<00:04:58.650> a<00:04:59.490> jetta<00:05:00.150> now<00:05:00.900> this

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
i'd like to show you is a jetta now this

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.870 
i'd like to show you is a jetta now this
is<00:05:01.500> sort<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.860> loosely<00:05:02.130> based<00:05:02.430> on<00:05:02.730> the

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
is sort of loosely based on the

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.510 
is sort of loosely based on the
arpeggiator<00:05:03.390> of<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:03.780> role<00:05:04.230> in<00:05:04.380> Jupiter<00:05:04.740> 8<00:05:04.920> so

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
arpeggiator of the role in Jupiter 8 so

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.220 
arpeggiator of the role in Jupiter 8 so
you<00:05:05.610> sort<00:05:05.790> of<00:05:05.850> got<00:05:05.970> your<00:05:06.090> typical<00:05:06.390> sort<00:05:06.660> of<00:05:06.780> art

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
you sort of got your typical sort of art

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.780 
you sort of got your typical sort of art
style<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:07.830> we<00:05:07.890> can<00:05:08.040> I'll<00:05:08.250> just<00:05:08.370> turn<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.610> on

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
style so we can I'll just turn that on

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:17.559 
style so we can I'll just turn that on
now<00:05:09.120> there<00:05:09.360> we<00:05:09.450> go

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:38.870 

so<00:05:18.569> let's<00:05:18.869> just<00:05:19.139> crank<00:05:19.529> that<00:05:19.679> up

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.660 

ok<00:05:39.880> so<00:05:39.940> let's<00:05:40.330> change<00:05:40.570> our<00:05:40.840> also<00:05:41.620> okay<00:05:41.950> because

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
ok so let's change our also okay because

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:51.559 
ok so let's change our also okay because
she's<00:05:42.970> down

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:06:09.940 

that's<00:05:52.469> ten<00:05:52.740> number<00:05:53.069> of<00:05:53.219> ties<00:05:53.460> down

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:30.330 

naked<00:06:10.950> enough<00:06:11.190> down

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.310 

I'm<00:06:30.910> not<00:06:31.060> getting<00:06:31.389> to<00:06:31.510> do<00:06:31.630> sort<00:06:31.900> of<00:06:31.930> parameters

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
I'm not getting to do sort of parameters

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.540 
I'm not getting to do sort of parameters
oh

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.460 

we<00:06:40.550> can<00:06:40.699> also<00:06:40.849> control<00:06:41.599> various<00:06:41.990> teachers<00:06:42.199> of

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
we can also control various teachers of

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.559 
we can also control various teachers of
the<00:06:42.500> synth<00:06:42.770> through<00:06:42.949> this<00:06:43.069> time<00:06:43.310> here<00:06:43.550> so<00:06:43.819> the

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:44.569 
the synth through this time here so the

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:46.270 
the synth through this time here so the
moment<00:06:44.780> we're<00:06:44.990> only<00:06:45.110> a<00:06:45.229> monophonic<00:06:45.650> subsided

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
moment we're only a monophonic subsided

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.580 
moment we're only a monophonic subsided
so<00:06:46.550> we've<00:06:47.419> got<00:06:47.569> a<00:06:47.599> selection<00:06:47.900> of<00:06:48.169> no<00:06:48.289> priority

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
so we've got a selection of no priority

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.110 
so we've got a selection of no priority
scheme<00:06:48.979> so<00:06:49.190> you<00:06:49.280> can<00:06:49.400> see<00:06:49.580> just<00:06:49.610> there<00:06:50.000> we've

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
scheme so you can see just there we've

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.240 
scheme so you can see just there we've
got<00:06:50.150> a<00:06:50.300> choice<00:06:50.509> between<00:06:50.830> low<00:06:51.830> no<00:06:51.979> priority

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
got a choice between low no priority

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.610 
got a choice between low no priority
high<00:06:52.580> note<00:06:52.759> and<00:06:52.910> priority<00:06:53.270> or<00:06:53.419> a<00:06:53.590> thing<00:06:54.590> that

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
high note and priority or a thing that

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.620 
high note and priority or a thing that
sort<00:06:54.919> of<00:06:54.949> just<00:06:55.099> interpolate<00:06:55.490> between<00:06:55.940> between

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
sort of just interpolate between between

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.480 
sort of just interpolate between between
water<00:06:57.550> next<00:06:58.550> feature<00:06:58.789> i'll<00:06:58.970> show<00:06:59.180> you<00:06:59.240> is<00:06:59.479> the

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
water next feature i'll show you is the

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:10.010 
water next feature i'll show you is the
envelope<00:07:01.490> generator

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.770 

alright<00:07:10.949> so<00:07:11.160> the<00:07:11.250> envelope<00:07:11.580> Jenna<00:07:11.789> basically

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
alright so the envelope Jenna basically

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.270 
alright so the envelope Jenna basically
the<00:07:12.960> main<00:07:13.319> main<00:07:13.560> thing<00:07:13.800> with<00:07:13.919> the<00:07:13.979> envelope

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 
the main main thing with the envelope

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.189 
the main main thing with the envelope
generators<00:07:14.729> you<00:07:14.849> roll<00:07:15.300> in<00:07:15.509> your<00:07:15.690> attack<00:07:15.960> time

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 
generators you roll in your attack time

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:18.680 
generators you roll in your attack time
here<00:07:16.470> so<00:07:16.500> I<00:07:16.710> put<00:07:16.949> that<00:07:16.979> in<00:07:17.220> there<00:07:17.690> your

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
here so I put that in there your

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.499 
here so I put that in there your
sustained<00:07:19.110> sustained<00:07:20.039> level<00:07:20.550> and<00:07:20.909> your

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:21.509 
sustained sustained level and your

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:23.990 
sustained sustained level and your
release<00:07:21.750> time<00:07:22.080> so<00:07:22.889> here<00:07:23.039> we<00:07:23.069> go<00:07:23.310> so<00:07:23.879> I'll<00:07:23.970> just

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 
release time so here we go so I'll just

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.360 
release time so here we go so I'll just
draw<00:07:24.449> in<00:07:24.629> the<00:07:24.750> envelope<00:07:25.110> with<00:07:25.319> envelope<00:07:25.979> in

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.370 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.249 

there<00:07:29.370> we<00:07:29.520> go<00:07:29.729> and<00:07:30.030> I'll<00:07:30.539> just<00:07:30.569> mark<00:07:30.840> out<00:07:31.110> as<00:07:31.229> a

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259 
there we go and I'll just mark out as a

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:39.730 
there we go and I'll just mark out as a
stain<00:07:31.560> region<00:07:34.460> there<00:07:35.460> we<00:07:35.580> go

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.740 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.620 

so<00:07:40.310> there<00:07:40.550> he's<00:07:40.729> looking<00:07:41.090> over<00:07:41.240> the<00:07:41.419> on<00:07:41.509> the

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:41.630 
so there he's looking over the on the

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.070 
so there he's looking over the on the
left<00:07:41.810> hand

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 
left hand

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:54.309 
left hand
and<00:07:44.009> I<00:07:44.099> let<00:07:44.280> go

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:59.629 

and<00:07:55.849> that's<00:07:56.849> a<00:07:57.089> bad<00:07:57.119> always<00:07:57.719> guts<00:07:58.579> I'll<00:07:59.579> give

00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 
and that's a bad always guts I'll give

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.459 
and that's a bad always guts I'll give
you<00:08:00.029> a<00:08:00.089> few<00:08:00.269> more<00:08:00.360> technical<00:08:00.779> specifications

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:01.469 
you a few more technical specifications

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:03.979 
you a few more technical specifications
in<00:08:01.619> the<00:08:01.679> near<00:08:01.799> future
