probably<00:01:52.409> kids<00:01:52.830> programming<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.670> it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
probably kids programming but you see it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.340 
probably kids programming but you see it
takes<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.150> long<00:01:54.299> time<00:01:54.360> suddenly<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.049> program

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
takes a long time suddenly the program

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.969 
takes a long time suddenly the program
starts<00:01:55.619> freezing<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.000> notable<00:01:57.689> delay<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
starts freezing it's a notable delay and

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.560 
starts freezing it's a notable delay and
I<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.430> go<00:01:59.610> back<00:01:59.640> each<00:01:59.970> other's<00:02:00.270> again

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
I can just go back each other's again

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.230 
I can just go back each other's again
and<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:02.280> always<00:02:02.520> wonder<00:02:02.850> what's<00:02:03.150> gonna

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and you always wonder what's gonna

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.910 
and you always wonder what's gonna
happen<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.659> much<00:02:03.960> slower<00:02:04.200> than<00:02:04.439> changing

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
happen it's much slower than changing

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.280 
happen it's much slower than changing
life<00:02:05.130> television<00:02:05.640> without<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.750> additional

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
life television without this additional

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.529 
life television without this additional
tuna<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.519> kind<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> downside<00:02:09.420> of

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
tuna so this is kind of a downside of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.720 
tuna so this is kind of a downside of
this<00:02:09.569> there<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.289> some<00:02:10.829> idiot<00:02:11.159> to<00:02:11.280> filter<00:02:11.610> out

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this there is some idiot to filter out

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
basic recording functionality I can

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.110 
basic recording functionality I can
either<00:03:07.680> change<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> time<00:03:08.430> i<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.760> record<00:03:08.880> this

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
either change the time i can record this

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.440 
either change the time i can record this
for<00:03:09.330> 60<00:03:09.750> minutes<00:03:09.989> 30<00:03:10.319> minutes<00:03:10.500> or<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.730> can<00:03:12.420> just

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
remote control is not that responsive

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.890 
remote control is not that responsive
right<00:04:02.700> now<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:06.000> doesn't<00:04:06.060> let<00:04:06.510> me<00:04:06.660> actually

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
could get used to the buttons and the

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.319 
could get used to the buttons and the
functionality<00:04:18.549> I'm<00:04:18.790> going<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.000> stop<00:04:19.180> this

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
functionality I'm going to stop this

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.590 
functionality I'm going to stop this
right<00:04:19.540> now<00:04:20.820> speaking<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:21.880> buttons<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.330> can<00:04:22.480> also

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
right now speaking of buttons I can also

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.690 
right now speaking of buttons I can also
show<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:22.990> kind<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:23.950> functionality<00:04:24.340> the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700

show you kind of the functionality the
remote<00:04:25.030> control<00:04:25.450> of<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:26.230> wdtv<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:27.190> kind<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.490> a

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
remote control of a wdtv it's kind of a

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.170 
remote control of a wdtv it's kind of a
little<00:04:27.910> bit<00:04:28.000> clunky<00:04:28.270> oh<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:29.650> was<00:04:29.770> too<00:04:29.919> fast

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
little bit clunky oh that was too fast

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.590 
little bit clunky oh that was too fast
it's<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.210> little<00:04:31.360> bit<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:31.540> delay<00:04:31.780> here

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
it's a little bit of a delay here

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.409 
it's a little bit of a delay here
probably<00:04:34.600> change<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.020> channel<00:04:35.350> right<00:04:35.470> now<00:04:35.530> so

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
probably change the channel right now so

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.970 
probably change the channel right now so
as<00:04:37.419> you<00:04:37.570> can<00:04:37.690> see<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:37.930> have<00:04:38.050> no<00:04:38.200> idea<00:04:38.620> where<00:04:38.950> II

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
as you can see I have no idea where II

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.290 
as you can see I have no idea where II
what<00:04:39.130> I'm<00:04:39.220> doing<00:04:39.520> because<00:04:39.580> i<00:04:39.760> just<00:04:40.120> installed

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
what I'm doing because i just installed

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.600 
what I'm doing because i just installed
this<00:04:40.750> but<00:04:41.620> then<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:41.919> shows<00:04:42.100> you<00:04:42.280> what<00:04:42.400> kind<00:04:42.430> of

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
this but then it shows you what kind of

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.070 
this but then it shows you what kind of
stuff<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.850> can<00:04:42.970> do<00:04:43.180> with<00:04:43.210> this<00:04:43.480> you<00:04:43.720> can<00:04:43.750> go

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
stuff you can do with this you can go

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.750 
stuff you can do with this you can go
channel<00:04:44.500> up<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.800> down<00:04:44.950> obviously<00:04:45.220> you<00:04:45.610> have<00:04:45.730> a

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
channel up and down obviously you have a

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.710 
channel up and down obviously you have a
menu<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:47.370> can<00:04:48.370> move<00:04:48.820> your<00:04:48.880> mute<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.690> audio

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
menu you can move your mute the audio

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.080 
menu you can move your mute the audio
that<00:04:50.169> didn't<00:04:50.440> actually<00:04:50.590> work<00:04:50.860> for<00:04:50.919> me<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.850> can

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
that didn't actually work for me you can

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.070 
that didn't actually work for me you can
select<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.990> channel<00:04:53.350> by<00:04:54.930> entering<00:04:55.930> the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
select the channel by entering the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.320 
select the channel by entering the
numerical<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:57.130> number<00:04:57.430> for<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:58.180> then

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
numerical the number for it and then

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.909 
numerical the number for it and then
there's<00:04:58.510> some<00:04:58.810> program<00:04:59.260> info<00:04:59.530> but<00:04:59.650> it's<00:04:59.800> very

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
there's some program info but it's very

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.640 
there's some program info but it's very
basic<00:05:00.630> essentially<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.660> can<00:05:01.870> just<00:05:02.020> hear<00:05:02.140> get

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
basic essentially I can just hear get

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.140 
basic essentially I can just hear get
the<00:05:02.800> programming<00:05:03.220> for<00:05:03.460> now<00:05:03.580> tell<00:05:03.880> me<00:05:03.910> what's

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
the programming for now tell me what's

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.060 
the programming for now tell me what's
going<00:05:04.330> on<00:05:04.480> right<00:05:04.630> now<00:05:04.890> what's<00:05:05.890> interesting

about this though is if I back out of

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.180 
about this though is if I back out of
this<00:05:08.380> appear<00:05:08.800> right<00:05:08.980> now<00:05:09.130> really<00:05:09.280> quick<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:11.530> I
