how<00:00:29.449> to<00:00:29.510> fly<00:00:29.869> in<00:00:30.260> two<00:00:30.560> worlds<00:00:30.920> we<00:00:31.220> thought<00:00:31.460> what

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
how to fly in two worlds we thought what

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.700 
how to fly in two worlds we thought what
if<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:31.789> same<00:00:32.059> physics<00:00:32.510> worked<00:00:33.350> with<00:00:33.590> the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
if the same physics worked with the

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.250 
if the same physics worked with the
humbling<00:00:34.129> blow<00:00:34.370> move<00:00:34.699> so<00:00:35.360> we<00:00:35.660> wanted<00:00:35.840> me<00:00:36.110> and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
humbling blow move so we wanted me and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.850 
humbling blow move so we wanted me and
godly<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:36.769> behaves<00:00:37.730> within<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.090> PvP<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.860> we

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
godly and behaves within the PvP and we

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.479 
godly and behaves within the PvP and we
tried<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:40.610> try<00:00:40.970> this<00:00:41.030> out<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.460> needless<00:00:43.460> to

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
tried to try this out and needless to

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.670 
tried to try this out and needless to
say<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:44.000> actually<00:00:44.120> worked<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.440> what<00:00:45.650> our

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
say it actually worked so what our

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.619 
say it actually worked so what our
tactic<00:00:46.159> was<00:00:46.370> we<00:00:46.699> were<00:00:46.790> just<00:00:46.970> annoy<00:00:47.239> our

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
tactic was we were just annoy our

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.740 
tactic was we were just annoy our
teammates<00:00:48.500> or<00:00:49.339> not<00:00:49.729> teammates<00:00:50.059> but<00:00:50.299> people

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
teammates or not teammates but people

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.630 
teammates or not teammates but people
that<00:00:50.839> were<00:00:50.960> playing<00:00:51.110> because<00:00:51.830> they<00:00:52.430> would

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
that were playing because they would

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.369 
that were playing because they would
just<00:00:52.850> try<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.269> attack<00:00:53.600> us<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.019> what<00:00:54.140> I<00:00:54.170> would

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
just try to attack us and what I would

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.189 
just try to attack us and what I would
do<00:00:54.500> is<00:00:54.589> I<00:00:54.680> just<00:00:54.710> constantly<00:00:55.489> be<00:00:55.729> spamming<00:00:56.199> the

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
do is I just constantly be spamming the

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.859 
do is I just constantly be spamming the
tornado<00:00:57.790> why<00:00:58.790> I<00:00:58.820> was<00:00:59.180> just<00:00:59.360> hovering<00:00:59.659> them

00:00:59.859 --> 00:00:59.869 
tornado why I was just hovering them

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:01.060 
tornado why I was just hovering them
around<00:01:00.170> me<00:01:00.290> they<00:01:00.440> really<00:01:00.680> can't<00:01:00.890> do<00:01:01.040> anything

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
around me they really can't do anything

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.420 
around me they really can't do anything
they're<00:01:01.460> kind<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:01.729> like<00:01:01.879> just<00:01:02.089> defenseless

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
tornado trick now if I were this guy I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.380 
tornado trick now if I were this guy I
probably<00:01:36.830> really<00:01:37.830> pissed<00:01:38.190> off<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.400> I

freaking<00:01:54.240> oh<00:01:54.480> my<00:01:55.380> gosh<00:01:55.590> she's<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.980> planet

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
freaking oh my gosh she's like a planet

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.320 
freaking oh my gosh she's like a planet
orbiting<00:01:56.910> me<00:01:57.060> right<00:01:57.240> now<00:01:57.390> oh<00:01:58.080> my<00:01:59.040> gosh<00:01:59.550> yeah

orbiting me right now oh my gosh yeah
it's<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.900> fun<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.350> tactic<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.220> you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it's just a fun little tactic if you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.940 
it's just a fun little tactic if you
need<00:02:03.090> some<00:02:03.360> friends<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.410> dude<00:02:04.619> who

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
need some friends just get one dude who

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.290 
need some friends just get one dude who
has<00:02:05.250> humbling<00:02:05.880> blow

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
has humbling blow

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.359 
has humbling blow
preferably<00:02:06.810> maxed<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.410> because<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.340> just

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
preferably maxed out because it just

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.310 
preferably maxed out because it just
makes<00:02:08.640> things<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.940> lot<00:02:09.060> easier<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:10.170> you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
makes things a lot easier because you

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.430 
makes things a lot easier because you
don't<00:02:10.470> always<00:02:10.590> get<00:02:10.860> humbling<00:02:11.370> blow<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.440> then

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
don't always get humbling blow and then

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680 
don't always get humbling blow and then
you<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.160> either<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.850> or<00:02:14.880> someone<00:02:15.540> else

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
you just have either you or someone else

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.180 
you just have either you or someone else
