that is noticeable about these trees is

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.540 
that is noticeable about these trees is
that<00:00:28.330> they're<00:00:28.750> trimmed<00:00:29.140> and<00:00:29.470> what<00:00:30.130> that<00:00:30.279> means

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
that they're trimmed and what that means

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.790 
that they're trimmed and what that means
is<00:00:30.760> about<00:00:31.029> half<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:31.539> new<00:00:31.900> growth<00:00:32.199> of<00:00:32.469> the<00:00:32.559> top

of topsoil and that that is best for
tree<00:01:27.130> growth<00:01:27.400> because<00:01:27.670> then<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.119> trees<00:01:28.390> can

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
tree growth because then the trees can

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.580 
tree growth because then the trees can
root<00:01:28.869> out<00:01:28.990> better<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:34.030> trees<00:01:34.390> are<00:01:34.840> easy<00:01:35.380> to

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
root out better the trees are easy to

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.670 
root out better the trees are easy to
grow<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.130> will<00:01:37.119> grow<00:01:37.479> upwards<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.200> three<00:01:38.470> feet

will grow about three feet a year and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.139 
will grow about three feet a year and
you<00:01:59.590> don't<00:01:59.920> want<00:02:00.189> to<00:02:00.250> grow<00:02:00.460> them<00:02:00.640> three<00:02:00.880> feet<00:02:01.119> a

you don't want to grow them three feet a

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.179 
you don't want to grow them three feet a
year<00:02:01.270> because<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:01.899> too<00:02:02.110> fast<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.680> growth<00:02:02.950> and

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
year because it's too fast to growth and

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.880 
year because it's too fast to growth and
they'll<00:02:03.310> be<00:02:03.430> open<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:03.970> sparse<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.290> trimming

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
they'll be open and sparse so trimming

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.920 
they'll be open and sparse so trimming
is<00:02:06.100> an<00:02:06.340> important<00:02:06.790> part<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.149> growing<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.659> nice

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
is an important part of growing a nice
