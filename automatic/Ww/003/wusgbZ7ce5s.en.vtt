00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.640
 here guys keep you on course dismantled 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.090
 here are the blocks 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:17.940
 very young so they will live a little bit more 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:21.289
 I won't take off my vitamins yet 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.289
 watch wheels will have 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.960
 front pads too, more or less 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.160
 hold replacement pads until canceled 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.160
 and leads accordingly too 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.059
 front chuck 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.629
 I will side on the track more left 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.629
 turns 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.240
 not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.030
 so here we connect well 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.450
 lads from has changed and the wheels look 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.060
 even our montazhki stupid a little bit 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.990
 the picture a little bit does not match 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:18.190
 direction of motion that is, in fact 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:23.760
 wheel and around here as it should 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.760
 move so cool i somewhere must be 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.810
 After all, you will spend a type drawing in another 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.510
 side and tire technicians did not know how 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.410
 do up to a year on the disc there is always here 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.250
 such an arrow I should not 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:45.090
 further this direction here's another 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.750
 Now I put the wheels and write down already 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.750
 when will they be installed 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.700
 but it is of course, we put the wheel 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.240
 but also doing a launch now going to 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.240
 I check the brakes 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.970
 that's shorter and now all set up now 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:50.630
 I will clean the chain with this machine 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.120
 I 'll fill this bottle with kerosene 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.300
 here it is two tubes and so it will be 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.880
 I will put pressure on kerosene 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:06.020
 walk perfectly clean 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:07.880
 Well, still see the old tires left 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.360
 the side is more worn out because on 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.750
 track more left turns and the most 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.209
 hard way out of the last turn there 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.270
 at full throttle and in the slope come out 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.930
 so put met here 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.930
 almost normal 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.700
 Well , here I have to cry and brush 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:38.430
 This is my wife who still does not know the sheet 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.000
 mole i can't find a frame on it 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.390
 no 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.580
 so on screws until light 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:50.010
 can stand us a frame will tell where 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:57.450
 to buy generally will be grateful to go 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:04:05.250
 clean the chain stay here 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:10.320
 the chain has become pure and this is how we are 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.940
 machine bought her germany now 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.049
 it remains only to wait until she 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:21.989
 dry and already spray with grease for 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.940
 circuits such a scheme here kerosene and the court 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.780
 served up the same here 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.380
 fluid is fed and at the bottom too on two 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.730
 sides watered 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.350
 chains dine tighten slightly she 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:40.280
 I almost did not sag in two years 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:43.190
 and the tone of the indicator is almost new 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.690
 such 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:51.380
 in general I keep 1 course so everything is marvel 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.380
 the gas itself
