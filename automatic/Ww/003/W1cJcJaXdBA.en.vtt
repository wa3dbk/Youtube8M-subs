get a little bit of tunnel vision and I
just<00:04:30.210> kind<00:04:30.390> of<00:04:30.420> use<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.630> same<00:04:30.840> map<00:04:31.050> over<00:04:31.320> and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
just kind of use the same map over and

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.990 
just kind of use the same map over and
over<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.650> over<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.950> have<00:04:32.070> no<00:04:32.310> idea<00:04:32.340> that

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
over here and you can see kind and you

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.330 
over here and you can see kind and you
can<00:05:12.930> sort<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.170> by<00:05:13.230> kind<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.770> basically<00:05:14.010> it's<00:05:14.220> in

can sort it by kind it basically it's in

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.480 
can sort it by kind it basically it's in
tell<00:05:14.780> you<00:05:15.780> say<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:15.990> lot<00:05:16.200> of<00:05:16.350> Intel<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:16.890> or

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
tell you say a lot of Intel and or

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.480 
tell you say a lot of Intel and or
universal<00:05:18.390> you're<00:05:18.870> ok<00:05:19.170> now<00:05:19.410> if<00:05:19.620> it's<00:05:19.740> powerpc

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
universal you're ok now if it's powerpc

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.730 
universal you're ok now if it's powerpc
it's<00:05:21.210> not<00:05:21.510> going<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:21.780> be<00:05:21.900> ok<00:05:22.230> you<00:05:22.470> know<00:05:22.560> you're

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
it's not going to be ok you know you're

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.020 
it's not going to be ok you know you're
going<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.890> have<00:05:23.100> so<00:05:23.280> these<00:05:23.400> these<00:05:23.610> programs

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
going to have so these these programs

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.350 
going to have so these these programs
are<00:05:24.150> not<00:05:24.390> going<00:05:24.540> to<00:05:24.630> work<00:05:24.840> inside<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:26.030> 10.6<00:05:27.030> as

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
are not going to work inside of 10.6 as

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.060 
are not going to work inside of 10.6 as
is<00:05:27.720> you're<00:05:27.960> going<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.140> need<00:05:28.260> rosetta<00:05:28.620> for<00:05:28.920> that

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
is you're going to need rosetta for that

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.530 
is you're going to need rosetta for that
so<00:05:29.460> this<00:05:29.550> is<00:05:29.640> a<00:05:29.670> good<00:05:29.790> way<00:05:29.910> just<00:05:30.090> to<00:05:30.180> kind<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.420> go

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
so this is a good way just to kind of go

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.180 
so this is a good way just to kind of go
through<00:05:30.570> your<00:05:30.990> apps<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:31.500> see<00:05:31.680> hey<00:05:31.920> what

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
through your apps and see hey what

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.790 
through your apps and see hey what
version<00:05:32.580> of<00:05:32.700> what<00:05:32.880> do<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.030> have<00:05:33.270> installed

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
version of what do I have installed

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.080 
version of what do I have installed
really<00:05:34.800> simple<00:05:35.160> to<00:05:35.190> do<00:05:35.370> so<00:05:35.580> again<00:05:35.790> if<00:05:35.910> you<00:05:35.970> get

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
really simple to do so again if you get

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.150 
really simple to do so again if you get
universal<00:05:36.390> or<00:05:37.140> if<00:05:37.260> you<00:05:37.350> have<00:05:37.410> Intel<00:05:37.800> you're

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
universal or if you have Intel you're

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.970 
universal or if you have Intel you're
good<00:05:38.370> if<00:05:38.610> it's<00:05:38.970> got<00:05:39.150> power<00:05:39.330> pc<00:05:39.690> your<00:05:40.500> it's<00:05:40.830> not

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
good if it's got power pc your it's not

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.620 
good if it's got power pc your it's not
going<00:05:41.100> to<00:05:41.190> work<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:41.610> if<00:05:41.700> you<00:05:41.760> have<00:05:41.970> an<00:05:42.240> older

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
one they use the classic on there it's

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.370 
one they use the classic on there it's
definitely<00:05:45.300> not<00:05:45.390> going<00:05:45.540> to<00:05:45.630> work<00:05:45.750> alright
