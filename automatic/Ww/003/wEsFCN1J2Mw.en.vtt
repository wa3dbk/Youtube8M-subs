00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
few random items from going on a trip we

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:43.520 
few random items from going on a trip we
got<00:03:26.040> nothing<00:03:42.020> looks<00:03:43.020> like<00:03:43.140> they<00:03:43.230> dug<00:03:43.410> around

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
got nothing looks like they dug around

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.430 
got nothing looks like they dug around
here<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.040> see<00:03:44.190> if<00:03:44.280> they<00:03:44.340> could<00:03:44.400> find<00:03:44.490> anything

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
here to see if they could find anything

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.930 
here to see if they could find anything
they<00:03:46.440> destroyed<00:03:46.680> all<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.820> extra<00:03:48.120> anvils

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
they destroyed all of the extra anvils

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.520 
they destroyed all of the extra anvils
so<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.390> hot<00:03:51.990> work<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.800> warm<00:03:53.010> room<00:03:53.280> thing

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
so the hot work the warm room thing

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.510 
so the hot work the warm room thing
completely<00:03:55.530> backfired<00:03:55.770> because<00:03:56.190> it's<00:03:56.400> all

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
completely backfired because it's all

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.300 
completely backfired because it's all
gone<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:58.080> took<00:03:58.230> all<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.830> materials

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
gone it took all of the materials

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.250 
gone it took all of the materials
probably<00:03:59.430> just<00:03:59.700> chuck<00:04:00.240> some<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:02.960> just<00:04:03.960> gone

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
probably just chuck some of it just gone

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:14.130 
probably just chuck some of it just gone
just<00:04:04.830> gone<00:04:05.450> everything<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.630> gone

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:24.220 

everything

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.010 

I<00:04:24.700> was<00:04:25.700> kind<00:04:25.910> of<00:04:25.940> worried<00:04:26.210> about<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.630> I<00:04:27.730> was

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
I was kind of worried about this I was

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.360 
I was kind of worried about this I was
stating<00:04:30.020> how<00:04:30.050> we<00:04:30.230> were<00:04:30.530> going<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.680> start

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
stating how we were going to start

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.910 
stating how we were going to start
looking<00:04:31.520> for<00:04:31.790> gabbro<00:04:32.350> and<00:04:33.350> I<00:04:33.410> realized<00:04:33.800> that

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
looking for gabbro and I realized that

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.860 
looking for gabbro and I realized that
this<00:04:34.190> way<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.460> looking<00:04:34.910> for<00:04:35.060> gabbro<00:04:35.420> is<00:04:35.600> a<00:04:35.630> way

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
this way of looking for gabbro is a way

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:53.280 
this way of looking for gabbro is a way
of<00:04:35.900> also<00:04:36.170> finding<00:04:36.650> basis

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.940 

so<00:04:54.290> I<00:04:54.320> was<00:04:54.650> planning<00:04:55.100> on<00:04:55.460> telling<00:04:55.790> them<00:04:56.240> too<00:04:56.950> I

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
so I was planning on telling them too I

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.490 
so I was planning on telling them too I
was<00:04:58.730> planning<00:04:58.880> on<00:04:59.060> possibly<00:04:59.570> moving<00:05:00.140> our<00:05:00.260> base

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
was planning on possibly moving our base

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.320 
was planning on possibly moving our base
to<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:00.890> much<00:05:01.280> lower<00:05:01.490> point<00:05:03.130> so<00:05:04.130> that<00:05:04.330> this

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
to a much lower point so that this

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.960 
to a much lower point so that this
wouldn't<00:05:05.510> happen<00:05:09.340> was<00:05:10.340> a<00:05:10.370> little<00:05:10.670> late<00:05:10.850> in

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
wouldn't happen was a little late in

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:25.690 
wouldn't happen was a little late in
that<00:05:11.090> thought<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:23.980> was<00:05:24.980> got<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.100> goal<00:05:25.280> squid<00:05:25.580> just

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
that thought I was got a goal squid just

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:40.480 
that thought I was got a goal squid just
kind<00:05:25.880> of<00:05:25.910> went<00:05:26.060> through<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.270> wall<00:05:26.420> over<00:05:26.570> there

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:48.999 

I<00:05:47.050> can't<00:05:48.050> even<00:05:48.139> get<00:05:48.349> to<00:05:48.440> the<00:05:48.470> bed<00:05:48.680> right<00:05:48.860> now<00:05:48.949> to

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
I can't even get to the bed right now to

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:55.150 
I can't even get to the bed right now to
sleep<00:05:53.289> well<00:05:54.289> I<00:05:54.319> have<00:05:54.470> a<00:05:54.500> bet<00:05:54.680> on<00:05:54.710> me<00:05:54.949> I<00:05:54.979> might<00:05:55.009> as

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
sleep well I have a bet on me I might as

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.830 
sleep well I have a bet on me I might as
