00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.930
 best headphones on the market for gaming and 

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:09.000
 music 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.549
 these are not my words these are the words of the president 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.580
 razer min leontin companies so 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.340
 let's understand razer kraken spoils 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.040
 these reamers thought thought and decided 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.020
 hit the premium took their very 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.149
 popular headphones put them on 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.579
 aviation aluminum and forced people 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.190
 collect them by hand in fact it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.019
 felt already at the stage of unpacking you 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.120
 you understand that at least the quality 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.489
 materials and feed is very cool 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.660
 hard case boxes in which headphones 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.210
 and spare wires 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.579
 case already looks cool but when 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.519
 you get the headphones then you forget about him 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.829
 This is certainly razer kraken but in metal 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.949
 they look really cool so 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.530
 I want to go to these I want to buy before 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.749
 how to know how much it is not worth it 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.500
 some kind of youth bright plastic and 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:06.750
 here everything is solid metal + leather 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.390
 always looks cool 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 high quality and conscience no squeaks 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.090
 how was the previous model here all 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.840
 clearly manual assembly as nothing but because 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 metal they weigh of course order 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.150
 headphones fold for 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.150
 transportation and all wires 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.040
 disconnect wires 2 for mobile 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.990
 devices with the call accept button and 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.880
 microphone and the usual on which else 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.400
 you can screw the adapter on 6 and 3 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 millimeter the first wire is best 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.420
 works with devices from apple ii 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.000
 black berry with android actually 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.010
 also insert all the rules and wire 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.370
 scroll to not fall out if you 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.670
 they are randomly taught by more interesting than 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.170
 ordinary crafins 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.799
 you got high 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.290
 you and so at least one dominant 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.479
 a little music plan nothing out of the ordinary 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.820
 that is, I want to say yes sound 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.250
 not bad but probably like without 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.200
 canoes not for the money for the money 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.750
 You can buy headphones that will be 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.090
 sound at times better but kraken chip 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.150
 not in this kind of material manual assembly 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.860
 and the price hints at irizar's not lice 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.569
 it is well understood therefore and not 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.269
 release these crafins into a massive 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.760
 production is almost the same as 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.470
 view everyone see some cool and all 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.959
 the rest is not important I would call them 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.060
 image if you are a gamer you want 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.519
 allow you to stand out for money 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.590
 it is your option that is to show your 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.870
 belonging to the gaming community and in 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.489
 the same time is not bad pantanutsya well or 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.650
 promote the brand to 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.480
 some lil vaine or kanye west on 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.910
 some awards ceremony came out 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.340
 in kraken, if I saw this where we are 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.250
 I liked it but I think you came to 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.530
 this is all the files on the internet in photo 7 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.269
 subscribe to the channel on youtube and you 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.959

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.959
 aluminum
