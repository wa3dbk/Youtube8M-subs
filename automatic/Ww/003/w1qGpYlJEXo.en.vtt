 a lot of tomato vegetables and it 's something 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.900

 take a vitamin shake but with 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.440
 not as colorful as we have here 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.630
 let's say it could be vegetables for the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.240
 summer like the gazpacho and for the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.130
 placing what is tomato 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.960
 let's take the pepper onion 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.600
 cucumber and let's cut it all by applying 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.090
 everything we are going to put it with the oil with 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.670
 the bread and then what we do is is left 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.140
 you have to let it rest all together and you 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.110
 Titles everything everything as if it were a 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.150
 shake to point of salt 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.980
 to enjoy the shot very well as a 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.980
 drink then let's start let's go 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.090
 important we remove him in the part of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.299
 back to the tomato and cut it into three 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.299
 chunks 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.260
 always using the tomato very well 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.030
 until the end 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.470
 a knife that cuts very well 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.480
 tomatoes one of the vegetables that more 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.250
 it costs to cut 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.540
 rojito mature ripe tomatoes 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.530
 we're going to go through it and everything here 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.360
 to this vessel where we are going to macerate 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.860
 everything as it can be red pediment only 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.780
 green pepper but since we have not 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.790
 let's take advantage of the two we are not going to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.530
 even perfectly 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.469
 there are also offices that are made 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.480
 because the passes with cherries with strawberries 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:48.150
 with raspberries 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.379
 also admits fruits because it does not 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.659
 you can put a little bit of fruit 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.430
 because by the handle you give a gazpacho with a 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.379
 fantastic handle touch I think it's 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.980
 a mixture of fruits and vegetables is 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.980
 spectacular 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.200
 and put favorite 9 with that little ball 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.200
 this party 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.189
 scallion the same as we discussed 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.010
 little if we take away a little part 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:16.110
 from outside part of outside 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.970
 to the scallion we're going for a bit of 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.970
 the fourth always of this to save it 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.570
 you have to take advantage of everything 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.190
 a clove of garlic you see that here we have 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.080
 some beautiful garlic look what tooth more 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.230
 big let's do it mercedes party 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.970
 in half this month purple the typical the 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.320
 and more more Spanish the garlic mont though 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.510
 is from the basin area of ​​the 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.030
 pedroñeras is a fantastic place very 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.250
 very arid in quotes but that is 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.540
 plant a lot of garlic and other 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.790
 product as fantastic as saffron 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.790
 which is one of those in that area too 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.390
 a clove of garlic nothing what we do is 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.850
 I already like a little bit that I have 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.050
 little garlic I do not like it to repeat a lot 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.050
 let's put a little garlic 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.190
 and we already put the cucumber is good and now 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.360
 it's crushed and now we're going to put 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.120
 we are going to see a little olive oil 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.220
 you also have to put a little water on 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.370
 bread we will not forget the bread of 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.370
 firewood 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.940
 and well you see a loaf of wood like that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.010
 fantastic let's go to take advantage of it 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.100
 this this symbolism to make some 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.890
 Toast for breakfast is the best thing 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.080
 passionate toast with a little ham 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.430
 little tomato and a luxury that's going to 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.530
 take a bit to put it there 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.530
 cut very delicate 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:45.180
 how it smells like flour 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.400
 so fantastic 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.969
 and well let's throw pieces of this 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.459
 in it 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:57.529
 also with the bark if it shows 

00:04:52.459 --> 00:05:00.309
 you also use more white more not so 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.309
 so rustic 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.990
 then the owner everything is already 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.680
 everything together is a bit is a little bit 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.330
 as an investment with the oil and now 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.860
 let's take the water 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.480
 I prefer more mineral water than water 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.830
 tap not to cook especially for 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.200
 areas better because on the subject of there 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.840
 cities that chlorine does not know about 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.150
 well, it's not a bit of a nuisance to the 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.150
 final flavors a little water 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:34.749
 escobar already serving the oil and now 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:36.999
 as you see we already have everything here that 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:38.770
 soak it well we throw a little 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:41.919
 sherry vinegar a little salt and now 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.569
 we let all that macerate and rest 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.339
 together let's all say that 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.319
 all the flavors are mixed there and then 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.569
 we already know how to crush it well well 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:52.330
 entitled we put it in, we can strain it 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.520
 a colander and nothing we already have the game of 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.030
 all that vegetable with all that nuance 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.150
 from the oil vinegar 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:04.010
 and nothing ready to try seems to be 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.010
 very like when I was 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:15.330

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:20.120

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.120

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.080

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.080
 to wash 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:36.310
 and you see here 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.530
 how it is crushed 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.130
 I was a little bland, we're going to put a 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.130
 little salt 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.070

 and sometimes especially what is usually 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.699
 to do is to accompany this with pepper 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:46.489
