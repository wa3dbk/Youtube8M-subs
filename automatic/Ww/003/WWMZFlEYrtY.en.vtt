you<00:00:29.279> could<00:00:29.490> hope<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.599> when<00:00:30.779> you're

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
you could hope for when you're

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.490 
you could hope for when you're
off-roading

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
off-roading

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.240 
off-roading
on<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> quad<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.700> wall<00:00:33.770> puncture<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.070> that's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
on the quad a wall puncture and that's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.580 
on the quad a wall puncture and that's
like<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.640> slice<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.540> I've<00:00:36.690> ever<00:00:36.840> seen<00:00:37.170> one

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
like a slice if I've ever seen one

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.190 
like a slice if I've ever seen one
so<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.969> screwdriver<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:42.110> pretty<00:00:43.110> much

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
so this screwdriver is pretty much

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.010 
so this screwdriver is pretty much
exactly<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.950> centimeter<00:00:49.579> as<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.090> see<00:00:51.390> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
exactly a centimeter as you can see that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.090 
exactly a centimeter as you can see that
screwdriver<00:00:53.539> it's<00:00:54.539> right<00:00:55.199> inside<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.219> slice

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
screwdriver it's right inside that slice

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
screwdriver it's right inside that slice
so<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.430> pretty<00:00:59.699> big<00:01:00.590> puncture<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so that's a pretty big puncture on the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
so that's a pretty big puncture on the
wall<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> tire<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.790> need<00:01:06.500> everyone's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
wall with the tire so I need everyone's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.850 
wall with the tire so I need everyone's
