solder head retorque on an oil head
we've<00:00:04.380> just<00:00:04.620> replaced<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:05.190> head<00:00:05.730> gasket

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
we've just replaced this head gasket

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.870 
we've just replaced this head gasket
leaking<00:00:07.290> very<00:00:07.500> badly<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:08.099> because<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.610> stud

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
leaking very badly it because the stud

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.580 
leaking very badly it because the stud
was<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.420> stud<00:00:09.660> was<00:00:09.809> pulled<00:00:10.139> out<00:00:12.170> so<00:00:13.170> this

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
was this stud was pulled out so this

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.110 
was this stud was pulled out so this
stage<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> little<00:00:14.370> bit<00:00:14.460> different<00:00:14.940> than

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
stage is a little bit different than

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
stage is a little bit different than
usual<00:00:16.010> normally<00:00:17.090> if<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> 600-mile

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140

service<00:00:19.740> these<00:00:20.430> would<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.820> loosened<00:00:21.720> torque

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439

to 20 Newton meters and then tightened

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.740 
to 20 Newton meters and then tightened
180<00:00:25.019> degrees<00:00:25.849> because<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> new<00:00:27.480> head

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750

bolt<00:00:47.399> gets<00:00:47.610> torque<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> 40<00:00:48.360> Newton<00:00:48.600> meters<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
bolt gets torque to 40 Newton meters so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.930
