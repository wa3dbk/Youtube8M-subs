finding the right the right time and the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.960 
finding the right the right time and the
right<00:00:14.839> subject<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.410> play<00:00:16.619> really<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.220> I

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
right subject for the play really so I

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.179 
right subject for the play really so I
had<00:00:18.840> such<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> great<00:00:19.199> time<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.439> little<00:00:20.010> tiny

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
had such a great time with little tiny

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.340 
had such a great time with little tiny
dynamite<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.720> write<00:00:22.170> very

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
dynamite and I think I write very

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.310 
dynamite and I think I write very
differently<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:23.250> them<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.850> know<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.320> often

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
differently for them you know I often

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.820 
differently for them you know I often
write<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:25.890> actors<00:00:26.820> or<00:00:27.150> maybe<00:00:28.109> even<00:00:28.230> directors

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
write for actors or maybe even directors

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.769 
write for actors or maybe even directors
in<00:00:29.010> film<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> television<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.060> I've<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.480> don't

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
in film and television but I've I don't

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.500 
in film and television but I've I don't
often<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.740> theater<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.210> feel

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
often do that for theater so and I feel

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.150 
often do that for theater so and I feel
that<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.690> write<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:33.930> bespoke<00:00:34.260> plays<00:00:34.770> for

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that I write very bespoke plays for

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.220 
that I write very bespoke plays for
frantic<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.840> also<00:00:36.989> about

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
frantic and so it was really also about

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.830 
frantic and so it was really also about
me<00:00:37.350> having<00:00:37.620> my<00:00:37.739> time<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> mental<00:00:39.600> space

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
me having my time and the mental space

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.940 
me having my time and the mental space
to<00:00:40.290> think<00:00:41.180> about<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.450> know<00:00:42.680> tailoring<00:00:43.680> quite

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
to think about you know tailoring quite

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.369 
to think about you know tailoring quite
a<00:00:43.980> fine<00:00:44.280> suit<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.719> was<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.170> what

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
a fine suit so that that was really what

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.810 
a fine suit so that that was really what
brought<00:00:46.559> us<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:46.890> together<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> that's<00:00:47.670> why

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
brought us back together and that's why

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.610 
brought us back together and that's why
it's<00:00:47.969> been<00:00:48.149> such<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> long<00:00:48.450> stretch<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
it's been such a long stretch and and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's been such a long stretch and and
also<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.700> another<00:00:50.940> way<00:00:51.180> also<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.449> find<00:00:51.660> plays

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
also in in another way also I find plays

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.569 
also in in another way also I find plays
a<00:00:51.960> lot<00:00:52.230> harder<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.649> write<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.039> than<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.280> used<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
a lot harder to write now than I used to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
a lot harder to write now than I used to
so<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> certain<00:00:54.989> kind<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.500> get

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
so it's a certain kind of I get

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.840 
so it's a certain kind of I get
definitely<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> fear<00:00:56.430> about

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
definitely get the fear about

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.420 
definitely get the fear about
playwriting<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.770> think

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
playwriting so it's it's it's it I think

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.389 
playwriting so it's it's it's it I think
it's<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.440> think<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.739> they've<00:01:01.949> loaded<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it's the I think that they've loaded you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.270 
it's the I think that they've loaded you
back<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.140> research<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.070> place

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
back I think this research is the place

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.300 
back I think this research is the place
of<00:01:05.460> language<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.000> ideas<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:09.710> television

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
of language and ideas and television

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.630 
of language and ideas and television
it's<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:11.790> plot<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> story<00:01:13.400> that's<00:01:14.400> not

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it's about plot of the story that's not

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.220 
it's about plot of the story that's not
to<00:01:14.760> say<00:01:14.910> that<00:01:14.940> both<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> those<00:01:15.720> things<00:01:15.780> don't

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
to say that both of those things don't

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.750 
to say that both of those things don't
overlap<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.210> for<00:01:18.210> me<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.680> theater<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.400> feels

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
overlap and for me with theater it feels

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.910 
overlap and for me with theater it feels
quite<00:01:21.000> much<00:01:21.660> more<00:01:21.870> singular<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.650> much<00:01:22.740> more

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
quite much more singular and much more

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
quite much more singular and much more
authored<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.300> you<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
authored and and you really you have to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.980 
authored and and you really you have to
have<00:01:24.990> something<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.410> say<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.660> often

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
have something to say and so I often

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.010 
have something to say and so I often
feel<00:01:28.410> that<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:29.700> trying<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> give<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> sense<00:01:30.510> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
feel that I'm trying to give a sense of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.670 
feel that I'm trying to give a sense of
theme<00:01:31.440> in<00:01:31.740> film<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.880> television<00:01:33.680> option

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
theme in film and television option

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.350 
theme in film and television option
through<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.920> visual<00:01:35.100> whereas<00:01:35.910> I<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.210> with

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
through the visual whereas I think with

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.960 
through the visual whereas I think with
with<00:01:36.960> theater<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.760> really

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
with theater you know what you really

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670 
with theater you know what you really
have<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.210> language<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
have is language I think it's a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.320 
have is language I think it's a
celebration<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.880> celebration

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
celebration I think it's a celebration

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.760 
celebration I think it's a celebration
of

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.849 

power<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.490> too<00:01:48.859> and<00:01:50.119> that<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.500> notion<00:01:52.829> that

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
power up too and that the notion that

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.349 
power up too and that the notion that
you<00:01:53.039> fall<00:01:53.219> in<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.820> love<00:01:53.969> with<00:01:54.149> someone

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
you fall in and out of love with someone

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.459 
you fall in and out of love with someone
but<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:55.619> remains<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.939> what<00:01:57.060> stays<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.659> sort

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
but what remains and what stays is sort

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.040 
but what remains and what stays is sort
of<00:01:58.530> cool<00:01:58.829> sensitive

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.440 

and<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.640> was<00:02:03.790> something<00:02:04.000> very<00:02:04.270> profound

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
and that was something very profound

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.020 

I<00:02:18.680> think<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.099> do<00:02:19.220> I've<00:02:19.340> working<00:02:19.550> with<00:02:19.790> them<00:02:19.910> is

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
I think we do I've working with them is

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.500 
I think we do I've working with them is
that<00:02:20.060> they're<00:02:20.390> complete<00:02:20.750> artists<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:23.360> I

interesting and in terms of my finest a
writer<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.810> find<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:48.140> once<00:02:48.319> in<00:02:48.620> television

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
writer and I find it once in television

writer and I find it once in television
and<00:02:49.730> film<00:02:50.600> where<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.560> know<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.709> think<00:02:51.980> when<00:02:52.069> you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
and film where you know I think when you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.800 
and film where you know I think when you
go<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.430> set<00:02:52.670> your<00:02:52.850> job<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.120> kind<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.390> done<00:02:53.600> and

go on set your job is kind of done and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.449 
go on set your job is kind of done and
use<00:02:53.930> but<00:02:54.110> most<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.440> time<00:02:54.650> it's<00:02:55.250> all<00:02:55.370> things

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
use but most of the time it's all things

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.430 
use but most of the time it's all things
placate<00:02:55.819> or<00:02:55.850> it's<00:02:56.030> done<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.900> know<00:02:56.930> in<00:02:57.110> theatre

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
placate or it's done you know in theatre

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.600 
placate or it's done you know in theatre
it's<00:02:57.590> great<00:02:57.830> because<00:02:58.100> you're<00:02:58.310> just<00:02:58.489> watching

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
it's great because you're just watching

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.559 
it's great because you're just watching
something<00:02:58.970> grow<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.400> evolve<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:02.209> there<00:03:02.420> is

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
something grow and evolve but there is

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.180 
something grow and evolve but there is
still<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.989> sense<00:03:03.319> that<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.680> has<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.010> grow<00:03:04.100> a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
still that sense that it has to grow a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.620 
still that sense that it has to grow a
little<00:03:04.340> without<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.180> think<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:05.540> a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
little without you so I think it's a

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.020 
little without you so I think it's a
balance<00:03:05.780> between<00:03:06.110> I<00:03:06.590> tend<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.580> come<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:07.790> at<00:03:07.970> the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
balance between I tend to come in at the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.640 
balance between I tend to come in at the
beginning<00:03:08.120> which<00:03:08.720> is<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.110> know<00:03:09.200> my<00:03:09.350> ticket

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
beginning which is you know my ticket

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.559 
beginning which is you know my ticket
when<00:03:09.739> I'm<00:03:09.830> shaping<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.310> script<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.910> when<00:03:11.450> we

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
when I'm shaping the script and when we

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.120 
when I'm shaping the script and when we
were<00:03:11.630> leading<00:03:11.810> up<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.019> having<00:03:12.590> improve<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
were leading up to having improve the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.650 
were leading up to having improve the
script<00:03:13.310> published<00:03:13.790> as<00:03:13.940> well<00:03:14.090> because<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.600> a

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
script published as well because to a

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.900 
script published as well because to a
certain<00:03:14.690> degree<00:03:15.019> that's<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.560> script<00:03:15.860> set<00:03:16.100> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
certain degree that's the script set the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.610 
certain degree that's the script set the
future<00:03:17.239> productions

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
future productions

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.900 
future productions
and<00:03:18.770> then<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.250> think<00:03:19.520> there's<00:03:19.640> probably<00:03:19.790> a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and then I think there's probably a

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.100 
and then I think there's probably a
period<00:03:20.240> in<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.360> Middle<00:03:20.600> where<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.750> like<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.960> go

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
period in the Middle where I like to go

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.040 
period in the Middle where I like to go
wait<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:23.150> see<00:03:23.240> what<00:03:23.390> happens<00:03:23.720> really

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
wait and just see what happens really

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.850 
wait and just see what happens really
and<00:03:24.830> then<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.040> have<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.400> go

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
and then I have to go

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.130 
and then I have to go
just<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.700> bit<00:03:27.820> more<00:03:27.850> as<00:03:28.120> an<00:03:28.240> observer<00:03:28.570> I<00:03:28.900> think

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
just a bit more as an observer I think

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.540 
just a bit more as an observer I think
my<00:03:29.260> sister<00:03:29.680> as<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:31.020> critical<00:03:32.020> voice<00:03:32.140> just

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
my sister as a critical voice just

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.140 
my sister as a critical voice just
just<00:03:34.270> me<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.600> see<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:34.930> it's<00:03:35.110> gone

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
just me to see that it's gone

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.149 
just me to see that it's gone
