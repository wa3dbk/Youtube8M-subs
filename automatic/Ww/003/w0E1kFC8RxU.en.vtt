2065 and but you know when I start for
the<00:00:13.799> first<00:00:14.070> time<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.639> little<00:00:15.120> bit

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the first time I was a little bit

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.140 
the first time I was a little bit
skeptical<00:00:15.780> about<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.520> was<00:00:17.520> not<00:00:17.820> entirely

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
skeptical about it I was not entirely

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.050 
skeptical about it I was not entirely

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
sure if you know I shall believe this or

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.480 
sure if you know I shall believe this or
not<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.840> start<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.439> analysis<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> little

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
not but I start to analysis it a little

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670 
not but I start to analysis it a little
bit<00:00:23.640> more<00:00:23.789> careful<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.750> make<00:00:25.019> sure<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.320> go

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
bit more careful and I make sure to go

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.750 
bit more careful and I make sure to go
back<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.220> black<00:00:26.430> ops<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.910> black<00:00:27.539> ops<00:00:27.750> 2<00:00:27.960> and

back to black ops and black ops 2 and
actually<00:00:29.760> see<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.330> myself<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.990> put<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.560> the

actually see it for myself I put in the
same<00:00:31.890> kind<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.430> angle<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.239> they<00:00:33.719> kind<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
same kind of angle and they kind of a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.590 
same kind of angle and they kind of a
match<00:00:34.710> i<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.460> admit<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.270> match

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
pure speculation and i have a few

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.220 
pure speculation and i have a few
seconds<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.390> are<00:00:42.450> seeing<00:00:42.690> right<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:43.079> of

and the specific image that i showed a
few<00:00:48.510> seconds<00:00:48.870> ago<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.370> minute<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
few seconds ago was from one minute and

few seconds ago was from one minute and
26<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:52.410> hard<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.890> catch<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.340> but

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
26 it was a little hard to catch it but

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
26 it was a little hard to catch it but
that<00:00:54.239> specific<00:00:54.449> image<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.379> actually<00:00:55.710> from

that specific image was actually from
126<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.410> few<00:00:58.680> seconds<00:00:59.100> after<00:00:59.550> now

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
126 this one was a few seconds after now

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.599 
126 this one was a few seconds after now
I<00:01:00.420> went<00:01:01.050> back<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.379> black<00:01:01.559> ops<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.039> black<00:01:02.280> ops<00:01:02.460> 2

as you're seeing right now and it does

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.300 
as you're seeing right now and it does

loves to do easter eggs especially in

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.320 
loves to do easter eggs especially in
their<00:01:13.740> trailers<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.400> are<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.520> lot<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.909> small

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
their trailers there are a lot of small

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
their trailers there are a lot of small
things<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.140> lot<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.530> people<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.400> most

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
things that a lot of people or most

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.450 
things that a lot of people or most
people<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.509> actually<00:01:18.900> catch<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.130> in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
people then actually catch you know in

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
people then actually catch you know in
the<00:01:20.700> trailers<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the trailers and I think this is one of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.700 
the trailers and I think this is one of
them<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.590> i<00:01:23.280> did<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> speculation<00:01:24.270> video<00:01:24.720> about

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
them and i did a speculation video about

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.490 
them and i did a speculation video about
newton<00:01:26.189> coming<00:01:26.580> back<00:01:26.759> he's<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.840> shape<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.259> form

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
newton coming back he's in shape or form

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.850 
newton coming back he's in shape or form
a<00:01:29.270> four<00:01:30.270> days<00:01:30.450> ago<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.990> i<00:01:31.290> didn't<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.650> get

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
a four days ago and i didn't really get

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.469 
a four days ago and i didn't really get
that<00:01:32.070> much<00:01:32.130> feedback<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.939> i<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.240> almost

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
that much feedback but i was almost

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.810 
that much feedback but i was almost
certain<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> will<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.650> possible<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.579> i<00:01:35.670> mean

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
certain that will be possible and i mean

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.539 
certain that will be possible and i mean
i'll<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.119> pretty<00:01:36.450> much<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:37.229> confirmed<00:01:37.829> but

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
i'll be pretty much like confirmed but

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.130 
i'll be pretty much like confirmed but
don't<00:01:38.820> forget<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.329> nothing<00:01:39.990> has<00:01:40.110> been

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
don't forget that nothing has been

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.880 
don't forget that nothing has been
confirmed<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:41.100> denied<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:42.329> i<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.350> that

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
confirmed or denied but i do think that

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
confirmed or denied but i do think that
is<00:01:44.159> coming<00:01:44.369> back<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.329> gonna<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.630> bigger

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
is coming back now is it gonna be bigger

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.139 
is coming back now is it gonna be bigger
