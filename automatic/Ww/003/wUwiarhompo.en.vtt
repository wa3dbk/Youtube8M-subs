00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.700
 hi my warriors wild fruits 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.920
 again on Wednesday empowered from 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.050
 very many berraquera I hope 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.439
 that all and all be supremely 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.360
 well today I bring a super important subject 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.580
 that some of you have asked me is 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.400
 simple but so we will go catching 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.590
 that practicality in the kitchen we are going to 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.750
 make a brown rice with quinoa 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.120
 remember that the quinoa is a multi 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.970
 cereal is excellent for people 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.040
 because it gives them calcium iron if 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.500
 they have high cholesterol they can 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.050
 help leveling is excellent for whom 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.660
 handles a dietary process then what 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.140
 let's do it is very simple today I want 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.600
 so do it mixed but if you want 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.259
 You can simply use the reservoir 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.320
 only quinoa or the single rice bowl 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.500
 integral also if they wish they can 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.240
 Add vegetables or shredded chicken 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.210
 it's delicious then we're going to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.970
 need three pouches like these from 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.810
 medium water made possible of brown rice 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.420
 and half a well of quinoa these salts 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.909
 smoked marina can use salt 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.000
 of the himalayas or simply the one that the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.670
 which I prefer best I will use 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.210
 also olive oil can use 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.250
 the one in your house are not very strict 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.320
 town what we need in these 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.170
 moments but it's like for you 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.780
 they are entering this world of the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.720
 healthy more than fitness remember that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.289
 I am healthy then these two post 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.479
 and those that are half of quinoa and a half of 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.369
 whole rice come to be a single 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.069
 hallway what we are going to do is 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.540
 add three large positions of 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:06.070
 water or four if they are the same size 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.070
 I am going to add 3 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.860
 ah 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.930
 Y 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.930
 and 3 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:41.800
 add the sea salt smoked 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:45.060
 little because this room a lot between 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.959
 less salt let's use of food 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.959
 It really is a lot better 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.210
 add a little bit of river oil 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.170
 we wait for the water to boil and 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.270
 Then we added half a well of 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.709
 Quinoa and half a cup of brown rice 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.709
 what would it be 1 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.610
 already after the rice has boiled 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.330
 we add quinoa 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.330
 brown rice 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.550
 we stir 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.040
 and later when the rice is 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.720
 is drying then we cover is like 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.500
 make a normal rice 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.750
 i 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.940
 I 'm going to show you how it looks 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.520
 prepared our rice 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.960
 this has been our final result if 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.000
 they wish they can accompany it with a 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.940
 salad with a salmon with a piece of 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.270
 chicken can cook a breast with the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.860
 breast water make this that 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.570
