on<00:00:06.270> these<00:00:06.600> equal<00:00:07.020> six<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:07.859> have<00:00:08.010> here<00:00:08.250> now

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
on these equal six that we have here now

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.629 
on these equal six that we have here now
these<00:00:09.750> were<00:00:09.960> these<00:00:10.230> also<00:00:10.800> applies<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.460> 5

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
these were these also applies to the 5

Series<00:00:12.030> I'm<00:00:12.240> not<00:00:12.509> sure<00:00:12.690> about<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.960> sensors<00:00:13.349> it

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
Series I'm not sure about the sensors it

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.470 
Series I'm not sure about the sensors it
might<00:00:13.679> change<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.219> little<00:00:14.400> bit<00:00:14.610> but<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
might change a little bit but the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.609 
might change a little bit but the
concept<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.139> same

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
concept is the same

concept is the same
now<00:00:17.250> we'll<00:00:17.670> use<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> stock<00:00:18.439> giant<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
now we'll use in the stock giant the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.840 
now we'll use in the stock giant the
console<00:00:19.800> tab<00:00:19.890> you'll<00:00:20.189> see<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.550> how<00:00:20.640> easy

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
console tab you'll see this is how easy

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.759 
console tab you'll see this is how easy
it<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.539> while<00:00:21.720> he's<00:00:21.930> lifting<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.289> vehicle

you gotta remove these metal bar here on
the<00:00:34.260> caliper<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.250> gonna<00:00:35.399> play<00:00:35.579> this

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the caliper so just gonna play this

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.069 
the caliper so just gonna play this
foods<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.480> out<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.809> way<00:00:36.960> it's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
foods out and get out of the way it's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.020 
foods out and get out of the way it's
something<00:00:37.140> tricky<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.610> would<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
this camera was a little tricky to

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.170 
this camera was a little tricky to
remove<00:01:47.300> a<00:01:47.870> little<00:01:48.140> sticky<00:01:48.410> so<00:01:48.890> if<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:50.000> get

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.880 
remove a little sticky so if you get
that<00:01:50.330> problem<00:01:50.600> just<00:01:50.930> get<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.229> screwdriver<00:01:51.650> and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
that problem just get a screwdriver and

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.580 
that problem just get a screwdriver and
just<00:01:52.010> come<00:01:52.220> play<00:01:52.430> with<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.760> so<00:01:52.940> now<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.440> see

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
just come play with it so now you see

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.960 
just come play with it so now you see
the<00:01:54.680> life<00:01:54.860> on<00:01:55.040> those<00:01:55.130> brake<00:01:55.430> pads<00:01:55.670> they're

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
the life on those brake pads they're

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.790 
the life on those brake pads they're
literally<00:01:56.600> gone<00:01:56.900> so<00:01:57.200> I'll<00:01:57.290> remove<00:01:57.590> these

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
literally gone so I'll remove these

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.440 
literally gone so I'll remove these
brake<00:01:58.070> pad<00:01:58.310> first<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.729> then<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:59.000> one<00:01:59.270> this

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
brake pad first and then this one this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.600 
brake pad first and then this one this
one<00:01:59.780> has<00:02:00.020> some<00:02:00.830> clips<00:02:01.100> inside<00:02:01.370> of<00:02:01.490> that

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
one has some clips inside of that

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.550 
one has some clips inside of that
cylinder<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.690> said<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:09.229> his<00:02:09.350> first

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
cylinder so like I said it's his first

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.590 
cylinder so like I said it's his first
time<00:02:09.740> changing<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.520> brake<00:02:11.120> pads<00:02:11.360> on<00:02:11.480> his

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
time changing the brake pads on his

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.180 
time changing the brake pads on his
vehicle<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.170> if<00:02:12.260> he<00:02:12.350> can<00:02:12.530> do<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.680> anybody<00:02:13.010> can

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
in mind though is that on BMWs you have

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.900 
in mind though is that on BMWs you have
to<00:02:18.170> replace<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.680> rotors<00:02:19.070> every<00:02:19.520> other<00:02:19.640> brake

Nissan's and Toyota that you can do you

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.870 
Nissan's and Toyota that you can do you
know<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> couple<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.570> couple<00:02:27.130> brake<00:02:28.130> pads<00:02:28.430> dogs

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
know a couple a couple brake pads dogs

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.800 
know a couple a couple brake pads dogs
and<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:30.080> get<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.410> rotor<00:02:30.830> turn<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.880> now<00:02:32.209> what

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
and just get the rotor turn so now what

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.970 
and just get the rotor turn so now what
we're<00:02:32.959> gonna<00:02:33.050> do<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.380> we<00:02:33.560> gotta<00:02:33.769> push<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
we're gonna do is we gotta push the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.470 
we're gonna do is we gotta push the
cylinder<00:02:34.220> back<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.720> we're<00:02:35.959> using<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
cylinder back in so we're using the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.000 
cylinder back in so we're using the
brake<00:02:38.480> pad<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.780> doesn't<00:02:39.019> have<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.200> clips<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
brake pad it doesn't have the clips and

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.540 
brake pad it doesn't have the clips and
we're<00:02:40.280> using<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.610> C<00:02:40.880> clamp<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.989> just<00:02:42.590> find

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
we're using the C clamp so just find

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.040 
we're using the C clamp so just find
your<00:02:43.670> way<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.910> stick<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.269> on<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.510> back<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
your way to stick it on the back of the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.949 
your way to stick it on the back of the
cylinder<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.590> gives<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:46.100> know<00:02:46.220> slowly<00:02:46.959> turn

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
cylinder and gives you know slowly turn

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.230 
cylinder and gives you know slowly turn
the<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.739> C<00:02:49.160> clamp

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240
