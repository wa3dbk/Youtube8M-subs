that was not mainly down to our choice
but<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.470> suppose<00:03:15.010> it's<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.370> way<00:03:15.519> that<00:03:15.700> we've<00:03:15.820> been

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
but I suppose it's a way that we've been

but I suppose it's a way that we've been
playing<00:03:16.840> for<00:03:17.140> quite<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.410> while<00:03:17.530> now<00:03:17.590> and

playing for quite a while now and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.940 
playing for quite a while now and
finally<00:03:18.280> getting<00:03:18.790> across<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:20.079> it's<00:03:20.500> good<00:03:20.709> and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
finally getting across so it's good and

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.310 
finally getting across so it's good and
