00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280 
head is a little bit tricky but first
thing<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.540> seven<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
thing you want to do is go seven and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.639 
thing you want to do is go seven and
then<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.640> was<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> sandstone<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.930> your

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
then for was the sandstone and your

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.170 
then for was the sandstone and your
about<00:02:01.860> one-fifth<00:02:02.399> done<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.820> his<00:02:02.969> face

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
about one-fifth done with his face

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.730 
about one-fifth done with his face
already<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.990> his<00:02:04.140> face<00:02:04.350> you're<00:02:04.590> gonna

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
already but in his face you're gonna

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
already but in his face you're gonna
just<00:02:05.070> want<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> use<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> sandstone<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.479> black

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
just want to use the sandstone and black

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.350 
just want to use the sandstone and black
for<00:02:07.290> his<00:02:07.439> hair<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:07.920> his<00:02:08.879> hair<00:02:09.179> is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
for his hair because his hair is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.360 
for his hair because his hair is
traditionally<00:02:10.020> black<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.009> want<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.280> go

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
traditionally black so you want to go

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.660 
traditionally black so you want to go
for

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
for

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.910 
for
right<00:02:13.670> there<00:02:13.909> and<00:02:14.140> then<00:02:15.140> one<00:02:15.409> right<00:02:15.650> there<00:02:16.120> and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
right there and then one right there and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.240 
right there and then one right there and
one<00:02:18.920> sandstone<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:20.590> then<00:02:21.590> two<00:02:21.799> more<00:02:21.950> black

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
one sandstone and then two more black

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.280 
one sandstone and then two more black
those<00:02:22.580> two<00:02:22.879> black<00:02:23.209> right<00:02:23.510> there<00:02:23.720> are<00:02:23.930> going<00:02:24.170> to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
those two black right there are going to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.089 
those two black right there are going to
be<00:02:24.349> his<00:02:24.739> eye<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:25.340> mean<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:27.230> really<00:02:27.260> can't<00:02:27.830> see

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
be his eye I mean you really can't see

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.610 
be his eye I mean you really can't see
it<00:02:28.250> at<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.430> moment<00:02:28.909> I'm<00:02:29.000> gonna<00:02:29.150> zoom<00:02:29.450> out<00:02:29.620> as

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
it at the moment I'm gonna zoom out as

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.319 
it at the moment I'm gonna zoom out as
you<00:02:30.829> can<00:02:30.920> see<00:02:31.099> it<00:02:31.400> really<00:02:31.790> doesn't<00:02:32.090> look<00:02:32.150> like

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
you can see it really doesn't look like

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.569 
you can see it really doesn't look like
