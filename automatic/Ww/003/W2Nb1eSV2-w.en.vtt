00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:10.340
 I think 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:10.340
 The nature of what we see and what is real is not completely different 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:26.100
 Attempts to attack on the basis of hate have been tried for decades 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:29.960
 I would like to see the giant from a different perspective than the existing one 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.960
 It may end up idle but 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.500
 I am 8 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.500
 What 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.400
 Was I 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.400
 Hmm 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.210
 I 've only been surprised since I entered the Survey Corps 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.640
 Not only Hanji 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 Just a change 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.530
 Now this is a haunted cave 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.130
 People who seek change are groups 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.250
 That's investigation Corps What 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.550
 Of Judge 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.710
 If you like 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:14.330
 Of ten story Can you tell us more 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.720
 a Yes I think it is better to know in detail for tomorrow's experiment 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.640
 Oh yeah- 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:25.470
 There are many omitted parts in the current story 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:32.600
 It will be a little longer white when talking to fix again 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.600
 Mercer When I first captured the giant I assumed that 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.310
 Because 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.920
 There is no newly obtained information in this incident 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.000
 Hmm 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.170
 What I have told you should have been taught as a training soldier 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.170
 You know Ele too 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.340
 I knew everything 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.420
 So from here on, with my own guesses, decipher again 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.460
 enter 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.950
 That giant giant vomiting 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.520
 Two kanji characters end but ah 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.670
 Test die gar 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.390
 He was killed even if he hates the giant 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.390
 Ha ha ha
