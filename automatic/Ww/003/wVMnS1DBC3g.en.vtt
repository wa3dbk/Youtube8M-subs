 hello everyone we are in new york 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.379
 today for you I was to write a small 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:36.629
 the truth is now all the time of the day we 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.350
 arrived just two days on business 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.340
 heard today try to describe it 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.150
 accounts without a clean stay 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.700
 we have deadlines alessandro 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.490
 I got the music out there a little loud 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.470
 plays can't comment or me 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.110
 really like how they decorated the trees 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.360
 then hang out on the same tree 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.250
 big beautiful in front of us 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.590
 I will show you now another tree 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.760
 artificial by the way here at all street 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.200
 these trees with 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.230
 we will deliver this year too 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.030

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.500

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.260
 like when white yellow lights 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.920
 multicolored I used to like now 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.920
 there is no arch 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.290
 we pass near the radius and in the music hall 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.020
 and you can go to class no 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.520
 but today we will not go there because 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.009
 us 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.790
 time is not so much just wanted 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.460

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.159
 look at this beautiful christmas tree changes

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.910
 we are by the way trying to find a restaurant 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.470
 where to dine 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:15.180
 see these big red circles here 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 in front of me scenery yes I see them on 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.380
 over the past five years here each 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.050
 spears happen in new york before christmas 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.720
 and happy new year and I see it is interesting to me 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.290
 why they do not usually change the scenery 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.090

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.510
