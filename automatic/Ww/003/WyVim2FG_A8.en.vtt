like<00:01:22.940> when<00:01:23.120> two<00:01:23.300> of<00:01:23.330> them<00:01:23.510> happen<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:23.960> be

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
mass so instead one clue scientists use

to<00:01:28.340> figure<00:01:28.610> out<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.940> identity<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.450> an<00:01:29.540> object

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
to figure out the identity of an object

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.020 
to figure out the identity of an object
is<00:01:30.140> how<00:01:30.530> hot<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:31.010> is<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.460> case<00:01:31.610> of<00:01:31.790> stars

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
is how hot it is in the case of stars

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.940 
is how hot it is in the case of stars
for<00:01:32.270> example<00:01:32.390> we<00:01:33.020> know<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.440> higher<00:01:33.680> its

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
for example we know that the higher its

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.160 
for example we know that the higher its
surface<00:01:34.340> temperature<00:01:34.760> is<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.390> more<00:01:35.570> mass<00:01:35.900> it

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
surface temperature is the more mass it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.440 
surface temperature is the more mass it
has<00:01:36.320> because<00:01:36.770> more<00:01:37.010> massive<00:01:37.520> stars<00:01:37.760> burn

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
has because more massive stars burn

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.510 
has because more massive stars burn
their<00:01:38.659> fuel<00:01:38.900> more<00:01:39.200> rapidly<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:39.890> get<00:01:40.250> hotter

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
their fuel more rapidly and get hotter

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.060 
their fuel more rapidly and get hotter
and<00:01:40.610> by<00:01:40.850> extension<00:01:41.270> less<00:01:42.020> massive<00:01:42.350> stars<00:01:42.800> have

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
and by extension less massive stars have

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.219 
and by extension less massive stars have
lower<00:01:43.610> temperatures<00:01:44.180> than<00:01:44.570> more<00:01:44.840> massive

lower temperatures than more massive

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.200 
lower temperatures than more massive

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.270

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.340 
dwarfs they lack the sustained fusion to
maintain<00:02:01.670> such<00:02:01.909> temperatures<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> brown

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
maintain such temperatures so a brown

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.380 
maintain such temperatures so a brown
