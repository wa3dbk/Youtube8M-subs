00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 what is your favorite character in 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.549
 the paths of the aude yesterday at 2 months and 6 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.549
 years ago that it is clear 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.070
 bring together the Nintendo and Knights of the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.680
 zodiac it started from a good feeling 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.840
 but finally it's a bit like being 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.010
 whipped cream on shit it will be 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.900
 very presentable but I advise you 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.820
 not to eat it 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.699
 ok it's that thing that determines 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.769
 your zodiac sign maybe it's okay 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.240
 to be useful in the genre game we 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.160
 know the golden knight who goes with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.890
 you and not at all seniors after 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
 because he had no face no but 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.489
 serious but I wanted to play 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.129
 knight of the zodiac and face what the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.719
 whores must do what camp 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.739
 bad guys that looks like heaps of mud 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.320
 people come you assault me â€‹â€‹was cage 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.870
 what is this serious city of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.030
 whores forced to do shenanigans 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.829
 example at the coliseum it was impossible 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.719
 to chain all the fights without losing 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.129
 so between each fighter it takes 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.049
 go to the hosto to recover from 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.280
 the energy at the sto that is not in the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.170
 menu of regions and so you have to there 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.520
 go on foot what becomes extremely 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.840
 shocking because to go faster there 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.259
 must have blackberry those who drain 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.170
 our cosmos we can exchange points 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.250
 of life against cosmos points 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.720
 so just before getting treatment 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.460
 knowing that I recover my points 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.299
 of energy I convert the remains into 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.610
 Cosmos tip 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.610
 do not try to go to zero otherwise 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.680
 must spend the rest of the time navigating 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.509
 in the select menu and we are entitled to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.509
 every time to pau fc yanev 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:47.790
 Moreover fuck it gave me fucking 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:53.460
 besson or the black knight the ecrennes 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.480
 cream strike also strike 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.660
 I hope all the game is not like 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.580
 oh my god but all the game like that 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.910
 said look what I just found 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.770
 it is heartbreaking could not have discovered 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.450
 something else knew this strange 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.700
 feeling that something is going to happen 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.950
 horrible thing like seeing the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.450
 box but if you know it this 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.820
 feeling you 're going to play a real 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.350
 horror saas platform game fell 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.840
 in the void and die in places 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.600
 improbable winger fucking wetter you 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.730
 were right this game is like a species 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.590
 of cruel punishment you will inflict 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.470
 dogs the cooks and the women 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.670
 cleaning and it's killing me 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:43.510
 probably the worst hotel that exists 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:44.230
 in the world and in addition you see there but it 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.730

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.380
 this game was me focused and of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.700
 frustration and action is consistent 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.830
 totally impossible to achieve 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.970
 the avoid killer cooks I come to 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.489
 the welcome to hear him say that he 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.600

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.250

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.320

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.019
 watch I have to use the wind for 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.750
 to jump further and when I get to the 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.930
 end says nothing, no way to go anymore 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.699

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.960
 the universe has no secrets for anyone 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.960

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.120
 it's twisted mind but look at that 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.530
 but it's ridiculous how they 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.880
 be injected from the screen I mean 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.919
 of the Japanese version was very much 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.360
 more fun anyway I want to 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.900
 remove the violent side but here we will say 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.900
 asterix 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.629
 after 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.560
 game consists of four chapters 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.480
 divided into three kinds of level the 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.920
 levels boring very boring level and the 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.300
 deadly levels actually you have 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.030
 so much the impression of doing and 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.860
 redo and redo and again redo the 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.420
 same level in a loop as at the end of a 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.210
 moment you really feel 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.510
 to live a day without end but in real 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.510
 it is true 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.710
 t 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.419
 the trick 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.419
 I am tired 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.960
 t 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.690
 3 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.630
 troubles of this game will lead you to 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.430
 suicide doors you will not say anymore I 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.800
 I'm pissed off but I 'll tell you 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.990
 tired drummer and we pass from the soldier who 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.669
 fled from asthmatic chickens to bosses 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.380
 which are almost unbeatable that's it 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.380
 it's finally the last boss 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:55.479
 I'm dying as he wants but this 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:14.770
 a kitchen knife total cost to 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.770
 eat
