that<00:02:54.610> slam<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.239> my<00:02:55.390> frame<00:02:55.720> it's<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:56.319> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
that slam in my frame it's just the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.750 
that slam in my frame it's just the
shock<00:02:57.459> value<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.890> hammer<00:03:00.130> hitting<00:03:00.489> the

shock value of the hammer hitting the
frame<00:03:01.030> itself<00:03:01.450> it's<00:03:01.780> not<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.650> not<00:03:02.830> good<00:03:02.890> for

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
frame itself it's not it's not good for

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.800 
frame itself it's not it's not good for
it<00:03:03.549> it's<00:03:03.760> not<00:03:03.910> going<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> hurt<00:03:04.299> it<00:03:04.480> if<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.690> do

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
it it's not going to hurt it if you do

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.240 
it it's not going to hurt it if you do
it<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.989> couple<00:03:05.170> times<00:03:05.590> but<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:05.950> wouldn't

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
it a couple times but I wouldn't

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.130 
it a couple times but I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:06.760> doing<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.180> all<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.450> time<00:03:07.510> but

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
recommend it doing it all the time but

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.570 
recommend it doing it all the time but
just<00:03:08.410> by<00:03:08.590> doing<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:09.130> you're<00:03:09.340> actually

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
just by doing that you're actually

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.420 
just by doing that you're actually
polishing<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.569> surface<00:03:11.110> it's<00:03:11.769> better<00:03:12.160> than

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
polishing that surface it's better than

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.490 
polishing that surface it's better than
if<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.760> put<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.090> back<00:03:13.209> together<00:03:13.480> once<00:03:14.350> you

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
if you put it back together once you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.800 
if you put it back together once you
reassemble<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.310> gun<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:16.239> can<00:03:16.420> then<00:03:16.569> put<00:03:16.780> a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
reassemble the gun you can then put a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.390 
reassemble the gun you can then put a
dummy<00:03:17.019> around<00:03:17.350> a<00:03:17.530> net<00:03:17.709> more<00:03:17.859> you<00:03:18.010> can<00:03:18.160> drive

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
dummy around a net more you can drive

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.970 
dummy around a net more you can drive
fire<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.900> can<00:03:20.079> feel<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.590> difference

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
fire it and you can feel the difference

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.490 
fire it and you can feel the difference
what<00:03:21.459> I<00:03:21.489> would<00:03:21.790> suggest<00:03:21.970> first<00:03:22.570> is<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.260> take

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
what I would suggest first is to take

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.470 
what I would suggest first is to take
that<00:03:23.769> gun<00:03:24.100> before<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.640> put<00:03:24.910> any<00:03:25.060> weapon

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
that gun before you put any weapon

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.720 
that gun before you put any weapon
shield<00:03:25.720> on<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.320> use<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.950> trigger<00:03:27.430> pull

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
shield on it and use a trigger pull

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.870 
shield on it and use a trigger pull
gauge<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.540> measure<00:03:28.570> your<00:03:29.140> amount<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.590> pull<00:03:29.880> so

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
gauge and measure your amount of pull so

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.970 
gauge and measure your amount of pull so
let's<00:03:31.239> say<00:03:31.450> it's<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:32.530> know<00:03:32.650> somewhere

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
let's say it's you know somewhere

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.520 
let's say it's you know somewhere
between<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:34.150> could<00:03:34.329> be<00:03:34.450> 4<00:03:34.690> pounds<00:03:35.170> or<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.380> could

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
between it could be 4 pounds or it could

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.620 
between it could be 4 pounds or it could
be<00:03:35.620> 7<00:03:35.980> or<00:03:36.040> 8<00:03:36.220> but<00:03:36.760> you'll<00:03:36.940> measure<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.359> pull

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
be 7 or 8 but you'll measure that pull

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.130 
be 7 or 8 but you'll measure that pull
first<00:03:37.900> then<00:03:38.260> after<00:03:39.220> going<00:03:39.459> down<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:40.140> applying

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
first then after going down and applying

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.050 
first then after going down and applying
the<00:03:41.470> weapon<00:03:41.799> chill<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.310> hammer<00:03:42.609> hooks<00:03:42.880> in

the weapon chill to the hammer hooks in
the<00:03:43.180> sear<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:44.280> work<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.459> put<00:03:45.640> it<00:03:45.760> back

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
the sear and work and put it back

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.680 
the sear and work and put it back
together<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.329> work<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.690> a<00:03:46.750> little<00:03:46.959> bit<00:03:48.690> once

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
together and work it a little bit once

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.900 
together and work it a little bit once
you've<00:03:49.870> pulled<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.920> trigger<00:03:51.160> drive<00:03:51.489> fired<00:03:51.760> it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
you've pulled the trigger drive fired it

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.620 
you've pulled the trigger drive fired it
a<00:03:51.970> couple<00:03:52.150> times

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
a couple times

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.309 
a couple times
put<00:03:52.870> your<00:03:53.220> trigger<00:03:54.220> gates<00:03:54.579> back<00:03:54.910> on<00:03:55.180> pull<00:03:56.140> the

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
put your trigger gates back on pull the

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.319 
put your trigger gates back on pull the
trigger<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.890> you'll<00:03:57.640> see<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.120> it's

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
trigger and you'll see that it's

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.420 
trigger and you'll see that it's
lightens<00:03:58.780> anywhere<00:03:59.319> between<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.799> half<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.400> a

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
lightens anywhere between a half to a

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.880 
lightens anywhere between a half to a
full<00:04:00.519> pound<00:04:01.030> I've<00:04:01.900> had<00:04:02.079> some<00:04:02.290> guys<00:04:02.500> say<00:04:02.709> it's

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
full pound I've had some guys say it's

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.530 
full pound I've had some guys say it's
actually<00:04:03.250> giving<00:04:03.579> them<00:04:03.640> about<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:03.940> pound<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:04.510> a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
actually giving them about a pound and a

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.250 
actually giving them about a pound and a
half<00:04:04.569> more<00:04:05.019> but<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:05.769> would<00:04:05.980> be<00:04:06.010> on<00:04:06.310> real<00:04:06.700> real

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
half more but that would be on real real

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.620 
half more but that would be on real real
rough<00:04:08.260> triggers<00:04:08.709> but<00:04:09.370> this<00:04:09.639> actually<00:04:10.209> helps

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
rough triggers but this actually helps

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.069 
rough triggers but this actually helps
to<00:04:10.870> lap<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:12.060> condition<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.180> trigger<00:04:13.480> but

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
to lap and condition that trigger but

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.210 
to lap and condition that trigger but
it's<00:04:14.200> going<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.440> give<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.889> maximum

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
it's going to give you the maximum

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.050 
it's going to give you the maximum
amount<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.359> smoothness<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:17.200> Christmas<00:04:18.060> that

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
amount of smoothness and Christmas that

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.180 
amount of smoothness and Christmas that
you<00:04:19.209> can<00:04:19.389> in<00:04:20.049> fact<00:04:20.079> you'll<00:04:20.500> experience<00:04:20.919> it

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
you can in fact you'll experience it

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.600 
you can in fact you'll experience it
yourself<00:04:21.280> on<00:04:22.210> an<00:04:22.360> ar-15<00:04:22.810> platform<00:04:23.610> that's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
yourself on an ar-15 platform that's

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.810 
yourself on an ar-15 platform that's
pretty<00:04:24.880> simple

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
pretty simple

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.260 
pretty simple
here's<00:04:27.820> your<00:04:28.000> hammer<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:29.789> your<00:04:30.789> hammer<00:04:31.000> looks

here's your hammer and your hammer looks

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.210 
here's your hammer and your hammer looks
basically<00:04:31.570> are<00:04:32.050> right<00:04:32.259> here<00:04:32.620> I'll<00:04:32.830> point<00:04:33.039> them

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
basically are right here I'll point them

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.580 
basically are right here I'll point them
up<00:04:34.410> good<00:04:36.509> right<00:04:37.509> there<00:04:37.780> I<00:04:37.960> don't<00:04:38.199> know<00:04:38.320> if<00:04:38.440> we

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
up good right there I don't know if we

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.520 
up good right there I don't know if we
can<00:04:38.770> get<00:04:39.100> down<00:04:39.280> can<00:04:39.550> you<00:04:39.639> see<00:04:39.669> that<00:04:40.000> Matt<00:04:40.530> okay

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
can get down can you see that Matt okay

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.010 
can get down can you see that Matt okay
right<00:04:42.280> here<00:04:42.639> that<00:04:42.880> first<00:04:43.120> little<00:04:43.539> tear<00:04:43.750> that's

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
right here that first little tear that's

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.870 
right here that first little tear that's
that's<00:04:44.680> where<00:04:44.889> you<00:04:45.039> want<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.280> put<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.550> weapon

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
that's where you want to put the weapon

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.490 
that's where you want to put the weapon
show<00:04:46.060> just<00:04:46.330> put<00:04:46.479> a<00:04:46.509> drop<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:47.020> there<00:04:49.259> I've<00:04:50.259> got<00:04:50.470> a

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
show just put a drop on there I've got a

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.300 
show just put a drop on there I've got a
JP<00:04:50.979> fire<00:04:51.250> control<00:04:51.699> system<00:04:52.150> in<00:04:52.300> there<00:04:52.479> so<00:04:53.310> but

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
JP fire control system in there so but

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.830 
JP fire control system in there so but
essentially<00:04:54.820> it's<00:04:54.970> going<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.180> be<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.389> same<00:04:55.630> on

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
essentially it's going to be the same on

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.080 
essentially it's going to be the same on
everything<00:04:56.320> I've<00:04:57.160> got<00:04:57.400> lighter<00:04:57.610> springs

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
everything I've got lighter springs

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.240 
everything I've got lighter springs
everything<00:04:58.660> so<00:04:58.870> this<00:04:59.470> thing<00:04:59.710> has<00:04:59.860> about<00:05:00.220> a

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
everything so this thing has about a

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.290 
everything so this thing has about a
this<00:05:01.030> is<00:05:01.210> my<00:05:01.419> SiC<00:05:01.810> 400<00:05:02.349> pistol<00:05:03.000> with<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.120> arm

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
this is my SiC 400 pistol with the arm

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.749 
this is my SiC 400 pistol with the arm
grip<00:05:04.539> on<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:04.990> it's<00:05:05.320> got<00:05:05.500> about<00:05:05.650> a<00:05:05.770> four

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
grip on it and it's got about a four

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.659 
grip on it and it's got about a four
pound<00:05:07.060> pull<00:05:07.690> on<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.080> but<00:05:08.800> after<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.490> do<00:05:09.639> that

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
pound pull on it but after you do that

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.089 
pound pull on it but after you do that
just<00:05:10.530> work<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.740> couple<00:05:11.979> times<00:05:12.280> but<00:05:14.099> once

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
just work it a couple times but once

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.279 
just work it a couple times but once
again<00:05:15.300> prior<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.330> doing<00:05:16.630> that<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:16.960> would

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
again prior to doing that I would

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.060 
again prior to doing that I would
suggest<00:05:17.580> putting<00:05:18.580> your<00:05:19.320> your<00:05:20.320> gauge<00:05:20.530> on<00:05:20.860> it

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
suggest putting your your gauge on it

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.240 
suggest putting your your gauge on it
your<00:05:21.580> your<00:05:22.000> pound<00:05:22.360> gauge<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:23.099> testing<00:05:24.099> the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
your your pound gauge and testing the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.339 
your your pound gauge and testing the
pull<00:05:24.460> see<00:05:25.270> how<00:05:25.389> many<00:05:25.539> pounds<00:05:25.750> of<00:05:25.990> pull<00:05:26.199> you

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
pull see how many pounds of pull you

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.740 
pull see how many pounds of pull you
have<00:05:26.500> then<00:05:26.830> after<00:05:27.190> you<00:05:27.310> do<00:05:27.490> that<00:05:27.699> put<00:05:28.449> it<00:05:28.570> on

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
have then after you do that put it on

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.870 
have then after you do that put it on
you<00:05:29.139> can<00:05:29.289> work<00:05:29.500> that<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:30.220> other<00:05:30.340> thing<00:05:30.610> if

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
you can work that the other thing if

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.010 
you can work that the other thing if
it's<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.180> milspec<00:05:32.789> hammer<00:05:33.789> and<00:05:34.120> and<00:05:34.360> and<00:05:34.630> snare
