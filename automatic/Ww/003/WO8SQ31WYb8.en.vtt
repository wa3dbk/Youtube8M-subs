of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.060> reality<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.680> really<00:00:28.890> well-known

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
of the reality I'm not really well-known

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.820 
of the reality I'm not really well-known
and<00:00:29.789> no<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.599> actually<00:00:30.779> knew<00:00:31.140> who<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.380> am<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and no one actually knew who I am and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.200 
and no one actually knew who I am and

channel<00:00:37.620> actually<00:00:38.070> cancelled<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.050> why

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219
