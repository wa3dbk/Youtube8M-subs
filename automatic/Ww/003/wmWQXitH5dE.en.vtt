00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
definitely been physics I took it last

definitely been physics I took it last
year<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.520> grade<00:01:44.700> 11<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.300> taking<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.660> again

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
year in grade 11 and I'm taking it again

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.620 
year in grade 11 and I'm taking it again
in<00:01:46.050> grade<00:01:46.200> 12<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.940> has<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> coalesced

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
in grade 12 I think it has a coalesced

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.210 
in grade 12 I think it has a coalesced
field<00:01:48.869> trips<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.290> projects<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> any<00:01:49.920> course

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
if I chose last year in grade 11 physics

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.680 
if I chose last year in grade 11 physics
we<00:01:52.560> got<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.009> nuclear<00:01:53.369> reactor<00:01:53.729> for

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
we got to go to a nuclear reactor for
