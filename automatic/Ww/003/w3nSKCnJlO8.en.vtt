00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello everyone with you android android 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.429
 today wanted to talk about the game 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.610
 which is not interesting for you but it 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 still an alpha version so up 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.389
 the final version is still many many 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.039
 time will have to wait for the game 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.890
 called zone project x 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.350
 all events in the game turn on 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.930
 the territory of Ukraine in general the game is largely 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.599
 very much like a game like 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.510
 stalker for sure you are many in such a game 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.000
 played and I including that is 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 have read one of the best games for such 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.950
 themed as you see also 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.059
 different houses are so rustic 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.510
 houses in which can 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.750
 fathers move around the club so to speak 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.360
 kill different here dudes stalkers 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.899
 release and who's here through various kinds 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.789
 weapons graphics too I really like 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.760
 because it is really very beautiful for 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.340
 mobile device made awesome 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 different shades of the same here and there 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.020
 as you noticed that here's the video itself from 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.729
 gameplay 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.130
 made as if i'm on iphone 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.140
 reproduces it seems to me not only on 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.020
 iphone on android she is also a must 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.280
 will come out here at least I heard that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.869
 And also in the game there is physics in 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.659
 further see in the dark over 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.290
 apply here we will shoot kill and 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.799
 style, but so far not enough information 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.320
 there is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.009
 about this game so i can only 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.189
 some thoughts of your own due to this video 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.450
 I watch as you have something like 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.979
 there is still enough here 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.670
 good art intelligence because 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.829
 if we get shot yes he hear the noise he 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.270
 Of course, running to the council resorts 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.189
 he kills you calmly 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.470
 In the game, in addition to this, is present 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.200
 and blood well all but naturalistic all 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.290
 done here is quite an interesting game 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.540
 very big potential in this game and 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.340
 the main thing is not just to run on 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.820
 enclosed space as you can see 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.890
 this level is there and fenced 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.039
 fence and limited to us 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.640
 move somewhere beyond this territory 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.920
 just a stalker than he was famous for 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.110
 very large areas were on which 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.500
 we will be able to move 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.300
 here so we can move 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.390
 here the trees are also done very much 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.900
 well even these different car 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.490
 now see the very physics we shoot 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.610
 here in this dude and he will shoot 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.790
 bone boxes here look got up that's it 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.040
 they their i giggle collapse besides 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.680
 of this as you see when I we build from 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.680
 automatic machine, he inaccurately goal does not leave a 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.560
 a lot of bullets passes by but in 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.670
 the result of luciana of this stalker 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.370
 and whom we still do 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.519
 we finish short the game is worth it because 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.120
 what's worth playing it 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:04.080
 because there are very few quality ones here 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.570
 just such shooters are made in posts 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.810
 Jewish style especially traction lpg 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.350
 that's why I think everyone without exception 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.180
 will become this game as well as there 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.810
 as if different helicopters are in the same 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.230
 stalker 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.209
 I really do not know if we can with him 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.100
 fight them yes shoot it 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.470
 kill but a stalker like that i'm not 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.400
 I remember though what was like in 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.880
 last levels 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.760
 data he even vitim some base skf 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.980
 model we will hang out the exception that 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.590
 this is what this game has 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.269
 short awesome game waiting without 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.790
 exceptions all all 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.769
 and here is such an interesting grape which 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.519
 Here is a concrete helicopter was going to say and 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.040
 here flies if pike see it 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.709
 information yes I did 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.790
 Some role with you was Andrei than the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.790
 ideal all bye
