hurdler because that's my best jump and
it's<00:00:12.150> easy<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.900> doesn't<00:00:13.049> even<00:00:13.230> look<00:00:13.349> like

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
it's easy and it doesn't even look like

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.709 
it's easy and it doesn't even look like
bad<00:00:13.950> even<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.429> grass<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.849> that's<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.480> good

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
bad even on the grass so that's a good

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.700 
bad even on the grass so that's a good
thing<00:00:16.070> for<00:00:17.270> hurdlers<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.600> most<00:00:19.320> people<00:00:19.590> do

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
thing for hurdlers and most people do

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.710 
thing for hurdlers and most people do
the<00:00:19.830> right<00:00:20.010> side<00:00:20.250> but<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> think<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.330> easier

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the right side but I think it's easier

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.410 
the right side but I think it's easier
to<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> side<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.680> you're<00:00:23.550> like<00:00:23.760> most

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
to do the side that you're like most

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.900 
to do the side that you're like most
flexible<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.230> guess<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> heel

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
flexible of I guess like I can do a heel

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.460 
flexible of I guess like I can do a heel
stretch<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.269> my<00:00:27.359> left<00:00:27.539> side<00:00:27.720> that's<00:00:27.930> why<00:00:28.109> my

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
stretch on my left side that's why my

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.950 
stretch on my left side that's why my
herky<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.400> good<00:00:29.580> because<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.570> basically

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
herky is so good because it's basically

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.160 
herky is so good because it's basically
