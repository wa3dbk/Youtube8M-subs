some cold water just to cool the shells
off<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.060> use<00:01:54.240> them<00:01:54.420> right<00:01:54.600> away

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
off so that you can use them right away

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
off so that you can use them right away
drain<00:01:55.500> those<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.280> you're<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> put

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
drain those and then you're going to put

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.020 
drain those and then you're going to put
some<00:01:57.270> stuffing<00:01:57.719> into<00:01:57.960> each<00:01:58.110> shell<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:02.030> there

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
some stuffing into each shell and there

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.510 
some stuffing into each shell and there
is<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.659> recipe<00:02:04.140> actually<00:02:04.469> makes<00:02:04.649> enough<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
is this recipe actually makes enough to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.580 
is this recipe actually makes enough to
fill<00:02:05.759> almost<00:02:06.180> all<00:02:06.329> 16<00:02:06.840> quite<00:02:07.229> full<00:02:09.590> then

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
fill almost all 16 quite full then

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.000 
fill almost all 16 quite full then
you're<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.400> dip<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.569> stuffed<00:02:12.930> pasta

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
egg and the breadcrumbs kind of seal the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.360 
egg and the breadcrumbs kind of seal the
opening<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> shell<00:02:33.930> then<00:02:34.710> put<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> couple

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
opening of the shell then put a couple

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.900 
opening of the shell then put a couple
of<00:02:35.490> inches<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:36.950> vegetable<00:02:37.950> oil<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.370> assualt<00:02:38.700> in

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
of inches of vegetable oil in assualt in

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.790 
of inches of vegetable oil in assualt in
a<00:02:39.180> frying<00:02:39.840> pan<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.500> heat<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:42.440> 365<00:02:43.440> degrees

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
a frying pan and heat it to 365 degrees

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.230 
a frying pan and heat it to 365 degrees
and<00:02:44.100> then<00:02:44.190> you're<00:02:44.340> gonna<00:02:44.490> put<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.820> shells<00:02:45.060> in

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
and then you're gonna put the shells in

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.180 
and then you're gonna put the shells in
there<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.630> you're<00:02:45.750> gonna<00:02:45.840> cook<00:02:46.080> them<00:02:46.290> for

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
there and you're gonna cook them for

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.830 
there and you're gonna cook them for
about<00:02:47.280> minute<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> half<00:02:48.210> to<00:02:48.480> two<00:02:48.690> minutes

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
about minute and a half to two minutes

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.830 
about minute and a half to two minutes
now<00:02:49.830> if<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.040> had<00:02:50.190> deep<00:02:50.370> enough<00:02:50.580> oil<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.630> could

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
now if you had deep enough oil you could

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.900 
now if you had deep enough oil you could
just<00:02:52.020> submerge<00:02:52.410> them<00:02:52.710> but<00:02:52.920> since<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.340> don't<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
just submerge them but since I don't I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.540 
just submerge them but since I don't I
had<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.630> turn<00:02:54.840> me<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.620> had<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.190> dig<00:02:56.340> up<00:02:56.460> a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
had to turn me so I had to dig up a

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.120 
had to turn me so I had to dig up a
couple<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.970> minutes<00:02:57.270> per<00:02:57.480> side<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:58.110> guess<00:02:58.920> I

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
couple of minutes per side I guess I

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.620 
couple of minutes per side I guess I
would<00:02:59.280> say<00:02:59.490> what<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.850> did<00:02:59.970> until<00:03:00.390> they're<00:03:00.600> a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
would say what I did until they're a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.590 
would say what I did until they're a
nice<00:03:00.780> golden<00:03:01.230> brown<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.000> then<00:03:03.000> you're<00:03:03.180> once

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
nice golden brown and then you're once

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.330 
nice golden brown and then you're once
they're<00:03:03.810> done<00:03:03.960> you're<00:03:04.710> gonna<00:03:04.830> take<00:03:05.070> them<00:03:05.220> out

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
they're done you're gonna take them out

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.010 
they're done you're gonna take them out
let<00:03:05.580> them<00:03:05.610> drain<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.030> paper<00:03:06.240> toweling<00:03:06.810> I

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
let them drain on paper toweling I

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.500 
let them drain on paper toweling I
suggest<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.890> put<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.790> shell<00:03:09.090> opening

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
suggest you put the shell opening

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.240 
suggest you put the shell opening
downward<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.350> if<00:03:10.410> there's<00:03:10.530> any<00:03:10.710> oil<00:03:10.800> that's

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
downward so if there's any oil that's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.340 
downward so if there's any oil that's
been<00:03:11.400> trapped<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.880> there<00:03:12.090> it'll<00:03:12.840> come<00:03:13.020> out<00:03:13.140> and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
been trapped in there it'll come out and

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.400 
been trapped in there it'll come out and
these<00:03:13.980> aren't<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:14.460> greasy<00:03:14.910> as<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.330> think<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
these aren't as greasy as you think the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.470 
these aren't as greasy as you think the
egg<00:03:16.680> there's<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.130> really<00:03:17.430> good<00:03:17.850> job<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.240> sealing

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
egg there's a really good job of sealing

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.060 
egg there's a really good job of sealing
off<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.870> shell<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.320> there<00:03:19.440> isn't<00:03:19.650> much<00:03:19.830> oil

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
off the shell so there isn't much oil

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.910 
off the shell so there isn't much oil
that<00:03:20.280> gets<00:03:20.460> inside<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.350> then<00:03:22.350> serve<00:03:22.710> your

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
that gets inside and then serve your

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.680 
that gets inside and then serve your
shells<00:03:23.190> over<00:03:23.640> top<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.090> marinara<00:03:24.480> sauce

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
shells over top of the marinara sauce

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.990 
shells over top of the marinara sauce
this<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.500> quite<00:03:26.070> tasty<00:03:26.340> dinner<00:03:26.760> it's

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
this is quite tasty dinner it's

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.300 
this is quite tasty dinner it's
