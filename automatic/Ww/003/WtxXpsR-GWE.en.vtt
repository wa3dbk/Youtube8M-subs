00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
of our incredible race cars okay so here

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.460 
of our incredible race cars okay so here
we<00:00:12.719> have<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.370> mp4<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.509> McLaren<00:00:16.020> project

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
we have the mp4 one the McLaren project

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.730 
we have the mp4 one the McLaren project
for<00:00:16.710> chassis<00:00:17.279> number<00:00:17.520> one<00:00:17.699> from<00:00:18.140> 1981<00:00:19.140> now

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
for chassis number one from 1981 now

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.950 
for chassis number one from 1981 now
simply<00:00:20.100> put<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.000> biggest<00:00:21.539> leap<00:00:21.750> in

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
simply put this is the biggest leap in

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.439 
simply put this is the biggest leap in
technology<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.800> safety<00:00:23.250> within<00:00:23.760> Formula<00:00:24.330> One

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
first carbon fiber chassis which is a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.690 
first carbon fiber chassis which is a
massive<00:00:29.970> part<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.359> our<00:00:30.929> story<00:00:31.500> not<00:00:32.219> only<00:00:32.279> was

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
massive part of our story not only was

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.069 
massive part of our story not only was
it<00:00:32.730> better<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.239> performance<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.870> was

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
it better for performance it was

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.470 
it better for performance it was
stronger<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.250> more<00:00:35.460> lightweight<00:00:35.760> but

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
stronger it was more lightweight but

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.840 
stronger it was more lightweight but
more<00:00:36.660> importantly<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.710> incredibly<00:00:38.610> safe

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
more importantly it was incredibly safe

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.850 
more importantly it was incredibly safe
now<00:00:39.570> if<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:39.989> look<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.410> inside<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
now if you just look on the inside of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.440 
now if you just look on the inside of
the<00:00:41.100> car<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.760> carbon<00:00:42.210> fiber

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
rolled aluminium and the torsional

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.450 
rolled aluminium and the torsional
rigidity<00:00:54.379> wasn't<00:00:55.379> great<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.190> when<00:00:56.340> you're

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
rigidity wasn't great so when you're

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
rigidity wasn't great so when you're
pushing<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> throttle<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> cars<00:00:57.840> often

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
pushing on the throttle the cars often

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.349 
pushing on the throttle the cars often
suffered<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.829> lot<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.340> twists<00:00:59.670> this

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
suffered a lot of twists this

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.840 
suffered a lot of twists this
practically<00:01:00.989> eliminated<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.980> twist<00:01:02.309> because

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
practically eliminated the twist because

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.570 
practically eliminated the twist because
for<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.239> equivalent<00:01:03.750> weight<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.199> aluminium

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
for the equivalent weight of aluminium

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.899 
for the equivalent weight of aluminium
carbon<00:01:05.580> fiber<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.060> five<00:01:06.630> times<00:01:07.080> stronger

there<00:01:08.909> were<00:01:09.000> critics<00:01:09.450> however<00:01:09.810> people

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
there were critics however people

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
there were critics however people
