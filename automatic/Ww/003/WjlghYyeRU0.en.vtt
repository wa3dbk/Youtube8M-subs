00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
about the pumpkin block in Minecraft it

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.120 
about the pumpkin block in Minecraft it
has<00:00:27.189> more<00:00:27.490> uses<00:00:28.060> than<00:00:28.329> any<00:00:29.050> other<00:00:29.380> block<00:00:29.829> that

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
has more uses than any other block that

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.490 
has more uses than any other block that
I<00:00:30.189> can<00:00:30.519> think<00:00:30.699> of<00:00:30.939> most<00:00:31.510> blocks<00:00:31.750> have<00:00:32.019> like<00:00:32.199> one

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
I can think of most blocks have like one

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.840 
I can think of most blocks have like one
or<00:00:32.650> two<00:00:32.680> things<00:00:33.040> they<00:00:33.190> can<00:00:33.370> do<00:00:33.489> but<00:00:33.730> the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
or two things they can do but the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.900 
or two things they can do but the
pumpkin<00:00:34.330> has<00:00:34.720> tons<00:00:35.140> so<00:00:35.890> let's<00:00:36.070> show<00:00:36.309> it<00:00:36.430> off<00:00:36.550> No

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
pumpkin has tons so let's show it off No

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.930 
pumpkin has tons so let's show it off No
so<00:00:37.120> first<00:00:37.420> pumpkins<00:00:38.350> will<00:00:38.620> spawn<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:39.040> random

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
so first pumpkins will spawn in random

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.259

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
seeds like I said before pumpkin seeds

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.649 
seeds like I said before pumpkin seeds
can<00:01:27.070> also<00:01:27.250> be<00:01:27.490> found<00:01:27.640> in<00:01:27.880> abandoned<00:01:28.630> mine

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
can also be found in abandoned mine

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.390 
can also be found in abandoned mine
shafts<00:01:29.110> now<00:01:29.650> let's<00:01:29.920> move<00:01:30.070> on<00:01:30.220> in<00:01:30.340> a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
shafts now let's move on in a

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.039 
shafts now let's move on in a
jack-o'-lantern<00:01:30.670> since<00:01:31.329> we<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:31.600> made<00:01:31.810> one

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
jack-o'-lantern since we just made one

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.950 
jack-o'-lantern since we just made one
they<00:01:32.530> emit<00:01:33.070> light<00:01:33.119> brighter<00:01:34.119> than<00:01:34.420> torches

they emit light brighter than torches

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.280 
they emit light brighter than torches
and<00:01:35.170> they<00:01:35.799> work<00:01:36.100> underwater<00:01:37.030> this<00:01:37.600> is<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.960> easy

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
and they work underwater this is a easy

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.990 
and they work underwater this is a easy
way<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.619> get<00:01:38.799> something<00:01:39.159> close<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.400> glowstone

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
way to get something close to glowstone

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.030 
way to get something close to glowstone
early<00:01:40.479> on<00:01:40.659> in<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.229> game<00:01:41.259> they<00:01:41.890> have<00:01:41.979> a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
early on in the game they have a

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.789 
early on in the game they have a
brightness<00:01:42.490> level<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.850> 15<00:01:43.570> which<00:01:43.899> is<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.439> same

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
brightness level of 15 which is the same

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.429 
brightness level of 15 which is the same
as<00:01:45.220> glowstone<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.000> those<00:01:46.689> see<00:01:46.869> beacons<00:01:47.259> which

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
as glowstone and those see beacons which

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.039 
as glowstone and those see beacons which
are<00:01:47.560> coming<00:01:47.740> up<00:01:47.890> in<00:01:48.070> 1.8<00:01:48.700> pushing<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.810> with<00:01:50.020> a

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
are coming up in 1.8 pushing it with a

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.100 
are coming up in 1.8 pushing it with a
piston<00:01:50.560> will<00:01:50.770> break<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.549> it<00:01:52.030> can<00:01:52.299> also<00:01:52.420> be<00:01:52.750> used

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
piston will break it it can also be used

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.469
