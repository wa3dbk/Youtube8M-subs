going up into the museum in two months
had<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> piece<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.880> up<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.180> Madison

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540

Square Park in New York which was the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
into SF MoMA this is a prototype also a

work in itself but a prototype
essentially<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.810> work<00:01:00.990> that<00:01:01.290> went<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.739> in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
essentially for the work that went up in

essentially for the work that went up in
Madison<00:01:02.160> Square<00:01:02.520> Park<00:01:03.110> but<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.260> actually

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
Madison Square Park but it's actually

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.500 
Madison Square Park but it's actually
pretty<00:01:04.949> similar<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> what's<00:01:05.730> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.120> be<00:01:06.330> at

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510

SF<00:01:06.870> MoMA<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.740> work<00:01:07.950> itself<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.400> very<00:01:08.670> abstract

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
SF MoMA the work itself is very abstract

SF MoMA the work itself is very abstract
as<00:01:09.480> you<00:01:09.690> can<00:01:09.870> probably<00:01:10.050> see<00:01:10.230> in<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.530> camera

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
as you can probably see in the camera

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
as you can probably see in the camera
you're<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.250> seeing<00:01:11.550> anything<00:01:11.850> behind<00:01:12.240> me

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you're not seeing anything behind me

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.380 
you're not seeing anything behind me
except<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:12.990> flashing<00:01:13.560> lights<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.150> need

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
except for flashing lights so you need

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.320 
except for flashing lights so you need
to<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> certain<00:01:15.990> distance<00:01:17.180> Madison<00:01:18.180> Square

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
to get a certain distance Madison Square

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.810 
to get a certain distance Madison Square
Park<00:01:18.510> we<00:01:18.750> had<00:01:18.869> light<00:01:19.229> bulbs<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.190> we<00:01:20.250> took<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
Park we had light bulbs and we took the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.960 
Park we had light bulbs and we took the
filament<00:01:21.360> out<00:01:21.560> for<00:01:22.560> power<00:01:22.710> reasons<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.790> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
filament out for power reasons this is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.160 
filament out for power reasons this is
kind<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> funnest<00:01:24.690> part<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
kind of the funnest part of the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530 
kind of the funnest part of the
sculpture<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.220> did<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.550> large<00:01:26.820> 50<00:01:27.300> foot

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
sculpture so we did this large 50 foot

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.660 
sculpture so we did this large 50 foot
by<00:01:27.720> 20<00:01:28.080> foot<00:01:28.229> by<00:01:28.440> twenty<00:01:28.650> foot<00:01:28.890> sculpture<00:01:29.400> with

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
by 20 foot by twenty foot sculpture with

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.930 
by 20 foot by twenty foot sculpture with
sixteen<00:01:30.630> hundred<00:01:31.050> light<00:01:31.410> bulbs<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:32.040> drew

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
sixteen hundred light bulbs that drew

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.600 
sixteen hundred light bulbs that drew
less<00:01:33.240> power<00:01:33.509> than<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.050> toaster<00:01:34.310> because<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.430> did

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
less power than a toaster because we did

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.109 
less power than a toaster because we did
it<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:36.030> LEDs<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.130> at<00:01:38.310> SFMOMA<00:01:38.670> is

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it with LEDs so the one at SFMOMA is

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.520 
it with LEDs so the one at SFMOMA is
actually<00:01:39.390> gonna<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.690> a<00:01:39.720> lot<00:01:39.930> more<00:01:39.960> twice<00:01:40.350> as

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
actually gonna have a lot more twice as

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.800 
actually gonna have a lot more twice as
many<00:01:40.710> pixels<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.550> have<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.670> think

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
many pixels it's going to have I think

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.590 
many pixels it's going to have I think
3,200<00:01:42.810> pixels<00:01:43.230> and<00:01:43.500> they'll<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.860> bright<00:01:44.600> you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
3,200 pixels and they'll be bright you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
3,200 pixels and they'll be bright you
have<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.930> notion<00:01:46.230> of<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.830> pixel<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.340> pixels

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
have this notion of a pixel but pixels

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.910 
have this notion of a pixel but pixels
don't<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:48.120> a<00:01:48.150> look<00:01:48.510> so<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.740> represent

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
don't have a look so you can represent

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.830 
don't have a look so you can represent
it<00:01:50.340> any<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.300> represent<00:01:51.480> as

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
it any way you want it can represent as

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.080 
it any way you want it can represent as
a<00:01:51.930> square<00:01:52.290> or<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> circle<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.460> however<00:01:53.730> you<00:01:53.940> want

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
a square or a circle or however you want

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
a square or a circle or however you want
to<00:01:54.120> represent<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.650> looked<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:56.130> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
to represent it if you looked at this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.810 
to represent it if you looked at this
work<00:01:56.700> from<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.540> hundred<00:01:58.500> feet<00:01:58.680> away<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.610> would

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
work from a hundred feet away it would

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.580 
work from a hundred feet away it would
look<00:01:59.970> like<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.630> perfectly<00:02:01.320> flat

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
look like a perfectly flat

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.250 
look like a perfectly flat
two-dimensional<00:02:02.130> grid<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.780> essentially

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
two-dimensional grid so it's essentially

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.320 
two-dimensional grid so it's essentially
a<00:02:04.290> 2d<00:02:04.710> image<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.250> stretched<00:02:05.550> into<00:02:05.850> three

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
a 2d image that's stretched into three

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.979 
a 2d image that's stretched into three
dimensions<00:02:07.489> the<00:02:08.489> different<00:02:09.360> thing<00:02:09.570> about<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
dimensions the different thing about it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.690 
dimensions the different thing about it
relative<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.560> all<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.769> 3d<00:02:11.160> works<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.580> I've

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
relative to all the 3d works that I've

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
relative to all the 3d works that I've
seen<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.030> you'll<00:02:12.239> first<00:02:12.510> see<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.780> from<00:02:13.019> below

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
seen is you'll first see it from below

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.550 
seen is you'll first see it from below
before<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.610> from<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.880> side<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:16.260> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
before you see it from the side so it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.740 
before you see it from the side so it
will<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.890> abstract<00:02:17.459> until<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.090> actually<00:02:18.299> see

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
will be abstract until you actually see

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.420 
will be abstract until you actually see
it<00:02:18.870> from<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.290> first<00:02:19.530> balcony<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.190> the

it from the first balcony of the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.970 
it from the first balcony of the
staircase<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.330> then<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.470> image<00:02:22.799> will

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
staircase and then the image will

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.000 
staircase and then the image will
hopefully<00:02:23.190> at<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.640> point<00:02:23.880> be<00:02:24.180> clear<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
hopefully at that point be clear the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.820 
hopefully at that point be clear the
most<00:02:26.310> important<00:02:26.910> aspect<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.019> all<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.709> these

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
most important aspect of all of these

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.310 
most important aspect of all of these
works<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:30.060> fact<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.600> they're<00:02:30.780> readable

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
works is the fact that they're readable

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.970 
works is the fact that they're readable
by<00:02:31.530> people<00:02:32.390> because<00:02:33.390> they<00:02:33.660> move<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.799> all

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
by people because they move so it's all

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.759 
by people because they move so it's all
about<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.370> movements<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.320> mean<00:02:37.320> they<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.620> go

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
about the movements I mean they can go

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.600 
about the movements I mean they can go
in<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.160> out<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.580> being<00:02:38.760> recognized<00:02:39.470> as<00:02:40.610> people

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
in and out of being recognized as people

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.290 
in and out of being recognized as people
just<00:02:42.390> by<00:02:42.570> them<00:02:43.170> stopping

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.690 

it's<00:02:48.300> all<00:02:48.510> about<00:02:48.840> kind<00:02:49.409> of<00:02:49.590> primal<00:02:50.069> perception

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
it's all about kind of primal perception

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.509 
it's all about kind of primal perception
and<00:02:51.560> creating<00:02:52.560> an<00:02:52.680> image<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.250> somehow

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
and creating an image that somehow

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.470 
and creating an image that somehow
clicks<00:02:54.000> into<00:02:54.569> us<00:02:55.730> recognizing<00:02:56.730> something

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
clicks into us recognizing something

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.080 
clicks into us recognizing something
without<00:02:57.900> even<00:02:58.230> really<00:02:58.470> imaging<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.940> just

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
without even really imaging it we just

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.280 
without even really imaging it we just
kind<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.420> feel<00:03:00.629> it<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:02.900> that's<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.049> challenge

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
kind of feel it and that's the challenge

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.740 
kind of feel it and that's the challenge
I<00:03:04.650> think

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.810
