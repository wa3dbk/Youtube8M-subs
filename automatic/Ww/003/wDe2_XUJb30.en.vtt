using an LG tone I think the 730 HBS 730
headphones<00:00:34.679> before<00:00:34.940> had<00:00:35.940> those<00:00:36.089> for<00:00:36.269> about

however<00:00:47.210> after<00:00:48.210> kind<00:00:48.749> of<00:00:48.899> pairing<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.649> up

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
however after kind of pairing this up

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.020 
however after kind of pairing this up
with<00:00:50.069> my<00:00:50.510> android<00:00:51.510> phone<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.409> android

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
with my android phone and my android

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.520 
with my android phone and my android
watch<00:00:54.030> phone<00:00:55.729> there's<00:00:56.729> quite<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.089> bit<00:00:57.359> of<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
watch phone there's quite a bit of I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.180 
watch phone there's quite a bit of I
guess<00:00:59.280> stuttering<00:00:59.999> and<00:01:00.469> a<00:01:01.469> bad<00:01:01.829> connection

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
guess stuttering and a bad connection

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.780 
guess stuttering and a bad connection
between<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.989> device<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.790> Bluetooth

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
between the device and the Bluetooth

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.819 
between the device and the Bluetooth
headphones<00:01:06.649> so<00:01:07.649> I'll<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.890> listening<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
headphones so I'll be listening and

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.539 
headphones so I'll be listening and
it'll<00:01:10.829> just<00:01:11.040> cut<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.719> music

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
it'll just cut in and out of the music

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.639 
it'll just cut in and out of the music
multiple<00:01:14.549> times<00:01:14.790> even<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
multiple times even when I have the

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.670 
multiple times even when I have the
phone<00:01:17.399> or<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.090> watch<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.930> next<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
phone or my watch right next to the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.029 
phone or my watch right next to the
actual<00:01:20.360> earphones<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.289> would<00:01:22.770> say<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
actual earphones to so I would say the

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.060 
actual earphones to so I would say the
range<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.549> these<00:01:23.670> things<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.380> pretty<00:01:25.380> abysmal

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
range on these things are pretty abysmal

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.359 
range on these things are pretty abysmal
and<00:01:26.579> it's<00:01:27.329> unfortunate<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.079> they<00:01:29.009> are

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and it's unfortunate because they are

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.499 
and it's unfortunate because they are
great<00:01:29.640> headphones<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:32.060> they<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.240> need<00:01:33.390> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
great headphones but they just need to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.020 
great headphones but they just need to
figure<00:01:33.960> out<00:01:34.079> how<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> make<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> better<00:01:35.579> antenna

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
figure out how to make a better antenna

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.469 
figure out how to make a better antenna
I<00:01:36.149> guess<00:01:36.359> and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.859> next<00:01:38.130> point<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
I guess and then the next point is the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.740 
I guess and then the next point is the
battery<00:01:40.170> life<00:01:40.289> on<00:01:40.680> these<00:01:40.829> things<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.820> when<00:01:42.719> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
battery life on these things so when I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.139 
battery life on these things so when I
got<00:01:42.960> them<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.619> lasted<00:01:44.280> maybe<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.850> six

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
got them they lasted maybe about six

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.990 
got them they lasted maybe about six
hours<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.979> then<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> charged<00:01:47.460> them<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
hours and then I charged them up and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.340 
hours and then I charged them up and
then<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.179> use<00:01:48.359> them<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.600> next<00:01:48.719> day

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
then I use them the next day

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.730 
then I use them the next day
and<00:01:50.659> then<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.810> thing<00:01:51.990> kept<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.380> telling<00:01:52.649> me

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and then this thing kept on telling me

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.580 
and then this thing kept on telling me
that<00:01:52.920> battery<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.820> low<00:01:53.850> even<00:01:54.810> though<00:01:54.929> I<00:01:55.049> just

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that battery was low even though I just

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.240 
that battery was low even though I just
charged<00:01:56.280> them<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.479> after<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.899> happened

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
charged them so after that happened

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.450 
charged them so after that happened
was<00:01:59.820> kind<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.150> annoyed<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.370> like

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
was kind of annoyed because I was like

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.850 
was kind of annoyed because I was like
oh<00:02:02.580> great<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.120> have<00:02:03.300> no<00:02:03.420> music<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.530> work<00:02:04.650> out

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
oh great now I have no music to work out

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.560 
oh great now I have no music to work out
with

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
with

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.930 
with
so<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:07.039> basically<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.520> turned<00:02:08.789> off

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
so I basically they turned off

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.060 
so I basically they turned off
automatically<00:02:09.539> there's<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.350> person<00:02:10.710> that<00:02:10.860> says

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
automatically there's a person that says

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.170 
automatically there's a person that says
goodbye<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:12.030> something<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
goodbye or something like that in the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.050 
goodbye or something like that in the
headphones<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.990> hear<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.520> then<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.880> was

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
headphones that you hear and then I was

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.520 
headphones that you hear and then I was
like<00:02:18.150> whoa<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.360> doesn't<00:02:18.810> make<00:02:19.020> any<00:02:19.200> sense<00:02:19.350> to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
like whoa this doesn't make any sense to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.230 
like whoa this doesn't make any sense to
me<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.770> let<00:02:19.950> me<00:02:20.040> try<00:02:20.190> turning<00:02:20.400> these<00:02:20.790> back<00:02:21.060> on

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
me so let me try turning these back on

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.870 
me so let me try turning these back on
and<00:02:22.010> after<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.070> did<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.400> they<00:02:23.670> actually

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
and after I did that they actually

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.180 
and after I did that they actually
worked<00:02:24.270> perfectly<00:02:24.690> fine<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:24.990> there<00:02:25.920> seems<00:02:26.100> to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
worked perfectly fine so there seems to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.960 
worked perfectly fine so there seems to
be<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.580> glitch<00:02:26.910> or<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.240> software<00:02:27.780> glitch

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
be like a glitch or a software glitch

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.970 
be like a glitch or a software glitch
that<00:02:29.970> doesn't<00:02:30.620> really<00:02:33.530> report<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> battery

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
that doesn't really report the battery

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.060 
that doesn't really report the battery
correctly<00:02:35.850> for<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.270> headphones<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:37.920> that

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
correctly for the headphones so if that

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.070 
correctly for the headphones so if that
happens<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> try<00:02:39.150> turning<00:02:39.209> them<00:02:39.660> back<00:02:39.690> on

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
happens to you try turning them back on

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.820 
happens to you try turning them back on
again<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.520> maybe<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.239> will<00:02:42.390> work<00:02:42.830> however

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
again and maybe that will work however

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
again and maybe that will work however
yesterday<00:02:44.370> when<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:44.940> use<00:02:45.270> these<00:02:45.510> again<00:02:46.850> they

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
yesterday when I use these again they

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.290 
yesterday when I use these again they
just<00:02:48.090> died<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.290> was<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:51.000> battery

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
just died and that was it so the battery

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.240 
just died and that was it so the battery
life<00:02:51.360> on<00:02:51.660> these<00:02:51.810> could<00:02:52.080> be<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.440> lot<00:02:52.739> better<00:02:52.770> but

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
life on these could be a lot better but

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.770 
life on these could be a lot better but
they're<00:02:53.430> not<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:54.890> next<00:02:55.890> thing<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.420> actual

they're not so next thing is the actual

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.860 
they're not so next thing is the actual
design<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.190> headphones<00:02:59.840> they<00:03:00.840> are<00:03:01.320> pretty

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
design of the headphones they are pretty

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.770

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
know I was reading other reviews and it

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.420 
know I was reading other reviews and it
seems<00:04:35.030> like<00:04:35.210> they<00:04:35.360> work<00:04:35.540> best<00:04:35.840> with<00:04:36.050> Apple<00:04:36.470> but

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
seems like they work best with Apple but

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.490 
seems like they work best with Apple but
for<00:04:37.610> Android<00:04:38.000> users<00:04:38.360> not<00:04:39.170> so<00:04:39.350> much<00:04:40.480> and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
for Android users not so much and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.800 
for Android users not so much and
another<00:04:42.500> annoyance<00:04:43.010> was<00:04:43.340> there<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.240> forward

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
another annoyance was there is a forward

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.470 
another annoyance was there is a forward
button<00:04:45.170> on<00:04:45.290> this<00:04:45.530> but<00:04:46.430> there's<00:04:46.640> not<00:04:46.790> a<00:04:46.850> back

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
button on this but there's not a back

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.830 
button on this but there's not a back
button<00:04:48.350> so<00:04:48.800> if<00:04:48.920> you<00:04:49.040> try<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.310> skip<00:04:49.670> skip<00:04:50.420> tracks

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
button so if you try to skip skip tracks

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.360 
button so if you try to skip skip tracks
forward<00:04:51.380> works<00:04:52.280> perfectly<00:04:52.910> fine<00:04:53.800> but<00:04:54.800> if<00:04:55.160> you

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
forward works perfectly fine but if you
