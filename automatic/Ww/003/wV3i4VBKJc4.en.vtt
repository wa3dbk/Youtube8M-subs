00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello friends welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.339
 video tutorial 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.820
 today we will talk about tablets of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.550
 chocolate 39 death but we'll talk 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.309
 of graphics tablets see some 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.830
 useful tips to make the best use 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.140
 a graphics tablet but what is it for 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 a graphic tablet my friend lives 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.859
 the tablet says quickly indeed 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.369
 allows private resignations that parma 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.050
 after 5 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.880
 currently the favelas that are delicate 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.710
 especially good design artists dad me 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.750
 sees the fact the treaty clear then 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.420
 graphic tablets are used 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.980
 to draw and retouch images 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.300
 so far easy no 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.250
 no, because drawing with a tablet 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.200
 graphic is not easy at all 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.570
 first of all we have to get used to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.670
 look at the hand when drawing e 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 learn to look at the screen instead 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.739
 then you have to constantly resize 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.680
 the stretch seen that the space of one 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.120
 tablet is lower than that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 of a digital sheet 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.020
 in short, a mess and we did then 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.359
 let's throw in the towel 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.299
 absolutely not like for all things 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.869
 even digital design requires a lot 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.340
 lots and lots of lots and lots of practice and 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.799
 some useful advice 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.170
 and here comes into play some videos 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.140
 tips I hope will help you 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.580
 speed up practice times are things 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.619
 that I tried on my skin 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.500
 in short, how it works maybe 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.780
 will work 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.150
 you but let the talk begin with 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.860
 advice number one use of the sock 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.800
 it can happen that your hand to face 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.170
 struggling to slip on the collection in 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.880
 this case or draw with your hand 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.100
 slightly raised 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.890
 I 've never been able to commit 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.360
 a glove so as to make the hand less 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.190
 adherent to the support since the glove 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.200
 limits to sensitivity 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.600
 The council is the crazy marinetta 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.060
 hare an old sock throw the part 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.979
 low and insert the top part into the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.220
 hand in this way the fingers will remain 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.820
 free and the hand loved us 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.830
 the tablet is important that you keep 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.690
 the graphics tablet perfectly in 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.910
 line with the screen 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.520
 if the tablet were crooked you could 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.590
 not be accurate the advice of 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 crazy puppet and to touch the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.790
 graphic tablet with both hands 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.920
 both with the drawing hand and with 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.709
 the other will have a perception 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.989
 tactile of the digital sheet 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.880
 I draw with my right hand while with 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.500
 the left touch the low angle a 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.980
 left of the tablet 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.020
 outline one of the most difficult things 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.740
 when drawing with a tablet 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.920
 graphic is your worst insecure hand 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.140
 like 3 May today if you have to do a 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.380
 long hatching don't do it at once 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.640
 alone but divide it in more time 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.770
 you will see that in this way the stroke 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.880
 the weak point will be safer 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.180
 try to understand what your point is 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.450
 those vertical lines are weak 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.110
 horizontal oblique ones discharged from 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.630
 Internet 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.150
 an image that has lines proof to 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.950
 trace the image and see which is the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.390
 your weak point 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.760
 I have difficulty with traits 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.459
 horizontal when you find your point 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.440
 weak army of exclusively on 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.440
 that will be your rock to overcome 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.700
 the program learns to use i 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.250
 photo editing programs 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.800
 if you are using photoshop try to understand 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.750
 good the concept of levels and learn 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.790
 use them to your advantage 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.380
 you want to do the drawing from a level 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.269
 draft opacifies the layer creates a 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.340
 new level and draw c above 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.980
 using the previous draft as 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.989
 reference remember to tick the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.970
 parameters for the sensitivity of punishment 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.709
 graphic in this way the stroke 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.080
 it will depend on the pressure you put 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.660
 on the tip if you find it difficult to 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.820
 draw a particular stretch test a 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.989
 rotate the image and see if you are 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.510
 mind 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.320
 often reflect the image to find out 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.290
 any imperfections learns to 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.870
 use the keyboard shortcuts 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.930
 remember that with or accented and accented 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.510
 zoom out increases the cursor with w 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.739
 call the magic wand with b 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.069
 the brush tool 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.039
 with the rubber with the g the bucket with 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:30.530
 controls z get back one step behind 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.330
 control alt and z around back more 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.330
 steps etcetera etc. 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.310
 well as last advice I can tell you 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.750
 that the goddess learning force is 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.940
 in the desire to do 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.380
 enjoy your little results e 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.509
 do not be discouraged if at the beginning i 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.949
 drawings will not be well remembered 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.050
 that the quality of a design is 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.270
 strictly proportionate to the time that 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.280
 you will therefore not devote to him 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.569
 hurry and you will see that you will soon get 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.729
 of the results 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.270
 be curious look at the tutorials on 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.270
 youtube 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.280
 look at my tutorials please ask me 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.440
 of the councils in my small one I will try of 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.110
 help you well the video is finished 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.740
 what greets you and also crazy puppet 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.740
