00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
 hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.700
 new police play 413 career mode 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.950
 after which the last game against 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.990
 tottenham goes on, yes 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.110
 Unfortunately unfortunately you have to move so 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.389
 say with the sprained knee three 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.039
 Weeks will be us one 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.140
 a little less seems lucky 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.840
 because in between is country break 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.269
 and therefore no league play of course 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.670
 we will thereby also the injury 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 not really for the country games 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.160
 nominated today it's against swansea 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.110
 including city ​​and west bridge 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.969
 also went on believe I was in the make up 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.540
 So there we have three games before 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.920
 us and see what happens first 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.079
 Of course it was careful in the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.739
 This time very interesting for us 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.100
 at liverpool among others the top 3 too 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.760
 3 or 4 3 was and also the second leg 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.129
 was no less uninteresting cc 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.789
 schmidt front of a storm peak for us 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.100
 then a good one and with lafer and otherwise 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.720
 he does not necessarily stay a big one 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.799
 change strategy behind the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.560
 lineup and at swansea city 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.670
 almost similar but not until the 18th 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 davide santon the 1 0 26 minutes for 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.729
 newcastle united and then holds 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.890
 until the break 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.360
 It certainly was not really that much 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.820
 Therefore a lot of offensive urge for 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.630
 neatly changed and 14 minutes before 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.829
 conclusion in the 63rd 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.689
 then come barth leather again 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.600
 defenders of smart city ​​and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.180
 make the thing purely for 1 1 and yes that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.210
 is only one point for both newcastle 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.920
 as well as for swansea city and this 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.880
 point is not really much 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.320
 but can run a little better 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.420
 well now next is the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.009
 transfer deadline day already existed 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.049
 some interesting transfers we are 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.950
 yes, also in this transfer period 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.560
 changed for 8 million 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 robin among others to his old ones 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.229
 employer so she shies back gomis 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.270
 may be to newcastle united 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.700
 come olympique lyon still has one 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.540
 little hope the latch 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.120
 push forward 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.100
 because 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.960
 you need another striker here 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.080
 and not necessarily especially if you are 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.850
 just take demba Papiss Cissé and 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.140
 just slip around a demba ba 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.230
 So it's a little bit over there 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.600
 very much and for electricity production 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.950
 also completely too much we are almost 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.070
 again fit so it's a bit 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.150
 faster than expected you give us 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.020
 even for the selection of the next 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.160
 play free make up well that's the same 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.290
 the next day 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.400
 Let's see if that's enough first 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.910
 Let's look at the transfer deadline 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.590
 day you have to say here to loans 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.560
 switches or other also switched on 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.420
 as well as gentleman abt there was 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.770
 already some transfers especially for 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.680
 also conducts an interesting transfer 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.940
 from the bundesliga out but also in 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.860
 ten here just switch to 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.020
 valencia 30 5 million 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.410
 So we already have some big ones 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.940
 transfers among others tom meanwhile 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.160
 checked a bit down though time 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.810
 8 million are there are the big ones 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.690
 of course buzz in the top transfers 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.739
 decide as any names too 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.180
 if the change directly to 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.650
 ligakonkurrenten was 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.060
 I'm curious how the way to 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.250
 first match equal to liverpool 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.890
 runs that I think there is the middle of the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.850
 season 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.320
 I think 26 Spielag so in the rotation 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.660
 more interesting transfers eder 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.959
 for example, to stoke city so the 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.160
 premier league continues to upgrade and 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.239
 Aston villa also offers shopping there 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.070
 But they can not really 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.750
 Shop properly because no stop 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.870
 they would like to have that 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.100
 Investors caught but how is there 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.910
 It is very likely to continue in 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.470
 the next one follows a bit further 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.140
 especially during the summer break 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.760
 Again Eduardo was guest feels 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.790
 just speaks though that's quite 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.950
 nice jelavic changed silvia so that 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.750
 is very interesting and yes a good one 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.030
 Unfortunately there is no message for us 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.540
 Fitness level of Zion is not really 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.760
 enough for the effect but for that 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.280
 this see again next panned for 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.739
 theres this time in the middle goes into the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.799
 Central Midfield and Ben Arfa's 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.509
 set is interesting midfield on 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.259
 each case only from 80 see already in the 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.150
 11 minutes the 1 0 in the 25 minute lays 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.970
 Ask for the first beautiful yellow 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.979
 card cashed and just before the 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.259
 Halftime in Nicosia of the decision 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.750
 makes that really enough for lafer 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.130
 not the 4 0 after there already seems 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.289
 That's why he's going to be decided 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.610
 already tested a bit so that's it 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.910
 No major departure of the power provider 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.380
 also makes the 15 15 finalScore 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.229
 greven from the opponent hurts normally 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.039
 but that would have done nothing anyway 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.509
 15 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.740
 strong start in any case and now 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.840
 it goes on I believe in 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.479
 quarter final round of last to be made 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.280
 the kick without something yes and we 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.130
 do not want to be spared at the 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.430
 defeat, perhaps, but looked 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.310
 For us there was the victory 15 0 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.479
 So that's pretty neat and me 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.710
 I hope that here on ours 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.830
 Stammplatz also a bit yes 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.690
 can maintain 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.510
 Of course I want to play in the 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.220
 next game and we are not for 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.570
 the national team is doing well now 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.510
 Of course I could not do any good 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.940
 show because we were injured 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.699
 arithmetically, tenth are just in the 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:42.760
 a few students but from the table 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.760
 box turned off and against newcastle 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:50.120
 unfortunately not against ex-post office boss 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.130
 play mario and play directly in 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.409
 the country break are still there 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.539
 Almost couple with the very whole 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.659
 quite early gate in the 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:02.659
 first but soon afterwards equal longplay 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.710
 4018 minute so that you want then 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.150
 Rip out a bit and 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.680
 maybe take it to a point 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.030
 until half past time then happens too 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.440
 not very much then in the second 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.169
 half 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.570
 this scene beginning phase of change 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:19.009
 Shaped his second goal makes in the 74 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.050
 and maybe he will as well 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.940
 come in out of a short 2 2 and made that 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.850
 again only one point for newcastle 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.740
 So hold it should be against 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.350
 wolverhampton run a little better 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.150
 and went to Hoffnungheim in the Europa-Pokal 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.410
 anyway and is watching 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.830
 probably again soon 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.130
 his 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.090
 one pushes oneself in the training and 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.860
 I would say we have to go 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.410
 look how it works if we are 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.550
 imposing in training now and that 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.500
 maybe we can play again 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.960
 right now we are a table and 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.910
 have seven points residue on one 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.840
 International playground it could 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.790
 take a little longer, causing serious 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.300
 It's 24 o'clock and I would say 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.830
 Otherwise, we follow at the next one and 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.120
 Let's see if we play then 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.120
 may be so until then
