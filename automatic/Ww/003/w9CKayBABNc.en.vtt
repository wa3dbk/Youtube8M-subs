00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.530
 hello you love today is about one 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.559
 delicious bratwurst pie let yourself 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.600
 just surprise what that is 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.090
 First we make the bratwurst places 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.050
 let's do the dough, we need it 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:24.279
 a little flour butter 1 egg some salt 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.439
 and water that will knead well 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.140
 exact ingredients the child yes meanwhile 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.470
 confess later on in youtube 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:41.320
 the infobox or you will find 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:42.520
 you in the recipe on www.aida.de so now 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.000
 The dough is again with the hands 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.580
 Kneaded after the machine has the ground 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.600
 did work 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.640
 if then a really nice 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.160
 supple dough is formed then 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.620
 he comes wrapped in fresh foil 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.050
 and allowed to rest for 20 minutes 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.509
 also shows up well and then 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.750
 as I said for about 20 minutes in 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.750
 the refrigerator 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.539
 while the dough in the fridge goes well 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.880
 So now it's the potatoes they need 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.909
 be peeled and cooked 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.350
 that will spare you we will show you 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.109
 then the same with the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.759
 mashed potatoes and the degree bit 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.759
 continues and also with the sauerkraut 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.159
 you see the potatoes are on 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.299
 in this little flag here in front 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.590
 we now have the thinnest garlic and 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.179
 onions we have already 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:47.789
 cut small and in the other 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:50.679
 wander our bratwurst and 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.969
 although we need about six to 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.909
 eight sausages 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.770
 it's also dependent on it like that 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.579
 but afterwards placed in the shape of the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.579
 be the same 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.950
 the roughly chopped onions and the fine ones 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:42.320
 chopped garlic just because now 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:44.270
 some butter soaked in the big one 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.819
 pan, we now give the sausages 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.560
 you just need to be seared 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.390
 So they do not need to be cooked 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.350
 will be the same year all the same 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.350
 in the oven us 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.560
 as much as he needs at the press now 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.560
 not to be done at all 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.880
 in the floskel of nebra 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.100
 there will be sauerkraut right now 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.740
 get done that 's just another 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.300
 a bit spiced with salt and pepper 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.070
 and once played through 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.200
 so they do not taste much more 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.760
 come and then it continues immediately 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.760
 shape with the ball 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:51.980
 so the potatoes are ready and now 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:54.599
 comes a little milk and 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.150
 then also a few flakes 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.560
 butter 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.599
 then there is an excellent one 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:08.690
 chapter 3 which we stood now so 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:10.560
 actually he mashed potatoes the 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.840
 potato porridge is now still 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.870
 tasted with a bit the nutmeg 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.720
 and salt and pepper oh so now 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.760
 I almost forgot that again 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:31.229
 potatoes were also bad of course 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:33.780
 the garlic steamed in onions like that 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.010
 So we go from the dough 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.949
 Fridge taken 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.340
 He had his rest time and have him 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.229
 is important in the springform distributed 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.599
 that we have a really nice high 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.020
 around 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.430
 he could also be around with him 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.410
 push up your fingers you can open 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.060
 Roll out the day before and clean 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.710
 we have expressed it now and 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.800
 this is actually going on 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.539
 this day always very good 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.550
 and then it goes on with the same 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.710
 potato porridge is now being filled 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.810
 but in the meantime you can do that 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.960
 oven already at 180 degrees 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.320
 preheat 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.750
 so now it goes further than 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.960
 First one fills a small situation now 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.210
 potato porridge in the springform quasi 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.220
 that we just covered the ground 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:29.280
 is so when the potato porridge is distributed 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:35.090
 then come line up the sausages 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.090
 they 're just well distributed all around 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.419
 and the bratwurst is coming now 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.340
 Sauerkraut 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.439
 you can then also the spaces between them 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.439
 between the rad box 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:08.530
 and as a conclusion story comes then 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:26.360
 again potato pulp on top 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:28.600
 as a lid so now that comes 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.750
 whole in the oven and 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.980
 got to 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:37.490
 at 180 degrees about 50 minutes 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.220
 It should be baked up afterwards 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.800
 Too dark then you have to go against it 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.750
 ten minutes before the end of the baking time above 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.470
 with aluminum foil or a baking paper 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.470
 cover
