00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
now it's kind of interesting how history

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.360 
now it's kind of interesting how history
works<00:00:13.200> because<00:00:13.679> when<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:13.920> first<00:00:14.130> started

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
works because when we first started

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.230 
works because when we first started
doing<00:00:14.429> c-sections

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
doing c-sections

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.630 
doing c-sections
there<00:00:15.719> was<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:15.929> mantra<00:00:16.500> once<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.250> c-section

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
there was this mantra once a c-section

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.000 
there was this mantra once a c-section
always<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> c-section<00:00:18.650> people<00:00:19.650> started<00:00:19.920> in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
always a c-section people started in

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.470 
always a c-section people started in
experimenting<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.939> safe<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.240> deliver

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
experimenting is it safe to deliver

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.179 
experimenting is it safe to deliver
vaginally<00:00:21.689> after<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> c-section<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.890> found<00:00:23.100> out

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
vaginally after a c-section we found out

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.490 
vaginally after a c-section we found out
that<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> actually<00:00:23.490> was<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.990> while<00:00:25.199> we

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
that it actually was and for a while we

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.589 
that it actually was and for a while we
were<00:00:25.590> pretty<00:00:26.039> much<00:00:26.210> insisting<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.330> people

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
were pretty much insisting that people

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.240 
were pretty much insisting that people
at<00:00:27.689> least<00:00:27.750> attempt<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.500> deliver<00:00:28.680> vaginal

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
at least attempt to deliver vaginal

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.679 
at least attempt to deliver vaginal
after<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> c-section

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
after a c-section

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.410 
after a c-section
well<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> pendulum<00:00:32.309> has<00:00:32.460> swung<00:00:32.489> again<00:00:33.149> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
well the pendulum has swung again and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.880 
well the pendulum has swung again and
unfortunately<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.230> opinion<00:00:34.530> has<00:00:34.680> swung

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
unfortunately in my opinion has swung

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.069 
unfortunately in my opinion has swung
too<00:00:35.070> far<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.120> now<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.390> most<00:00:36.570> communities

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
too far so that now in most communities

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.869 
too far so that now in most communities
for<00:00:37.260> instance<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> live<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.399> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
for instance the one that I live in that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.000 
for instance the one that I live in that
you<00:00:39.090> cannot<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> vaginal<00:00:40.350> birth<00:00:40.379> after<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you cannot have a vaginal birth after a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.790 
you cannot have a vaginal birth after a
c-section<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.780> reason<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.469> fairly

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
c-section and the reason is is fairly

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.090 
c-section and the reason is is fairly
complicated<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.789> some<00:00:45.270> ways<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.230> reality

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
complicated in some ways but in reality

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.240 
complicated in some ways but in reality
it<00:00:47.579> basically<00:00:47.940> boils<00:00:48.450> down<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:49.250> malpractice

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
it basically boils down to malpractice

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.660 
it basically boils down to malpractice
concerns<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.329> malpractice<00:00:52.050> insurance<00:00:52.739> what

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
concerns and malpractice insurance what

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.459 
concerns and malpractice insurance what

they're<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.670> willing<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.970> take<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
they're not willing to take the

they're not willing to take the
malpractice<00:01:46.020> liability<00:01:46.500> risk<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.729> they

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
malpractice liability risk and so they

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.510 
malpractice liability risk and so they
stopped<00:01:48.149> delivering<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:49.079> spivey<00:01:49.799> back<00:01:49.979> when

stopped delivering or spivey back when

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.910 
stopped delivering or spivey back when
hospitals<00:01:51.360> won't<00:01:51.840> offer<00:01:52.049> feedbacks<00:01:52.530> anymore

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
hospitals won't offer feedbacks anymore

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.670 
hospitals won't offer feedbacks anymore

having a c-section you can't do it at

having a c-section you can't do it at
our<00:02:00.090> Hospital<00:02:00.479> which<00:02:00.600> means<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.869> can't<00:02:01.229> have

our Hospital which means I can't have
you<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> patient<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.280> ultimately<00:02:03.090> you'd

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you as a patient and ultimately you'd

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.499 
you as a patient and ultimately you'd

of our County even that provides that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.309 
of our County even that provides that
service<00:02:09.030> my<00:02:09.629> opinion<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.080> very

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
service my opinion that's very

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.800 
service my opinion that's very
unfortunate<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.610> reality

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
unfortunate but it's the reality

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.960 
unfortunate but it's the reality
and<00:02:13.050> people<00:02:13.440> will<00:02:13.590> say<00:02:13.740> well<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.820> have

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.040 
a VBAC and I want to deliver at that
hospital<00:02:16.800> why<00:02:17.010> can't<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.580> my<00:02:18.360> explanation<00:02:18.930> is

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
hospital why can't I my explanation is

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.930 
hospital why can't I my explanation is
well<00:02:19.560> that's<00:02:19.650> sort<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.980> like<00:02:20.040> going<00:02:20.820> to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
well that's sort of like going to

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.700 
well that's sort of like going to
McDonald's<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.660> insisting<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.590> get

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
McDonald's and insisting that you get

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.530 
McDonald's and insisting that you get
pizza<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.730> know<00:02:23.760> what<00:02:24.000> you're<00:02:24.270> not<00:02:24.330> going<00:02:24.480> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
pizza you know what you're not going to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.850 
pizza you know what you're not going to
get<00:02:24.660> pizza<00:02:24.840> at<00:02:24.990> McDonald's<00:02:25.470> because<00:02:25.710> they

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
get pizza at McDonald's because they

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.770 
get pizza at McDonald's because they
don't<00:02:26.010> serve<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.150> our<00:02:27.270> hospital

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
don't serve it and so it our hospital

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.660 
don't serve it and so it our hospital
for<00:02:27.930> example<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.710> don't<00:02:28.890> offer<00:02:29.040> VBAC<00:02:29.490> so

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
for example we don't offer VBAC so

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.180 
for example we don't offer VBAC so
that's<00:02:29.820> not<00:02:29.970> something<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.840> have

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
that's not something that you can have

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.860 
that's not something that you can have
I'm<00:02:32.190> hoping<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.910> future<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.630> that's

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
I'm hoping in the future that that's

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.750 
I'm hoping in the future that that's
going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> change<00:02:34.350> it's<00:02:35.100> gonna<00:02:35.220> probably<00:02:35.490> take

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
going to change it's gonna probably take

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.240 
going to change it's gonna probably take
liability<00:02:36.540> reform<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.380> but

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
liability reform to do that but

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.800 
liability reform to do that but
unfortunately<00:02:38.820> that's<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.090> reality<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.600> we

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
unfortunately that's the reality that we

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.540 
unfortunately that's the reality that we
live<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.710> bottom<00:02:40.980> line<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.340> the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
live in and the bottom line is the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.570 
live in and the bottom line is the
hospital's<00:02:42.210> insurance<00:02:42.860> will<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:43.890> cover<00:02:44.070> them

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
hospital's insurance will not cover them

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.730 
hospital's insurance will not cover them
if<00:02:44.850> they<00:02:45.240> deliver<00:02:45.420> patients<00:02:46.080> vaginally<00:02:46.470> after

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
if they deliver patients vaginally after

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.960 
if they deliver patients vaginally after
c-section<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.370> therefore<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
c-section and therefore it's the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.850 
c-section and therefore it's the
hospital's<00:02:48.510> not<00:02:48.959> willing<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.320> take<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.530> risk

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
hospital's not willing to take that risk

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.260 
hospital's not willing to take that risk
and<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.550> that's<00:02:50.730> where<00:02:50.880> we<00:02:50.970> are<00:02:51.000> right<00:02:51.120> now

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
and so that's where we are right now

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.930 
and so that's where we are right now
with<00:02:51.830> c-sections<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.160> once<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:53.910> a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
with c-sections so that once you have a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.910 
with c-sections so that once you have a
c-section<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:54.630> most<00:02:54.930> communities<00:02:55.140> you're

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
c-section in most communities you're

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.140 
c-section in most communities you're
going<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.130> have<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.490> c-section<00:02:56.700> from

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
going to have to have a c-section from

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.400 
going to have to have a c-section from
then<00:02:57.300> on

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
then on

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.919 
then on
