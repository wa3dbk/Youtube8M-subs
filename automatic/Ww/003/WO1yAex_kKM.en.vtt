so he's driving the dark he will see
where<00:03:51.600> he's<00:03:51.750> going<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.260> deer<00:03:52.440> also<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.950> that

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
where he's going the deer also like that

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.190 
where he's going the deer also like that
too<00:03:53.340> because<00:03:53.730> then<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.420> deer<00:03:54.630> know<00:03:54.900> that

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
too because then the deer know that

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.319 
too because then the deer know that
you're<00:03:55.350> not<00:03:55.500> gonna<00:03:55.680> hit<00:03:55.890> them

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
you're not gonna hit them

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.369 
you're not gonna hit them
either<00:03:57.329> that<00:03:57.450> or<00:03:57.510> they'll<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.989> stand<00:03:58.290> there

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
either that or they'll just stand there

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.140 
either that or they'll just stand there
as<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.680> cars<00:03:58.890> coming<00:03:59.220> right<00:03:59.370> at<00:03:59.520> them<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.790> don't

some<00:04:16.560> controls<00:04:16.950> there<00:04:18.230> perhaps<00:04:19.230> this<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.650> like

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
some controls there perhaps this is like

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.440 
some controls there perhaps this is like
a<00:04:19.860> secret-agent<00:04:20.430> car<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.150> some<00:04:21.270> of<00:04:21.360> these

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
a secret-agent car that some of these

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.900 
a secret-agent car that some of these
buttons<00:04:21.780> would<00:04:21.989> activate<00:04:22.500> features<00:04:22.980> like<00:04:23.670> oil

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
buttons would activate features like oil

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.260 
buttons would activate features like oil
slick<00:04:24.470> that's<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.560> horrible<00:04:25.800> sound<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.400> oil

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
could be an injector seat this could

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.510 
could be an injector seat this could
maybe<00:04:35.280> turn<00:04:35.490> into<00:04:35.730> a<00:04:35.840> jet-powered<00:04:36.840> car<00:04:37.520> it

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
maybe turn into a jet-powered car it

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.780 
maybe turn into a jet-powered car it
rolls<00:04:38.940> very<00:04:39.270> easily<00:04:40.130> both<00:04:41.130> front<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.670> back

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
tires roll very very easily yeah it's a

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.310 
tires roll very very easily yeah it's a
fun<00:04:44.610> little<00:04:44.760> piece<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.750> thing<00:04:45.900> is<00:04:46.080> there's

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
fun little piece the thing is there's

fun little piece the thing is there's
not<00:04:46.410> enough<00:04:46.470> companies<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.370> think<00:04:47.580> that<00:04:47.760> are

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
not enough companies I think that are

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.840 
not enough companies I think that are
producing<00:04:48.690> vehicles<00:04:49.530> for<00:04:49.890> blind<00:04:50.220> bag<00:04:50.460> figures

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
producing vehicles for blind bag figures

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.520 
producing vehicles for blind bag figures
there<00:04:51.030> they<00:04:51.390> produce<00:04:51.540> via<00:04:51.870> they<00:04:52.110> produce<00:04:52.320> the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
there they produce via they produce the

there they produce via they produce the
blind<00:04:52.740> bag<00:04:52.920> figures<00:04:53.340> but<00:04:53.550> it's<00:04:53.700> nice<00:04:53.850> when<00:04:54.060> you

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090
