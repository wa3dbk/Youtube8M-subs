instead<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.990> mixer<00:01:48.500> because<00:01:48.680> mixers<00:01:49.250> are

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
instead of a mixer because mixers are

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.100 
instead of a mixer because mixers are
noisy<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.149> to<00:01:50.299> clean<00:01:50.479> them<00:01:50.659> after

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
that so it just bugs me to use them I

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.389 
that so it just bugs me to use them I
just<00:01:53.990> thought<00:01:54.170> what<00:01:54.469> I<00:01:54.500> need<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.860> crush<00:01:55.009> in<00:01:55.310> the

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
plastic bag and go over it with the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.410 
plastic bag and go over it with the
rolling<00:01:57.049> pin<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.619> dress<00:01:58.009> works<00:01:58.490> perfect<00:01:59.060> but

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
rolling pin and dress works perfect but

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:11.400
