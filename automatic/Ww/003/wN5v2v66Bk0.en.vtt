 let's start 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:25.100
 2 follow the rhythm and balance of form 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:29.299

 the double too much down balances 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:51.259
 rhythmically in a relaxed way for 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.039
 form a natural vibration the skewer 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.810
 It has been tested by scientific methods 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.280
 facilitates the circulation of elche up 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.009
 the tip of the fingers 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.649
 and since the fingers are related 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.770
 with the heart a complete

 this later 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.299
 now we slowly stop four abre
