00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.050 
the springtime we will turn all this
under<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.500> will<00:02:01.500> help<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:02.040> planting<00:02:02.490> new<00:02:02.670> new

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
under and will help be planting new new

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.760 
under and will help be planting new new
crops<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.750> knock<00:02:03.990> corn<00:02:04.320> we'll<00:02:04.590> wait

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
crops in here knock corn we'll wait

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.980 
crops in here knock corn we'll wait
another<00:02:05.159> four<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> five<00:02:06.240> years<00:02:06.479> before<00:02:06.840> we

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
another four to five years before we

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.650 
another four to five years before we
return<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.799> corn<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.280> rotate<00:02:09.270> our<00:02:09.300> crops

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
return here for corn we rotate our crops

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.930 
return here for corn we rotate our crops
it'll<00:02:10.530> probably<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.340> lot<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.610> beans<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.209> here

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
it'll probably be a lot of beans in here

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.630 
it'll probably be a lot of beans in here
because<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.840> like<00:02:13.990> beans<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.710> we<00:02:15.340> grow<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.550> lot

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
because I like beans and we grow a lot

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.490 
because I like beans and we grow a lot
of<00:02:15.880> them<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.240> maybe<00:02:16.360> some<00:02:16.630> sweet<00:02:16.840> potatoes<00:02:17.350> as

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
of them and maybe some sweet potatoes as

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.160 
of them and maybe some sweet potatoes as
well<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.740> keep<00:02:18.010> returning<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.520> them<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.210> at

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
well I keep returning to them and at

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.170 
well I keep returning to them and at
that<00:02:20.230> point<00:02:20.830> all<00:02:21.610> all<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.840> all<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:24.180> spiders

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
that point all all the all the spiders

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.140 
that point all all the all the spiders
that<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:25.890> overwintered<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.580> run<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.940> new

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
that have overwintered can run to a new

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.510 
that have overwintered can run to a new
place<00:02:28.390> they<00:02:29.020> can<00:02:29.080> recolonize<00:02:29.890> parts<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
place they can recolonize parts of the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.600 
place they can recolonize parts of the
farm<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.540> we've<00:02:31.900> retained<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.950> that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
farm and so we've retained that that

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.970 
farm and so we've retained that that
that<00:02:34.090> population<00:02:34.840> if<00:02:34.960> we<00:02:35.110> had<00:02:35.320> done<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.740> at

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
that population if we had done it at

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.040 
that population if we had done it at
this<00:02:36.400> time<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.820> year<00:02:36.880> this<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.750> time<00:02:38.020> of

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
this time of the year this is a time of

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.630 
this time of the year this is a time of
year<00:02:38.260> actually<00:02:38.440> when<00:02:38.740> they're<00:02:38.950> least<00:02:39.250> capable

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
year actually when they're least capable

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.780 
year actually when they're least capable
of<00:02:40.090> rebounding<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:41.340> with<00:02:42.340> those<00:02:42.460> spider

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
of rebounding and with those spider

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.570 
of rebounding and with those spider
colonies<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.810> least<00:02:44.710> ability<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.340> find

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
colonies have the least ability to find

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.150 
colonies have the least ability to find
me<00:02:45.790> quarters<00:02:46.270> like<00:02:46.780> us<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.770> don't<00:02:47.950> want<00:02:48.100> to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
me quarters like us you don't want to

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.530 
me quarters like us you don't want to
move<00:02:48.280> before<00:02:48.520> winter<00:02:49.000> because<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.330> got<00:02:49.420> all

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
move before winter because you got all

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.210 
move before winter because you got all
these<00:02:49.690> stuff<00:02:49.990> stored<00:02:50.320> up<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.740> got<00:02:50.890> your<00:02:51.010> food

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
these stuff stored up you got your food

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.420 
these stuff stored up you got your food
and<00:02:51.490> you're<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:52.150> nice<00:02:52.300> place<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.890> move<00:02:54.280> in

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
and you're in a nice place you move in

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.890 
and you're in a nice place you move in
the<00:02:54.520> springtime<00:02:55.920> better<00:02:56.920> time<00:02:57.220> that's<00:02:58.060> human

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
the springtime better time that's human

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.390 
the springtime better time that's human
instinct<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.740> it's<00:02:59.980> also<00:03:00.160> good<00:03:00.460> for<00:03:00.580> spiders

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
instinct and it's also good for spiders

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.630 
instinct and it's also good for spiders
okay<00:03:03.400> here<00:03:03.700> we<00:03:03.730> go

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640
