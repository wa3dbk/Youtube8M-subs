00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
they're doing on they don't getting the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.809 
they're doing on they don't getting the
stove<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.099> not<00:02:50.340> pulse<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:52.049> science<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.549> the

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
stove to not pulse is a science and the

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.110 
stove to not pulse is a science and the
beginning<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.359> that<00:02:54.510> science<00:02:55.079> is

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
beginning of that science is

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.490 
beginning of that science is
understanding<00:02:57.120> why<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.510> pulses<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.230> begin

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
understanding why it pulses to begin

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.149 
understanding why it pulses to begin
with<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.220> not<00:02:59.609> just<00:02:59.939> stabbing<00:03:00.329> in<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.659> dark

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
with and not just stabbing in the dark

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.460 
with and not just stabbing in the dark
actually<00:03:02.159> knowing<00:03:02.459> why<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:02.909> pulses<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.750> then

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
actually knowing why it pulses and then

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.000 
actually knowing why it pulses and then
designing<00:03:05.159> it<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.150> won't<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.680> far<00:03:07.980> I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
designing it so that it won't so far I

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.170 
designing it so that it won't so far I
don't<00:03:08.159> know<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> lot<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.790> people<00:03:08.879> that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
don't know a lot of people that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.050 
don't know a lot of people that
understand<00:03:09.750> why<00:03:09.989> soaps<00:03:10.470> pulse<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:13.879> think<00:03:14.879> I'm

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
understand why soaps pulse I think I'm

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.479 
understand why soaps pulse I think I'm
the<00:03:15.090> only<00:03:15.209> one<00:03:15.629> at<00:03:15.930> least<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:16.799> not<00:03:17.040> sure<00:03:17.310> but

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
the only one at least I I'm not sure but

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.280 
the only one at least I I'm not sure but
I<00:03:17.609> think<00:03:17.639> I<00:03:18.799> it's<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.950> little<00:03:20.189> complicated<00:03:20.549> but

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
I think I it's a little complicated but

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.449 
I think I it's a little complicated but
if<00:03:22.290> you're<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.709> right<00:03:22.859> place<00:03:22.920> at<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
if you're in the right place at the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.190 
if you're in the right place at the
right<00:03:23.579> time<00:03:23.760> when<00:03:24.480> you're<00:03:24.629> building<00:03:24.840> these

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
right time when you're building these

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.789 
right time when you're building these
and<00:03:25.439> testing<00:03:25.950> them<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:28.590> will<00:03:30.530> see<00:03:31.530> things

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
and testing them you will see things

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.839 
and testing them you will see things
happen<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.489> figure<00:03:32.879> it<00:03:32.970> out<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.989> took<00:03:34.319> me<00:03:34.849> five

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
happen and figure it out it took me five

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.210 
happen and figure it out it took me five
or<00:03:36.060> six<00:03:36.299> years<00:03:36.389> before<00:03:38.510> before<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.750> actually

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
or six years before before I actually

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.379 
or six years before before I actually
was<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> right<00:03:41.669> place<00:03:41.730> at<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.120> right<00:03:42.180> time

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
was in the right place at the right time

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.159 
was in the right place at the right time
and<00:03:42.989> saw<00:03:43.530> one<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.419> figured<00:03:45.419> out<00:03:45.540> why<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.900> was

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
and saw one and figured out why it was

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.729 
and saw one and figured out why it was
pulsing<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:48.690> was<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> happy<00:03:49.139> day<00:03:49.470> when<00:03:49.709> I

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
pulsing that was a happy day when I

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.559 
pulsing that was a happy day when I
actually<00:03:50.010> happened<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:50.639> be<00:03:50.730> right<00:03:51.030> there<00:03:51.269> just

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
actually happened to be right there just

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.080 
actually happened to be right there just
the<00:03:51.810> right<00:03:51.930> moment<00:03:52.199> to<00:03:52.650> see<00:03:53.400> what<00:03:53.579> was<00:03:53.730> going

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the right moment to see what was going

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.750 
the right moment to see what was going
on<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:56.540> see<00:03:57.540> one<00:03:57.720> pulse<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.489> once<00:03:59.489> you

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
on and see one pulse and once you

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.930 
on and see one pulse and once you
actually<00:03:59.970> see<00:04:00.540> one<00:04:00.780> pulse<00:04:01.169> with<00:04:02.010> no<00:04:02.190> pot<00:04:02.489> on<00:04:02.729> it

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
actually see one pulse with no pot on it

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.020 
actually see one pulse with no pot on it
then<00:04:03.629> you<00:04:03.780> understand<00:04:04.290> why<00:04:04.319> expulsion<00:04:04.979> or<00:04:05.879> you

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
then you understand why expulsion or you

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.729 
then you understand why expulsion or you
want<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.239> see<00:04:06.419> what<00:04:06.599> stands<00:04:06.959> was<00:04:07.079> going<00:04:07.379> on<00:04:07.500> and

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
want to see what stands was going on and

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.759 
want to see what stands was going on and
then<00:04:07.889> you<00:04:08.010> have<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.220> do<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> little<00:04:09.440> thinking<00:04:10.440> to

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
then you have to do a little thinking to

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.830 
then you have to do a little thinking to
figure<00:04:11.099> out<00:04:11.220> okay<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.180> happening<00:04:12.629> why

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
figure out okay this is happening why

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.539 
figure out okay this is happening why
well<00:04:14.000> it's<00:04:15.000> not<00:04:15.150> too<00:04:15.359> complicated<00:04:15.949> so<00:04:16.949> anyway

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
well it's not too complicated so anyway

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.180 
well it's not too complicated so anyway
I<00:04:17.760> have<00:04:18.150> about<00:04:18.449> this<00:04:18.930> they<00:04:19.440> wait<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.709> half<00:04:20.039> an

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
I have about this they wait a half an

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.469 
I have about this they wait a half an
ounce<00:04:20.630> roughly<00:04:22.340> have<00:04:23.340> all<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.669> pieces<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.120> the

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
ounce roughly have all the pieces of the

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.510 
ounce roughly have all the pieces of the
elite<00:04:25.199> to<00:04:25.440> black<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.919> ely<00:04:26.310> poor<00:04:26.610> black<00:04:26.909> bottom

elite to black I ely poor black bottom
but<00:04:29.520> they<00:04:29.669> are<00:04:29.789> a<00:04:29.820> little<00:04:29.970> bit<00:04:30.150> heavy<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.800> can

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
but they are a little bit heavy so I can

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:40.629 
but they are a little bit heavy so I can
even<00:04:32.460> call<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:35.630> bios<00:04:36.630> mini<00:04:38.150> bio<00:04:39.150> thigh<00:04:39.659> or

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
even call this a bios mini bio thigh or

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.129 
even call this a bios mini bio thigh or
I<00:04:41.639> can<00:04:42.090> call<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.479> elite<00:04:42.930> heavy<00:04:43.469> duty<00:04:44.870> or<00:04:45.870> in

oh<00:04:50.150> I'm<00:04:51.150> thinking<00:04:51.690> I'm<00:04:51.780> going<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.020> call<00:04:52.230> it<00:04:52.260> an

oh I'm thinking I'm going to call it an

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.940 
oh I'm thinking I'm going to call it an
elite<00:04:52.950> five<00:04:53.390> it<00:04:54.390> is<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.600> heavy-duty<00:04:55.080> version<00:04:55.830> of

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
elite five it is a heavy-duty version of

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.310 
elite five it is a heavy-duty version of
an<00:04:56.070> elite<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.640> actually<00:04:57.570> it's<00:04:57.720> smaller<00:04:58.140> than

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
an elite and actually it's smaller than

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.670 
an elite and actually it's smaller than
a<00:04:58.500> kneeling<00:04:58.980> although<00:04:59.310> its<00:04:59.460> credit<00:05:00.000> heavier

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
a kneeling although its credit heavier

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
bids on this to be real high because

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.880 
bids on this to be real high because
unlike<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.300> elites<00:05:22.020> made<00:05:22.290> from<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.620> soda

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
unlike the elites made from the soda

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.810 
unlike the elites made from the soda
cans<00:05:23.250> that<00:05:24.090> have<00:05:24.330> seven<00:05:25.220> annealing<00:05:26.220> steps<00:05:26.580> in

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
cans that have seven annealing steps in

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.470 
cans that have seven annealing steps in
them<00:05:27.350> these<00:05:28.350> are<00:05:28.410> fairly<00:05:28.980> easy<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.700> make<00:05:29.970> i<00:05:30.240> can

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
them these are fairly easy to make i can

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.970 
them these are fairly easy to make i can
make<00:05:30.630> one<00:05:30.840> of<00:05:30.930> these<00:05:31.050> in<00:05:31.680> just<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.580> few<00:05:32.790> minutes

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
make one of these in just a few minutes

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.980 
make one of these in just a few minutes
so<00:05:34.980> i<00:05:35.010> don't<00:05:35.430> expect<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.970> bids<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.450> be<00:05:36.570> really

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
so i don't expect the bids to be really

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.120
