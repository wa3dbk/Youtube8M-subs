I'm<00:00:04.500> going<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.680> preface<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:04.980> by<00:00:05.130> saying<00:00:05.250> that

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
I'm going to preface this by saying that

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.700 
I'm going to preface this by saying that
it's<00:00:05.910> not<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.450> XP<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.109> limits<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.529> in

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
it's not the XP that limits you in

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.049 
it's not the XP that limits you in
titanfall<00:00:08.040> it's<00:00:08.340> mostly<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.730> region

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
titanfall it's mostly the region

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.640 
titanfall it's mostly the region
requirements<00:00:09.660> every<00:00:10.110> generation<00:00:10.380> there<00:00:10.530> are

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
requirements every generation there are

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.350 
requirements every generation there are
certain<00:00:10.800> requirements<00:00:10.889> had<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.400> do<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.849> they

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
certain requirements had to do and they

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.480 
certain requirements had to do and they
get<00:00:12.509> more<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.139> more<00:00:13.170> difficult<00:00:13.710> as<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.099> rank

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
get more and more difficult as you rank

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.039 
get more and more difficult as you rank
up<00:00:14.610> through<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.910> generations<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.599> being

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
up through the generations that being

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.060 
up through the generations that being
said<00:00:16.170> first<00:00:16.410> i'ma<00:00:16.560> start<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.800> my<00:00:16.890> strategy

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
said first i'ma start with my strategy

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.950 
said first i'ma start with my strategy
for<00:00:17.310> just<00:00:17.940> getting<00:00:18.060> massive<00:00:18.420> amounts<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.660> XP

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
for just getting massive amounts of XP

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.240 
for just getting massive amounts of XP
really<00:00:19.199> quickly<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.650> then<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:20.010> going<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> go

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
really quickly and then I'm going to go

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.890 
really quickly and then I'm going to go
into<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.400> sort<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.640> general<00:00:20.699> tips<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.750> dealing

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
into a sort of general tips for dealing

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420 
into a sort of general tips for dealing
with<00:00:22.020> region<00:00:22.350> requirements<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.340> one

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
with region requirements so it's one

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.269 
with region requirements so it's one
basic<00:00:23.699> strategy<00:00:24.060> i<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.960> form<00:00:25.560> lots<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.010> XP

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
basic strategy i use to form lots of XP

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.710 
basic strategy i use to form lots of XP
in<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> short<00:00:26.849> amount<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.060> time<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.630> is

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
in a short amount of time and that is

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.839 
in a short amount of time and that is
basically<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.080> play<00:00:28.199> hard<00:00:28.439> point<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:29.130> camp<00:00:29.609> at

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
basically to play hard point you camp at

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
basically to play hard point you camp at
a<00:00:29.880> hard<00:00:30.269> point<00:00:30.390> location<00:00:30.840> preferably<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
a hard point location preferably you

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.620 
a hard point location preferably you
camp<00:00:31.769> with<00:00:32.009> your<00:00:32.189> titan<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.510> sort

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
camp with your titan and you just sort

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.709 
camp with your titan and you just sort
of<00:00:33.690> sit<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.399> you<00:00:35.399> farm<00:00:36.210> minions

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
of sit there and you farm minions

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
of sit there and you farm minions
because<00:00:37.559> they<00:00:37.649> give<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.890> extra<00:00:38.100> XP<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.730> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
because they give you extra XP if you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.639 
because they give you extra XP if you
are<00:00:39.059> sitting<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> hard<00:00:39.780> point<00:00:39.899> location<00:00:40.350> on

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
are sitting on a hard point location on

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.650 
are sitting on a hard point location on
top<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.040> i<00:00:41.100> usually<00:00:41.460> use<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.270> fast

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
top of that i usually use the fast

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
top of that i usually use the fast
learner<00:00:42.989> card<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> i<00:00:43.680> try<00:00:43.829> not<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.040> die<00:00:44.219> which

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
learner card and i try not to die which

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.819 
learner card and i try not to die which
is<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:45.719> dying<00:00:45.989> when<00:00:46.200> your<00:00:46.320> Titan<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> lot

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
is a not dying when your Titan is a lot

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.350 
is a not dying when your Titan is a lot
easier<00:00:46.980> than<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.640> dying<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:48.030> you're<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
easier than not dying when you're just a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.970 
easier than not dying when you're just a
pilot<00:00:48.660> now<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.079> some<00:00:49.260> hard<00:00:49.469> plant<00:00:49.620> locations

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
pilot now as some hard plant locations

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.619 
pilot now as some hard plant locations
in<00:00:50.070> some<00:00:50.250> maps<00:00:50.430> there's<00:00:50.820> really<00:00:51.120> obvious

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
in some maps there's really obvious

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.270 
in some maps there's really obvious
enemy<00:00:52.110> minion<00:00:52.410> spawns<00:00:52.710> coming<00:00:53.039> down<00:00:53.160> around

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
enemy minion spawns coming down around

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
enemy minion spawns coming down around
you<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.020> just

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you and what you can do is you can just

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.170 
you and what you can do is you can just
send<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.440> Titan<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> farm<00:00:56.760> those<00:00:56.940> minions

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
send your Titan and farm those minions

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.240 
send your Titan and farm those minions
bonds<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.809> come<00:00:57.960> down<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:59.039> drop

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
bonds as they come down so they drop

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.729 
bonds as they come down so they drop
down<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.030> kill<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:00.270> four<00:01:00.780> specters<00:01:01.469> or

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
down and you kill all four specters or

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.439 
down and you kill all four specters or
grunts<00:01:02.160> whatever<00:01:02.399> they<00:01:02.520> come<00:01:02.670> down<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> then

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
grunts whatever they come down and then

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.759 
grunts whatever they come down and then
then<00:01:03.629> say<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.930> 20<00:01:04.140> seconds<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.559> more

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
then say like 20 seconds that are more

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.649 
then say like 20 seconds that are more
minions<00:01:05.159> come<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.700> farming<00:01:06.090> minions<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.420> much

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
minions come now farming minions is much

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.789 
minions come now farming minions is much
easier<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.990> hard<00:01:07.200> point<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:07.680> not

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
easier and hard point because you're not

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.320 
easier and hard point because you're not
competing<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:08.460> other<00:01:08.700> people<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.090> minion

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
competing with other people for minion

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.550 
competing with other people for minion
kills<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:09.990> good<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.409> not

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
kills and this is good because you not

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.899 
kills and this is good because you not
only<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.920> minion<00:01:11.220> kills<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.549> extra<00:01:11.760> XP

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
only for minion kills for extra XP

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.460 
only for minion kills for extra XP
because<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> also<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.720> minion<00:01:12.990> kills<00:01:13.110> four

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
because you also for minion kills four
