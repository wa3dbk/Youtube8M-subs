for sensitive skin but it works fine

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.200 
for sensitive skin but it works fine
also<00:06:13.470> from<00:06:13.650> my<00:06:13.830> skin<00:06:14.220> first<00:06:14.610> time<00:06:14.789> I<00:06:14.820> was<00:06:15.000> about

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
also from my skin first time I was about

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.150 
also from my skin first time I was about
to<00:06:15.450> use<00:06:15.630> oil<00:06:15.990> on<00:06:16.229> my<00:06:16.380> skin<00:06:16.410> I<00:06:16.740> was<00:06:16.830> really

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
to use oil on my skin I was really

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.550 
to use oil on my skin I was really
scared<00:06:17.490> that<00:06:18.150> my<00:06:18.330> skin<00:06:18.660> would<00:06:18.810> be<00:06:18.990> very<00:06:19.260> oily

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
scared that my skin would be very oily

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
scared that my skin would be very oily
and<00:06:20.010> actually<00:06:21.000> it<00:06:21.120> wasn't<00:06:21.360> at<00:06:21.720> all<00:06:21.900> I<00:06:22.590> don't

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
and actually it wasn't at all I don't

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.969 
and actually it wasn't at all I don't
know<00:06:23.810> it's<00:06:24.810> like<00:06:25.050> when<00:06:25.110> you<00:06:25.440> provide<00:06:25.680> your

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
know it's like when you provide your

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.850 
know it's like when you provide your
skin<00:06:26.130> with<00:06:26.280> that<00:06:27.000> much<00:06:27.180> that<00:06:27.660> oil<00:06:27.960> it<00:06:28.470> just

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
skin with that much that oil it just

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.790 
skin with that much that oil it just
doesn't<00:06:29.070> produce<00:06:29.430> it<00:06:29.789> as<00:06:30.030> much<00:06:30.720> as<00:06:31.380> it<00:06:31.620> would

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
doesn't produce it as much as it would

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.880 
doesn't produce it as much as it would
if<00:06:32.160> it<00:06:32.669> would<00:06:32.820> need<00:06:33.030> it<00:06:33.240> an<00:06:33.479> orphan<00:06:34.110> if<00:06:34.770> it

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
if it would need it an orphan if it

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.610 
if it would need it an orphan if it
makes<00:06:35.070> sense<00:06:35.280> anyway<00:06:36.210> the<00:06:36.750> skin<00:06:36.990> is<00:06:37.140> not

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
makes sense anyway the skin is not

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.340 
makes sense anyway the skin is not
but<00:06:38.310> it's<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:39.090> best<00:06:39.120> ways<00:06:39.510> to<00:06:39.540> applied<00:06:40.020> during

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350
