00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.560
 iron 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.099
 Caracas 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.870
 there are welcome ways are some videos 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.490
 great of that we are here a 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.129
 new way and how they will have seen in the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.710
 title this way of seeing when 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.380
 all credits to the doctor the blue and 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.050
 ian extra good because they are the creators 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.059
 of this fabulous mold nothing although it is not 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.099
 like the previous ones previous 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:31.130
 versions but that is a map more 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.170
 limited to the level but they did it as 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.329
 that for concentration when we go to 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.910
 need 10 auxiliary blocks and a 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.739
 Click on steel or a good lighter 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.489
 to build the portal we are going to do it 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.100
 of three base 123 here good now 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.140
 let's do the laterals that would be 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.019
 three up we're going to put here 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.550
 three and the last one that gets and stays 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.019
 something real is still fish but 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.289
 well they are at least let us 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.780
 leads to the portal or to the cne it does not matter 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.489
 we are going to touch the block here 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.499
 from below like the swindon steel is going 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.850
 to take a little bit some you can 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.740
 grow up others can grab us 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.240
 then there it depends on your device 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:17.189
 as he says welcome when denying 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 and we are here here is the good black 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.250
 Well, here it's like a quarter of nine 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 long and good, well, that's great 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.149
 that they give us what they can say 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.330
 kits for example here as you see give us 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.140
 this good I do not know what it's called has been 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.149
 forgotten 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.650
 no, they give us what would be ton balloons 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:42.590
 by the brou sexton i never break 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.990
 what else these blocks of good for this 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.360
 I think I did not forget what it's called 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.640
 strange and steaks good this one this 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.710
 is not made for us to see in a 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.540
 we come with him and his lady and 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.270
 all that is what is difficult 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.310
 build on the portal then it's like 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.620
 that in a series we come to tend to 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.180
 collect these elements and well then 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.760
 to go again to the world where 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.350
 we were to play again and 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.900
 it's going to look like we 're dying we're going to 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.300
 give respawn and we will appear again 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.830
 in the place where we were good then 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.290
 this is one of the bugs that has to 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.630
 sometimes you will leave this as 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.400
 this stone of the end and good then in 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.590
 other times it does not come out but appears 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.830
 normally in the one where you started 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.720
 play where eln class was important 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.250
 and well, that's all so good 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.110
 I hope you liked the no way 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.150
