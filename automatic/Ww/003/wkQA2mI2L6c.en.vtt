I'm here with Mark Nelson of Rio Grande

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.860 
I'm here with Mark Nelson of Rio Grande
and<00:00:02.370> we're<00:00:02.700> talking<00:00:02.850> about<00:00:03.120> taking<00:00:03.540> things<00:00:03.720> to

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
and we're talking about taking things to

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.599 
and we're talking about taking things to
the<00:00:03.929> next<00:00:04.020> level<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:04.680> one<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.250> those<00:00:05.370> things

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
the next level and one of those things

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.290 
the next level and one of those things
would<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:06.230> creating<00:00:07.230> every<00:00:07.890> component<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.670> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
would be creating every component of a

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.780 
would be creating every component of a
piece<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.469> instance<00:00:10.830> creating<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.429> necklace

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
piece for instance creating the necklace

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.400 
piece for instance creating the necklace
creating<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.870> other<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.380> know

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
creating all of the other you know

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.160 
creating all of the other you know
dangling<00:00:14.040> components<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.910> needs<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.450> let's

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
dangling components and needs and let's

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
dangling components and needs and let's
talk<00:00:16.289> about<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.710> okay<00:00:17.100> well<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.029> create

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
talk about that okay well you can create

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.790 
talk about that okay well you can create
some<00:00:18.449> really<00:00:18.570> fascinating<00:00:18.840> little<00:00:19.320> elements

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
some really fascinating little elements

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.160 
some really fascinating little elements
just<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.430> some<00:00:20.580> wire<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> hammer<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
just with some wire a hammer and a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.810 
just with some wire a hammer and a
little<00:00:22.380> block<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.699> right

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
little block and you can see it right

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.160 
little block and you can see it right
here<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.119> necklace<00:00:24.390> how<00:00:24.660> pretty<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.019> is

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
here on that necklace how pretty that is

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.390 
here on that necklace how pretty that is
and<00:00:25.470> that's<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:25.769> we're<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> work<00:00:26.220> on

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and that's what we're going to work on

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.189 
and that's what we're going to work on
right<00:00:26.609> now<00:00:26.640> we'll<00:00:27.570> start<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.960> you're<00:00:28.080> going

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
right now we'll start with you're going

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.290 
right now we'll start with you're going
to<00:00:28.289> start<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.650> neck<00:00:28.830> wire<00:00:29.060> this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.150> made

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
to start with a neck wire this is made

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359 
to start with a neck wire this is made
out<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.480> 16<00:00:30.900> gauge<00:00:31.109> wire<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.890> has<00:00:32.070> some<00:00:32.250> nice

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
out of 16 gauge wire it has some nice

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.790 
out of 16 gauge wire it has some nice
rigidity<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.390> holds<00:00:33.660> its<00:00:33.780> shape<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
rigidity to it so holds its shape and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.470 
rigidity to it so holds its shape and
then<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.550> really<00:00:35.760> thick<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.239> engage

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
then we get some really thick to engage

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.540 
then we get some really thick to engage
wire<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.440> when<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> forge<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
wire that when you forge it out and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.160 
wire that when you forge it out and
we're<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.120> doing<00:00:39.450> forging<00:00:39.930> today

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
we're going to be doing forging today

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.410 
we're going to be doing forging today
you<00:00:41.129> could<00:00:41.280> get<00:00:41.640> some<00:00:41.790> interesting<00:00:42.180> shapes

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
you could get some interesting shapes

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.000 
you could get some interesting shapes
that<00:00:42.540> way<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.440> string<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that way and then string them on the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.279 
that way and then string them on the
wire<00:00:44.239> absolutely<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.660> I've<00:00:45.750> done<00:00:45.899> some<00:00:46.079> pre

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
wire absolutely so I've done some pre

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.459 
wire absolutely so I've done some pre
shapes<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.520> how<00:00:47.969> that's<00:00:48.090> done<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:49.289> take

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
shapes here and how that's done you take

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.220 
shapes here and how that's done you take
a<00:00:49.730> length<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.300> engage<00:00:51.570> however<00:00:51.960> long<00:00:52.110> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
a length of to engage however long you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
a length of to engage however long you
want<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.129> you're<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> alternate

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
want it and you're going to alternate

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.410 
want it and you're going to alternate
flat<00:00:55.379> areas<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.430> want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.030> polished

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
flat areas you want to use a polished

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.020 
flat areas you want to use a polished
steel<00:00:57.600> block<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.820> polished

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
steel block to do this on and a polished

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.880 
steel block to do this on and a polished
forging<00:01:00.690> hammer<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.260> things<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.530> highly

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
forging hammer these things are highly

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
forging hammer these things are highly
polished<00:01:02.120> but<00:01:03.120> there's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.420> flat<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
polished but there's a flat one in a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.500 
polished but there's a flat one in a
around<00:01:04.739> one<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.640> start<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> round<00:01:06.270> one

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
around one you start with the round one

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.469 
around one you start with the round one
and<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:07.830> causes<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> spread<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.939> okay

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
and that causes it to spread out okay

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.640 
and that causes it to spread out okay
you<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.720> light<00:01:12.930> taps<00:01:13.229> towards<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
you go with light taps towards the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.870 
you go with light taps towards the
center<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> wire<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:17.220> heavier<00:01:17.580> taps

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
center of the wire and heavier taps

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
center of the wire and heavier taps
towards<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> end<00:01:18.540> because<00:01:19.320> that'll<00:01:19.619> spread

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
towards the end because that'll spread

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
towards the end because that'll spread
the<00:01:19.979> ends<00:01:20.250> out<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:20.939> why<00:01:21.119> i<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the ends out so that's why i use the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.520 
the ends out so that's why i use the
route<00:01:21.720> right

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.810 

and<00:01:31.530> once<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.829> get<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.159> thickness<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and once you get to a thickness that you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.550 
and once you get to a thickness that you
like<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.229> turn<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.470> over<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:36.229> use<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> flat

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
like you can turn it over and use a flat

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.770 
like you can turn it over and use a flat
side<00:01:37.830> of<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> hammer<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:39.000> kind<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.330> flattens

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
side of the hammer it kind of flattens

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.190 
side of the hammer it kind of flattens
it<00:01:39.840> down<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.850> hammer<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.110> you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
it down the hammer is the one that you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
it down the hammer is the one that you
want<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.619> definitely<00:01:44.220> recommend<00:01:44.580> to<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.850> this

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
want you definitely recommend to do this

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880 
want you definitely recommend to do this
with<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.720> forging<00:01:46.080> here<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.350> at<00:01:46.439> 14

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
with the forging here we at 14

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.660 
with the forging here we at 14
definitely<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.030> let<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.330> different<00:01:48.720> dome

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
definitely you let the different dome

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.370 
definitely you let the different dome
the<00:01:50.670> different<00:01:51.000> ends<00:01:51.270> give<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:52.200> more

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the different ends give you a lot more

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.679 
the different ends give you a lot more
you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.890> different<00:01:53.700> opportunities<00:01:54.360> just

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
you can do different opportunities just

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:07.719 
you can do different opportunities just
regular<00:02:04.490> what<00:02:05.490> I've<00:02:05.610> done<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.970> I've

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
regular what I've done is I've

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.609 
regular what I've done is I've
alternated<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.850> once<00:02:09.060> sides<00:02:09.330> flat<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.410> way

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
alternated it once sides flat this way

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.259 
alternated it once sides flat this way
and<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.130> other<00:02:11.160> side's<00:02:11.549> flat<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.030> other<00:02:12.180> way

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
and the other side's flat the other way

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.479 
and the other side's flat the other way
and<00:02:12.450> why<00:02:12.600> are<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.930> using<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.500> metal<00:02:14.280> block

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
and why are you using that metal block

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.880 
and why are you using that metal block
metal<00:02:15.209> block<00:02:15.330> if<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.569> do<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:15.989> wood<00:02:16.230> it's

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
metal block if I do this on wood it's

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.860 
metal block if I do this on wood it's
just<00:02:17.069> going<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.310> dent<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.580> wood<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.000> not

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
just going to dent the wood and not

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.850 
just going to dent the wood and not
spread<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.200> metal<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:22.380> want<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
spread the metal so you want to do the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.059 
spread the metal so you want to do the
one<00:02:22.980> creating<00:02:23.489> right<00:02:24.150> exactly<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.860> just

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
one creating right exactly and you just

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.800 
one creating right exactly and you just
keep<00:02:26.220> working<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> wire<00:02:26.819> until<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.569> gets<00:02:27.750> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
keep working the wire until it gets to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.920 
keep working the wire until it gets to
the<00:02:27.930> basic<00:02:28.230> shape<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.620> want<00:02:29.359> and<00:02:30.359> when

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the basic shape that you want and when

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.380 
the basic shape that you want and when
you<00:02:31.019> get<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.440> size<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.790> right<00:02:33.030> here<00:02:33.359> is

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
you get to this size this right here is

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.039 
you get to this size this right here is
kind<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.720> roughed<00:02:33.959> out<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:35.570> we<00:02:36.570> can<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:36.780> take

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
kind of roughed out and we can just take

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.210 
kind of roughed out and we can just take
a<00:02:37.079> 8-inch<00:02:37.680> hand<00:02:37.890> file<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.940> really<00:02:39.780> kind<00:02:39.930> of

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
a 8-inch hand file and really kind of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.759 
a 8-inch hand file and really kind of
smooth<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.370> out<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:42.049> shape<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.500> don't

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
smooth it out and shape it if you don't

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.520 
smooth it out and shape it if you don't
want<00:02:43.980> sharp<00:02:44.220> corners<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.840> round<00:02:46.320> those

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
want sharp corners you can round those

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.759 
want sharp corners you can round those
off<00:02:49.340> that's<00:02:50.340> pretty<00:02:50.810> yeah<00:02:51.810> when<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.680> all

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
off that's pretty yeah when this is all

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.559 
off that's pretty yeah when this is all
done<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.010> polished<00:02:53.549> it'll<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.120> some<00:02:54.329> really

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
done and polished it'll have some really

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.870 
done and polished it'll have some really
nice<00:02:54.750> facets<00:02:55.319> that<00:02:55.530> really<00:02:56.400> reflect<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
nice facets that really reflect the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.590 
nice facets that really reflect the
light<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:59.760> love<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.329> really

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
light I just love that you can really

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.900 
light I just love that you can really
create<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.200> shape<00:03:01.500> as<00:03:01.709> much<00:03:02.100> as<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.430> want<00:03:02.640> or<00:03:02.819> as

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
create a shape as much as you want or as

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.610 
create a shape as much as you want or as
little<00:03:03.030> as<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.329> want<00:03:03.450> exactly<00:03:04.170> your<00:03:04.410> watch

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
little as you want exactly your watch

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.009 
little as you want exactly your watch
you<00:03:04.920> you're<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.400> complete<00:03:05.579> control<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.840> know

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
you you're in complete control you know

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.370 
you you're in complete control you know
it's<00:03:07.739> your<00:03:07.889> design<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:09.810> can<00:03:09.930> make<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.139> fit

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
it's your design and you can make it fit

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.710 
it's your design and you can make it fit
however<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:12.299> so<00:03:12.450> once<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.690> have

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
however you like it and so once you have

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.020 
however you like it and so once you have
it<00:03:12.900> shaped<00:03:13.400> filing<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.489> more<00:03:14.639> for<00:03:14.819> shaping

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
it shaped filing is more for shaping

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.199 
it shaped filing is more for shaping
right<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.620> can<00:03:16.769> start<00:03:16.980> sanding<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.790> I

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
right you can start sanding and I

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.559 
right you can start sanding and I
usually<00:03:18.450> start<00:03:18.660> with<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.870> 320<00:03:19.500> grit<00:03:19.680> um<00:03:20.579> goes

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
usually start with that 320 grit um goes

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.530 
usually start with that 320 grit um goes
faster<00:03:22.100> okay<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.730> little<00:03:24.000> harder<00:03:24.480> to

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
faster okay this is a little harder to

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.690 
faster okay this is a little harder to
hold<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.079> here<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.459> give<00:03:26.609> it

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
hold on to here and is that to give it

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.340 
hold on to here and is that to give it
the<00:03:26.819> high<00:03:26.970> polish<00:03:27.389> exactly<00:03:27.989> now<00:03:28.139> we're<00:03:28.260> good

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
the high polish exactly now we're good

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.110 
the high polish exactly now we're good
this<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.530> kind<00:03:28.829> of<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:28.920> finishing<00:03:29.280> stage<00:03:29.910> of

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
this is kind of the finishing stage of

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.780 
this is kind of the finishing stage of
it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.910 
it
and<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:32.140> have<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.349> go<00:03:32.469> through<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.920> successive

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
and you have to go through a successive

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.179 
and you have to go through a successive
progression<00:03:35.920> of<00:03:36.629> sanding<00:03:37.629> grits<00:03:37.870> mm-hmm<00:03:38.620> if

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
progression of sanding grits mm-hmm if

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.860 
progression of sanding grits mm-hmm if
you<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:39.370> start<00:03:39.700> with<00:03:39.879> like<00:03:39.969> a<00:03:40.030> real<00:03:40.329> fine<00:03:40.569> six

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
you just start with like a real fine six

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.929 
you just start with like a real fine six
hundred<00:03:41.200> or<00:03:41.349> so<00:03:41.379> it<00:03:42.250> just<00:03:42.459> takes<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:42.819> much

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
hundred or so it just takes so much

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.380 
hundred or so it just takes so much
longer<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.359> do<00:03:44.730> absolutely<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.180> we'll<00:03:46.299> go

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
longer to do absolutely so we'll go

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.839 
longer to do absolutely so we'll go
there<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:46.900> then<00:03:47.859> you<00:03:48.129> know<00:03:48.220> finish<00:03:48.579> up<00:03:48.730> with

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
there and then you know finish up with

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.380 
there and then you know finish up with
something<00:03:49.150> like<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.299> 600<00:03:50.700> that's<00:03:51.700> really<00:03:52.180> gives

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
something like a 600 that's really gives

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.849 
something like a 600 that's really gives
it<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:53.159> nice<00:03:54.159> move<00:03:54.519> pneus<00:03:54.819> exactly

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
it that nice move pneus exactly

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.990 
it that nice move pneus exactly
especially<00:03:56.859> isn't<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.400> wearing<00:03:57.730> something

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
especially isn't you wearing something

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.699 
especially isn't you wearing something
you<00:03:58.359> want<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.599> to<00:03:58.720> be<00:03:58.750> nice<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.019> smooth<00:03:59.409> and

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
you want it to be nice and smooth and

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.599 
you want it to be nice and smooth and
soft<00:04:00.609> and<00:04:01.170> exactly<00:04:02.170> not<00:04:02.709> have<00:04:02.889> any<00:04:03.040> edges<00:04:03.400> to

you have a variable speed from real slow
to<00:04:42.310> really<00:04:43.000> fast<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:45.400> he's<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.669> really<00:04:45.970> easy<00:04:46.449> to

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
to really fast so he's it really easy to

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.100 
to really fast so he's it really easy to
do<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.199> with<00:04:47.320> a<00:04:47.349> really<00:04:47.650> light<00:04:47.860> pressure
