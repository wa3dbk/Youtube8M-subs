 donate 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.800
 leonberger like a warm one 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.020
 to another round with yours 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.640
 battle.net at it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.099
 Of course, today it is how it should be 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.720
 be different about battlefield 4 but not 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.840
 into game content 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.670
 Today it's time for something else though 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.489
 come ask if you have in your 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.470
 Last video zone emblem on a weapon 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.290
 It was about a logo and I can 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.559
 tell you yes that was me such a logo 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.449
 can create or emblem to yours 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.699
 Weapon pack could show you in 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.260
 this video 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.750
 to be able to do it all now 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.610
 you have to first your origin States 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.250
 here on the battlefield 4 beta 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.199
 click and then in your battlelog if 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.769
 you arrived there you go up 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.379
 your soldiers and have over here 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.549
 customize this button if on it 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.869
 you have a choice 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.670
 between three options 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.810
 you are here on the first emblem 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.820
 yes , there we are and we are 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.530
 Maybe I have my eyes here 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.990
 very first logo created 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.880
 that's how it looks like it's a first 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.070
 You definitely have to do it here 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.440
 bring a bit of creativity there 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.290
 It does not seem like every letter 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.190
 or every sign there but we here 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.409
 over there sees a certain range 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.090
 signs symbolize or pay 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.060
 which are also available to you 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.790
 then with this color palette still respectively 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.650
 you can customize for example 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.270
 disfigure new emblem yes there you have 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.760
 her up here the possibility here yet 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.220
 to select a few freely or over 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.510
 add new ones 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.750
 we'll just do it here 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.490
 We have a free area here, we say 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.780
 okay, we want to do it now, for example 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.580
 then have this wrench 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.890
 Let's just click on it and it will 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.390
 automatically inserted into this field 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.379
 We can look similar here 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.479
 editing program such as 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.299
 photoshop we can make this bigger or 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.569
 pull is less than or at this upper eck 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:20.349
 point we can do it all the same 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.060
 turn around 360 Â° once and can 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.870
 this is how we position it 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.400
 want to have 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.049
 if we have some color in it now 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.999
 Do not want a problem we go down in 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.160
 the color palette just click us 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.130
 here the money to 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.390
 already the wrench is yellow 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.460
 Maybe we want to be here like this 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.620
 in the corner is not a problem 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.660
 now it is so i might have 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.230
 like a colored background like 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.360
 I do that 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.960
 So basically there is not that 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.760
 possibility here by bicycle crate 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.730
 just to cut a background 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.070
 You have to do all this with an object 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.700
 For example, this would be done here 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.500
 to offer 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.750
 that they just big accordingly 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.480
 pulls and thus this complete 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.640
 covering the display area and then the in 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.650
 pink is doing this now 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.910
 wrench to see again 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.130
 you just here at the side as a layer 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.690
 all the way up it seemed that too 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.590
 similar to a photoshop if there are any 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.270
 know of you 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.610
 that could also make the layer 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.330
 move and order the order 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.760
 establish 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.140
 otherwise we have our yellow here 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.080
 wrench on pink 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.850
 background if your now for example 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.760
 want something like I did here 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.980
 my logo i at least tried it 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.459
 I have that for example 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.350
 made by taking a bar 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.350
 I've been down here with that 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.060
 that the l creates and you have to 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.950
 just try a little bit 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.080
 Adjust a little bit 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.010
 It is already a lot of work around 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.780
 there something yes I say 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.209
 find out more sophisticated and 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.680
 but you have to get here 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.270
 also like i mentioned one 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.940
 corresponding creativity to the day 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.250
 lay there for example that it can 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:11.910
 yes, go in there are two 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:14.970
 elements and these I have from this 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.500
 brackets so to speak 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.750
 I then as you see here 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.390
 adapted and pulled over with the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.850
 from direction stool so turned it that 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.980
 In the end, it is actually about one thing 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.919
 as I said here you just have to 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.210
 Try and play around if you are 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.070
 now have an element in there like 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.750
 For example, this clip I here 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.490
 not always in the logo would like to have mine 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.870
 logo so far finished you could be here 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.390
 Over here at layer you see here the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.600
 All I teach for this 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.360
 I just needed logo on the back 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.980
 click these six and it's gone 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.540
 you can do all this with this one 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.770
 closed simple fix 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.230
 then you can not do that in yours 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.030
 Move composition, so to speak 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.650
 who finished with your logo since it is 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.710
 in any case important that here 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.120
 at the top is on save and thus lord 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.970
 the name already says it all, of course 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.490
 save as you see is now ours 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.930
 yellow wrench on pink in the 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.360
 background no longer because that lies 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.810
 because we did not save it 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.540
 to have 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.560
 So if we have ours here 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.070
 wrench in yellow again 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.080
 then we need to save on top 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.600
 andrews that means we all 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.790
 save and use at the same time 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.980
 if we do that now we save 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.070
 that time and he will do that as ours 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.290
 logo or emblem and if we are now 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.210
 turn to the other lodge we have 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.090
 not the option safe anymore 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.430
 use if I go back then then 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.470
 I'll use mine again 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.360
 real logo is definitely 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.370
 important otherwise all your work you 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.140
 if you have another one 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.970
 field always clicks lost 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.220
 important if you have done something here 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.260
 and you 're not done up here 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.640
 somehow continue to click into another 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.260
 in the life but save first 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.700
 yes, by and large, it was 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.800
 So I can only tell you 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.710
 try it out that's really funny 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.750
 like that finally on the 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.600
 weapon I can show you that now 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.550
 again and you can here on each 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.130
 case a few funny individual things 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.110
 then make the whole emblem is like 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.880
 you may already be up to both 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.640
 on your weapon as well as on yours 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.040
 outfit he wears but also on the 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.610
 vehicles in which you are seated 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.860
 So if you have an emblem 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.840
 which is really really striking 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.820
 then yes you can on the one or 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.280
 other battlefield of course completely 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.530
 nice and quick to notice the further 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.650
 is added that in the kilfitt so in the 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.390
 view you see who you are yes 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.130
 shot over the pile there 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.960
 Also this emblem appears the 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.249
 is really a funny customization 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.709
 history 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.729
 Definitely so a little year 

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:57.349
 fun and diversion pure 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.819
 Brings because you can see it ok 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:00.739
 he has that and the symbol 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:03.859
 so of course it has a certain 

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:06.039
 shadow because some people just 

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:09.319
 here's something, yes 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:11.499
 misuse and then I had to 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:13.549
 unfortunately already partially see year 

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:16.519
 have used xenophobic symbols 

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:18.259
 which is not so nice but im 

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:20.209
 big and big videos that really 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:21.889
 A nice way to get there 

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:22.309
 little change in the game 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.769
 bring 

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:26.929
 yes and now you are in demand again 

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:28.939
 if you like this little tutorial 

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:30.139
 and you have more information too 

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.089
 Battlefield 4 would like to have 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.339
 Well then you are exactly right with me 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:35.899
 because your bertram ost supplies you with 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:37.399
 all the important information the aua 

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:39.889
 survive on the virtual 

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:42.319
 positively influence the battlefield 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:44.529
 In this sense you keep your goal in the 

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:44.529
 eye
