00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
to scratch the gold hardware and I don't

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310 
to scratch the gold hardware and I don't
want<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> white<00:01:51.090> leather<00:01:51.330> dirty<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
can adjust the length of the band but

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.960 
can adjust the length of the band but
you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.750> adjust<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> width<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
you can adjust the width so one of the

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.179 
you can adjust the width so one of the
complaints<00:01:57.600> by<00:01:57.900> some<00:01:58.290> people<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> it's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
too narrow for their heads so that can

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.890 
too narrow for their heads so that can
cause<00:02:02.220> some<00:02:02.430> discomfort<00:02:02.640> over<00:02:03.240> time<00:02:03.509> the

cause some discomfort over time the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.830 
cause some discomfort over time the
memory<00:02:04.049> foam<00:02:04.380> cushions<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.610> soft<00:02:06.540> they

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
memory foam cushions are so soft they

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.109 
memory foam cushions are so soft they
are<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.170> butter<00:02:07.649> I've<00:02:07.890> never<00:02:08.100> had<00:02:08.399> ones<00:02:08.700> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
are like butter I've never had ones that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
are like butter I've never had ones that
are<00:02:09.420> flush<00:02:10.110> against<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.649> ear<00:02:10.769> like<00:02:10.979> this

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
are flush against your ear like this

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.800

before<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.519> always<00:02:11.730> had<00:02:12.000> ones<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.360> work<00:02:12.480> like

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
before I always had ones that work like

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.470 
before I always had ones that work like
cups<00:02:13.140> over<00:02:13.410> your<00:02:13.829> ears<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.000> far<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.209> good

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
cups over your ears but so far so good

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.610 
cups over your ears but so far so good
with<00:02:15.630> these<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.989> haven't<00:02:16.260> had

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
with these I haven't had

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.589 
with these I haven't had
the<00:02:16.709> real<00:02:16.890> issues<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.909> bad<00:02:18.060> thing<00:02:18.269> about<00:02:18.450> this

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
the real issues the bad thing about this

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.720 
the real issues the bad thing about this
design<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.019> there's<00:02:19.440> no<00:02:19.650> physical<00:02:20.010> seal<00:02:20.489> over

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
design is there's no physical seal over

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.600 
design is there's no physical seal over
your<00:02:21.000> ears<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.200> sound<00:02:22.409> does<00:02:22.620> leak<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:23.129> you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
your ears so the sound does leak if you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.720 
your ears so the sound does leak if you
have<00:02:23.849> your<00:02:23.970> volume<00:02:24.150> above<00:02:24.890> 30%<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.430> people

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
have your volume above 30% the people

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.580 
have your volume above 30% the people
around<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.150> will<00:02:27.330> probably<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:28.080> able<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.379> hear

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
around you will probably be able to hear

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.289 
around you will probably be able to hear
what<00:02:28.709> you're<00:02:28.830> listening<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.909> is<00:02:30.060> not

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
what you're listening to so this is not

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.570 
what you're listening to so this is not
good<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.810> library

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
good for the library

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.770 
good for the library
another<00:02:32.580> thing<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:32.849> differentiates<00:02:33.299> these

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
another thing that differentiates these

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.600 
another thing that differentiates these
from<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.140> beats<00:02:34.379> is<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.799> cord<00:02:35.069> doesn't

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
from the beats is that the cord doesn't

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.210 
from the beats is that the cord doesn't
detach<00:02:36.120> from<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> headphones<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.010> don't

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
detach from the headphones but I don't

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.339 
detach from the headphones but I don't
really<00:02:38.310> care<00:02:38.519> about<00:02:38.579> that<00:02:39.019> one<00:02:40.019> thing<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.319> I

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
really care about that one thing that I

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.750 
really care about that one thing that I
do<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.129> these<00:02:41.280> don't<00:02:41.519> require

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
do like is that these don't require

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.960 
do like is that these don't require
batteries<00:02:42.110> with<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.290> beats<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.860> always<00:02:44.640> always

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
batteries with the beats I always always

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.050 
batteries with the beats I always always
always<00:02:45.269> forgot<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.049> turn<00:02:46.230> them<00:02:46.440> off<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.099> just

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060

Kevin<00:02:50.549> these<00:02:50.940> do<00:02:51.209> fold<00:02:51.450> up<00:02:51.599> but<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.959> a

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
Kevin these do fold up but in a

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.619 
Kevin these do fold up but in a
different<00:02:52.379> way<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.010> cups<00:02:53.519> turn<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.450> can

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
different way the cups turn so you can

wear them around your neck like speakers
I<00:02:56.519> would<00:02:56.970> never<00:02:57.329> do<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.019> it's<00:02:58.170> an<00:02:58.260> option

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
I would never do that but it's an option

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.830 
I would never do that but it's an option
for<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.549> they<00:02:59.760> fold<00:03:00.060> up<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.510> create<00:03:00.810> a

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
for you then they fold up to create a

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.539 
for you then they fold up to create a
semicircle<00:03:01.560> shape<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.040> then<00:03:02.129> you<00:03:02.220> can<00:03:02.400> just

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
semicircle shape and then you can just

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.030 
semicircle shape and then you can just
toss<00:03:02.760> them<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.510> white<00:03:03.780> zipper<00:03:04.530> pouch<00:03:04.739> that

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
toss them in the white zipper pouch that

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.720 
toss them in the white zipper pouch that
it<00:03:05.129> comes<00:03:05.310> with

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
I do wish that it came with a more

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.039 
I do wish that it came with a more
structured<00:03:07.950> case<00:03:08.359> for<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.390> better<00:03:09.810> protection

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
structured case for a better protection

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
against these is there's not very much
