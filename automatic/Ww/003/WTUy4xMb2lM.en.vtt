00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
in the forum today I will test out some

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.670 
in the forum today I will test out some
orange<00:00:12.910> tubing<00:00:13.360> they<00:00:13.719> call<00:00:13.930> it

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
orange tubing they call it

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.890 
orange tubing they call it
in<00:00:16.010> medical<00:00:16.280> industries<00:00:16.880> I'll<00:00:17.540> try<00:00:17.840> to

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
in medical industries I'll try to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.050 
in medical industries I'll try to
remember<00:00:18.110> to<00:00:18.260> put<00:00:18.440> the<00:00:18.470> link<00:00:18.770> on<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.760> thread

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
remember to put the link on the thread

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.530 
remember to put the link on the thread
or<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.480> spot<00:00:21.200> on<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:21.470> video<00:00:22.390> which<00:00:23.390> is<00:00:23.480> a

I<00:00:24.950> guess<00:00:25.790> the<00:00:26.029> UK<00:00:26.390> call<00:00:26.660> it<00:00:26.860> fake<00:00:27.860> Marcus<00:00:28.340> from

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
I guess the UK call it fake Marcus from

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.979 
I guess the UK call it fake Marcus from
the<00:00:29.300> UK<00:00:29.860> dubbed<00:00:30.860> it<00:00:31.010> as<00:00:31.160> dub<00:00:31.369> dub

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
the UK dubbed it as dub dub

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.910 
the UK dubbed it as dub dub
anyway<00:00:32.989> I'm<00:00:33.110> also<00:00:33.320> trying<00:00:33.710> out<00:00:34.010> the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
anyway I'm also trying out the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.869 
anyway I'm also trying out the
attachment<00:00:36.920> method<00:00:37.160> that's<00:00:37.309> not<00:00:37.460> discussed

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
attachment method that's not discussed

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.700 
attachment method that's not discussed
talked<00:00:38.270> about<00:00:38.540> too<00:00:38.750> much<00:00:38.930> but<00:00:39.170> it's<00:00:39.320> not<00:00:39.470> new

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
talked about too much but it's not new

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.860 
talked about too much but it's not new
it's<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.030> ball<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.050> tube<00:00:42.260> method<00:00:43.660> at<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.780> end

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
it's the ball and tube method at the end

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.869 
it's the ball and tube method at the end
of<00:00:44.989> this<00:00:45.050> video<00:00:45.260> I'll<00:00:45.830> show<00:00:46.070> how<00:00:46.100> I<00:00:46.250> did<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:46.670> but

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
of this video I'll show how I did it but

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.460 
of this video I'll show how I did it but
in<00:00:47.239> case<00:00:47.330> I<00:00:47.600> forget<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:47.989> mention<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.320> key

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
in case I forget to mention the key

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.170 
in case I forget to mention the key
points<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:50.290> want<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.560> ball<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.460> be<00:00:52.700> bigger

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
points you want the ball to be bigger

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.990 
points you want the ball to be bigger
than<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.540> diameter<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.520> big<00:00:55.520> enough<00:00:55.640> in<00:00:55.910> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
than the diameter and big enough in the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.590 
than the diameter and big enough in the
hole<00:00:56.210> big<00:00:57.200> enough<00:00:57.230> to<00:00:57.470> stop<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:59.149> hole<00:00:59.329> in<00:00:59.480> your

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
hole big enough to stop the hole in your

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.790 
hole big enough to stop the hole in your
fork<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:01.570> you<00:01:02.570> sometimes<00:01:02.809> have<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.200> get<00:01:03.680> it

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
fork and you sometimes have to get it

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.480 
fork and you sometimes have to get it
went<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.270> get<00:01:05.270> it<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.509> there<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.310> well<00:01:07.310> once

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
went to get it in there and well once

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.270 
went to get it in there and well once
you<00:01:07.610> get<00:01:07.759> in<00:01:07.940> there<00:01:08.090> wet<00:01:08.300> let<00:01:08.899> it<00:01:09.020> dry<00:01:09.259> first<00:01:09.590> to

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
you get in there wet let it dry first to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.790 
you get in there wet let it dry first to
prevent<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.729> from<00:01:10.840> working<00:01:11.840> its<00:01:12.110> way<00:01:12.259> out<00:01:12.470> but

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
prevent it from working its way out but

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.160 
prevent it from working its way out but
other<00:01:13.789> than<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:14.030> it's<00:01:14.270> been<00:01:14.300> pretty<00:01:14.630> secure

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
other than that it's been pretty secure

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.940 
other than that it's been pretty secure
it's<00:01:15.979> not<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.310> safest<00:01:16.789> method<00:01:17.000> but<00:01:17.950> done

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
it's not the safest method but done

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.730 
it's not the safest method but done
right<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:19.550> if<00:01:20.240> you're<00:01:20.360> careful<00:01:20.630> it's<00:01:21.470> a<00:01:21.530> good

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
right and if you're careful it's a good

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.950 
right and if you're careful it's a good
method<00:01:21.920> anyway<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.000> is<00:01:23.090> my<00:01:23.119> SPS<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:23.659> want<00:01:23.900> to

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
method anyway this is my SPS I want to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.390 
method anyway this is my SPS I want to
make<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.080> few<00:01:24.320> shots<00:01:25.869> can't<00:01:26.869> use<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.650> 3/8<00:01:28.070> steel

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
make a few shots can't use a 3/8 steel

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.810 
make a few shots can't use a 3/8 steel
this<00:01:29.180> uh<00:01:29.210> dub<00:01:29.720> dub<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.890> far<00:01:31.130> I've<00:01:31.310> been<00:01:31.340> liking
