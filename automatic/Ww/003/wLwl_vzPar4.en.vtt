00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:07.840
 Hello, I have already bought the enamels 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:10.599
 of the magnet in the end I bought two this 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.719
 of the mercadona that cost me 250 with 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.339
 the magnet that cost me 120 and comes in 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.760
 this kind of cap that now 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:22.180
 I will explain and the kiko bought me this 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.390
 other than its price is 490 unless it's 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.310
 you agree some offer and the magnet of 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.369
 Kiko 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.230
 what is this that I took it with form 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.360
 star also now I explain 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.280
 in the mercadona you have four colors to 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.489
 choose blue green this is that way 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.230
 garnet and other half bronze and in boy 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.390
 what you have are more colors I think 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.790
 There are eight to choose from different and 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.310
 all very nice advantages and 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.770
 inconveniences to see 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.420
 at the beginning the market magnet is not 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.510
 a little difficult until you take the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.490
 trick but once you take it 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.220
 I do not change it anymore I do not use this anymore 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.570
 Well the only thing that has is that 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.210
 you can only make the drawing of 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.120
 the lines diagonally I thought that 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 could have taken the magnet out of here and so 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.230
 when you move it, you could do them in 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.600
 horizontal or vertical what happens that I 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.280
 he's used it so much that I'm not going 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.330
 I'm not interested in doing 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.760
 I went to Kiko and decided to change to take the 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.729
 the star shape so they were not 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.340
 same but good does not convince me much 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.799
 because you have to see that you do not notice 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.619
 So what I recommend is that if you 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.080
 like putting diagonal lines or be 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:41.330
 in horizontal or vertical you can buy 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.100
 the kiko magnet that only by turning it 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.780
 you can put of the position that more you 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.500
 like but if you like anything the 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.710
 diagonal and there you get used to this 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.140
 half gadget 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.820
 I believe that you are not going to change 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.990
 the magnets go in any to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.610
 any of the glazes but 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.620
 only with enamels that are for 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.000
 magnets with a normal enamel do not try 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.850
 because it will not work 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.170
 more things if you spot animal without 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.110
 no problem is cleaned with twine 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.429
 normal enamels at the beginning you will 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.500
 Cost 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.250
 and you got stained but once you 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.550
 You take the trick is to put your finger and 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.550
 bring it closer to the magnet 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.610
 the more you miss this step because 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.120
 you are taking out the nail then in a 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.060
 moment is good I will teach you to 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.700
 you can see how it is becoming it does not matter 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.260
 use one another as I said with 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.050
 either of the two brothers is worth 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.230
 first I will use the equipment with the magnet 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.490
 of the star to use on the nail 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.060
 great to see if we get that we're 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.610
 stay 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.050
 but I will say no I have been 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.030
 disappointed but hey I was not going to buy 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.770
 the same kart 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.350
 At first I thought that this enamel 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.490
 of kiko covered more than that of mercadona 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.160
 but in the end either of the two is 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.220
 well we will paint the nail this would be the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.040
 center of the star we approach 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.190
 without touching but as close 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.190
 possible 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.799
 The more time we leave it 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.140
 the nail dries and do a favor 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.260
 in a moment we would have done it 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.739
 to see if it has been left that I doubt it is worth 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.470
 good look 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.040
 we have had little luck I do not know if the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.040
 you will see well 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.560
 it does not look very good on the camera for 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.560
 try like this 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.890
 you will see the stripes much better 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.810
 Look, today there has been luck because yes 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.460
 it shows a bit although you do not 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.580
 you see very well 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.720
 OK 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.000
 and now the same 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.880
 let's try with the same enamel light 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.350
 so you can see that it does not matter being 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.380
 those of the magnet 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.390
 the one of the market the magnet of the market a 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.230
 animal of the market does not have as a 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:08.240
 sort of markit here that you put the 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.910
 uÃ±a acercas you support this here 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.850
 and that's the best way I've ever 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.019
 got to hold it without the nail 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.329
 rubbing of lime 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.800
 that at first good yes it costs 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:25.319
 truth to another very important thing is that 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.320
 with these glazes you always give yourself a 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:33.750
 base because they tend to dye the nail 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.770
 here it is 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.770
 the dashes 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.340
 I like a lot of hairlines 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.310
 Now I'm going to do it with the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.450
 mercadona enamel that although it is not 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.580
 very different color good but 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.950
 surely coming back is better and what 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.440
 I told you important a nail base 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.470
 be a shine or a hardener what 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.040
 use because especially those of the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.650
 mercadona 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.660
 I give faith because I've seen it in ones that 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.700
 stay and buy for example the blue for 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.200
 tell you once what else is not that you 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.450
 all the blue nail will be there but yes 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.930
 it shows a bluish tone if you do not use 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.930
 protective 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.259
 and so much 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.840
 good now 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.060
 the same today we paint 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.849
 else if you do not like the color 

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:30.310
 you want to make the magnet because you already know that 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:34.590
 Are cheap 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:38.030
 and you can buy them the same perfectly 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.030
 there you can see the stripes a little 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.360
 I usually count between 15 and 20 so 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.880
 I tell you because the nail is already 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.950
 I almost got dry and also while 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.120
 the more time you have it, the more marked you are going to 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.040
 to be the line arrives a moment that already 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.560
 do not mark more but if you have it little 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:06:00.080
 time is not marked clearly 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:02.410
 There you see the color of the one I bought 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.760
 of course the kiko is a little more orange 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.460
 this one is more garnet 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.530
 They are both very nice and I already tell you in 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.050
 the ice in a little the star 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.670
 in 5 what you have is those different 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.610
 types of magnets this is the way of 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.460
 star would be the one of the stripes good and 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.110
 massimo some little packets like that and the ones 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.660
 drawn ends and I think that 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.580
 they had one of little dots I do not remember very 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.620
 well but I think yes I took it for 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.150
 change for what I say even to 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.340
 be of stars I thought clearly 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.009
 it would have been good you could guide it 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.949
 you and put 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:39.499
 where would you like but well I think that 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:45.189
 I 'm going to stay with this 120 in the 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:47.889
 mercadona enamel 250 and kiko 490 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:53.910
 although good I then took it on sale 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:56.670
 and he is the magnet of kiko 190 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.070
 and well, now I'm going to paint them 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.780
 All of them I'm going to leave with the 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.120
 diagonal lines so you can see how 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.880
 all are left and it also seems to me that 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.130
 I'm going to take the color of kiko because in 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.760
 the mercadona what led these days but 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:14.170
 well here you see it is worth 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.170
 come until now 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:20.860
 well, this 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.539
 there you see them really well in the end I 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.220
 leave the star to show it tomorrow 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.830
 A friend since I have stayed because I 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.420
 I asked but the others are the 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.010
 hairline 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.930
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.100
 video and another recommendation for the 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.900
 summer if you do not like the magnets 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.810
 he gets the French manicure but in 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.480
 colors so another new invention already 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:43.090
 you know we'll see you next time and 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:48.180
 you know not to be more from the magnet with the 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.180
 magnet that you like more god
