that in the right position i think of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.300 
that in the right position i think of
the<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.110> formula<00:01:43.619> i<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.920> will<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.189> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the in formula i think it will be one of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.550 
the in formula i think it will be one of
my<00:01:44.399> favorite<00:01:45.060> players<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.840> play<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.350> here
