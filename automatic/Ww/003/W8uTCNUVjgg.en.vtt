set number 82 59 the mini bulldozer I

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.780 
set number 82 59 the mini bulldozer I
don't<00:00:20.950> know<00:00:21.010> why<00:00:21.189> I've<00:00:21.310> been<00:00:21.430> in<00:00:21.490> such<00:00:21.760> a

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
don't know why I've been in such a

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.990 
don't know why I've been in such a
bulldozer<00:00:22.210> mood<00:00:22.930> lately<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:24.250> this<00:00:24.490> one<00:00:24.730> I

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
bulldozer mood lately but this one I

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.529 
bulldozer mood lately but this one I
really<00:00:25.390> like<00:00:25.660> this<00:00:25.960> little<00:00:26.200> tiny<00:00:26.440> model<00:00:27.539> this

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
really like this little tiny model this

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.549 
really like this little tiny model this
really<00:00:29.050> it<00:00:29.289> compares<00:00:29.710> to<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.130> bigger<00:00:30.430> set<00:00:31.270> the

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
really it compares to the bigger set the

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.060 
really it compares to the bigger set the
82-75<00:00:32.559> of<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.629> power<00:00:34.629> functions<00:00:35.170> bulldozer

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
82-75 of the power functions bulldozer

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.450 
82-75 of the power functions bulldozer
just<00:00:37.000> got<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.300> very<00:00:37.480> similar<00:00:37.930> style<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.280> it's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
just got the very similar style and it's

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.770 
just got the very similar style and it's
neat<00:00:39.640> little<00:00:39.760> thing<00:00:40.059> these<00:00:40.390> little<00:00:40.629> tiny

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
neat little thing these little tiny

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.479 
neat little thing these little tiny
models<00:00:41.230> you<00:00:41.350> think<00:00:41.560> you<00:00:41.649> wouldn't<00:00:42.220> have<00:00:42.340> any

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
models you think you wouldn't have any

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
models you think you wouldn't have any
functionality<00:00:43.329> but<00:00:43.480> it<00:00:43.600> does<00:00:43.750> you<00:00:44.020> can<00:00:44.130> with

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
functionality but it does you can with

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.620 
functionality but it does you can with
front<00:00:47.260> end<00:00:47.410> of<00:00:48.309> it<00:00:48.489> up<00:00:48.579> and<00:00:48.850> down<00:00:48.970> up<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.390> down

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
front end of it up and down up and down

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.720 
front end of it up and down up and down
that's<00:00:49.899> what<00:00:50.050> it<00:00:50.140> does<00:00:50.170> implicit<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.460> treads

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
that's what it does implicit the treads

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.049 
that's what it does implicit the treads
roll<00:00:52.000> especially<00:00:52.660> they<00:00:52.809> roll<00:00:52.960> good<00:00:53.140> on<00:00:53.290> carpet

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
roll especially they roll good on carpet

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.330 
roll especially they roll good on carpet
have<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.239> and<00:00:55.480> also<00:00:56.040> compare<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.219> my

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
have that and also compare it to my

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.740 
have that and also compare it to my
little<00:00:57.520> tiny<00:00:57.760> bulldozer<00:00:58.239> I<00:00:58.390> did<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.660> video

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
little tiny bulldozer I did a video

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.549 
little tiny bulldozer I did a video
earlier<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.940> that's<00:01:01.180> my<00:01:01.870> favorite<00:01:02.230> part<00:01:02.440> of

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
earlier but that's my favorite part of

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.770 
earlier but that's my favorite part of
it<00:01:02.739> building<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.969> bulldozer<00:01:04.420> you<00:01:04.629> can

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
it building the the bulldozer you can

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.859 
it building the the bulldozer you can
also<00:01:04.930> build<00:01:05.290> this<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:06.009> excavator<00:01:06.869> which

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
also build this the excavator which

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.480 
also build this the excavator which
interestingly<00:01:08.229> enough<00:01:09.160> they<00:01:09.430> have<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:10.440> Technic

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
interestingly enough they have a Technic

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.039 
interestingly enough they have a Technic
power<00:01:12.490> functions<00:01:12.910> a<00:01:13.060> excavator<00:01:13.750> which<00:01:13.930> I

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
power functions a excavator which I

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.140 
power functions a excavator which I
haven't<00:01:14.320> built<00:01:14.409> yet<00:01:14.710> but<00:01:15.070> um<00:01:15.220> I'm<00:01:15.850> more<00:01:16.060> than

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
haven't built yet but um I'm more than

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.260 
haven't built yet but um I'm more than
the<00:01:16.210> bulldozer<00:01:16.690> moved<00:01:17.350> right<00:01:17.590> now<00:01:17.860> so<00:01:18.790> I<00:01:18.820> have

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
the bulldozer moved right now so I have

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.330 
the bulldozer moved right now so I have
four<00:01:20.020> total<00:01:20.260> bulldozers<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:20.979> I've

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
four total bulldozers that I've

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.340 
four total bulldozers that I've
assembled<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.810> many<00:01:23.020> one<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.140> micro<00:01:26.140> one

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
assembled the many one or the micro one

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.160 
assembled the many one or the micro one
the<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:27.100> meaning<00:01:27.310> one<00:01:27.630> full-scale<00:01:28.630> one<00:01:28.900> and

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
the the meaning one full-scale one and

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.000 
the the meaning one full-scale one and
I'm<00:01:29.470> waiting<00:01:30.430> on<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.610> MIDI<00:01:31.320> medium<00:01:32.320> sized<00:01:32.710> one

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
I'm waiting on the MIDI medium sized one

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.929 
I'm waiting on the MIDI medium sized one
I<00:01:33.040> ordered<00:01:33.460> one<00:01:33.790> off<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.810> break<00:01:35.200> link<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
I ordered one off a break link and

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.460 
I ordered one off a break link and
they'll<00:01:37.150> be<00:01:37.330> coming<00:01:37.659> soon<00:01:37.869> I'll<00:01:38.080> do<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.229> video

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
they'll be coming soon I'll do a video

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.340 
they'll be coming soon I'll do a video
when<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.830> get<00:01:39.009> it<00:01:39.159> I'm<00:01:39.729> not<00:01:39.790> going<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.119> do<00:01:40.210> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
when I get it I'm not going to do a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.600 
when I get it I'm not going to do a
build<00:01:41.350> of<00:01:41.590> this<00:01:41.710> one<00:01:41.920> it's<00:01:42.040> really<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> simple

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
build of this one it's really a simple

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.539 
build of this one it's really a simple
build<00:01:43.439> there's<00:01:44.439> plenty<00:01:44.680> of<00:01:44.770> YouTube<00:01:45.159> videos

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
of it but I just wanted to do a

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.460 
of it but I just wanted to do a
comparison<00:01:48.009> here<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.580> these<00:01:49.470> three

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
comparison here of these three

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.649 
comparison here of these three
bulldozers<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.640> have<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.329> will<00:01:52.509> do

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
bulldozers that I have and I will do

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.200 
bulldozers that I have and I will do
another<00:01:53.079> video<00:01:53.369> when<00:01:54.369> I<00:01:54.400> get<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
another video when I get the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.130 
another video when I get the
medium-sized<00:01:56.790> town<00:01:57.790> bulldozer<00:01:58.600> that's<00:01:58.960> more

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
medium-sized town bulldozer that's more

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.030 
medium-sized town bulldozer that's more
of<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.290> minifigure<00:01:59.710> scale<00:02:01.200> anyway<00:02:02.200> that's<00:02:02.590> the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
of a minifigure scale anyway that's the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.580 
of a minifigure scale anyway that's the
bulldozers<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:03.850> my<00:02:04.630> collection<00:02:05.079> is<00:02:05.229> growing

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
bulldozers and my collection is growing

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.290 
bulldozers and my collection is growing
of<00:02:05.820> bulldozers<00:02:06.820> thanks<00:02:07.750> for<00:02:07.930> watching
