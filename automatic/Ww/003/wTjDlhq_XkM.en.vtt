00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
the ones that are there preferably

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.470 
the ones that are there preferably
particularly<00:02:25.850> because<00:02:25.970> then<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.239> have<00:02:26.359> all

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
particularly because then you have all

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.300 
particularly because then you have all
the<00:02:26.600> mods<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.989> game<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.440> once<00:02:28.130> they're

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
the mods in the game and once they're

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.979 
the mods in the game and once they're
all<00:02:28.340> text<00:02:28.940> you're<00:02:29.150> going<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.480> apply<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:29.959> that

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
all text you're going to apply and that

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.460 
all text you're going to apply and that
should<00:02:30.260> set<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.500> into<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.829> game<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:32.079> go<00:02:33.079> on<00:02:33.200> to

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
should set it into the game and go on to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.510 
should set it into the game and go on to
your<00:02:33.920> saved<00:02:34.220> game

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.700 

and<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.330> should<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.570> there<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.380> we<00:02:43.530> go

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
and then it should be there so if we go

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:56.360 
and then it should be there so if we go
into<00:02:43.830> job<00:02:44.130> market<00:02:44.520> freight<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.980> they're<00:02:56.190> like

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
into job market freight so they're like

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.710 
into job market freight so they're like
you<00:02:56.460> got<00:02:56.610> one<00:02:56.790> there<00:02:57.770> if<00:02:58.770> we<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.310> from<00:02:59.720> some

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
you got one there if we go from some

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.410 
you got one there if we go from some
barracks<00:03:01.200> if<00:03:01.380> we<00:03:01.470> go<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.770> how<00:03:02.010> we<00:03:02.070> have<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.550> got

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
barracks if we go on how we have I got

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.370

builders yard I'll show you the size of
them<00:03:22.100> only<00:03:23.100> problem<00:03:23.370> with<00:03:23.520> these<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.940> that

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
them only problem with these is that

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.390

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
this ain't big struggle of getting

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.160 
this ain't big struggle of getting
around<00:03:26.520> corners<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.210> if<00:03:27.660> you're<00:03:27.780> gonna<00:03:27.930> do

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
around corners so if you're gonna do

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.540 
around corners so if you're gonna do
like<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.410> massively<00:03:29.220> long<00:03:29.520> job

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
like a massively long job

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.370 
like a massively long job

trailers<00:04:54.370> there<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:55.200> obviously<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:57.400> only

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
trailers there that obviously the only

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.300 
trailers there that obviously the only
problem<00:04:58.270> is<00:04:58.450> with<00:04:59.140> the<00:04:59.320> flatbed<00:04:59.860> obviously

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
problem is with the flatbed obviously

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.840 
problem is with the flatbed obviously
with<00:05:00.520> nothing<00:05:00.940> being<00:05:01.120> there<00:05:03.240> I've<00:05:04.240> see<00:05:04.540> the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
with nothing being there I've see the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.920 
with nothing being there I've see the
original<00:05:06.850> trailer<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.450> track<00:05:07.660> that

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
original trailer the track that

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.930 
original trailer the track that
basically<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.770> tractors<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.460> diggers<00:05:09.850> are

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
basically the tractors and diggers are

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.010 
basically the tractors and diggers are
usually<00:05:10.420> on<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.630> trailer

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
usually on the trailer

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.810 
usually on the trailer
they've<00:05:11.530> just<00:05:11.740> replaced<00:05:12.100> that<00:05:12.340> source<00:05:12.670> so

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
they've just replaced that source so

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.660 
they've just replaced that source so
that's<00:05:13.030> why<00:05:13.180> I<00:05:13.210> see<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:14.250> trailer<00:05:15.250> sticking

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
that's why I see the trailer sticking

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.570 
that's why I see the trailer sticking
out<00:05:15.790> of<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.120> mud<00:05:16.420> that<00:05:16.570> you<00:05:16.630> have<00:05:16.780> now<00:05:17.580> sorry
