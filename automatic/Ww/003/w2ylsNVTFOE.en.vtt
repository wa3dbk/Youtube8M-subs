perks<00:01:29.939> after<00:01:30.299> every<00:01:30.570> kill<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.380> think

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
perks after every kill and I think

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.370 
perks after every kill and I think
that's<00:01:31.710> what's<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:33.229> think<00:01:34.229> that's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that's what's going to be I think that's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.280 
that's what's going to be I think that's
what's<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.549> factors<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
what's going to be the the factors that

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.450 
what's going to be the the factors that
you're<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> pick<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> your<00:01:38.220> last

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you're not going to pick the your last

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.580 
you're not going to pick the your last
perks<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.900> could<00:01:40.049> pick<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> very

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
perks but you could pick the very

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.660 
perks but you could pick the very
beginning<00:01:40.950> perks<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> want<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> run

beginning perks that you want to run

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
beginning perks that you want to run
with<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.030> after<00:01:42.540> every<00:01:42.780> single<00:01:43.140> kill<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.530> get

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
with and after every single kill you get

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.289

to<00:01:47.310> work<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.759> not<00:01:47.880> too<00:01:48.090> positive<00:01:48.360> um<00:01:49.229> that's

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to work I'm not too positive um that's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289

that's<00:01:50.159> that's<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.610> i'm<00:01:50.700> thinking<00:01:50.759> i<00:01:51.060> think

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that's that's what i'm thinking i think

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.999 
that's that's what i'm thinking i think
it<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.509> 35<00:01:51.869> gunstreak<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.409> there's<00:01:52.590> 35

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
it is a 35 gunstreak because there's 35

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.760 
it is a 35 gunstreak because there's 35
perks<00:01:53.270> they<00:01:54.270> make<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> 25<00:01:55.020> streak<00:01:55.380> that'd<00:01:55.680> be

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
perks they make it a 25 streak that'd be

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.050 
perks they make it a 25 streak that'd be
awesome<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.369> specialist<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:56.969> they

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
awesome if they do specialist like they

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.010 
awesome if they do specialist like they
didn't<00:01:57.270> want<00:01:57.420> for<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> three<00:01:57.840> they'd<00:01:57.990> be

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
didn't want for a three they'd be

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.539 
didn't want for a three they'd be
awesome<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.770> think<00:01:59.130> I'll<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.340> really

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
awesome but I think I'll be really

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.209 
awesome but I think I'll be really
really<00:01:59.790> overpower<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:00.840> 35<00:02:01.259> kill<00:02:01.560> all

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
really overpower to get all 35 kill all

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.999 
really overpower to get all 35 kill all
35<00:02:02.610> perks<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.149> seven<00:02:03.840> kills<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.290> eight<00:02:04.740> kills

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
35 perks in seven kills or eight kills

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
35 perks in seven kills or eight kills
and<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.549> that's<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.759> little<00:02:06.000> too<00:02:06.240> insane

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and I think that's a little too insane

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.059 
and I think that's a little too insane
maybe<00:02:06.899> they<00:02:07.049> might<00:02:07.229> bump<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.680> number<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
maybe they might bump that number to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.609 
maybe they might bump that number to
like<00:02:08.190> 11<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.670> something<00:02:09.349> where<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.440> get<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
like 11 or something where you get a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.610 
like 11 or something where you get a
perk<00:02:10.860> every<00:02:11.099> three<00:02:11.340> kills<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
perk every three kills and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.850 
perk every three kills and
every<00:02:12.890> two<00:02:13.040> kills<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.640> they<00:02:14.120> do<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.860> like

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
every two kills and they do that to like

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.770 
every two kills and they do that to like

that<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.459> Moab<00:02:43.849> is<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.599> care<00:02:44.780> package

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
that the Moab is not in a care package

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.860 
that the Moab is not in a care package
also<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:46.160> Moab<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:47.030> doesn't<00:02:47.359> it's<00:02:47.480> not<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.629> game

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
also the Moab it doesn't it's not a game

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.960 
also the Moab it doesn't it's not a game
ending<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.410> not<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> game<00:02:48.799> inning<00:02:49.069> streak<00:02:49.370> I

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
think after they called it in there are

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.009 
think after they called it in there are
walking<00:02:52.099> around<00:02:52.190> still<00:02:52.609> so<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.239> Moab<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.720> in<00:02:53.959> a

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
walking around still so the Moab is in a

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.199 
walking around still so the Moab is in a
game<00:02:54.200> ender<00:02:54.530> maybe<00:02:55.069> there's<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> secret<00:02:55.760> maybe

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
game ender maybe there's a secret maybe

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.490 
game ender maybe there's a secret maybe
there's<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.569> secret<00:02:56.750> kill<00:02:57.109> streak<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.379> we

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
there's a secret kill streak that we
