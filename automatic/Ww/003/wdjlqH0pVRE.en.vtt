little bit about these Alltech
amplifiers<00:00:05.990> these<00:00:06.500> are<00:00:06.710> fairly<00:00:07.220> common<00:00:07.670> I've

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
amplifiers these are fairly common I've

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.020 
amplifiers these are fairly common I've
seen<00:00:08.209> them<00:00:08.330> up<00:00:08.419> on<00:00:08.629> eBay<00:00:08.959> or<00:00:09.139> different<00:00:09.440> places

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
seen them up on eBay or different places

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.329 
seen them up on eBay or different places
for<00:00:11.030> sometimes<00:00:11.959> a<00:00:12.079> dollar<00:00:12.259> or<00:00:12.499> two<00:00:12.530> piece<00:00:13.070> and

for sometimes a dollar or two piece and

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.150 
for sometimes a dollar or two piece and
I<00:00:14.269> got<00:00:14.629> a<00:00:14.659> big<00:00:14.900> load<00:00:15.169> of<00:00:15.199> them<00:00:15.499> in<00:00:15.650> wondered

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
I got a big load of them in wondered

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.480 
I got a big load of them in wondered
what<00:00:16.370> in<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:16.670> world<00:00:16.850> they<00:00:17.150> really<00:00:17.180> are<00:00:17.720> and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
what in the world they really are and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.650 
what in the world they really are and
you<00:00:19.490> know<00:00:19.580> they<00:00:19.730> can<00:00:19.790> still<00:00:20.030> be<00:00:20.180> used<00:00:20.450> out<00:00:20.630> in

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
you know they can still be used out in

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.560 
you know they can still be used out in
the<00:00:20.930> field<00:00:21.200> but<00:00:21.980> resale<00:00:22.850> value<00:00:23.240> on<00:00:23.360> them<00:00:23.480> is

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
the field but resale value on them is

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.050 
the field but resale value on them is
fairly<00:00:23.990> low<00:00:24.290> so<00:00:24.860> I<00:00:24.890> got<00:00:25.370> a<00:00:25.400> big<00:00:25.610> load<00:00:25.790> of<00:00:25.820> these

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
fairly low so I got a big load of these

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.790 
fairly low so I got a big load of these
and<00:00:26.390> decided<00:00:26.930> I've<00:00:27.050> looked<00:00:27.260> for<00:00:27.380> scrap<00:00:27.590> value

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
and decided I've looked for scrap value

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.300 
and decided I've looked for scrap value
here's<00:00:28.310> what<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.520> found<00:00:29.860> look<00:00:30.860> for<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.130> ones

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
here's what I found look for the ones

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.440

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
blade screwdriver those I found to be

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.190 
blade screwdriver those I found to be
older<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:40.640> they<00:00:40.970> have<00:00:41.000> more<00:00:41.570> value<00:00:41.780> in<00:00:42.110> them

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
older and they have more value in them

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.750

I'll<00:00:42.410> show<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:42.650> that<00:00:42.739> in<00:00:42.800> just<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:43.010> second<00:00:43.310> the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
I'll show you that in just a second the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.420 
I'll show you that in just a second the
ones<00:00:43.970> with<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.270> Phillips<00:00:45.079> heads<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.560> it

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
ones with the Phillips heads and it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.120 
ones with the Phillips heads and it
doesn't<00:00:46.700> really<00:00:46.790> seem<00:00:46.880> to<00:00:47.149> matter<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.540> number

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
doesn't really seem to matter the number

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.830 
doesn't really seem to matter the number
in<00:00:49.130> my<00:00:49.489> stack<00:00:49.790> I<00:00:49.970> have<00:00:50.180> all<00:00:50.360> of<00:00:50.390> them<00:00:50.600> with<00:00:50.810> the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
in my stack I have all of them with the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.380 
in my stack I have all of them with the
numbers<00:00:51.680> go<00:00:52.430> with<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.640> Phillips<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.120> flat

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
numbers go with the Phillips of the flat

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.360 
numbers go with the Phillips of the flat
but<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:54.200> seems<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.530> be<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.680> lot<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:55.220> the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
but that seems to be a lot of the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.810 
but that seems to be a lot of the
difference<00:00:56.149> I<00:00:56.270> pulled<00:00:57.200> apart<00:00:57.520> various<00:00:58.520> ones

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
difference I pulled apart various ones

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
difference I pulled apart various ones
here<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.480> show<00:00:59.660> you<00:00:59.920> what's<00:01:00.920> inside<00:01:01.100> of<00:01:01.340> them

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
here to show you what's inside of them

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.810 
here to show you what's inside of them
actually<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:02.870> think<00:01:03.020> that<00:01:03.440> this<00:01:04.430> one<00:01:04.610> on<00:01:04.729> the

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
actually I think that this one on the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.160 
actually I think that this one on the
right<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.239> one<00:01:05.330> on<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.570> left<00:01:05.780> are<00:01:05.960> the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
right and the one on the left are the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.860 
right and the one on the left are the
same<00:01:06.500> part<00:01:06.860> number<00:01:07.060> but<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:08.420> one<00:01:08.630> on<00:01:08.750> the

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
same part number but this one on the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.649 
same part number but this one on the
left<00:01:09.049> is<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.290> newer<00:01:09.620> model<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:11.330> doesn't

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
left is a newer model and it doesn't

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.320 
left is a newer model and it doesn't
have<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.840> whole<00:01:12.110> lot<00:01:12.290> of<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:13.040> gold<00:01:13.729> reclamation

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
have a whole lot of a gold reclamation

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.660 
have a whole lot of a gold reclamation
value<00:01:14.690> in<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:14.930> but<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:16.070> does<00:01:16.280> have<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.460> little

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
value in it but it does have a little

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.420 
value in it but it does have a little
bit<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:17.150> I'll<00:01:17.360> show<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:17.659> this<00:01:17.840> little<00:01:18.049> left

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
bit and I'll show you this little left

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.530 
bit and I'll show you this little left
it's<00:01:19.430> probably<00:01:19.700> better<00:01:19.820> if<00:01:19.909> I<00:01:20.060> grab<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.420> with

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
it's probably better if I grab it with

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.160 
it's probably better if I grab it with
the<00:01:20.630> pliers<00:01:20.900> here<00:01:21.369> it's<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.430> little<00:01:22.670> pin<00:01:23.180> that

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
the pliers here it's a little pin that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.920 
the pliers here it's a little pin that
is<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:25.270> is<00:01:26.270> gold-plated<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:28.150> it<00:01:29.150> was<00:01:29.570> in<00:01:29.750> there

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
is a is gold-plated and it was in there

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.340 
is a is gold-plated and it was in there
as<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.760> strapping<00:01:31.760> option<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.869> found<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.200> few

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
as a strapping option and I found a few

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.980 
as a strapping option and I found a few
of<00:01:33.409> those<00:01:33.650> in<00:01:34.010> there<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:35.240> pull<00:01:35.570> those<00:01:35.780> out

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
of those in there so I pull those out

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.600 
of those in there so I pull those out

how we're doing was with focus there is
a<00:02:27.469> nice<00:02:27.859> little<00:02:28.040> pin<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.670> some<00:02:29.120> other<00:02:29.329> parts<00:02:29.719> I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
a nice little pin and some other parts I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.509 
a nice little pin and some other parts I
wanted<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.590> show<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.799> real<00:02:31.040> quick<00:02:31.280> where

wanted to show you real quick where
these<00:02:31.730> parts<00:02:32.120> came<00:02:32.329> out<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.750> because<00:02:33.379> this

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
these parts came out of because this

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.160 
these parts came out of because this
came<00:02:34.609> out<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.790> actually<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:36.010> rheostat<00:02:37.010> and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
came out of actually this rheostat and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.699 
came out of actually this rheostat and
we<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.319> pull<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.560> apart<00:02:39.829> real<00:02:40.189> quick<00:02:40.459> and

show<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:42.739> how<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.040> take<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.549> apart<00:02:44.859> probably

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
show you how to take that apart probably

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.470 
show you how to take that apart probably
can't<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.159> that<00:02:46.280> with<00:02:46.430> one<00:02:46.579> hand<00:02:46.609> but<00:02:47.120> these

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
can't do that with one hand but these

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.289 
can't do that with one hand but these
little<00:02:47.870> sides<00:02:48.290> come<00:02:48.680> off<00:02:49.090> there's<00:02:50.090> three

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299

little sides come off there's three
little<00:02:50.419> clips<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.079> just<00:02:51.260> used<00:02:51.409> a<00:02:51.560> small

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
little clips and I just used a small

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.159 
little clips and I just used a small
little<00:02:52.849> pair<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.030> pliers<00:02:53.359> or<00:02:53.659> something<00:02:53.989> and

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
little pair of pliers or something and

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.990 
just grab hold of that and then twist it
and<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:57.439> comes<00:02:57.590> up<00:02:57.739> really<00:02:58.099> easy<00:02:58.340> if<00:02:58.849> you<00:02:58.909> can

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
and it comes up really easy if you can

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.869 
and it comes up really easy if you can
just<00:02:59.209> grab<00:02:59.389> hold<00:02:59.599> of<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:01.459> will<00:03:01.669> come

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
just grab hold of it and this will come

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.300 
just grab hold of it and this will come
come<00:03:02.510> out<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.169> inside<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.799> it<00:03:04.010> there's<00:03:04.219> this

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
come out and inside of it there's this

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.550 
come out and inside of it there's this
nice<00:03:04.549> little<00:03:04.579> gold-plated<00:03:05.299> ring<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.349> then

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
nice little gold-plated ring and then

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.179 
nice little gold-plated ring and then
you<00:03:06.829> can<00:03:06.980> see<00:03:07.189> from<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.579> backside<00:03:08.060> here<00:03:09.189> where

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
you can see from the backside here where

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.689 
you can see from the backside here where
these<00:03:10.280> connectors<00:03:10.760> are<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.810> there's<00:03:12.230> gold

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:12.699 
these connectors are that there's gold

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.830 
these connectors are that there's gold
connectors<00:03:13.699> there<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.329> that's<00:03:14.510> what<00:03:14.689> this

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
connectors there and that's what this

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.720 
connectors there and that's what this
piece<00:03:15.079> is<00:03:15.109> and<00:03:16.099> so<00:03:16.219> you're<00:03:16.370> going<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.549> break

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
piece is and so you're going to break

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.429 
piece is and so you're going to break
that<00:03:16.879> on<00:03:17.060> out<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:17.629> get<00:03:17.689> the<00:03:17.810> plastic<00:03:18.229> off<00:03:18.409> of

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:21.979 
there and this little silver part it's

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.710 
there and this little silver part it's
not<00:03:22.159> silver<00:03:22.519> but<00:03:22.699> it's<00:03:22.879> aluminum<00:03:23.269> probably

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
not silver but it's aluminum probably

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.649 
not silver but it's aluminum probably
and<00:03:24.280> take<00:03:25.280> just<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.639> gold<00:03:25.849> plated<00:03:26.209> stuff<00:03:26.449> and

for later refining you're also going to

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.210 
for later refining you're also going to
have<00:03:31.849> a<00:03:31.879> lot<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.030> scrap<00:03:32.329> metal<00:03:33.009> you<00:03:34.009> know<00:03:34.099> the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.059 
pair of wire cutters and just grab hold
of<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:43.519> board<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.359> here<00:03:44.689> with<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.799> screws

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
of this board in here with the screws

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.110 
of this board in here with the screws
are<00:03:46.280> because<00:03:46.459> there's<00:03:46.609> some<00:03:46.729> little<00:03:46.939> tiny

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
are because there's some little tiny

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.429 
are because there's some little tiny
funky<00:03:47.569> screws<00:03:47.870> just<00:03:48.859> snap<00:03:49.579> it<00:03:49.729> like<00:03:49.879> that<00:03:50.120> and

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
funky screws just snap it like that and

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.819 
funky screws just snap it like that and
then<00:03:52.419> let<00:03:53.419> it<00:03:53.449> quite<00:03:53.780> get<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:53.959> big<00:03:54.379> enough<00:03:54.560> snap

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
then let it quite get a big enough snap

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.699 
then let it quite get a big enough snap
on<00:03:55.069> it<00:03:55.159> but<00:03:55.310> anyway<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.989> you<00:03:57.290> can<00:03:57.379> see<00:03:57.530> that

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
on it but anyway that you can see that

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.129 
on it but anyway that you can see that
it<00:03:57.829> just<00:03:57.859> shatters<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.639> stuff<00:03:58.909> and<00:03:59.139> this

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
it just shatters that stuff and this

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.369 
it just shatters that stuff and this
then<00:04:00.859> will<00:04:01.069> pull<00:04:01.250> apart<00:04:01.609> quite<00:04:02.090> easily<00:04:02.379> once

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
then will pull apart quite easily once

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:04.959 
then will pull apart quite easily once
you<00:04:03.500> get<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.769> done<00:04:04.009> and<00:04:04.340> then<00:04:04.699> you<00:04:04.819> just

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:04.969 
you get that done and then you just

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.520 
you get that done and then you just
start<00:04:05.150> processing<00:04:05.719> and<00:04:05.989> this<00:04:06.109> one<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.379> can

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
start processing and this one you can

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.409 
start processing and this one you can
see<00:04:06.560> there's<00:04:06.859> quite<00:04:06.949> a<00:04:07.040> bit<00:04:07.219> of<00:04:07.310> gold<00:04:07.430> there's

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
see there's quite a bit of gold there's

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.539 
see there's quite a bit of gold there's
also<00:04:08.629> these<00:04:08.930> big<00:04:09.139> capacitors<00:04:09.859> I'll<00:04:10.250> show<00:04:10.459> you

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
also these big capacitors I'll show you

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.219 
also these big capacitors I'll show you
those<00:04:10.699> in<00:04:10.879> just<00:04:10.909> a<00:04:11.150> second<00:04:13.209> we've<00:04:14.209> got<00:04:14.239> lots<00:04:15.109> of

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
those in just a second we've got lots of

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.569 
those in just a second we've got lots of
different<00:04:15.500> parts<00:04:15.799> that<00:04:15.979> aren't<00:04:16.070> resellable

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
different parts that aren't resellable

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.430 
different parts that aren't resellable
but<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.479> can<00:04:17.630> see<00:04:17.780> that<00:04:17.930> there's<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.169> lot<00:04:18.349> of

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
but you can see that there's a lot of

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.909 
but you can see that there's a lot of
these<00:04:18.530> gold-plated<00:04:19.780> locations<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:21.650> the

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
these gold-plated locations that the

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.310 
these gold-plated locations that the
people<00:04:22.330> took<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.449> lot<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.599> time<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.990> put<00:04:24.139> them

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
people took a lot of time to put them

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.469 
people took a lot of time to put them
into<00:04:24.590> but<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.580> only<00:04:25.729> thing<00:04:26.029> for<00:04:26.210> reclamation

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
into but the only thing for reclamation

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.400 
into but the only thing for reclamation
is<00:04:26.870> just<00:04:27.080> get

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
is just get

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.810 
is just get
I'm<00:04:27.440> out<00:04:27.560> of<00:04:27.590> there<00:04:27.770> so<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.370> got<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.580> just<00:04:28.730> go

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
I'm out of there so you got to just go

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.340 
I'm out of there so you got to just go
through<00:04:28.850> with<00:04:29.150> your<00:04:29.270> cutters<00:04:29.630> cut<00:04:30.110> all<00:04:30.230> the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
through with your cutters cut all the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.860 
through with your cutters cut all the
little<00:04:30.560> resistors<00:04:30.950> out<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.630> just<00:04:32.630> dig<00:04:32.840> down

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
little resistors out and just dig down

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.570 
little resistors out and just dig down
in<00:04:33.230> there<00:04:33.410> just<00:04:33.590> keep<00:04:33.800> going<00:04:34.100> at<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:34.460> only

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
in there just keep going at it it only

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.480 
in there just keep going at it it only
takes<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.940> few<00:04:35.060> minutes<00:04:35.560> let<00:04:36.560> me<00:04:36.620> show<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.800> real

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
takes a few minutes let me show you real

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.450 
takes a few minutes let me show you real
quickly<00:04:37.670> on<00:04:38.000> these<00:04:38.840> capacitors<00:04:39.470> some<00:04:40.370> of

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
quickly on these capacitors some of

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.030 
quickly on these capacitors some of
these<00:04:40.550> capacitors<00:04:41.180> have<00:04:41.620> silver<00:04:42.620> value<00:04:42.770> in

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
these capacitors have silver value in

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.920 
these capacitors have silver value in
them<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.420> sometimes<00:04:44.420> you'll<00:04:44.570> find<00:04:44.720> other

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
them and sometimes you'll find other

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.930 
them and sometimes you'll find other
parts<00:04:45.350> by<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.560> way<00:04:45.710> there's<00:04:45.920> a<00:04:45.980> nice<00:04:46.820> little

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
parts by the way there's a nice little

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.150 
parts by the way there's a nice little
gold-plated<00:04:47.660> piece<00:04:47.870> with<00:04:48.170> the<00:04:48.380> long<00:04:48.680> it's<00:04:49.070> a

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
gold-plated piece with the long it's a

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.000 
gold-plated piece with the long it's a
transistor<00:04:49.730> with<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.030> really<00:04:50.960> long<00:04:51.170> wires<00:04:51.680> on

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
transistor with the really long wires on

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.490 
transistor with the really long wires on
it<00:04:52.040> so<00:04:52.370> that<00:04:52.730> is<00:04:53.030> really<00:04:53.330> nice<00:04:53.510> that's<00:04:54.140> got

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
it so that is really nice that's got

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.670 
it so that is really nice that's got
this<00:04:55.070> aluminum<00:04:55.520> around<00:04:55.760> it<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:56.720> it<00:04:57.110> still<00:04:57.380> got

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
this aluminum around it so it still got

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.050 
this aluminum around it so it still got
a<00:04:57.740> little<00:04:57.920> bit<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.100> work<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.310> do<00:04:58.580> probably<00:04:58.970> have

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
a little bit of work to do probably have

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.590 
a little bit of work to do probably have
to<00:04:59.180> heat<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.510> up<00:04:59.570> and<00:04:59.870> pull<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.140> apart<00:05:00.230> and

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
to heat that up and pull it apart and

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.330 
to heat that up and pull it apart and
get<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:02.690> out<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:02.810> there<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.260> can't<00:05:03.470> just<00:05:03.560> go<00:05:04.160> in

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
get it out of there you can't just go in

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.370 
get it out of there you can't just go in
you<00:05:04.520> could<00:05:04.700> chemically<00:05:05.120> melt<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.420> down<00:05:05.450> but

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
you could chemically melt it down but

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.020 
you could chemically melt it down but
you're<00:05:06.470> going<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:06.650> have<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.770> lot<00:05:07.010> of<00:05:07.220> excess

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
you're going to have a lot of excess

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.020 
you're going to have a lot of excess
metal<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.740> typically<00:05:10.130> put<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.520> over<00:05:10.670> into

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
metal so I typically put that over into

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.540 
metal so I typically put that over into
the<00:05:11.180> into<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.720> larger<00:05:12.170> parts<00:05:12.470> bucket<00:05:12.890> like<00:05:13.310> this

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
the into a larger parts bucket like this

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.640 
the into a larger parts bucket like this
you<00:05:13.790> know<00:05:13.880> it's<00:05:14.060> a<00:05:14.180> piece<00:05:14.990> that<00:05:15.200> needs<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.500> be

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
you know it's a piece that needs to be

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.580 
you know it's a piece that needs to be
worked<00:05:16.520> with<00:05:17.260> anyway<00:05:18.260> back<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.440> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
worked with anyway back to the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.610 
worked with anyway back to the
capacitors<00:05:19.070> real<00:05:19.250> quick<00:05:19.490> to<00:05:19.670> wrap<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:20.240> up

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
capacitors real quick to wrap this up

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.290 
capacitors real quick to wrap this up
some<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:21.740> them<00:05:21.860> have<00:05:22.040> some<00:05:22.430> silver<00:05:22.670> content<00:05:23.120> in

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
some of them have some silver content in

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.420 
some of them have some silver content in
them<00:05:23.420> be<00:05:24.200> careful<00:05:24.680> you<00:05:24.860> should<00:05:25.010> wear<00:05:25.130> gloves

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
them be careful you should wear gloves

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.370 
them be careful you should wear gloves
when<00:05:25.700> you<00:05:25.790> do<00:05:25.940> that<00:05:26.120> because<00:05:26.330> there's<00:05:26.750> some

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
when you do that because there's some

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.590 
when you do that because there's some
electrolyte<00:05:27.860> that<00:05:27.890> sometimes<00:05:28.460> is<00:05:28.700> not<00:05:29.150> very

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
electrolyte that sometimes is not very

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.750 
electrolyte that sometimes is not very
good<00:05:29.810> chemical<00:05:30.230> stuff<00:05:30.440> on<00:05:30.650> it<00:05:30.770> it's<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.640> good

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
good chemical stuff on it it's a good

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.610 
good chemical stuff on it it's a good
idea<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:32.180> do<00:05:32.540> that<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.810> can<00:05:32.900> just<00:05:33.080> slice<00:05:33.440> them

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
idea to do that you can just slice them

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.710 
idea to do that you can just slice them
open<00:05:33.740> with<00:05:33.920> a<00:05:34.040> knife<00:05:34.250> use<00:05:34.490> a<00:05:34.520> pair<00:05:34.760> of<00:05:35.060> cutters

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
open with a knife use a pair of cutters

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.960 
open with a knife use a pair of cutters
and<00:05:35.990> just<00:05:36.050> trim<00:05:36.380> them<00:05:36.470> back<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:37.580> outside

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
and just trim them back the outside

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.690 
and just trim them back the outside
casings<00:05:38.450> are<00:05:38.570> aluminum<00:05:39.020> inside<00:05:39.680> there<00:05:40.340> they

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
casings are aluminum inside there they

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.100 
casings are aluminum inside there they
could<00:05:40.850> be<00:05:40.970> aluminum<00:05:41.360> but<00:05:41.570> sometimes<00:05:41.930> they're

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
could be aluminum but sometimes they're

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.290 
could be aluminum but sometimes they're
silver<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:43.190> you<00:05:43.430> can<00:05:43.550> see<00:05:43.730> kind<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:44.000> what<00:05:44.120> that

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
silver and you can see kind of what that

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.720 
silver and you can see kind of what that
looks<00:05:44.600> like<00:05:44.660> here<00:05:44.990> is<00:05:45.140> just<00:05:45.320> a<00:05:45.500> kind<00:05:46.340> of<00:05:46.370> a<00:05:46.490> tape

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
looks like here is just a kind of a tape

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.000 
looks like here is just a kind of a tape
that<00:05:47.030> comes<00:05:47.660> out<00:05:47.870> most<00:05:48.530> of<00:05:48.650> these<00:05:48.770> are

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
that comes out most of these are

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.070 
that comes out most of these are
aluminum<00:05:49.280> but<00:05:50.120> I<00:05:50.150> have<00:05:50.360> found<00:05:50.540> a<00:05:50.690> couple<00:05:50.900> that

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
aluminum but I have found a couple that

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.200 
aluminum but I have found a couple that
I've<00:05:51.230> tested<00:05:51.710> for<00:05:51.890> silver<00:05:52.250> so<00:05:52.850> I<00:05:52.910> just<00:05:53.060> thought

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
I've tested for silver so I just thought

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.400 
I've tested for silver so I just thought
I'd<00:05:53.360> just<00:05:53.510> show<00:05:53.690> you<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.900> whole<00:05:54.050> thing<00:05:54.260> right

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
I'd just show you the whole thing right

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.900 
I'd just show you the whole thing right
there<00:05:54.680> anyway

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
there anyway

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.880 
there anyway
obviously<00:05:56.690> what<00:05:56.810> you're<00:05:56.960> going<00:05:57.140> after<00:05:57.440> is<00:05:57.590> is

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
obviously what you're going after is is

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.890 
obviously what you're going after is is
this<00:05:58.100> gold<00:05:58.370> reclamation<00:05:59.330> stuff<00:05:59.570> right<00:05:59.720> in

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
this gold reclamation stuff right in

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.320 
this gold reclamation stuff right in
here<00:06:00.140> and<00:06:00.260> then<00:06:01.040> you<00:06:01.400> can<00:06:01.610> further<00:06:01.850> clean<00:06:02.150> that

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
here and then you can further clean that

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.700 
here and then you can further clean that
down<00:06:02.570> you<00:06:03.230> can<00:06:03.350> see<00:06:03.470> there's<00:06:03.650> little

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
down you can see there's little

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.440 
down you can see there's little
transistors<00:06:04.370> in<00:06:04.580> there<00:06:04.790> there's<00:06:05.000> all<00:06:05.150> kinds

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
transistors in there there's all kinds

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.340 
transistors in there there's all kinds
of<00:06:05.540> little<00:06:06.320> parts<00:06:06.710> and<00:06:06.830> things<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:08.260> some<00:06:09.260> of

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
of little parts and things and some of

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.450 
of little parts and things and some of
that<00:06:09.440> needs<00:06:09.620> to<00:06:09.680> be<00:06:09.770> broken<00:06:09.919> down<00:06:10.190> a<00:06:10.250> little

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
that needs to be broken down a little

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.620 
that needs to be broken down a little
bit<00:06:10.610> further<00:06:10.910> but<00:06:11.720> that<00:06:11.780> can<00:06:12.050> be<00:06:12.110> done<00:06:12.290> by<00:06:13.630> just

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
bit further but that can be done by just

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.740 
bit further but that can be done by just
taking<00:06:15.080> a<00:06:15.490> pestle<00:06:16.490> or<00:06:16.520> whatever<00:06:16.910> and<00:06:17.150> chopping

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
taking a pestle or whatever and chopping

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.930 
taking a pestle or whatever and chopping
down<00:06:17.990> breaking<00:06:18.410> it<00:06:18.590> into<00:06:18.830> parts<00:06:19.070> a<00:06:19.400> little<00:06:19.850> bit

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
down breaking it into parts a little bit

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.420 
down breaking it into parts a little bit
of<00:06:20.060> pressure<00:06:20.720> applied<00:06:21.020> and<00:06:21.440> all<00:06:22.070> that'll<00:06:22.250> work

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
of pressure applied and all that'll work

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.180 
of pressure applied and all that'll work
great<00:06:22.640> yeah<00:06:23.540> that's<00:06:23.810> a<00:06:24.110> that's<00:06:24.560> these<00:06:24.800> little

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
great yeah that's a that's these little

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.150 
great yeah that's a that's these little

things sometimes these has some retail

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.320 
things sometimes these has some retail
resale<00:06:30.860> value<00:06:31.280> you<00:06:31.430> need<00:06:31.580> to<00:06:31.700> double<00:06:32.300> check

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
resale value you need to double check

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.190 
resale value you need to double check
and<00:06:32.750> you<00:06:33.620> know<00:06:33.710> look<00:06:34.070> on<00:06:34.190> different<00:06:34.640> places

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
and you know look on different places
