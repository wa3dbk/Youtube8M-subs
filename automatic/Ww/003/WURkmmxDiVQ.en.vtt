00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.280
 what 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:16.360
 how 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.150
 let's prepare lemon cakes and in 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.669

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.280
 huge for you gorgeous 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.730
 The ingredients we need are 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.489
 for the mass of 150 grams of flour 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.860
 force 30 grams of sugar 4 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.830
 teaspoons of average cornstarch 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.970
 teaspoon of salt and 125 grams of 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:48.720
 butter and for the flan 180 ml of 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.629
 lemon juice 250 grams of sugar 6 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.090
 eggs the zest of a lemon and 5 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.060
 tablespoons of strength flour 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.079
 let's put the flour together with the 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.039
 cornstarch 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.039
 and we mix it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.900
 we dump it on a bigger bowl 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.340
 we add the sugar the salt and the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.340
 butter that has to be to 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.790
 We will mix the room temperature 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.790
 or with a fork or with a blender 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.220
 and in the end we will have to get what 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 what are you seeing in the image 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.440
 now let's grease a square mold 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.960
 24 x 24 centimeters we dump the dough 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.640
 and with the help of our hands the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.640
 let's adapt to the bottom of the mold 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.450
 and now we're going to bake it for 20 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.430
 minutes with 180 preheated oven 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.820
 degrees 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.550
 meanwhile we prepare the flan in a 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.680
 blender or arm blender 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.100
 we put all the ingredients 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.240
 eggs 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.240
 the lemon juice 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.440
 and the sugar 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.569
 the lemon zest that has to be 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.050
 only the yellow part since the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.990
 bitter white part and the tablespoons of 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.810
 strength flour 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.880
 we beat everything 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.060
 and you already see that the plan is very 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.480
 simple to do so we take out the mold from 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.150
 oven that has to be slightly 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.819
 gilt the dough overturned the lemon flan 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.099
 over 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:45.360
 and now we bake it again but this 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:48.330
 once at 150 degrees and for 40 45 minutes 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.080
 After the time we took it out of the oven and 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.200
 we let it cool 15 minutes 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.640
 we are going to cut it in squares of the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.640
 size we prefer 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.640
 sprinkle icing sugar on top 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.270
 and we're going to move them to a plate of 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.880
 presentation and ready we have our 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.209
 lemon cupcakes or squares of 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.209
 lemon
