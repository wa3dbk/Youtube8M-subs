Raisins - 2 tbsp

00:00:57.056 --> 00:01:06.848
Weâ€™ll have to peel mango first to take out the pulp and then grate it to prepare Aam Ka Chunda.

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:09.288
Peel the mangoes first.

00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:23.589
We have peeled the raw mango first.

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.838
Take out the pulp from it now.

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:31.556
We can grate them directly also.

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:36.124
Here, we will grate them in a food processor.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.480

00:01:49.937 --> 00:01:51.818

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:19.568
Take out grated mangoes in a bowl.

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.937
Mix sugar in it.

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:29.037
Keep it like this for 8 to 10 hours.

00:02:29.408 --> 00:02:36.167
You should mix the mixture, if you feel that the juice of mango is coming up after three to four hours.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.045
We will prepare Aam Ka Chunda
by cooking the mixture with all

00:02:42.046 --> 00:02:47.325
the ingredients when sugar in
the mixture is mixed properly.

00:02:47.816 --> 00:02:54.692
Traditionally, Aam Ka Chunda is prepared in Sun which takes about 8 to 10 days.

00:02:55.038 --> 00:03:02.691
We will keep it like this for 10 hours and we will prepare Chunda after that.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.133
The sugar has melted in it since 10 hours have passed.

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:14.008

Cut the almonds and Pista and peel the cardamom till the time this cooks.

00:03:56.316 --> 00:04:00.777
The mixture is becoming thick.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:10.091
Add almonds, Pista and raisins in it.

00:04:11.826 --> 00:04:14.691
It is boiling and bubbles are coming out of it.

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:17.185
Therefore, we have covered it with a lid.

00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:20.054
Stir it after every 2 to 3 minutes.

00:04:20.271 --> 00:04:24.620
We will cook it more since we have to make it thick.

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:32.319
The juice of mango has cooked now since it has turned thick.

00:04:32.785 --> 00:04:43.848
We can check it by taking a drop in a bowl. It should stay at its place.

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.502
Turn off the gas.

00:04:49.881 --> 00:04:51.952
Add powder of cardamom to it.

00:04:55.871 --> 00:05:08.693
It should be golden in color and it will be ready once it cools down.

00:05:09.044 --> 00:05:12.965
The drop in the bowl is viscous and is not flowing.

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:23.533
Take the Chunda out in the bowl.
