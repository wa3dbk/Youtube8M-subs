00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.109
 talk about the crazy animated series of 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.780
 cartoon network good adventure time 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.719
 let's start anyone would believe that this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.480
 It would be completely normal but it is no longer 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.510
 that this animated series is set on a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.820
 post apocalyptic time as shown 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.029
 in the various chapters of the series 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.150
 besides, it's based on what is said 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.640
 in several chapters the land of eye is 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.430
 a land after the great war of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.860
 mushrooms or mushrooms is easy 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.890
 deduce that this would be the next and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.250
 expected third world war judging 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.890
 for the following images this is the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.230
 Intro you can see several bombs 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.050
 unexploded and several items or 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.480

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.719
