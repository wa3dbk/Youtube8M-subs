of the all of the coding happens right

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.410 
of the all of the coding happens right
here<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.850> doesn't<00:01:06.119> make<00:01:06.210> any<00:01:06.390> noise

to you know get a high-definition signal
over<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.090> television<00:01:15.420> set<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.170> an

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
over to that television set to be an

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
over to that television set to be an
awesome<00:01:16.680> way<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.580> look<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.790> dual

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
awesome way to go you can look up dual

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670 
awesome way to go you can look up dual
monitors<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.930> no<00:01:19.080> problem<00:01:19.110> but

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
monitors you can do that no problem but

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.289 
monitors you can do that no problem but
one<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> reasons<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
one of the reasons I really like this

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.030 
one of the reasons I really like this
one<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.570> because<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.900> uses<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> silent

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
one is because it uses the silent

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.030 
one is because it uses the silent
cooling<00:01:23.490> take<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> look<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.869> fan<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
cooling take a look at the the fan of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.219 
cooling take a look at the the fan of
which<00:01:26.280> there's<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.869> large

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
which there's not one it's just a large

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.410 
which there's not one it's just a large
heat<00:01:28.680> say<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.130> keeps<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.640> cool<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
heat say now this keeps it cool at the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.609 
heat say now this keeps it cool at the
same<00:01:30.600> time<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.869> doesn't<00:01:31.049> make<00:01:31.140> any<00:01:31.350> noise<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
same time it doesn't make any noise and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
same time it doesn't make any noise and
the<00:01:31.950> last<00:01:32.189> thing<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.210> while

about<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.579> that's<00:03:15.090> with<00:03:15.329> no<00:03:15.359> filters<00:03:15.989> no

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
about this that's with no filters no

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.539 
about this that's with no filters no
anti-aliasing<00:03:16.439> but<00:03:16.950> everything<00:03:17.220> else<00:03:17.400> on

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.309 
anti-aliasing but everything else on
high<00:03:17.760> quality<00:03:18.389> now<00:03:18.780> if<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.959> turn<00:03:19.169> the

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
high quality now if you turn the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.640 
high quality now if you turn the
anti-aliasing<00:03:20.010> up<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.400> 4x<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:22.109> still<00:03:22.379> runs<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
anti-aliasing up to 4x it still runs the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.379 
anti-aliasing up to 4x it still runs the
game<00:03:22.829> at<00:03:23.010> 55<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:23.760> only<00:03:23.849> dropped<00:03:24.150> four

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
game at 55 so it only dropped four

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.030 
game at 55 so it only dropped four
frames<00:03:24.660> per<00:03:24.810> second<00:03:25.139> if<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.560> want<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.769> turn<00:03:25.889> on

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
frames per second if you want to turn on

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.379 
frames per second if you want to turn on
all<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.220> filters<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:26.760> get<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:26.940> smooth<00:03:27.150> edges

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
all the filters and get the smooth edges

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.990 
all the filters and get the smooth edges
so<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.230> does<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.440> well<00:03:28.769> but<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.459> main<00:03:29.730> thing

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
so it does that well but the main thing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.729 
so it does that well but the main thing
for<00:03:30.269> me<00:03:30.599> about<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:30.959> card<00:03:31.199> is<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.500> fact<00:03:31.680> that

for me about this card is the fact that

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.729 
for me about this card is the fact that
it's<00:03:31.919> HDCP<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.049> that<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.139> has<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.620> ins

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
it's HDCP and that it has all the ins

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.960 
it's HDCP and that it has all the ins
and<00:03:34.829> outs<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.159> need<00:03:35.340> speaking<00:03:35.699> ins<00:03:35.819> and

come with one in the box if you wanted

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.689 
come with one in the box if you wanted
to<00:04:01.590> run<00:04:01.709> like<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:01.919> component<00:04:02.280> or<00:04:02.459> something

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
to run like a component or something

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:03.920 
to run like a component or something
like<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.030> can<00:04:03.150> get<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.329> breakaway<00:04:03.900> that

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
like that you can get the breakaway that

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.599 
like that you can get the breakaway that
plugs<00:04:04.260> in<00:04:04.409> right<00:04:04.560> there<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:04.889> that<00:04:05.370> will<00:04:05.459> do

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
plugs in right there and that will do

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.869 
plugs in right there and that will do
1080i<00:04:06.229> so<00:04:07.229> you<00:04:08.069> can<00:04:08.190> do<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> high<00:04:08.699> definition

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
1080i so you can do a high definition

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:09.979 
1080i so you can do a high definition
with<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.419> as<00:04:09.569> well

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
with that as well

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.780 
with that as well
really<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.769> really<00:04:11.190> really<00:04:11.489> cool<00:04:11.669> that

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
really it really really cool that

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.430
