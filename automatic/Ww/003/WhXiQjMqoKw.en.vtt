00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
hey guys got a quick little combo

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.710 
hey guys got a quick little combo
tutorial<00:00:57.350> here<00:00:57.500> for<00:00:57.769> you<00:00:57.890> this<00:00:58.460> is<00:00:58.730> based<00:00:59.449> off

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
tutorial here for you this is based off

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.830 
tutorial here for you this is based off
the<00:00:59.989> equinox<00:01:00.559> by<00:01:00.890> rims<00:01:01.239> basically<00:01:02.239> follows

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
the equinox by rims basically follows

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.630 
the equinox by rims basically follows
the<00:01:02.930> same<00:01:03.050> structure<00:01:03.469> as<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.800> equinoxes<00:01:04.250> a

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
the same structure as the equinoxes a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.600 
the same structure as the equinoxes a
little<00:01:04.909> bit<00:01:05.000> different<00:01:06.220> gotta<00:01:07.220> start<00:01:07.490> with

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
little bit different gotta start with

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.399 
little bit different gotta start with
the<00:01:07.790> knife<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.420> closed<00:01:08.690> forward<00:01:09.140> grip

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
the knife and the closed forward grip

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.800 
the knife and the closed forward grip
here<00:01:09.649> by<00:01:09.890> hand<00:01:10.130> on<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.460> left<00:01:10.700> can<00:01:11.420> we<00:01:11.509> go<00:01:11.659> into

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
here by hand on the left can we go into

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.340 
here by hand on the left can we go into
your<00:01:12.020> basic<00:01:12.229> horizontal<00:01:13.130> opening<00:01:14.200> giving<00:01:15.200> it

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
your basic horizontal opening giving it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.859 
your basic horizontal opening giving it
an<00:01:15.500> extra<00:01:16.009> half<00:01:16.220> turn<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.330> there's<00:01:17.659> basically

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
an extra half turn so there's basically

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.700 
an extra half turn so there's basically
three<00:01:18.259> half<00:01:18.649> turns<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:19.190> half<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.909> half<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.020> a

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
three half turns a half a half and a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.980 
three half turns a half a half and a
half<00:01:21.740> you're<00:01:22.490> gonna<00:01:22.640> end<00:01:22.970> with<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.450> spine<00:01:23.780> of

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
half you're gonna end with the spine of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.320 
half you're gonna end with the spine of
the<00:01:24.080> blade<00:01:24.170> on<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.770> left<00:01:24.979> here<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:25.429> slow

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
the blade on the left here so slow

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.550 
the blade on the left here so slow
motion<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:26.869> would<00:01:26.990> look<00:01:27.110> like<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:29.560> now

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
motion it would look like this now

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.310 
motion it would look like this now
you're<00:01:30.860> going<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.490> use<00:01:32.179> a<00:01:32.210> circular<00:01:32.630> motion

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
you're going to use a circular motion

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.380 
you're going to use a circular motion
turning<00:01:33.710> your<00:01:33.800> palm<00:01:34.039> down<00:01:34.390> moving

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
turning your palm down moving

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.410 
turning your palm down moving
counterclockwise<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.729> I<00:01:37.940> guess<00:01:38.149> you<00:01:38.300> would

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
counterclockwise and I guess you would

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.350 
counterclockwise and I guess you would
call<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.869> wrist<00:01:39.229> pass<00:01:39.470> motion<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.880> you're

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
call it a wrist pass motion and you're

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.330 
call it a wrist pass motion and you're
gonna<00:01:41.450> go<00:01:41.690> directly<00:01:42.110> into<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.619> fan<00:01:43.009> or<00:01:43.310> a

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
gonna go directly into a fan or a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.770 
gonna go directly into a fan or a
helicopter<00:01:43.520> or<00:01:44.030> whatever<00:01:44.300> you<00:01:44.390> want<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.600> call

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
helicopter or whatever you want to call

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.010 
helicopter or whatever you want to call
it<00:01:44.960> for<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.560> single<00:01:45.950> rotation<00:01:46.690> so<00:01:47.690> turn

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
it for a single rotation so turn

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.510 
it for a single rotation so turn
counterclockwise<00:01:48.530> turning<00:01:49.490> palm<00:01:49.819> down

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
counterclockwise turning palm down

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.190 
counterclockwise turning palm down
allowing<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.790> knife<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:54.610> fan<00:01:55.610> around<00:01:56.170> for<00:01:57.170> a

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
allowing the knife to fan around for a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.149 
allowing the knife to fan around for a
rotation<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.090> then<00:01:59.090> downwards<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
rotation and then downwards so the

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.789 
rotation and then downwards so the
outside<00:02:01.640> edge<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.930> safe<00:02:03.110> handle<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.649> now

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
outside edge of the safe handle is now

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.609 
outside edge of the safe handle is now
facing<00:02:04.100> up<00:02:04.490> towards<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:05.930> once<00:02:06.200> again<00:02:06.320> from

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
facing up towards you so once again from

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.539 
facing up towards you so once again from
the<00:02:06.710> beginning<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.280> slow<00:02:07.460> motion<00:02:12.280> now<00:02:13.280> it'll

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
the beginning and slow motion now it'll

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.940 
the beginning and slow motion now it'll
be<00:02:13.579> in<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:13.880> position<00:02:14.150> outside<00:02:15.019> edge<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.829> the

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
and from here you just swing up and

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.830 
and from here you just swing up and
they're<00:05:44.250> gonna<00:05:44.340> end<00:05:44.639> in<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:45.030> icepick<00:05:45.570> grip

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
they're gonna end in the icepick grip

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.990 
they're gonna end in the icepick grip
here<00:05:48.620> okay<00:05:49.620> so<00:05:49.650> here's<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.370> combo<00:05:50.850> again

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
here okay so here's the combo again

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.200 
here okay so here's the combo again
going<00:05:51.690> in<00:05:51.900> slow<00:05:52.200> steps<00:05:52.850> once<00:05:53.850> you<00:05:53.970> get<00:05:54.090> the

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
going in slow steps once you get the

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.150 
going in slow steps once you get the
steps<00:05:54.450> memorized<00:05:54.930> then<00:05:55.380> you<00:05:55.530> can<00:05:55.740> work<00:05:55.979> on

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
steps memorized then you can work on

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.250 
steps memorized then you can work on
eliminating<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.030> pauses<00:05:57.510> and<00:05:57.750> doing<00:05:58.169> the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
eliminating the pauses and doing the

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.980 
eliminating the pauses and doing the
combo<00:05:58.650> in<00:05:58.830> one<00:05:59.010> continuous<00:05:59.430> motion<00:05:59.850> so<00:06:00.780> once

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
combo in one continuous motion so once

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:25.170 
combo in one continuous motion so once
again<00:06:01.110> from<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.620> beginning<00:06:02.040> in<00:06:02.250> steps

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.760 

so<00:06:26.180> like<00:06:26.600> I<00:06:26.750> said<00:06:26.930> once<00:06:27.170> you<00:06:27.260> get<00:06:27.410> the<00:06:27.500> steps

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
so like I said once you get the steps

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.650 
so like I said once you get the steps
down<00:06:27.890> then<00:06:28.340> you<00:06:28.490> can<00:06:28.520> work<00:06:29.390> on<00:06:31.240> going<00:06:32.240> through

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
down then you can work on going through

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.710 
down then you can work on going through
the<00:06:33.530> combo<00:06:33.920> from<00:06:34.070> beginning<00:06:34.580> to<00:06:34.670> end

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
the combo from beginning to end

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.780 
the combo from beginning to end
eliminating<00:06:35.720> any<00:06:35.960> pauses<00:06:36.530> and<00:06:36.860> continuing

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
eliminating any pauses and continuing

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.060 
eliminating any pauses and continuing
the<00:06:37.940> momentum<00:06:38.060> all<00:06:38.990> the<00:06:39.290> way<00:06:39.410> through<00:06:39.620> hope

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
the momentum all the way through hope

00:06:40.070 --> 00:07:16.200 
the momentum all the way through hope
you<00:06:40.220> enjoyed

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:26.510
