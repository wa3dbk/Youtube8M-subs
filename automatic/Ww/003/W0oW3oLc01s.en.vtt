00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 a lot of walking and it's about the 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.530
 continued by our editor dirk 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.719
 the whole of this here in the e 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.000
 In retrospect I correct it 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.160
 basically gives a vote 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 we should take care of it there are two 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.199
 possibilities 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.359
 this is a little bit now 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.970
 post-processing the roman empire like 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.429
 we were to normally 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.730
 here are a few individual independently to 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.430
 Example Queen quite funny areas 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.610
 partly that's what I have here now 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.309
 solved because in my eyes so 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.590
 later my eyes are so wise 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.360
 how to convert to when should 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.050
 you really have to convert completely byzanz 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.190
 especially with the independent kings 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.430
 after something for the holy Roman 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.750
 rich, by the way, exists 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.699
 converted savegames is still there 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.320
 but a little smaller 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.210
 I have a screenshot aim 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 a bit small but it is too 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.439
 comparatively no matter 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.490
 that's pretty much true 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:11.549
 the things we conquered though 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.369
 So here then sicily southern Italy 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.710
 here the small areas up here 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.240
 Croatia here byzanz also here 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.460
 with the small dent the one 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.930
 not really good they are the ones 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.330
 provinces in eur since we are natural 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.640
 Of course, it was much more spacious 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.299
 the whole world is contained here 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.770
 apart from asia, however, then here 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.780
 of course, the areas of joke 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.579
 from here down to here 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.990
 Jerusalem is a continuous line 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.720
 the larger provinces alexandria tunis 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.670
 and for the north Italian goodness something 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.290
 we just conquered that would be one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.470
 possibility one could say money from 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.030
 Go here and try the rest today 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.570
 the rest of the roman empire too 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.610
 so set up maximum extent or what 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.930
 you can find it in the direction 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.930
 certainly always a small picture 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.909
 roman empire and what it is possible 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.670
 yes a possibility that we are 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.730
 pretty big accordingly 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:18.209
 of course, too 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:19.069
 pretty powerful and there is a nice one 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.610
 image 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.450
 of course, of course 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.780
 relatively powerful but have it 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.780
 we also have a much stronger one 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.360
 position to just then the rest of 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.980
 Roman empire I say now 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.180
 something not quite so 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.100
 simple as that 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.000
 the possibility you but something 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.340
 now that would be so of course 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.950
 that would have to be about the maximum 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.300
 stretch his look just that is 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.970
 just the biggest picture I found 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.700
 have 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.830
 it should be fine 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.890
 That should be already and of course 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.190
 already powerful goal but just from the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.830
 current position quite possible that 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.830
 would be just with the already shown 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.440
 startPosition times now recover briefly 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.780
 so that others would come as I said 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.220
 the city â€‹â€‹position the other 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.660
 possibility would be I have it now 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.010
 cut a little bit together as 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.530
 It was also a consideration even when I was 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.329
 to start small, so to speak, it is 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.670
 so here own me here 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.260
 southern Italy and actually so 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.989
 pretty much everything I have here now 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.630
 the two islands here we have group 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.250
 opel because that is still the capital 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.019
 and the province and the ten provinces 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.910
 I want then just at the beginning of 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.750
 play, so to speak, to the nation 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.670
 give away 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.989
 I have on the fast the province 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.239
 this is not partial to that now 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.160
 just about kings 2 by release 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.209
 partly but also simply over the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.620
 console made because there is no 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.390
 typical quarrels give people the one 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.489
 are a bit sensitive like me again 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.890
 had to find again at xfx but 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.480
 That was easy to set up 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.650
 starting position may be interesting 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.170
 you would see here now too 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.470
 I fixed the problems the nation the 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.940
 now all pretty good-provoking 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.519
 half the old names are in it 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.250
 I also say no matter what 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.269
 pretty german names probably 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.180
 also will the 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.930
 there will probably be the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.220
 improving the community college 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.970
 perhaps is pure again I know 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.220
 not exactly 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.050
 he may almost be 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.819
 otherwise can you do it if you 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.770
 old, of course, the same with the other if 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.210
 I should play this are just those 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.319
 two possibilities that we stop 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.259
 small start 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.690
 both of course normal november 14 44 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.919
 no further modifications is also 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.759
 I do not quite believe that 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.050
 compatible with the links saves too 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.520
 That's why it's my eyes 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.050
 no real option everyone knows that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.440
 two possibilities we have 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.940
 small or big that is of course one 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.620
 much bigger challenge no 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.550
 theme, of course, is the 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.770
 ask why then ingo 6 2 have everything 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.360
 conquered so to speak but I agree 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.069
 leave it up to you to draw 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.419
 vince drew and decided 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.069
 But it is up to you to decide it yourself 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.870
 will show it was opinion 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:22.800
 interest 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.380
 Of course I do not know if I have it 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.639
 that really up to the whole extent 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.490
 play because it pulls then already 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.599
 long way because this house so 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.919
 I want to think about this 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.659
 every case for the entire training 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.810
 I would play with him 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.009
 superior as I said sounds like that 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.349
 he knows the voting form 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:44.270
 now your choice 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.270
 we see ourselves very pleased they made
