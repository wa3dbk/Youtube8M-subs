00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
that's actually 24 beater four star if

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.479 
that's actually 24 beater four star if
you<00:02:34.780> booked<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.049> like<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.349> if<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.040> have<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
you booked it like that if you have the

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.099 
you booked it like that if you have the
protection<00:02:37.000> which<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.329> sort<00:02:37.629> of<00:02:37.689> do<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:37.989> this

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
protection which you sort of do in this

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.250 
protection which you sort of do in this
Dec<00:02:38.459> dark<00:02:39.459> core<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.239> kind<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.900> like<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.049> bad

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
Dec dark core this is kind of like a bad

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.899 
Dec dark core this is kind of like a bad
smashing<00:02:41.739> ground<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.189> discard<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.579> card<00:02:42.609> and

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
smashing ground you discard a card and

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.179 
smashing ground you discard a card and
move<00:02:43.120> from<00:02:43.480> playing<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> face-up<00:02:43.989> monster<00:02:44.530> so

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
move from playing a face-up monster so

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.770 
move from playing a face-up monster so
it's<00:02:45.340> all<00:02:45.430> right<00:02:45.609> it<00:02:45.700> doesn't<00:02:45.849> destroy<00:02:46.269> but

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
it's all right it doesn't destroy but

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.360 
it's all right it doesn't destroy but
you<00:02:46.959> do<00:02:47.049> have<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.260> discard<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.829> card<00:02:47.859> so<00:02:48.189> it's<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
you do have to discard a card so it's a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.740 
you do have to discard a card so it's a
minus<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:51.370> play<00:02:51.519> three<00:02:51.849> enemy<00:02:52.239> controllers

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
minus we play three enemy controllers

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.990 
minus we play three enemy controllers
because<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.439> card's<00:02:53.739> really<00:02:54.340> good<00:02:54.549> and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
because this card's really good and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.970 
because this card's really good and
Kaiba<00:02:55.359> definitely<00:02:55.959> does<00:02:56.290> use<00:02:56.620> enemy

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
Kaiba definitely does use enemy

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.789 
Kaiba definitely does use enemy
controller<00:02:58.109> you<00:02:59.109> actually<00:02:59.230> do<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.590> ways

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
controller you actually do have ways

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.740 
controller you actually do have ways
making<00:03:00.129> this<00:03:00.280> go<00:03:00.430> off<00:03:00.579> like<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.909> said<00:03:01.180> Peyton<00:03:01.510> is

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
making this go off like I said Peyton is

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.690 
making this go off like I said Peyton is
like<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.930> Tengu<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.799> do<00:03:02.919> play<00:03:03.159> other<00:03:03.310> cards

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
like a Tengu and you do play other cards

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.069 
like a Tengu and you do play other cards
that<00:03:03.849> work<00:03:04.000> well<00:03:04.180> with<00:03:04.389> it<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:04.689> I'll<00:03:04.780> get<00:03:04.900> to

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
that work well with it then I'll get to

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.500 
that work well with it then I'll get to
later<00:03:05.370> plus<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.549> can<00:03:06.669> just<00:03:06.849> shift<00:03:07.329> their

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
later plus you can just shift their

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.229 
later plus you can just shift their
monster<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.930> defense<00:03:08.139> if<00:03:08.409> you're<00:03:08.530> desperate

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
monster to defense if you're desperate

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.170 
monster to defense if you're desperate
one<00:03:10.239> megamorph<00:03:10.750> cabbie<00:03:11.049> uses<00:03:11.409> this<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:12.180> it's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
one megamorph cabbie uses this and it's

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.940 
one megamorph cabbie uses this and it's
all<00:03:13.269> right<00:03:13.510> like<00:03:13.780> if<00:03:13.959> your<00:03:14.290> lower<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.799> life

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
all right like if your lower in life

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.199 
all right like if your lower in life
points<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.430> get<00:03:15.549> this<00:03:15.639> out<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.879> blue<00:03:16.030> eyes

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
points and you get this out of blue eyes

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.080 
points and you get this out of blue eyes
it<00:03:16.419> goes<00:03:16.569> to<00:03:17.400> 6,000<00:03:18.400> for<00:03:18.639> one<00:03:18.819> attack

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
it goes to 6,000 for one attack

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.020 
it goes to 6,000 for one attack
basically<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.620> can<00:03:20.949> usually<00:03:21.370> win<00:03:21.819> after

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
basically and you can usually win after

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.089 
basically and you can usually win after
that<00:03:22.299> but<00:03:22.959> it's<00:03:23.109> not<00:03:23.229> that<00:03:23.260> great<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:23.709> we<00:03:23.979> do

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
that but it's not that great so we do

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.080 
that but it's not that great so we do
only<00:03:24.250> play<00:03:24.459> one<00:03:25.889> monster<00:03:26.889> reborn<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:27.909> is

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
only play one monster reborn this is

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.909 
only play one monster reborn this is
obvious<00:03:28.449> let's<00:03:28.629> table<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.989> Kaiba<00:03:29.349> plays<00:03:29.650> and

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
obvious let's table that Kaiba plays and

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.080 
obvious let's table that Kaiba plays and
everyone<00:03:30.250> plays<00:03:31.229> three<00:03:32.229> MST<00:03:32.650> he<00:03:33.069> uses<00:03:33.639> MST

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
everyone plays three MST he uses MST

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.170 
everyone plays three MST he uses MST
during<00:03:34.479> battle<00:03:34.810> City<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.290> think<00:03:35.470> and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
during battle City and I think and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.069 
during battle City and I think and
obviously<00:03:37.180> since<00:03:37.510> we<00:03:37.599> can't<00:03:37.780> play<00:03:37.900> heavy

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
obviously since we can't play heavy

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.569 
obviously since we can't play heavy
storm<00:03:38.169> or<00:03:38.590> anything<00:03:38.919> else<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.310> be<00:03:39.370> played

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
storm or anything else to be played

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.839 
storm or anything else to be played
three<00:03:39.790> MST<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> mystic<00:03:41.099> one<00:03:42.099> no<00:03:42.310> woman<00:03:42.609> this<00:03:42.729> is

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
three MST a mystic one no woman this is

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.509 
three MST a mystic one no woman this is
kind<00:03:43.030> of<00:03:43.090> tech<00:03:43.329> basically<00:03:43.989> but<00:03:44.650> also<00:03:44.859> he<00:03:45.159> uses

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
kind of tech basically but also he uses

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.490 
kind of tech basically but also he uses
it<00:03:45.669> and<00:03:45.819> it's<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.209> decent<00:03:46.750> card<00:03:46.959> basically<00:03:47.319> you

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
it and it's a decent card basically you

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.050 
it and it's a decent card basically you
just<00:03:47.530> look<00:03:47.739> for<00:03:47.889> a<00:03:47.919> good<00:03:48.040> car<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.579> you<00:03:48.669> thrown

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
just look for a good car that you thrown

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.050
