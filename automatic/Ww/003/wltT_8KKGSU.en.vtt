as<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.350> can<00:00:04.440> see<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:04.920> am<00:00:05.400> training<00:00:05.670> on<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
as you can see I am training on the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.450 
as you can see I am training on the
crimson<00:00:07.140> skill<00:00:07.350> chompers<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> moment<00:00:08.309> and

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
crimson skill chompers at the moment and

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.430 
crimson skill chompers at the moment and
that<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.580> because<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.420> figure<00:00:10.050> out<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.380> I

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
that is because I figure out that I

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.589 
that is because I figure out that I
could<00:00:10.740> probably<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:11.370> go<00:00:11.639> for<00:00:12.269> Terron

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
could probably just go for Terron

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.589 
could probably just go for Terron
million<00:00:12.960> hunter<00:00:13.200> or<00:00:13.380> 120<00:00:14.099> hunter<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.820> for

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
million hunter or 120 hunter on this for

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.689 
million hunter or 120 hunter on this for
a<00:00:15.630> little<00:00:15.780> -<00:00:16.560> couple<00:00:17.010> things<00:00:17.220> mainly<00:00:17.460> because

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
a little - couple things mainly because

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.150 
a little - couple things mainly because
that<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.630> Experian<00:00:19.199> them<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:19.770> really

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that the Experian them it's not really

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.439 
that the Experian them it's not really
that<00:00:20.340> bad<00:00:20.609> compared<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> would<00:00:21.960> get<00:00:22.289> on

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
that bad compared to what I would get on

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.599 
that bad compared to what I would get on
Draco<00:00:24.449> nature<00:00:24.840> denko's<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> lot

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
Draco nature denko's and this is a lot

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.120 
Draco nature denko's and this is a lot
more<00:00:26.789> advantageous<00:00:27.570> because<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.349> you

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
more advantageous because you get you

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.589 
more advantageous because you get you
can<00:00:29.310> use<00:00:29.460> them<00:00:29.609> yourself<00:00:30.060> or<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.359> sell

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
can use them yourself or you can sell

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.380 
can use them yourself or you can sell
them<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:30.900> GP<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.410> kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
prices I said I said if the prices

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.930 
prices I said I said if the prices
remain<00:00:37.200> -<00:00:37.530> while<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.399> at<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> moment<00:00:38.730> I

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
can sell one of them for like 200 k GP

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.069 
can sell one of them for like 200 k GP
somehow<00:00:41.910> wish<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.719> will<00:00:42.870> happen

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
somehow wish I don't think will happen

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.650 
somehow wish I don't think will happen
so<00:00:43.770> let's<00:00:43.950> say<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.520> drop<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
so let's say that they drop to like I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.410 
so let's say that they drop to like I
don't<00:00:45.719> know<00:00:46.460> 50<00:00:47.690> gph<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.800> 500<00:00:50.640> GP<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> actually

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
don't know 50 gph but 500 GP is actually

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
don't know 50 gph but 500 GP is actually
a<00:00:51.480> little<00:00:52.170> bit<00:00:52.260> low<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.129> they<00:00:53.250> dropped<00:00:53.489> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
a little bit low but if they dropped you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.630 
a little bit low but if they dropped you
like<00:00:53.760> 500<00:00:54.420> gph<00:00:54.870> after<00:00:55.829> hundred<00:00:56.100> Tony<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.430> will

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
like 500 gph after hundred Tony I will

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.970 
like 500 gph after hundred Tony I will
about<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.660> about<00:00:57.899> 200<00:00:58.350> thousand<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
about will have about 200 thousand of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
about will have about 200 thousand of
this<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> his<00:00:59.850> skull<00:01:00.000> chompers<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
this is his skull chompers which is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.510 
this is his skull chompers which is
enough<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.350> now<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.160> least<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> hundred

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
enough for like now at least a hundred

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.609 
enough for like now at least a hundred
million<00:01:02.879> GP<00:01:03.270> which<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.960> better<00:01:04.260> than<00:01:04.470> whatever

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
million GP which is better than whatever

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.800 
million GP which is better than whatever
in<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.460> guess<00:01:05.880> thieving<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.630> whatever

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
in there I guess thieving and whatever

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.719 
in there I guess thieving and whatever
you<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.500> why<00:01:08.159> not

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
you know so why not

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.550 
you know so why not
I<00:01:08.760> couldn't<00:01:09.270> also<00:01:09.510> use<00:01:09.689> them<00:01:09.960> myself<00:01:10.080> for

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
I couldn't also use them myself for

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340 
I couldn't also use them myself for
about<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.770> 10%<00:01:11.760> bonus<00:01:12.240> basic<00:01:12.869> speed<00:01:13.170> which

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
about like 10% bonus basic speed which

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.780 
about like 10% bonus basic speed which
is<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.920> very<00:01:14.040> bad<00:01:14.280> either

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
is not really very bad either

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.999 
is not really very bad either
I<00:01:14.939> guess<00:01:15.600> there's<00:01:15.810> something<00:01:16.080> nice<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.560> -

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
I guess there's something nice to have -

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.130 
I guess there's something nice to have -

a day at all guess I'm thinking that if

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.920 
a day at all guess I'm thinking that if
that's<00:01:30.329> like

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that's like

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.719 
that's like
100k<00:01:31.710> expand<00:01:32.009> our<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.400> could<00:01:32.520> easily<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:32.880> up

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
100k expand our that could easily go up

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.190 
100k expand our that could easily go up
210<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.939> cakes<00:01:36.180> being<00:01:36.450> our<00:01:36.630> rather<00:01:36.960> than

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
210 that cakes being our rather than

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.109 
210 that cakes being our rather than
like<00:01:37.350> divination<00:01:37.710> which<00:01:37.950> would<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
like divination which would be like and

position<00:02:52.480> here<00:02:52.660> rather<00:02:52.840> than<00:02:52.960> like<00:02:53.260> over<00:02:53.590> your

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
there or behind there is something I

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.550 
there or behind there is something I
don't<00:02:56.830> know<00:02:57.010> what<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.250> people<00:02:57.400> do<00:02:57.670> but

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
don't know what you people do but

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.750 
don't know what you people do but
exactly<00:02:59.560> here<00:02:59.920> I<00:02:59.950> think<00:03:00.220> that's<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.430> nice<00:03:00.550> but

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
exactly here I think that's a nice but

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.040 
exactly here I think that's a nice but
you<00:03:00.850> can<00:03:00.970> see<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.240> I<00:03:01.270> catch<00:03:01.480> your<00:03:01.600> frequently

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
you can see that I catch your frequently

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.930 
you can see that I catch your frequently
often<00:03:02.260> rather<00:03:03.040> than<00:03:03.250> having<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.580> wait<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.820> while

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
often rather than having to wait a while

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.400 
often rather than having to wait a while
before<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.360> catch<00:03:04.600> them<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.900> stuff<00:03:05.050> like<00:03:05.140> that

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
before I catch them and stuff like that

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.680 
before I catch them and stuff like that
so<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.490> this<00:03:06.640> spot<00:03:06.910> but<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.330> know<00:03:07.480> it's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
so I like this spot but you know it's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.960 
so I like this spot but you know it's
not<00:03:07.840> necessarily<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> best<00:03:08.740> place<00:03:09.040> ever

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
not necessarily the best place ever

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.060 
not necessarily the best place ever
you<00:03:10.300> will<00:03:10.450> also<00:03:10.600> notice<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.140> don't<00:03:11.800> really<00:03:11.950> have

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
you will also notice I don't really have

you will also notice I don't really have
much<00:03:12.160> ammonia<00:03:12.490> thermometers<00:03:13.150> because<00:03:13.390> it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
much ammonia thermometers because it

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.750 
much ammonia thermometers because it
just<00:03:13.660> bought<00:03:14.020> money<00:03:14.680> for<00:03:15.070> a<00:03:15.100> buttbounce

just bought money for a buttbounce

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.750 
just bought money for a buttbounce
actually<00:03:16.360> for<00:03:16.570> runefest<00:03:16.900> about<00:03:17.860> 35<00:03:18.400> blondes

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.660 
actually for runefest about 35 blondes
which<00:03:18.910> ended<00:03:19.180> up<00:03:19.240> on<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.450> 230<00:03:20.170> mil<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.220> adorable

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
which ended up on a 230 mil so adorable

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.010 
which ended up on a 230 mil so adorable
to<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:21.910> much<00:03:22.120> money<00:03:22.360> at<00:03:22.540> all<00:03:22.630> about<00:03:22.870> down

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
to have much money at all about down

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.420 
to have much money at all about down
there<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.320> find<00:03:23.560> some<00:03:23.709> kind<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.160> way<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.310> make

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
there to find some kind of way to make

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.400 
there to find some kind of way to make
some<00:03:24.700> more<00:03:24.790> money<00:03:24.850> which<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.660> again<00:03:25.990> think<00:03:26.230> that

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
some more money which I again think that

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.500 
some more money which I again think that
this<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.680> gonna<00:03:26.830> help<00:03:27.070> me<00:03:27.190> quite<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.400> bit<00:03:27.640> now

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
this is gonna help me quite a bit now

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.380 
this is gonna help me quite a bit now
once<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.930> hit<00:03:29.080> 120<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.250> hunter<00:03:30.910> was<00:03:31.090> just<00:03:31.270> gonna

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
once I hit 120 a hunter was just gonna

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.970 
once I hit 120 a hunter was just gonna
probably<00:03:31.990> gain<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.350> back<00:03:32.440> like<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.709> hundred

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
probably gain it back like a hundred

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.040 
probably gain it back like a hundred
million<00:03:33.190> GP<00:03:33.550> and<00:03:34.150> after<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.780> probably

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
million GP and after that I probably

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.840 
million GP and after that I probably
just<00:03:35.320> have<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.560> do<00:03:35.680> something<00:03:36.010> fancy<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.430> I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
just have to do something fancy like I

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.540 
just have to do something fancy like I
don't<00:03:37.360> know<00:03:37.800> something<00:03:38.800> kinds<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:39.370> I'm

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
don't know something kinds of this I'm

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.949 
don't know something kinds of this I'm
I'm<00:03:39.640> doing<00:03:39.880> farming<00:03:40.150> as<00:03:40.270> well<00:03:40.480> which<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:40.660> like

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
I'm doing farming as well which is like

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.030 
I'm doing farming as well which is like
300k<00:03:41.950> XP<00:03:42.370> no<00:03:42.910> XP<00:03:43.270> but<00:03:43.450> 300k<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.140> GP<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.860> I<00:03:44.890> were

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
300k XP no XP but 300k a GP and I were

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.290 
300k XP no XP but 300k a GP and I were
something<00:03:45.340> like<00:03:45.490> that<00:03:45.670> for<00:03:45.790> every<00:03:45.970> run<00:03:46.150> to

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
something like that for every run to

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.940 
something like that for every run to
that<00:03:46.450> deal<00:03:46.720> we<00:03:47.260> just<00:03:47.290> don't<00:03:47.620> bring<00:03:47.709> about

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
that deal we just don't bring about

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.650 
that deal we just don't bring about
either<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.700> guess<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:49.000> depends<00:03:49.330> on<00:03:49.450> what

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
either so I guess it depends on what

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.470 
either so I guess it depends on what
adds<00:03:50.440> up<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:50.890> eventually<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.430> just<00:03:51.459> see<00:03:51.910> where

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
adds up and eventually I just see where

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.940 
adds up and eventually I just see where
I<00:03:52.510> end<00:03:52.780> up<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.080> hopefully<00:03:53.260> I'll<00:03:53.680> have<00:03:53.890> enough

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
I end up and hopefully I'll have enough

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.430 
I end up and hopefully I'll have enough
money<00:03:54.490> to<00:03:54.760> survive<00:03:55.660> until<00:03:55.959> next<00:03:56.110> year<00:03:56.380> or

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
money to survive until next year or

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.810 
money to survive until next year or
something<00:03:56.650> like<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:57.100> which<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.400> kind<00:03:57.640> of<00:03:57.670> my

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
something like that which is kind of my
