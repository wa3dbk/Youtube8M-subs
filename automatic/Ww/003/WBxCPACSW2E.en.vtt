00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.829
 by one of the largest and oldest agencies resulting from a breakdown of 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.390
 cruciate ligaments for this movie is well and truly say it very welcome 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.519
 behind the scenes of a very busy day of the model's life 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.519
 as for Europe 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.929
 then go to the trap 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.920
 the work otherwise he was questioned 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.140
 but the text does not make much time 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.430
 at the same time

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.110
 m 64 bits 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.450
 on the first floor and yet there are some who have never dropped out of 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.660
 parade 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.350
 I think it will be a little bit complicated the task 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.050
 you have to be lucid for a few weeks 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.100
 it's definitely been helpful very mixed bleynie of sidaction 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.600
 which hinders the personality its efforts by justin lin 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.320
 you can be proud 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.370
 in wrought iron that is moving forward successfully van der jeugt 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.360

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.550
 points yesterday around 17 pm why be not however never 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.420
 that's why even clinton never understood why from yesterday after 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.030
 only a name in the middle of fashion he already has some 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.310
 experience but to win contracts it is necessary that in Senegal 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.180
 it's not time to manage his artist agent who goes through his 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.200
 agency to make a point with dominique senequier it's cheaper 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.730
 classified orange 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.390
 talat after that 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.390

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.090
 these same sources 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.730
 the relationship 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.270
 So this is it 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.280
 works he 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.360

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.399
 long time 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.799
 goes down 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.799
 that's why the association 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.679
 so that should go 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.149

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.980

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.409
 the coming years 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:52.619
 members of the media 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:55.199
