 mad effect on beautiful pink

 how i made such an image stay with 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.860
 me 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.329
 so I put in my base 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.960
 beautiful such 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.550
 and juicy peach you probably shade 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.530
 nacreous shadows from a sleek sun palette 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.879
 set very often use the latter 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.790
 video because it is very cool 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.680
 shades are now a delicate golden hue 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.589
 Any pearl that you have I put 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.860
 in the middle of the century to do a little 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.269
 such a shimmering look brilliant further 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.970
 dark brown shadows I draw 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.890
 our drawing of shadows namely fine 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.289
 brush and draws a crease 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 upper eyelid here such and specifically 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.720
 graphically i would say lines that is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.880
 not easy such a feathering movement 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 brushes namely a very specific line 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.759
 here it is important in general in makeup 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.759
 do all makeup 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.850
 neatly under the bone we start a brush 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.670
 and her respectively draw elongated 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.729
 line further I shade such an average 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 with stewed brush smaller than usual for 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.069
 so that the graphics remain but all 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.050
 was a bit smoother and shading 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.399
 cannon 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.220
 a little bit then I have her the same drawing 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.079
 to deepen the look darker 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.000
 brown or even gray shadows 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.659
 look depending only think you 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.530
 eat and draw the lower eyelid 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.490
 little tassel with the same shadows 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.799
 I connect with the top picture as you can see in 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.350
 Overall this is a very beautiful scheme for those 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.409
 who likes unusual hollywood so 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.869
 makeup makeup for filming probably very 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.880
 Looks like this 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.440
 drawing when we connect the lower eyelid with 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.730
 top through this here and 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.620
 I shade everything smoothly big 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.040
 a shading brush so that we have the whole 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.100
 drawing has become more smoothly more 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.760
 a milder professional can be so 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.370
 say next use gel 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.170
 eyeliner furniture here on draw beautiful 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.900
 graphic arrows are not too big and 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.110
 too small that you probably 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.239
 the average is generally very fond of such 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.379
 fairly simple images are probably 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:45.019
 there is my style here which makeup 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.640
 very easy as it seems to me to repeat but 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.700
 while they are real looks spectacular 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.530
 and much more spectacular than here in different 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.659
 watercolor techniques Russian here these and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.140
 pencil last case I'm so 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.730
 see and with a stylish modern trend 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.510
 from the wall of modern clothes this 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.879
 it looks just the same 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.599
 stylishly beautiful and in general here is such 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.810
 make up like here given make up yes like that 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.909

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.250

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.620
 obscure outer corner and mother of pearl 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.540

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.650
 how should we paint over 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.989

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.739

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:59.389

 medium length i.e. not long 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.440
