00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.969
 hello guys and girls the maxi would have 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.969
 I 'm full of the stupid tick 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.590
 I noticed today when people before 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.600
 I run and cough there I have like that 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.189
 instant air sustained reflex so like it 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.850
 Immediately start a form you instant 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.380
 Stop air 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.660
 I do not know if he's like complex 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.610
 Did I get infected or the 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.989
 probably only explains annett 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.120
 Scheller you have such things 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.379
 Everything is clear to me for the first time today 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.329
 done, I'll do it for years 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.270
 So I really noticed 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.560
 Today, I think it only once but as 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.899
 It should not be at all about it 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.300
 to what the yes but something like that 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.470
 go and what we yesterday too 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.460
 I noticed yes I have more or 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.309
 less saturday sunday monday so the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.219
 I have complete holidays over 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.170
 Overall, I'm not sure 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.420
 I'll just say 28 hours 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.860
 witcher 3 played really long me 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.840
 I have nothing else for most of the day 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.430
 made by brockens until the evening 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.049
 in between something was required 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.820
 that was it has been really long 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.869
 no longer done so much in a row and 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.220
 I can he fast again his 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.750
 plays is really good who somehow 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.159
 so far it has started with roleplaying 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.400
 That should definitely be 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.260
 Buy is the beginning game that 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.450
 intentionally the thing a bit too 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.140
 slower so you can take your time 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.090
 to let 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.430
 it's just worth it 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.170
 what I noticed is already too 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.760
 I still have a lot going on 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.640
 and if I really have the 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.869
 did not do anything else the whole day 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.390
 to play as ingame there dreams at night 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.869
 from the shit too and it's real 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.729
 the mega stupid things you 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.770
 you really imagine yourself like that 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.090
 by the way, tomorrow at the station can still 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.560
 other thing is the leak staples and 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.930
 hundreds of the game would have dreamed 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.490
 but you get a bit silly in your head 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.810
 I'm a bit 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.659
 This morning I have my backpack 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.860
 so it is why 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.520
 completely and only on one shoulder 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.570
 took 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.409
 I ran that way at the station 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.599
 Just a little bit here 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.599
 run up and so far 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.579
 wobbled if you can imagine 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.900
 and as they say frankfurt in the morning 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:18.290
 at the train station makes it that the people in 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.099
 rest leave or go out away then 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.210
 I noticed 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.430
 somehow 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.230
 somehow backpack rattled on the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.070
 back healthy again sword shape 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.660
 by gerald markl what you're going to do 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.550
 or how much must Michael yellow 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.470
 have played that one of the wobble 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.260
 his backpack somehow conclusions 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.850
 it draws on how the sword earns a few salaries 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.930
 on bridges wobbles or is disturbed 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.490
 but to come back to the real one 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.630
 so if I really have so many 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.920
 player is really on the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.720
 ask if I can do it this way 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.280
 I go out of it that way 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.780
 Some of them are so serious because if you go 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.830
 did nothing else during the day 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.660
 also to play his game 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.950
 What else is great for you ? 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.970
 Dream and sooner than I really still 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.590
 for hours out and something in the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.320
 also played here 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.750
 as we were then as parish priest in the 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.310
 hairdresser call of duty and so it was 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.380
 really hours at the lot really 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.020
 who have really played because unfortunately 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.670
 we really or I really have from 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.760
 The whole thing was really taken care of 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.380
 the stupidest dreams are several times yes me 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.630
 I have had some dreams since I have 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.760
 quest rewards so so quest 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.770
 completed or seen something 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.760
 you could not even remember that 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.800
 do everything but I really had 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.300
 I also dream and want to be there 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.040
 woke up at night and then got me 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.420
 asked yes how far are you there now 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.250
 actually until we get there 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.780
 it is so hot you do not sit 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.930
 from the computer and just play it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.660
 are completely disturbed 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.270
 so you can clearly see the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.200
 I do not know too much about trends 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.420
 not if that too in my 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.180
 advanced age is no me 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.920
 I am not 43 even if I am today 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.730
 one has posted on twitter 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.800
 Are you doing 43 and I have no 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.400
 eighth otherwise also wrote no 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.540
 I'm not 43 so that's so bad 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.130
 it still milk with me 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.950
 at least not yet 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.440
 In 33 13 years it looks different 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.090
 but I do not want any 43 because they ob 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.710
 it comes in old age but there I had 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.239
 earlier rather spend hours half life 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.120
 played cleared of any 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.370
 funny green shooters shooting 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.080
 aliens and stuff in the direction though 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.790
 sometimes you dream right so 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.980
 worst nonsense I can 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.050
 unfortunately he is so extreme 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.729
 rarely remember what was dreaming 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.960
 I can because only so entirely at 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.389
 a very small excerpt I remember 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.939
 For example, I really know that 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.520
 ever completed by quest 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:45.339
 have dreamed popups and at the latest then 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.389
 is clear now you really turn so 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:50.210
 but you can write the comments 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.680
 like how it is with you so that was 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.270
 on the whole car did not know it 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.909
 I got rid of the job 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.710
 bit 3 gameplay in the background always 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.219
 said people personally has bought you 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.559
 the whole 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:02.059
 and who was also often dreamed of games 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:02.779
 that can sometimes the comments 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:04.699
 write 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:07.159
 Unfortunately, you can not know it that way 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.659
 there are some that apparently 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.309
 I can not influence that 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.419
 unfortunately you can be happy 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:12.830
 choose what you dream as I would 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.199
 I also choose other things 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.580
 instead of necessarily now 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.729
 completed quests and other 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.629
 You can dream things 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.819
 choose 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.740
 yes no comments write if that 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.779
 fire too is one of the jobs now 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.899
 conclusion makes it good until the next one 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.899
 times
