right over here dr. Newman now he's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
right over here dr. Newman now he's
gonna<00:00:42.780> inject<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.160> some<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
gonna inject this and some kind of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.569 
gonna inject this and some kind of
secret<00:00:45.629> formula<00:00:46.260> very<00:00:46.559> scientific<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.460> me

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
secret formula very scientific for me

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.330 
secret formula very scientific for me
science<00:00:48.030> explained<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.809> stem<00:00:49.170> cell<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:50.100> stem

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
science explained the stem cell the stem

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.700 
science explained the stem cell the stem
cell<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.090> most<00:00:51.719> natural<00:00:51.989> way<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
cell if is the most natural way you can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.850 
cell if is the most natural way you can
get<00:00:53.030> rejuvenated<00:00:54.030> basically<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.649> age<00:00:55.829> we

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
get rejuvenated basically as we age we

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.099 
get rejuvenated basically as we age we
lose<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.340> volume<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.730> our<00:00:56.850> face<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.390> in

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
lose the volume in our face and in

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.220 
lose the volume in our face and in
traditional<00:00:58.710> surgery<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.699> tend<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.600> pull<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
traditional surgery we tend to pull and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.110 
traditional surgery we tend to pull and
make<00:01:01.350> everything<00:01:01.649> look<00:01:01.859> tight<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.850> stem

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
make everything look tight with stem

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.149 
make everything look tight with stem
cell<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.600> don't<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.589> fill<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> we

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
cell if we don't do that we fill and we

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.130 
cell if we don't do that we fill and we
lift<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> very<00:01:06.540> natural<00:01:06.780> look

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
lift it so you get a very natural look

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.530 
lift it so you get a very natural look
without<00:01:07.500> having<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> cut<00:01:08.340> now<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> stem<00:01:09.270> cells

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
without having to cut now the stem cells

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.179 
without having to cut now the stem cells
are<00:01:09.720> found<00:01:09.750> within<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.439> own<00:01:10.560> fat<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.130> your

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
are found within your own fat in your

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.700 
are found within your own fat in your
body<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.240> take<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.659> fat<00:01:13.020> from<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> body

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
body so we take this fat from the body

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
body so we take this fat from the body
as<00:01:14.070> we've<00:01:14.490> done<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:15.150> Heather<00:01:15.360> taking<00:01:16.110> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
as we've done with Heather taking it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
as we've done with Heather taking it
from<00:01:16.290> her<00:01:16.470> thighs<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:17.159> took<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> from<00:01:17.549> her

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
from her thighs we took it from her

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.370 
from her thighs we took it from her
thighs<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.180> got<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> mini<00:01:18.570> lipo<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.320> she

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
thighs you got a mini lipo so she

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.310 
thighs you got a mini lipo so she
doesn't<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.759> bags<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.320> we

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
doesn't have the little bags here we

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.679 
doesn't have the little bags here we
took<00:01:22.560> half<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> fat<00:01:23.310> stripped<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
took half the fat stripped of all the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.539 
took half the fat stripped of all the
stem<00:01:24.900> cells<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.320> were<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.009> we

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
stem cells that were in here and we

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.749 
stem cells that were in here and we
added<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.380> like<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:29.130> other<00:01:29.340> steps<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
added it like this these other steps a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.090 
added it like this these other steps a
liquid<00:01:30.150> part<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> stem<00:01:31.170> cells<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.590> so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
liquid part are the stem cells right so

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.920 
liquid part are the stem cells right so
we've<00:01:32.310> separated<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> fat<00:01:33.659> this

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
we've separated out this is the fat this

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.050 
we've separated out this is the fat this
is<00:01:34.140> stem<00:01:34.380> cells<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:35.189> took<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> stem<00:01:35.790> cells

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
is stem cells we took the stem cells

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.210 
is stem cells we took the stem cells
from<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.630> now<00:01:37.110> they're<00:01:37.290> activated<00:01:37.950> because

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
from here now they're activated because

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
from here now they're activated because
they're<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.610> no<00:01:38.909> longer<00:01:39.270> sitting<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> fat

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
they're now no longer sitting in the fat

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.310 
they're now no longer sitting in the fat
we<00:01:40.710> act<00:01:41.280> injected<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> back<00:01:42.479> into<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.110> fat

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
we act injected it back into the fat

you know is there the danger that this
could<00:01:51.600> move<00:01:51.840> later<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.710> fat<00:01:52.920> ends<00:01:53.130> up

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
could move later on the fat ends up

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.710 
could move later on the fat ends up
somewhere<00:01:53.610> else<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.030> face<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.450> stem

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
somewhere else in your face the stem

somewhere else in your face the stem
cells<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.290> very<00:01:55.799> very<00:01:56.100> smart<00:01:56.460> they're

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
cells are very very smart they're

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.359 
cells are very very smart they're
basically<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.049> incorporate<00:01:58.710> into<00:01:59.250> the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
you've done what we've done is basically

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.680 
you've done what we've done is basically
if<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:48.130> look<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:48.430> her<00:02:48.610> eyes<00:02:48.880> she's<00:02:49.330> got<00:02:49.360> these

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
if you look at her eyes she's got these

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.479 
if you look at her eyes she's got these
little<00:02:49.989> bags<00:02:50.260> on<00:02:50.530> their<00:02:50.709> eyes<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.190> she's<00:02:51.340> got

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
little bags on their eyes and she's got

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.030 
little bags on their eyes and she's got
this<00:02:51.700> area<00:02:52.180> that's<00:02:52.420> hollowed<00:02:52.959> out<00:02:53.110> we<00:02:53.650> filled

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
this area that's hollowed out we filled

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.910 
this area that's hollowed out we filled
it<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.670> it's<00:02:54.850> now<00:02:55.239> much<00:02:56.140> smoother<00:02:56.620> in

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
it in so it's now much smoother in

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.410 
it in so it's now much smoother in
traditional<00:02:57.520> plastic<00:02:57.670> surgery<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.330> would

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
traditional plastic surgery that would

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.509 
traditional plastic surgery that would
be<00:02:58.630> two<00:02:58.870> different<00:02:59.050> procedures<00:02:59.680> we're<00:03:00.340> next

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
be two different procedures we're next

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.100 
be two different procedures we're next
we're<00:03:00.730> gonna<00:03:00.850> do<00:03:01.030> her<00:03:01.180> nose<00:03:01.420> we're<00:03:01.840> gonna<00:03:01.989> do

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
we're gonna do her nose we're gonna do

we're gonna do her nose we're gonna do
her<00:03:02.230> lips<00:03:02.500> because<00:03:02.830> she's<00:03:03.760> also<00:03:04.000> lost<00:03:04.300> a

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
her lips because she's also lost a

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.020 
her lips because she's also lost a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
little volume here I've also done her a

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.990 
little volume here I've also done her a
little<00:03:07.720> jaw<00:03:08.319> area<00:03:08.560> here<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.700> she<00:03:09.819> doesn't
