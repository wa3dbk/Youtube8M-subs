00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.029
 on the town video I will tell you how 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.719
 quickly sew up a hole of non-important topics on 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:12.509
 clothes but I will show it with us as an example 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.730
 I will use black threads for 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.670
 visibility principle if neat 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.949
 You can not even sew up 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.150
 thread colors choose how we will 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.810
 putting a seam on the sock is easy 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:36.380
 see how we broke 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:40.649
 so back away from the edge of the tag 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.590
 hold the thread and now small 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.890
 stitches seize the right and left by 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.559
 a little bit of sho in which we get it 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.899
 will be visible from the inside they 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.640
 smash is not with the outside and see just 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.059
 the result is captured a little to the right 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:04.789
 now where the right thread has come out 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.789
 the sides we grab on the left and a little 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:16.470
 threading 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:19.080
 farther small stitch this way 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.780
 the thread we basically goes inside 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:30.500
 and its color is not visible by such city ​​bugs 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:34.159
 we pass by small around the edge 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.869
 if you make very big stitches then 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:44.450
 will be like an accordion in the end it will be 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:47.960
 visible whales skylight and not sewn part 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 looks not very beautiful how 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.950
 pass to the end 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.160
 so convenient to sew on any clothes 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.960
 here I don't use any light bulb 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.180
 no special eggs for 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.240
 to see the hole just pushing 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.520
 arm and open to be seen where 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:39.040
 stitching says it’s all easy for 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.040
 few minutes you can handle 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.810
 especially optimal when you are 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.510
 where is she at home you do not have 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:05.030
 matching color matching not 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.030
 in color and this seam is very helpful 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:31.209
 bend the bar pass through in order 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:35.319
 to tie a knot as you see the whole 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:43.569
 the seam he sticks out on the inside 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:48.430
 no one will see we sew and tie 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:51.299
 knot all thanks for your attention 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.299
 here is the result
