points<00:00:36.780> level<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.020> guess<00:00:37.079> you're<00:00:37.380> gonna<00:00:37.469> need

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
points level I guess you're gonna need

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.069 
points level I guess you're gonna need
to<00:00:37.890> use<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> thuggy<00:00:39.329> characters<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
to use one of the thuggy characters to

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.479 
to use one of the thuggy characters to
get<00:00:40.200> into<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.860> either<00:00:41.100> use<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
get into it and you can either use the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.940 
get into it and you can either use the
guy<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.850> scar<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.860> need

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
guy that scar is on the right you need

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
guy that scar is on the right you need
use<00:00:44.129> him<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.670> open<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.480> use

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
use him to open it or you can use

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
use him to open it or you can use
smaller<00:00:45.870> RAM<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.710> make<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.950> that's

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
smaller RAM so that can make it that's

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.100 
smaller RAM so that can make it that's
one<00:00:50.789> use<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.149> him<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> guess<00:00:51.570> anyway<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
one use of him I guess anyway the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.189 
one use of him I guess anyway the
rubrics<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.899> scorpions<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
rubrics these are the scorpions on the

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.790 
rubrics these are the scorpions on the
little<00:00:58.199> blocks<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:59.100> rocks<00:00:59.930> but<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
little blocks or rocks but if you see a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.179 
little blocks or rocks but if you see a
scorpion<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.760> its<00:01:02.969> right<00:01:03.180> break<00:01:04.189> these

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
scorpion it in its right break these

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
scorpion it in its right break these
ones<00:01:05.460> are<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:05.939> bit<00:01:06.150> harder<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.420> find<00:01:06.540> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
ones are a little bit harder to find in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.340 
ones are a little bit harder to find in
the<00:01:07.250> red<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.430> green<00:01:08.820> ones<00:01:09.150> obviously<00:01:09.630> yeah

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the red one green ones obviously yeah

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
the red one green ones obviously yeah
but<00:01:10.979> strangely<00:01:11.610> they're<00:01:11.909> not<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.240> hard<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
but strangely they're not is hard to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.070 
but strangely they're not is hard to
find<00:01:12.750> simpler<00:01:13.229> ones<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.100> your<00:01:14.280> wife

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
find simpler ones on there is your wife

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
find simpler ones on there is your wife
because<00:01:16.080> arguably<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.250> red<00:01:17.460> ones<00:01:17.700> give<00:01:17.970> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
because arguably the red ones give you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.190 
because arguably the red ones give you
the<00:01:18.150> most<00:01:18.299> useful<00:01:18.600> ones

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the most useful ones

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.910 
the most useful ones
I<00:01:19.880> guess<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> blue<00:01:21.270> ones<00:01:21.540> give<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> fast<00:01:22.530> big

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
I guess the blue ones give you fast big

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.270 
I guess the blue ones give you fast big
and<00:01:23.130> fast<00:01:23.430> build<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.090> all<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:25.040> you<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and fast build and all that you know the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.929 
and fast build and all that you know the
blue<00:01:26.460> bricks<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> next<00:01:28.140> video

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
blue bricks which will be the next video

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.429 
blue bricks which will be the next video
blue<00:01:29.939> bricks<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:32.060> lidless<00:01:33.060> pots<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.320> if

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
blue bricks are the lidless pots so if

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319 
blue bricks are the lidless pots so if
you<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> pot<00:01:34.979> without<00:01:35.159> elated<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.060> blue

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you see a pot without elated it's a blue

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.440 
you see a pot without elated it's a blue
brick<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.189> accidentally<00:01:38.790> get<00:01:39.210> one

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
brick and I think I accidentally get one

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.950 
brick and I think I accidentally get one
not<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.200> sure<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.970> think<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.090> try<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> mean
