the<00:02:58.519> way<00:02:58.640> in<00:03:00.880> take<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.030> again<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:10.220> that's<00:03:11.180> it

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
the way in take this again and that's it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.720 
the way in take this again and that's it
you're<00:03:11.540> done<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.950> that's<00:03:16.340> how<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.489> replace

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
you're done and that's how you replace

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.100 
you're done and that's how you replace
the<00:03:17.000> freewheel<00:03:17.560> okay<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.130> cassette

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
the freewheel okay so this is a cassette

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.319 
the freewheel okay so this is a cassette
now<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.170> can<00:03:21.380> recognize<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.799> by<00:03:22.069> D<00:03:22.340> by<00:03:23.269> it

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
now you can recognize it by D by it

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.979 
now you can recognize it by D by it
being<00:03:23.569> closer<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.200> axle<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.450> less<00:03:26.450> not<00:03:26.810> as

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
being closer to the axle and less not as

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.080 
being closer to the axle and less not as
recessed<00:03:27.530> as<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.829> freewheel<00:03:28.250> what<00:03:28.819> we<00:03:28.970> need

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
recessed as the freewheel what we need

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.640 
recessed as the freewheel what we need
is<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.360> course<00:03:29.569> another<00:03:29.840> socket<00:03:30.170> here<00:03:30.500> which

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
is of course another socket here which

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.449 
is of course another socket here which
fits<00:03:30.920> all<00:03:31.130> Shimano's<00:03:33.010> insert<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.160> in<00:03:34.280> there

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
fits all Shimano's insert it in there

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.879 
fits all Shimano's insert it in there
not<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.120> problem<00:03:35.359> is<00:03:35.540> if<00:03:35.630> we<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:35.840> screw<00:03:36.139> it<00:03:36.290> of

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
not a problem is if we in screw it of

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.940 
not a problem is if we in screw it of
course<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.250> entire<00:03:37.489> thing<00:03:37.760> moves<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.950> what

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
course the entire thing moves so what

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.250 
course the entire thing moves so what
you<00:03:40.069> need<00:03:40.220> one<00:03:40.459> of<00:03:40.489> these<00:03:40.930> which<00:03:41.930> actually

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
you need one of these which actually

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.210 
you need one of these which actually
grabs<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:43.130> gears<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:44.510> also<00:03:45.069> gives<00:03:46.069> you

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
grabs the gears and also gives you

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.090 
grabs the gears and also gives you
leverage<00:03:46.690> now<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.930> made<00:03:48.170> this<00:03:48.319> one<00:03:48.530> which<00:03:48.920> can

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
leverage now I made this one which can

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.809 
leverage now I made this one which can
actually<00:03:49.269> buy<00:03:50.269> one<00:03:50.299> at<00:03:50.600> any<00:03:50.810> good<00:03:51.109> bike<00:03:51.380> store

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
actually buy one at any good bike store

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:58.620 
actually buy one at any good bike store
so<00:03:52.819> I'm<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.299> going<00:03:54.790> go

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.360 

well<00:03:59.610> take<00:04:00.610> this<00:04:00.760> off<00:04:01.860> this<00:04:02.860> is<00:04:03.040> your<00:04:03.160> luck

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
well take this off this is your luck

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.250

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.870 
Nick
now<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.710> first<00:04:05.950> gear<00:04:06.250> has<00:04:06.370> come<00:04:06.550> out<00:04:06.670> and

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
now the first gear has come out and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.880 
now the first gear has come out and
these<00:04:07.540> are<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.810> ones<00:04:08.020> that<00:04:08.140> usually<00:04:08.320> get<00:04:08.680> used

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
these are the ones that usually get used

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.940 
these are the ones that usually get used
up<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.310> fastest<00:04:10.270> so<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:10.750> can<00:04:11.170> replace<00:04:11.590> only

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
up the fastest so you can replace only

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.470 
up the fastest so you can replace only
these<00:04:12.100> instead<00:04:12.550> of<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.790> whole<00:04:12.970> thing

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
these instead of the whole thing

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.110 
these instead of the whole thing
now<00:04:14.260> when<00:04:14.470> you<00:04:14.590> remove<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.460> rest<00:04:15.640> got<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.060> be

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
now when you remove the rest got to be

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.720 
now when you remove the rest got to be
careful<00:04:16.450> because<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.810> got<00:04:17.250> shim<00:04:18.250> in<00:04:18.400> between

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
careful because you got shim in between

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.510 
careful because you got shim in between
there<00:04:20.520> that<00:04:21.520> takes<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.910> gears<00:04:22.150> apart<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:23.530> make

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
there that takes the gears apart so make

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.440 
there that takes the gears apart so make
sure<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.760> don't<00:04:24.910> lose<00:04:25.090> this<00:04:26.010> now<00:04:27.240> in<00:04:28.240> the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
sure you don't lose this now in the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.170 
sure you don't lose this now in the
cassette<00:04:28.810> now<00:04:29.440> see<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.800> mechanism<00:04:30.160> he's<00:04:30.760> here

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
cassette now see the mechanism he's here

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.860 
cassette now see the mechanism he's here
in<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:32.110> hub<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:33.340> if<00:04:33.610> this<00:04:34.210> doesn't<00:04:34.480> work<00:04:34.600> I

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
in the hub so if this doesn't work I

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.370 
in the hub so if this doesn't work I
have<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.140> replace<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.860> entire<00:04:35.890> hub<00:04:37.140> now<00:04:38.140> all

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
have to replace the entire hub now all

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.810 
have to replace the entire hub now all
the<00:04:38.560> indentations<00:04:39.130> are<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.340> same<00:04:39.550> size

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
the indentations are the same size

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.910 
the indentations are the same size
except<00:04:40.180> for<00:04:40.330> one<00:04:40.540> which<00:04:40.750> is<00:04:40.870> smaller<00:04:41.230> and

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
except for one which is smaller and

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.280 
except for one which is smaller and
that's<00:04:42.130> your<00:04:42.280> guide<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.820> reinstall<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:43.510> so

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
that's your guide to reinstall this so

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:51.000 
that's your guide to reinstall this so
find<00:04:45.060> small<00:04:46.060> indentation<00:04:48.420> reinstall<00:04:49.860> put<00:04:50.860> the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
find small indentation reinstall put the

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.930 
find small indentation reinstall put the
shim<00:04:51.280> back<00:04:51.550> in<00:04:54.510> take<00:04:55.510> your<00:04:55.690> little<00:04:55.870> gears<00:04:56.940> find

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
shim back in take your little gears find

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.420 
shim back in take your little gears find
it<00:04:58.060> small<00:04:58.270> indentation<00:04:58.630> again<00:05:00.630> reinstall<00:05:01.630> it

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
it small indentation again reinstall it

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.570 
it small indentation again reinstall it
take<00:05:03.430> your<00:05:03.580> socket<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.230> locking<00:05:05.230> nut<00:05:05.520> now<00:05:06.520> we

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
take your socket and locking nut now we

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.020 
take your socket and locking nut now we
don't<00:05:06.760> need<00:05:06.910> go<00:05:07.120> of<00:05:07.270> course<00:05:11.820> your<00:05:12.820> wrench

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
don't need go of course your wrench

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:22.459 
don't need go of course your wrench
again

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:22.469 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.860 

and<00:05:23.469> that's<00:05:23.620> it

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.189 

so<00:05:29.610> that's<00:05:30.610> basically<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.210> now<00:05:31.930> you're<00:05:32.080> going

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
so that's basically it now you're going

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.719 
so that's basically it now you're going
to<00:05:32.259> notice<00:05:32.379> that<00:05:32.620> I<00:05:32.919> didn't<00:05:33.099> have<00:05:33.189> a<00:05:33.219> hard<00:05:33.490> time

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
to notice that I didn't have a hard time

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.119 
to notice that I didn't have a hard time
moving<00:05:34.060> these<00:05:34.439> the<00:05:35.439> freewheel<00:05:35.860> and<00:05:35.889> the

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
moving these the freewheel and the

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.159 
moving these the freewheel and the
cassette<00:05:36.430> that's<00:05:36.699> because<00:05:36.939> I<00:05:36.969> staged<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.599> it's

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
cassette that's because I staged it it's

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.140 
cassette that's because I staged it it's
a<00:05:38.229> bit<00:05:38.349> harder<00:05:38.740> than<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:39.009> looks<00:05:39.219> so<00:05:39.849> you<00:05:39.909> really

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
a bit harder than it looks so you really

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.749 
a bit harder than it looks so you really
got<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.449> put<00:05:40.629> some<00:05:40.780> energy<00:05:40.990> into<00:05:41.409> it<00:05:41.759> apart

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
got to put some energy into it apart

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.480 
got to put some energy into it apart
from<00:05:42.909> that<00:05:43.060> it's<00:05:43.569> that<00:05:43.810> simple<00:05:44.110> so<00:05:44.439> until<00:05:45.370> next

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
from that it's that simple so until next

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.620 
from that it's that simple so until next
time<00:05:45.759> ride<00:05:46.210> safe<00:05:46.479> and<00:05:46.719> Godspeed
