is Madison Square and the building that

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.890 
is Madison Square and the building that
looks<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.780> wedge<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:02.570> flat<00:04:03.570> iron

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
looks like a wedge is the flat iron

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.620 
looks like a wedge is the flat iron
building<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:06.030> used<00:04:06.240> to<00:04:06.360> be<00:04:06.480> considered

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630

the tallest building in New York if not
the<00:04:10.650> world

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
the world

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.130 
the world
I<00:04:11.730> think<00:04:12.730> it's<00:04:12.850> only<00:04:12.970> got<00:04:13.180> something<00:04:13.570> like<00:04:13.750> 20

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
I think it's only got something like 20

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:23.970 
I think it's only got something like 20
floors<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:20.640> in<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.820> natural<00:04:22.710> you've<00:04:23.710> just

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
floors and in the natural you've just

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.140 
floors and in the natural you've just
seen<00:04:24.190> your<00:04:24.400> from<00:04:24.850> 86<00:04:25.420> close<00:04:25.810> up
