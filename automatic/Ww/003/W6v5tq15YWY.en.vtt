00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
enough for a striker on this game he

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.309 
enough for a striker on this game he
will<00:02:41.610> miss<00:02:41.880> chance<00:02:42.209> after<00:02:42.390> chance<00:02:42.540> game<00:02:43.049> after

game he will score the old one but see

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.449 
game he will score the old one but see
his<00:02:45.810> chance<00:02:46.140> conversion<00:02:46.410> rate<00:02:47.040> would<00:02:47.400> be

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
his chance conversion rate would be

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.150 
his chance conversion rate would be
about<00:02:47.880> sixty<00:02:48.420> percent<00:02:48.569> seventy<00:02:49.230> percent<00:02:49.380> so

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
about sixty percent seventy percent so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.319 
about sixty percent seventy percent so
it<00:02:50.310> isn't<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> best<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> world
