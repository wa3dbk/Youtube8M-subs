00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
believe it's because there's nothing but

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.950 
believe it's because there's nothing but
leaks<00:00:32.759> at<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> moment<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.390> even<00:00:33.600> those<00:00:33.719> leaks

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
leaks at the moment and even those leaks

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.690 
leaks at the moment and even those leaks
a<00:00:34.050> little<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.350> unstable<00:00:34.770> there's<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.550> issue

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.610 
computer is completely is very very very
slow<00:04:50.330> so<00:04:50.570> it's<00:04:50.690> going<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.840> take<00:04:50.900> some<00:04:51.020> time<00:04:51.380> for

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
slow so it's going to take some time for

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.800 
slow so it's going to take some time for
you<00:04:52.070> guys<00:04:52.220> with<00:04:52.370> faster<00:04:52.670> faster<00:04:53.420> computers

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
you guys with faster faster computers

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.560 
you guys with faster faster computers
you<00:04:54.320> know<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.560> process<00:04:54.800> might<00:04:55.160> take<00:04:55.570> 60

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
you know the process might take 60

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.630 
you know the process might take 60
seconds<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.560> depending<00:04:58.220> on<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.370> speed<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.580> the

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
seconds so depending on the speed of the

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.820 
seconds so depending on the speed of the
computer<00:04:58.760> just<00:04:59.150> be<00:04:59.450> patient<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.110> I'm

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
computer just be patient and I'm

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.930 
computer just be patient and I'm
actually<00:05:00.980> going<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.250> be<00:05:01.310> right<00:05:01.520> back<00:05:01.640> as<00:05:01.850> soon

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
actually going to be right back as soon

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.090 
actually going to be right back as soon
as<00:05:02.090> it's<00:05:02.240> done<00:05:02.470> flashing<00:05:03.470> because<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.830> do<00:05:03.890> have

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
as it's done flashing because I do have

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.580 
as it's done flashing because I do have

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
a little trick sometimes in nine times

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.000 
a little trick sometimes in nine times
out<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:27.500> ten<00:05:27.590> when<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.070> flash<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:28.820> stock<00:05:28.880> firmware

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
out of ten when I flash a stock firmware

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.130 
out of ten when I flash a stock firmware
when<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.250> phone<00:05:31.490> reboots<00:05:31.850> itself<00:05:32.240> and<00:05:33.020> the

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
when the phone reboots itself and the

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.260 
when the phone reboots itself and the
boot<00:05:33.380> loader<00:05:33.830> or<00:05:34.130> the<00:05:34.280> boot<00:05:34.460> animation<00:05:35.030> starts

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
boot loader or the boot animation starts

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.180 
boot loader or the boot animation starts
up<00:05:35.540> it'll<00:05:36.230> actually<00:05:36.350> just<00:05:36.620> get<00:05:36.770> stuck<00:05:37.040> there

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
up it'll actually just get stuck there

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.210 
up it'll actually just get stuck there
for<00:05:37.520> like<00:05:37.640> 10-15<00:05:38.120> twit<00:05:38.540> forever<00:05:38.870> basically

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
for like 10-15 twit forever basically

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.220 
for like 10-15 twit forever basically
until<00:05:40.220> I<00:05:40.280> pull<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.700> battery<00:05:41.120> if<00:05:41.300> that's<00:05:41.990> the

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
until I pull the battery if that's the

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.510 
until I pull the battery if that's the
case<00:05:42.470> and<00:05:42.710> your<00:05:42.830> phone<00:05:43.040> doesn't<00:05:43.280> actually

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
case and your phone doesn't actually

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.060 
case and your phone doesn't actually
boot<00:05:43.880> into<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:44.450> welcome<00:05:45.050> screen<00:05:45.200> here's

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
boot into the welcome screen here's

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.710 
boot into the welcome screen here's
something<00:05:46.310> that<00:05:46.430> you<00:05:46.490> can<00:05:46.670> do<00:05:46.880> first<00:05:47.450> while

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
something that you can do first while

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.990 
something that you can do first while
again<00:05:48.110> considering<00:05:48.680> that<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:49.100> ant<00:05:49.760> boot

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
again considering that the ant boot

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.400 
again considering that the ant boot
animation<00:05:50.510> is<00:05:50.600> still<00:05:50.780> going<00:05:50.930> on<00:05:51.110> it<00:05:51.260> just

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
animation is still going on it just

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.930 
animation is still going on it just
looks<00:05:51.590> like<00:05:51.650> it's<00:05:51.830> in<00:05:51.950> a<00:05:51.980> boot<00:05:52.160> loop<00:05:52.190> go<00:05:52.700> ahead

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
looks like it's in a boot loop go ahead

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.640 
looks like it's in a boot loop go ahead
and<00:05:53.060> pull<00:05:53.330> your<00:05:53.510> battery<00:05:53.690> out<00:05:54.050> while<00:05:54.260> it's<00:05:54.470> on

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
and pull your battery out while it's on

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.800 
and pull your battery out while it's on
just<00:05:54.920> pull<00:05:55.100> it<00:05:55.190> out<00:05:55.280> completely<00:05:55.540> put<00:05:56.540> it<00:05:56.630> back

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
just pull it out completely put it back

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.450 
just pull it out completely put it back
in<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.320> then<00:05:57.740> press<00:05:58.010> and<00:05:58.160> hold<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.430> volume

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
in and then press and hold the volume

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.350 
in and then press and hold the volume
and<00:05:59.150> volume<00:06:00.080> up<00:06:00.410> and<00:06:00.650> power<00:06:00.710> button<00:06:01.430> okay<00:06:01.850> so

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
and volume up and power button okay so

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.410 
and volume up and power button okay so
because<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.440> this<00:06:04.340> firmware<00:06:04.610> actually<00:06:05.210> ends

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
because the this firmware actually ends

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.840 
because the this firmware actually ends
up<00:06:05.480> you<00:06:05.690> know<00:06:05.780> unrooting<00:06:06.290> your<00:06:06.410> device<00:06:06.650> and

notice<00:06:10.610> here<00:06:10.850> a<00:06:10.880> little<00:06:11.090> when<00:06:11.420> you<00:06:11.570> do<00:06:11.720> that

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
notice here a little when you do that

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.710 
notice here a little when you do that
little<00:06:12.580> blue<00:06:13.580> thing<00:06:13.610> happens<00:06:14.240> at<00:06:14.390> the<00:06:14.480> top<00:06:14.690> of

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
saying that it's booting into recovery

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.470 
saying that it's booting into recovery
so<00:06:16.580> what<00:06:16.700> we're<00:06:16.820> going<00:06:16.910> to<00:06:17.000> want<00:06:17.090> to<00:06:17.210> do<00:06:17.330> is
