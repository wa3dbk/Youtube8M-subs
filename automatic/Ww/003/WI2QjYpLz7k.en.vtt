00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.180
 I show at the World Cup about deadly as the Mettinger can and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.080
 What will be the basic thing to note is what you need and for what 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.359
 the whole thing is needed 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.669
 to Gameware first-class what we need to become one 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.029
 Controllers we need as well as now need so celebrated only finnish 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.449
 as well as a Vattenfall 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.220
 These are not required by default club new 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.999
 support controllers 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.699
 For example, a controller may like its ex-club like the fingers next to it 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.640
 for example, the Berlin 4000 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.690
 only dvd player which I like that not possible a millimeter to 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.580
 Example that the people as well as 100 or 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.720
 for example, which is supported by default he is 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.970
 newer holds the last right of a controller or this, for example, the 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.890
 Company out of the sit 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.090
 but basically it is so we can will really choose each one 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.580
 Member elected Meppen and therefore in Brussels needs to use 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.949
 That's what we need is the Finnish case 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.890
 The technical freedom of the rule practically when the button on the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.300
 Controller which media or sends 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.110
 Dr this is it is definitely old is created without such quite a few and the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.780
 then looks later in place for own parts will be white for the church 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.740
 how to do that exactly 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.580
 and what tools he needs, but above all to a video of me that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.350
 the Finnish especially economic 6 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.540
 then we still need to endanger case 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.219
 Red which button leads out what actions a virtual 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.729
 the easiest way to do this is to create a virtual teacher 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.160
 a place close to Timo's own deadly mapping 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.719
 and he also learns about that 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.719
 more information like me then the actual one 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.940
 Meppen trap spot 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.020
 Surely then in my video what I still do because of the Mad Men with you in the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.890
 Cell 6 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.260
 Something like that may be the basic features. "That was actually the most important thing 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.590
 he wanted to say that you know what Woods does with the difference of what 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.850
 free and what could you harm as contagious a lot of it i hope you have 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.320
 a little bit thankyou
