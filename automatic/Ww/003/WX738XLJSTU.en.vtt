00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.220
 is rejected and specifically designed for 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.320
 the typical age differences in tuning is 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.410

 finish that makes a good difference 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.270
 even compared to other guitarists 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.300
