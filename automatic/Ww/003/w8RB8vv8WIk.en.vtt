and then there's a diaspora and we lose

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.850 
and then there's a diaspora and we lose
a<00:01:47.340> sense<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.820> our<00:01:47.939> identity<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.810> thought<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
a sense of our identity I thought that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
a sense of our identity I thought that
but<00:01:50.820> every<00:01:51.119> culture<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.600> unique<00:01:51.750> for

something

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
something

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
something
I<00:01:52.979> thought<00:01:53.430> Cambodian<00:01:53.970> classical<00:01:54.450> dance<00:01:54.720> was

I thought Cambodian classical dance was
unique<00:01:55.680> art<00:01:56.250> form<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:57.000> represented

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
unique art form that represented

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.910 
unique art form that represented
Cambodian<00:01:58.350> culture

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.120 

dance<00:02:03.030> connects<00:02:04.030> Jenny<00:02:04.329> to<00:02:04.569> her<00:02:04.749> America<00:02:05.319> and

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
dance connects Jenny to her America and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.920 
dance connects Jenny to her America and
to<00:02:06.490> her<00:02:06.640> mother
