00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
could be done either way and this

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.200 
could be done either way and this
application<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.529> obviously<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.340> my<00:00:20.550> ipad<00:00:20.939> here

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
application is obviously on my ipad here

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.150 
application is obviously on my ipad here
ready<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> roll<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.619> are<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:22.769> going<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
ready to roll so we are just going to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.099 
ready to roll so we are just going to
kind<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.369> jump<00:00:23.609> straight<00:00:23.880> into<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.510> show

kind of jump straight into it and show
you<00:00:25.170> exactly<00:00:25.260> how<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.890> works<00:00:26.510> now<00:00:27.510> looking

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
you exactly how this works now looking

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.330 
you exactly how this works now looking
at<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.930> photo<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.380> I've<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:28.590> taken<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:29.130> my

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
at this photo that I've just taken of my

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.429 
at this photo that I've just taken of my
apartment<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:30.029> might<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
apartment you might think that this is a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.380 
apartment you might think that this is a
well<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> decent<00:00:32.759> photo<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.210> kind<00:00:33.360> of

well it's a decent photo it's kind of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
well it's a decent photo it's kind of
boring<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> most<00:00:34.680> part<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.070> colors

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
boring but for the most part the colors

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.790 
boring but for the most part the colors
look<00:00:35.780> okay<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.320> sort<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> see

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
look okay and you can sort of see

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.860 
look okay and you can sort of see
everything<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.660> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
everything that's going on but this is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.420 
everything that's going on but this is

half dark and half lit thanks to these

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.049 
half dark and half lit thanks to these
windows<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.980> i<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.579> then<00:00:47.670> AP<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:47.969> my

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
windows that i have and then AP on my

windows that i have and then AP on my
arm<00:00:48.239> chair<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.660> lamp<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> this

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
arm chair and lamp right there so this

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.850 
arm chair and lamp right there so this
is<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.539> original<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.440> media<00:00:52.800> viewer

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
is the original and the media viewer

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.340 
is the original and the media viewer
asus<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.579> asus<00:00:54.210> app<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.750> by<00:00:55.020> hitting<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
asus or asus app is that by hitting the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930 
asus or asus app is that by hitting the
automatic<00:00:55.920> function<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.370> automatically<00:00:56.789> goes

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
automatic function it automatically goes

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
automatic function it automatically goes
through<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.390> adjust<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> lighting<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.410> such

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
through and adjust the lighting in such

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.360 
through and adjust the lighting in such
a<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.520> looks<00:00:59.550> more<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.600> if<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> photo

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
a way that it looks more as if the photo

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070 
a way that it looks more as if the photo
might<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> were<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> sort<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> capturing

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
might if you were a sort of capturing

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.990 
might if you were a sort of capturing
stills<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.979> say<00:01:05.129> screenshots<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:05.939> own

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
stills or say screenshots of your own

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
stills or say screenshots of your own
eyes<00:01:06.240> let<00:01:06.840> me<00:01:06.960> explain<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> little<00:01:07.380> bit<00:01:07.500> further

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
eyes let me explain a little bit further

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.410 
eyes let me explain a little bit further
essentially<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> idea<00:01:08.850> behind<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
essentially the idea behind the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
essentially the idea behind the
application<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.320> most<00:01:10.530> cameras<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.130> not

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
application is that most cameras do not

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.399 
application is that most cameras do not
capture<00:01:11.640> light<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> same<00:01:12.630> way<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
capture light in the same way that the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.410 
capture light in the same way that the
human<00:01:13.830> eye<00:01:14.010> does<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.640> because<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> uni

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
human eye does this is because the uni

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
human eye does this is because the uni
asked<00:01:15.689> lots<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.020> loads<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.710> things<00:01:16.740> called

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
asked lots of loads of things called

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.620 
asked lots of loads of things called
rods<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.549> cones<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.240> they<00:01:18.360> connect

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
rods and cones and then they connect

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.940 
rods and cones and then they connect
your<00:01:18.810> central<00:01:19.110> nervous<00:01:19.140> system<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
your central nervous system and go to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.490 
your central nervous system and go to
the<00:01:20.040> brain<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.780> basically<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.350> gets

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the brain and basically it gets

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320 
the brain and basically it gets
complicated<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.430> brain<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.939> made<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
complicated but your brain is made to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.999 
complicated but your brain is made to
interpret<00:01:24.900> things<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> vastly<00:01:25.680> different

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
interpret things in a vastly different

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.980 
interpret things in a vastly different
way<00:01:26.100> than<00:01:26.250> say<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.640> simple<00:01:27.150> camera<00:01:27.450> which

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
way than say a simple camera which

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.530 
way than say a simple camera which
merely<00:01:28.200> takes<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.890> sort<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.640> still<00:01:29.939> shot<00:01:30.270> of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
merely takes a sort of still shot of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
merely takes a sort of still shot of
light<00:01:30.780> itself<00:01:31.229> hence<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
light itself hence you get all of the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.090 
light itself hence you get all of the
