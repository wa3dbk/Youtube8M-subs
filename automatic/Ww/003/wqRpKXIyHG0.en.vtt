00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.570
 well hello I'm happy to you 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.370
 find on the spot and 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.940
 today today we are going 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.980
 talk about orchids the size of 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.460
 orchids for potting and maintenance 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.619
 current 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.140
 so when your orchids has finished you 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.450
 laughs actually you're going to keep the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.190
 stem as long as it has not become 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.980
 this color there ie brown 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.990
 clear you have to keep it because he 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.619
 is possible that some shoots get 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.739
 reform 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.719
 like on this branch there when the stem 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.810
 becomes really funny very clear at this 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.050
 moment we will find it will have that 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.050
 plant 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.390
 so here I kept the stem because 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 that she had not dried yet 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.020
 now that the new shoot is 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.400
 left I'll be able to cut it is 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.080
 just above I cut an angle for 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.080
 that water can flow 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.850
 so when we made the size of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.460
 the plant 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.710
 now we will be able to win it on 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.600
 wins the orchids from the month 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.680
 from April until about mid August 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.090
 then we leave the plant flu 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.780
 gently 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.030
 we try to remove a maximum of old 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.070
 dumbbell then we will notice that the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.170
 orchids do not live in a mixture 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.680
 straight land but rather in a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.509
 amalgam of a little potting soil with 2 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.979
 bread corses and sometimes you can 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:48.509
 also add taulan stern where this 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.310
 polystyrene balls shakes them 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.929
 roots 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.850
 when we have roots that are like 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.920
 that when the roots are 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.119
 completely dry like that we're going 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.119
 able to cut them 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.720
 and we look like that the plant there is 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.750
 has some that are damaged on 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.280
 look a little removed all his roots 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.560
 damaged that will not grow on the other hand 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.800
 if roots come out of the bridge it's not 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.800
 very serious 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.110
 so you see that I did a 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.920
 earthy mix with 2 strings of 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.060
 bread a little potting soil and also some 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.040
 polystyrene beads 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.780
 because the orchids from him 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.310
 fatally of what is in the soil 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.810
 but rather some humidity 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.670
 catch with their roots and their 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.400
 leaves 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.349
 so we take a pot a little bigger 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.349
 we put a little potting soil in the bottom of the pot 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.120
 then we have the orchid we try 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.180
 to get a maximum of root in 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.170
 and we put the soil all around 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:14.709
 roots by obviously pressing 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.709
 gently do not break the roots 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.139
 that's when the port seems to us to be pau 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.139
 full fees 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.459
 we leave it like that if we want 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.930
 possibly on it we can put 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.140
 clay balls to prevent at 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.060
 polystyrene can from a 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.620
 saucer that is a bit too strong but 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.310
 obviously usually it would take a 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.989
 saucer it's a maximum 2 cm a little 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.290
 bigger than the fake ones and we water the 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.290
 Earth 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.470
 then it is possible that by watering the 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.870
 theron gets a little bit at this moment 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.790
 there after two three watering on 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:10.560
 see if it is missing if the amendment 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:13.140
 a lot will be added then the 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.209
 orchids like this variety there that 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.730
 is called fall ynopsis we can 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.760
 go out from the month of april 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.220
 until about mid September 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.729
 we will install them especially not in the sun 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.280
 but in the shade and we'll think about watering 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.320
 the more the earth once a week and 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.110
 alternately after two to three 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.990
 days we go mist ise ie 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.150
 takes a little so sprayers one 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.220
 will break and canton haze there are 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.389
 committed everything even if you have any 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.940
 stems that are higher it takes 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.710
 absolutely you put the stems the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.919
 flowers and leaves it's very 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.630
 important for orchids one thing 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.360
 also very important for orchids 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.770
 that there is water in the saucer there 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.440
 do not have water in 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.690
 permanence in the saucer the 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.280
 bright orchids from the humidity of the air 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.680
 they are not aquatic plants 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.600
 who live all the time the roots in 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.980
 water so it is possible that after 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.350
 two three days and well the 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.900
 the water has evaporated but it's not 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.790
 serious since you water on average 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.830
 it's once or twice a week in 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.720
 hot period by not forgetting to 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.720
 also specify the plant 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880
 this
