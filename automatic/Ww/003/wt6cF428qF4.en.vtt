00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the bottle and I've just set it to the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.569 
the bottle and I've just set it to the
side<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:36.320> I'm<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.649> going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> open<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.310> bag

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and because this is super ultra fine the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.800 
and because this is super ultra fine the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
directions actually tell you to work

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.929 
directions actually tell you to work
with<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> mask<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.729> just

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
with a mask because it really just

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.450 
with a mask because it really just
floats<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.719> of<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:45.990> almost<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.500> almost

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
floats out of you're almost like almost

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.670 
floats out of you're almost like almost
like<00:01:47.700> smoke<00:01:48.689> or<00:01:48.930> something<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.409> mean<00:01:49.530> it's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
like smoke or something I mean it's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.969 
like smoke or something I mean it's
cooler<00:01:50.100> fine<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.869> all<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.930> use<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.560> small

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
cooler fine and all I use is a small

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219 
cooler fine and all I use is a small
crystal<00:01:53.880> nail<00:01:54.210> file<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.899> kind<00:01:55.170> of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
crystal nail file because it kind of

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.670 
crystal nail file because it kind of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
okay and you might just have to tap it a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.240 
okay and you might just have to tap it a
little<00:02:19.430> bit<00:02:20.650> see<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:23.319> I<00:02:24.319> might<00:02:25.010> just<00:02:25.040> put

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
little bit see that and I might just put

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.400 
little bit see that and I might just put
a<00:02:25.430> tiny<00:02:25.700> bit<00:02:25.940> more<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.540> don't<00:02:26.810> need<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> lot

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
a tiny bit more but you don't need a lot

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.100 
a tiny bit more but you don't need a lot
to<00:02:27.440> make<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:28.069> stuff<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.580> mean<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.930> really

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
to make this stuff I mean you really

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.070 
to make this stuff I mean you really
don't<00:02:30.379> you<00:02:30.680> only<00:02:30.920> need<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> small<00:02:31.340> amount

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
don't you only need a small amount

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.479 
don't you only need a small amount
because<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.230> problem<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.739> if<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.069> get<00:02:34.220> too

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
because the problem is if you get too

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.040 
because the problem is if you get too
much<00:02:34.610> powder<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.060> there<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:35.599> it<00:02:35.720> ends<00:02:35.959> up

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
much powder in there then it ends up

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.990 
much powder in there then it ends up
looking<00:02:36.290> just<00:02:36.800> sort<00:02:37.519> of<00:02:37.610> pasty<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.599> muddy<00:02:39.019> and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
looking just sort of pasty and muddy and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.309 
looking just sort of pasty and muddy and
in<00:02:41.000> order<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.269> just<00:02:41.630> try<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.900> make<00:02:42.140> sure<00:02:42.170> I

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
in order to just try to make sure I

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.289 
in order to just try to make sure I
don't<00:02:42.500> waste<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.130> sometimes<00:02:43.549> I'll<00:02:43.730> use<00:02:43.760> just

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
don't waste it sometimes I'll use just

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.020 
don't waste it sometimes I'll use just
the<00:02:44.540> little<00:02:45.200> sleeve<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.830> my<00:02:45.980> nail<00:02:46.340> file<00:02:46.730> goes

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
I mean you can see on my nail file it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.440 
I mean you can see on my nail file it
looks<00:03:00.769> like<00:03:01.250> it's<00:03:01.400> just<00:03:01.489> stuck<00:03:01.940> on<00:03:02.090> there<00:03:02.269> you

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
looks like it's just stuck on there you

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.880 
looks like it's just stuck on there you
actually<00:03:02.660> have<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:02.989> rinse<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.440> off<00:03:03.590> I've

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
actually have to rinse it off I've

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.440 
actually have to rinse it off I've
gotten<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.340> my<00:03:04.489> fingers<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.299> looks

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
gotten it on my fingers and it looks

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.979 
gotten it on my fingers and it looks
like<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.660> smeared<00:03:07.060> silver<00:03:08.060> liquid<00:03:08.630> on<00:03:08.750> me<00:03:08.959> I

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
like I smeared silver liquid on me I

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.259 
like I smeared silver liquid on me I
mean<00:03:09.260> it's<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:11.799> micro-fine<00:03:13.269> okay

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
mean it's that that that micro-fine okay

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.800 
mean it's that that that micro-fine okay
then<00:03:14.930> all<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:15.349> is<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.739> add<00:03:15.920> some<00:03:16.519> BBS<00:03:16.880> okay

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
then all you do is you add some BBS okay

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.150 
then all you do is you add some BBS okay
because<00:03:18.110> this<00:03:18.290> powder<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.799> going<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.010> just

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
because this powder is going to just

let<00:04:07.010> this<00:04:07.160> fit<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.700> powder<00:04:08.000> will<00:04:08.329> flip<00:04:08.660> along

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
let this fit the powder will flip along

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.720 
let this fit the powder will flip along
to<00:04:09.139> the<00:04:09.230> bottom<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:09.889> what<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.130> want<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.400> do<00:04:10.519> is

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
to the bottom so what you want to do is

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.370 
to the bottom so what you want to do is
you're<00:04:10.940> going<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.150> shake<00:04:11.389> it<00:04:11.569> like<00:04:11.720> side-side

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
you're going to shake it like side-side

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.349 
you're going to shake it like side-side
says<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.829> BB<00:04:13.130> scrape<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.730> powder<00:04:14.030> up

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
says to BB scrape that powder up

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.569 
says to BB scrape that powder up
depending<00:04:14.930> on<00:04:15.049> how<00:04:15.319> you<00:04:15.380> let<00:04:15.980> your<00:04:16.099> bottle<00:04:16.400> lay

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
depending on how you let your bottle lay

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.120 
depending on how you let your bottle lay
down<00:04:17.289> but<00:04:18.289> you're<00:04:18.440> going<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:18.650> have<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.919> shake

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
down but you're going to have to shake

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.409 
down but you're going to have to shake
you<00:04:19.310> know<00:04:19.340> for<00:04:19.669> at<00:04:19.760> least<00:04:19.849> a<00:04:20.060> couple<00:04:20.090> of

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
you know for at least a couple of

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.180 
you know for at least a couple of
minutes<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.810> really<00:04:21.139> get<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.440> mixed<00:04:21.739> up<00:04:21.829> so<00:04:22.070> it

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
minutes to really get it mixed up so it

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.400 
minutes to really get it mixed up so it
looks<00:04:22.220> like<00:04:22.610> this<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.120> then<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.930> can<00:04:24.110> see

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
looks like this and then you can see

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.200 
looks like this and then you can see
when<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:24.800> take<00:04:25.039> this<00:04:25.190> out

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
when you take this out

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.550 
when you take this out
your<00:04:27.960> brush<00:04:28.229> will<00:04:28.680> have<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.930> will<00:04:31.050> have<00:04:31.229> some

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
your brush will have it will have some

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.200 
your brush will have it will have some
shimmer<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:32.069> it<00:04:32.100> it<00:04:32.280> almost<00:04:32.430> looks<00:04:32.759> just<00:04:33.030> kind

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
shimmer to it it almost looks just kind

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.610 
shimmer to it it almost looks just kind
of<00:04:33.270> gray<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:35.729> that's<00:04:36.509> it<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.110> would<00:04:37.349> you

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
of gray and that's it so you would you

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.710 
of gray and that's it so you would you
would<00:04:37.740> add<00:04:37.949> probably<00:04:38.280> two<00:04:38.789> coats<00:04:39.090> as<00:04:39.360> best

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
would add probably two coats as best

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.719 
would add probably two coats as best
when<00:04:40.289> you<00:04:40.410> use<00:04:40.620> this<00:04:40.800> daughter<00:04:41.130> of<00:04:41.460> this

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
when you use this daughter of this

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.689 
when you use this daughter of this
topcoat<00:04:42.530> two<00:04:43.530> coats<00:04:43.770> over<00:04:44.099> here<00:04:44.250> your<00:04:44.370> colors

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
topcoat two coats over here your colors

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.670 
topcoat two coats over here your colors
is<00:04:44.880> probably<00:04:45.270> best<00:04:45.569> if<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.840> start<00:04:46.199> adding<00:04:46.349> too

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
is probably best if you start adding too

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.710 
is probably best if you start adding too
much<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.430> does<00:04:48.000> not<00:04:48.150> make<00:04:48.389> it<00:04:48.449> more

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
much it does not make it more

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.240 
much it does not make it more
holographic<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.500> actually<00:04:49.860> will<00:04:49.979> make<00:04:50.009> it

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
holographic it actually will make it

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.939 
holographic it actually will make it
just<00:04:50.430> look<00:04:50.580> kind<00:04:50.789> of<00:04:50.849> like<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.199> silver<00:04:52.199> metallic

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
just look kind of like a silver metallic

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.480 
just look kind of like a silver metallic
kind<00:04:53.819> of<00:04:53.970> color<00:04:54.229> so<00:04:55.229> that's<00:04:55.860> all<00:04:56.039> there<00:04:56.190> is<00:04:56.250> to

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
kind of color so that's all there is to

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.809 
kind of color so that's all there is to
it

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
it

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.939 
it
it's<00:04:57.000> really<00:04:57.330> really<00:04:57.569> simple<00:04:58.080> in<00:04:58.380> fact<00:04:58.710> at<00:04:58.889> the

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
it's really really simple in fact at the

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.170 
it's really really simple in fact at the
end<00:04:59.009> of<00:04:59.160> this<00:04:59.220> video<00:04:59.490> I'll<00:04:59.639> just<00:04:59.820> show<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.060> I
