00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.960
 what a wave that a million videos in 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.540
 this destination occasion and this is the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.910
 cave of treasures on Mars 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.100
 and by itself as it already knew to influence in 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.530
 what is a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.170
 an area out there where they know what is the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.230
 good land is an imputation delivered 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.970
 around here a partridge on the planet Mars 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.760
 that yes already must be of a good level 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.710
 throwing him at 20 or a little bit higher 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.430
 and preferably you have to go 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.080
 accompanied by a friend because here 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.059
 they thought what the cabales are but there are 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.030
 one that brings out a shield there is another 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.730
 which is one of the little chiefs and one of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.680
 the normal ones then are three monkeys that 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.420
 they are leaving but they leave periodically 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.780
 and then here you can also do 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.650
 something of refarming to get there 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.340
 good good things ok then it's in the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.620
 mission 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.450
 cerberus by after singing 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.570
 it is simply a mission of cerberus 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.900
 bye bye which is the only mission out there 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.860
 the escudito is of ours we say 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.930
 of the planet then you get in there and 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.970
 almost at the end of what is this mission 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.070
 happens is what is the tank that you must 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.640
 destroy and after you destroy the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.500
 blood 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.450
 you get to be where we are going to fight 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.240
 against the final monster 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.590
 then there where we hardly get what 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 which is the ship where the monster is 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.240
 end there the only thing you have to do 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.710
 you enter and leave and when you leave nothing 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.420
 more you stay there in this part in the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.420
 that I am and the side from the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.729
 ramp ladder that 's the only thing 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.759
 they have to make you stay there and from 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.080
 there the Mossos will be going out and going out 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.690
 with a very good frequency of 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.310
 approximately about 6 seconds 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.220
 approximately they are going out there 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.010
 the monkeys then it's interesting 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.840
 now how good is it because in the other 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.420
 of the earth suddenly you have to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.880
 spend a lot of time and killing monkeys and 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.630
 Sometimes they gave you some in agra but not very 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.420
 good and it took a little bit to leave 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.720
 so good in this mission that I was 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 playing around here and it took me that they will be 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.090
 as some 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.250
 seven minutes let's say doing farming 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:47.250
 more or less is the duration of the video and 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.210
 in that duration of the video to be 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.900
 let's say I got an anagram green 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.970
 It was good but 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.200
 we look for the blues or purples that 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.510
 they are good 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.629
 they also gave me a in the grass of 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.790
 purple or on the grass of legend and 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.180
 in this video I did not get out because 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.250
 out there cut the video before time 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.540
 but also out there in the part of 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.120
 inside the cave 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.629
 they gave me another two in the color grass 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.280
 blue then for the time in the 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.930
 that I was out there investing him 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.269
 let's say they were I say 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.030
 approximately 78 minutes the truth is 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.060
 that this one is perfect with two in the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.400
 blue grass 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.849
 purple granma and other green 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.470
 so I think it's like monkeys 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.989
 they are already a little bit of another higher level 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.450
 maybe that's why they have better inagra 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.200
 more than those who have on earth by 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.380
 there in the cosmodrome part then 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.599
 Well, I really recommend this place 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.700
 I think if it sounds to them out there to give 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.470
 give good things and tell them nothing else the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.080
 recommendation you have to try out there 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.660
 go with one or with two friends because as 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.209
 one of ours is one of the monkeys 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.549
 they are a bit hard to kill 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.549
 then already between three is easier and if 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.620
 they want there in that same place here not 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.420
 I put it true because they erase them if they see 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.920
 what 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.819
 that suddenly in accounts for there 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.530
 places where farmers 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.600
 on the left side where I am 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.759
 pointing to more they go straight to what 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.680
 which is the mountain and from there you can 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.960
 put the three and they will be coming out of there 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.470
 from that farming cave or the cave of 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.630
 the treasures also on the right side of 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.270
 of what the ship is in this case 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.770
 that I'm standing on the left side and 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.660
 They will also be leaving from there 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.449
 ship then now here you can do 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.250
 farming perfectly only them 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.680
 I show here this part of what is 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.630
 this cave but there are three places there 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.699
 you can do an excellent farming and 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.610
 out there getting good at grams 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:51.099
 how good already with the new update 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.710
 all so the blue anagrams that 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:57.190
 have to can blue or purple things 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.969
 and the anagrams modes will give you things 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.619
 or is 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.290
 with this new patch that comes in 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:05.300
 the networks 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.920
 excellent as they come out there and it came out 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.320
 which is the purple color anagram 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.820
 there is green and those inside do not know 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.030
 they get to see why they are out there in 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.880
 the bottom part 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.880
 but hey here I leave you and more 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.740
 I'm still uploading more videos 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.300
 thank you and see you soon here I leave you with 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.320
 the final part of the video where I'm going to 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.320
 tour the biggest
