00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.820
 I am focused on some aspects 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.309
 properly of the pear because there was 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.980
 put the bottom with ultramarine blue and 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.130
 with mixed with black I tell them that 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.100
 can be is is that mixture between 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.040
 watercolor that we had that was the 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.900
 absolute marine being able to mix with 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.910
 the black ink that really 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.860
 works pretty well now what 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.230
 I have a rather dark surface 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.050
 in the background with a very beautiful blue and with 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.500
 a resplendent fruit with shades 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.360
 yellowish greens etcetera and is the 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.710
 part that corresponded to me was this that 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.290
 I was here to smear a little 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.720
 still that can be doubted more and I 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.840
 I do here as soon as you know it is 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.460
 explained many times the nature of 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.620
 how fast I have to paint 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.660
 here 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.390
 it's a little bit of stains nothing more 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.720
 Now what I'm going is with a little bit of 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.850
 black that is bandai that also for 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.369
 this part what is 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.290
 connection that had the fruit with the tree 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.290
 what's left a little bit there 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.069
 it can be thinner how it can be 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.069
 thicker depends as you the 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:27.850
 can perceive and in some parts 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:30.670
 much darker and much more adjustments 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.259
 clear this other one of here we had already 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.090
 put the shape of the sheet is 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.000
 simply nothing more 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.130
 try to accompany the time 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.560
 from that stem and a little thick here 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.860
 because it turns a little to one side the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.470
 fruit then clear when turning what 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.750
 it happens is that it gets a little thicker 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.170
 because the stem is in stock and it's like 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.659
 that curls on that surface 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.909
 and generates as a feeling of 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.659
 bulge 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.140
 nothing else is to go through here that area a 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.110
 little more diluted with water to 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.170
 take her there 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.400
 and leave a stain 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.020
 there plotted for ringing with the other 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.900
 making the paint deposit 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.790
 fall perfectly on the one of more 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.489
 surface I want to show right now in a 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.470
 almost at the end of the program one of 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.380
 the works already of one of the viewers 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.420
 in this case it will be of the good david 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.980
 stone castle is a very good painter and 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.170
 is doing some beautiful works 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.860
 some figures in manga that you 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.860
 soon they will see it 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.560
 also I remind my courses 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.730
 art there in curridabat so that you 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.280
 contact me at telephone 22 72 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.900
 59 12 also remember that they are groups 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.230
 little ones is like a kind of 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.040
 social gathering every weekend at 22 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.870
 72 59 12 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.890
 You see how the sheet is coming out 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.560
 cutting me to one side of the clear stroke 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.109
 that he had originally put and then 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.370
 forming the other darkening the lasting 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:20.890
 a kind of clear figure and then 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.500
 just lie down a little to where 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.519
 is the dark part and then towards the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.379
 another one I'm going with the ultramarine blue let me 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.989
 see be all this part of here brush 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.480
 It has a full stroke stroke 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.209
 so I need the blue to be good 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.940
 dark in this case from once from 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.819
 a principle I put it dark now from 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.879
 a principle for 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.920
 tolerate that strong color base in 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.959
 some sections of the dry brush true 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.190
 there is no need to fear the dry brush is 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:57.260
 just trace 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:00.800
 the well firm color well sure and for 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.560
 that looks good look good and we do not go 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.270
 to cause a 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.520
 it's nice to see the truth 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.690
 done wrong 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.760
 simply look somehow 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.310
 how to distribute the color correctly 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.209
 and then after moving towards another 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.069
 part of the picture 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.720
 always in the part in the part of the 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.170
 logically we are not going to do it in 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.510
 other part 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.510
 already with that I can do it 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.880
 mixture 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.220
 or the transition of this dark part with 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.960
 regarding the white part I would like 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.599
 I can turn this paper around and be able to 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.729
 stand up to work but I can 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:47.420
 do it I have to be here pending 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:50.180
 of this so that we do not go very ugly 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.630
 the watercolors always at home when not 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.820
 pint use all kinds of tricks 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.310
 here I have to be well credit 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.710
 It would be a bit strange to do 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.220
 grotesque changes in the way you paint 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.169
 I could indeed do it some day 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.129
 I think of doing something 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.199
 a little out of style mmm so what 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:17.310
 I can do perfectly but it's not 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.880
 feasible now this other part of here 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.270
 I will be giving in this way 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.740
 let's see if we can do it well 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.529
 As I tell you, I'm working against 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.619
 all the nature of my position 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:34.900
 It is not the most comfortable Peruvian for a 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:37.830
 left - handed of those parts are perfect 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.330
 because they are parts 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.530
 that you can work very well in the 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.170
 left hand works perfectly 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.030
 in this area but when you have to 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.860
 work in this other area to which your 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.960
 two makes them more uncomfortable as there 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.409
 part that benefits you and there are parts that 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.340
 do not 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.290
 so here I am going to put it and in 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.860
 tear it off a little bit the color what 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.830
 come here 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.469
 a little bit of scraped color 15 the 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.060
 scraped to make it look like I'm coming out 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:07.990
 with the 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:11.020
 so I'm going to take this away 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.880
 taking this away 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.460
 to see if it looks good 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.419
 cut out the paint we can that 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.419
 we can see the cleanest 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.199
 but be hindered by those spots 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.389
 that are always done to the shore already with 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.830
 the seal I have it ready but for 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.199
 course it will not be ready until it's 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.949
 put the signature then I'm going to 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.729
 putting out the logical thing would be to put it on 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.600
 inside I'm going to put it here 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:42.000
 outside 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.770
 because when it is already framed 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.110
 Well you will look for a correct position 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:51.760
 so that the signature remains 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:54.520
 that's the pears we were seeing 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.220
 the whole process and we continue to be made and 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.810
 I really think that I think he has 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.760
 it is clear that the pears are very pretty 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.270
 with that color that is not a contrast 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:07.620
 I want to show you now if this work of 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:11.460
 David Stone is a 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.380
 work of drawing in manga with colors 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.740
 very sober a little bit dark very 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:19.300
 pretty by the way 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:22.099
 we have it there and he is a viewer 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.530

 time to paint
