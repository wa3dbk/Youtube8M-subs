this<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.620> our<00:02:14.770> display<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.550> our<00:02:15.790> working

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
this is our display of our working

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.870 
this is our display of our working
display<00:02:16.720> our<00:02:16.870> actual<00:02:17.170> real-time<00:02:17.380> display<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
display our actual real-time display the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.530 
display our actual real-time display the
telemetry<00:02:19.209> stuff<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.690> we<00:02:19.780> have

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
telemetry stuff that we have

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.930 
telemetry stuff that we have
normally<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.530> device<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.370> goes<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:22.849> the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
normally it's a device that goes in the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.309 
normally it's a device that goes in the
controller<00:02:23.300> we<00:02:23.690> made<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.050> little<00:02:24.200> bit

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
controller we made it a little bit

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.780 
controller we made it a little bit
bigger<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.739> can<00:02:24.920> see<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.250> movie<00:02:25.489> easier

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
bigger so you can see the movie easier

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.059 
bigger so you can see the movie easier
this<00:02:26.239> tells<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.599> real-time<00:02:27.019> everything<00:02:27.860> that

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
this tells you real-time everything that

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.009 
this tells you real-time everything that
is<00:02:28.220> going<00:02:28.430> on<00:02:28.700> with<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.239> vehicle<00:02:29.629> hazard

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
is going on with the vehicle hazard

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.630 
is going on with the vehicle hazard
right<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:30.950> have<00:02:31.129> your<00:02:31.400> current

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
right so you have your current

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.430 
right so you have your current
temperature<00:02:32.090> right<00:02:32.239> now<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.420> motor<00:02:32.659> it's<00:02:32.900> 97

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
temperature right now the motor it's 97

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.289 
temperature right now the motor it's 97
degrees<00:02:33.470> you've<00:02:34.370> got<00:02:34.489> twenty<00:02:34.760> three<00:02:35.060> point

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
degrees you've got twenty three point

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.390 
degrees you've got twenty three point
two<00:02:35.480> volts<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.930> our<00:02:36.049> battery<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.160> course

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
two volts and our battery and of course

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.009 
two volts and our battery and of course
our<00:02:37.580> rpm<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.030> our<00:02:38.120> miles<00:02:38.299> per<00:02:38.510> hour<00:02:38.629> at<00:02:38.780> zero

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
our rpm and our miles per hour at zero

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.600 
our rpm and our miles per hour at zero
so<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:39.379> ramp<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.739> up<00:02:39.860> that's<00:02:40.129> all<00:02:40.250> going<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:40.549> be

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
so we ramp it up that's all going to be

00:02:40.610 --> 00:03:16.440 
so we ramp it up that's all going to be
real-time<00:02:40.879> solving<00:02:41.510> fly

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.809 

the<00:03:17.450> other<00:03:17.599> part<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.989> app<00:03:18.080> is<00:03:18.640> through<00:03:19.640> the

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
the other part of the app is through the

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.369 
the other part of the app is through the
app<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.330> can<00:03:20.480> actually<00:03:20.659> change<00:03:21.019> the

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
app you can actually change the

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.259 
app you can actually change the
parameters<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.549> controller<00:03:22.580> your

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
parameters of the controller your

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.520 
parameters of the controller your
throttle<00:03:23.659> sensitivity<00:03:24.170> your<00:03:24.230> steering

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
throttle sensitivity your steering

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.250 
throttle sensitivity your steering
sensitivity

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
sensitivity

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.899 
sensitivity
and<00:03:26.769> those<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:27.010> could<00:03:27.159> all<00:03:27.370> be<00:03:27.400> changed

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
and those that could all be changed

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.420 
and those that could all be changed
through<00:03:28.090> through<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.110> well<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.650> if<00:03:29.950> for

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
through through that as well so if for

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
through through that as well so if for
instance<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.940> want<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.120> change<00:03:31.330> their

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
instance you want to change their

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.509 
instance you want to change their
steering-oar<00:03:31.870> right<00:03:32.230> one<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:32.980> knobs<00:03:33.190> on

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
steering-oar right one of the knobs on

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.130 
steering-oar right one of the knobs on
our<00:03:33.819> controller<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.540> are<00:03:34.659> multifunctional

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
our controller is are multifunctional

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.710 
our controller is are multifunctional
and<00:03:35.590> as<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.670> can<00:03:36.819> see<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.209> screen<00:03:37.450> as<00:03:37.629> I

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
and as you can see on the screen as I

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.539 
and as you can see on the screen as I
turn<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.019> knob<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.349> changes<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.769> value<00:03:39.129> so<00:03:39.519> I

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
turn the knob it changes the value so I

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.130 
turn the knob it changes the value so I
can<00:03:39.640> assign<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.269> knob<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.510> these<00:03:40.840> five

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
can assign this knob to these five

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.820 
can assign this knob to these five
different<00:03:41.349> things<00:03:42.269> or<00:03:43.269> on<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.170> app<00:03:44.260> itself<00:03:44.560> I

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
different things or on the app itself I

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.280 
different things or on the app itself I
can<00:03:45.010> go<00:03:45.099> up<00:03:45.250> or<00:03:45.430> down<00:03:45.459> independently<00:03:46.450> of<00:03:47.019> which
