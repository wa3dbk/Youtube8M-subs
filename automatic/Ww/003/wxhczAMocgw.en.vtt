00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 was giving continuity to the 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.540
 process of conversion of bacteria 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.740
 electronic acoustic here today 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 finished more than a conversion even 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.359
 one a dish brand daycare 15 is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.060
 15 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.269
 it was all broken already all cut 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.980
 I'll even show you that I have used is 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.690
 very easy to find reading this kind of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.379
 pliers that the strong and the dish is not to know 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.910
 Why is she so easy to pliers? 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.700
 reasonably cheap is not very expensive 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.050
 I do not know that I did not even borrow it 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.059
 here from a neighbor 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.629

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:01.079
 I made a porteno here the bulletin kind of 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.449
 triangular rubber that I or I 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.250

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.689
 The internet left there. I got it. 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.060
 low ranking which will cut 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.880
 glued not here just will not give it to take 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.689
 but it's basic that people know how 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.610
 works pasted weight and is it folks 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.680

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.710
 just put another and see the same over 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.170

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.270
 I'll show him after touching result 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:58.200

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.049
 that are even or even as they say 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.789
 It is even better than a project 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.410
 where a large company 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.060
