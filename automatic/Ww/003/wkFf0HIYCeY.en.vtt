00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.860
 This is a video by which Texas have been teaching rules 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.239
 This video is about play money and vain money played 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.959
 so the video has no critical content summer sun jam just 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.539
 explain the rules 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.539
 this structure in this game is Nolan 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.570
 we could see it was raised to 10 cents 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.349
 I have extra York Zion 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.579
 either Pohlig that's who where my cards way 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 or I can use the 10 cents cord that is called GM 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.440
 or else I have the opportunity to increase what will be done here now 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.550
 I have increased to 90 cents 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.570
 because we play in the mirror 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.570
 Corinne the other William a racer fast 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
 At the moment I have a couple of fives 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.050
 I have a 5 in the hand and a five league in the middle 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.360
 if, however, with the trip or indeed a second comes then I have one 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.010
 Road they consist of tickets para 2 3 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.070
 and 5 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 Now I have got my street 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.100
 but I can still stand against someone else who's a six on the 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.150
 Hand has and therefore a higher road than I have 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.250
 his street would then consist of acts 2 3 4 5 and six 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.970
 the other player therefore wins the six in the hand a higher street 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 has when I'm on the hand with my boss 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.560
 Thank you very much for your attention
