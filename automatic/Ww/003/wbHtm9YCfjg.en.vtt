the way up the stem it's why if you were

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.770 
the way up the stem it's why if you were

you grow in the no dig manner like I do

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.620 
you grow in the no dig manner like I do
once<00:03:40.070> your<00:03:40.220> potatoes<00:03:40.340> are<00:03:40.730> 2<00:03:41.060> or<00:03:41.120> 3<00:03:41.360> inches

once your potatoes are 2 or 3 inches

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.990 
once your potatoes are 2 or 3 inches
high<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.230> go<00:03:43.100> along<00:03:43.340> then<00:03:43.579> you<00:03:43.610> use<00:03:43.850> the

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
high you go along then you use the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.270 
high you go along then you use the
second<00:03:44.390> application<00:03:45.049> of<00:03:45.260> well<00:03:46.070> rotted

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
second application of well rotted

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.850 
second application of well rotted
compost<00:03:46.970> or<00:03:47.600> really<00:03:48.019> really<00:03:48.290> well<00:03:48.470> rotted

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
compost or really really well rotted

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.370 
compost or really really well rotted
manure<00:03:49.480> because<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.780> can't<00:03:51.079> let<00:03:51.260> your

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
manure because you can't let your

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.610 
manure because you can't let your
potatoes<00:03:52.360> grow<00:03:53.360> on<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.780> surface<00:03:53.989> if<00:03:54.470> they

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
potatoes grow on the surface if they

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.110 
potatoes grow on the surface if they
grow<00:03:54.739> on<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:54.920> surface<00:03:55.070> they'll<00:03:55.549> turn<00:03:55.760> green

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
grow on the surface they'll turn green

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.009 
grow on the surface they'll turn green
and<00:03:56.900> green<00:03:57.140> potatoes<00:03:57.680> as<00:03:57.890> we<00:03:58.040> all<00:03:58.130> know<00:03:59.019> are

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
and green potatoes as we all know are

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.160 
and green potatoes as we all know are
poisonous

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.099 

so<00:04:05.170> once<00:04:05.349> we<00:04:05.560> have<00:04:05.709> about<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.980> third<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.930> bag

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
so once we have about a third of the bag

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:16.640 
so once we have about a third of the bag
filled<00:04:12.299> give<00:04:13.299> it<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.480> good<00:04:13.599> mix<00:04:13.870> around<00:04:14.079> to<00:04:14.530> mix

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
filled give it a good mix around to mix

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:30.760 
filled give it a good mix around to mix
your<00:04:17.650> ingredients<00:04:18.340> together

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.950 

take<00:04:31.770> your<00:04:31.950> potatoes<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:33.830> probably<00:04:34.830> three<00:04:35.160> is

the potatoes in our recycling back you

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.320 
the potatoes in our recycling back you
can<00:05:58.950> see<00:05:59.160> there's<00:05:59.370> some<00:05:59.520> phenomenal<00:06:00.120> growth

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
can see there's some phenomenal growth

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.260 
can see there's some phenomenal growth
that's<00:06:00.660> because<00:06:01.050> we've<00:06:01.650> kept<00:06:01.919> these<00:06:02.270> inside

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
that's because we've kept these inside

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.760 
that's because we've kept these inside
they're<00:06:03.630> actually<00:06:03.930> in<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.110> polytunnel<00:06:04.560> if

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
they're actually in the polytunnel if

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.170 
they're actually in the polytunnel if
you<00:06:04.890> keep<00:06:05.070> them<00:06:05.220> in<00:06:05.250> a<00:06:05.370> greenhouse<00:06:05.520> it<00:06:05.970> will<00:06:06.060> do

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
you keep them in a greenhouse it will do

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.029 
you keep them in a greenhouse it will do
the<00:06:06.300> same<00:06:06.510> if<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.020> look<00:06:07.169> around<00:06:07.530> me<00:06:07.740> you<00:06:07.860> can

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
the same if you look around me you can

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.370 
the same if you look around me you can
see<00:06:08.250> it<00:06:08.370> just<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:08.700> read<00:06:08.940> growth<00:06:09.360> in<00:06:09.630> this<00:06:10.080> bed

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
see it just the read growth in this bed

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.770 
see it just the read growth in this bed
and<00:06:10.650> this<00:06:11.100> has<00:06:11.280> been<00:06:11.430> left<00:06:11.640> for<00:06:12.030> a<00:06:12.479> different

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
and this has been left for a different

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.040 
and this has been left for a different
film<00:06:12.990> about<00:06:13.110> hoeing<00:06:13.560> but<00:06:14.360> since<00:06:15.360> you've<00:06:15.900> got

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
film about hoeing but since you've got

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.740 
film about hoeing but since you've got
about<00:06:16.200> this<00:06:16.380> much<00:06:16.440> growth<00:06:17.270> you<00:06:18.270> then<00:06:18.479> take

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
about this much growth you then take

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.090 
about this much growth you then take
some<00:06:19.080> more<00:06:19.910> compost<00:06:20.910> and<00:06:21.210> this<00:06:21.330> is<00:06:21.539> 50%<00:06:22.500> where

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
some more compost and this is 50% where

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.620 
some more compost and this is 50% where
