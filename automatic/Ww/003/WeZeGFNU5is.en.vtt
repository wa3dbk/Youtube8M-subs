00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.980
 in a 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.510
 team of people like this one in sioux and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.400
 I brought them a little video clip 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.640
 on how to improve with the trick of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.680
 patca punch plus the shield something very clear 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.330
 indeed by Sullen it is good has 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.920
 of patience I already had the recorded video 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.510
 out there but I did not have time to edit it 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.490
 so I put it on and said well let's 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.690
 edit it to see what happens not in order from 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.090
 the first step would be the 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.590
 locate the punch pack and after 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.300
 try to measure your times in this case 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.670
 I gave it a little bit delayed but 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.199
 good and good if the round ends 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.000
 do not worry, just keep the 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.700
 calm as it is running so to speak 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.489
 not once running the only thing that 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.720
 we have to wait is it to appear 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.970
 current elevator you are fortunate that 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.530
 So it went up much better in my case 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.540
 it kind of delayed me a bit and I had to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.070
 apply the trick that to get on 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.230
 little to the elevator to see if so 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.450
 I was already reacting with nerves but 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.399
 well the advantage the advantage that we can 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.690
 to have about this is that we recover the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.759
 points no more than nothing is the trick 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.350
 we could apply it also in any 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.060
 another weapon that is always close 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.759
 and when it is close as in this 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.380
 case could also have been the mp5 but 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.540
 does not catch my attention because the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.100
 initial muse is the most flirtatious and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.700
 nothing not people I think they forget a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 little bit 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.630
 very fast but in the end I think that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.430
 I have nothing else is bundled today or some 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.719
