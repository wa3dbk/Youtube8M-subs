00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.540
 hello everybody you want braille quest 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.770
 today I find myself riff raff to show you 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.070
 the fundamental tool to go to 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.630
 time for a musician that is the metronome 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 and specifically today we have a theme 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.280
 rhyme harms I will explain illustrate the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.579
 various features 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.850
 then first thing they will see is adjustable 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.570
 at 250 bpm we have two roles 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.300
 of clicks that is this climate and this one 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.060
 a little lower 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.399
 then we have the dap function what the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.869
 tab function to exit tatami allows 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.760
 if you then want to find the probability of 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:27.930
 a price of through the button 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.020
 central to select the speed of the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.420
 monica price of the price all ok 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.610
 little your finger carried the quarters e 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 the click will give you speed 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.220
 precise of the mini piece is very useful 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 this wheel very comfortable other function 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.490
 key is the program of 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.689
 speed you can do then 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.159
 let's say memories within the click 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.159
 up to 30 speeds 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.359
 this function is very useful for everyone 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.609
 because it sounds live because it allows you to 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.229
 be much faster in the gearbox 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.399
 from one song to the speed 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:08.989
 and full bie then through the 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.239
 frog button force here is the 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:20.510
 speed we find now is 80 a 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:22.790
 quarters then you have to change you've defined 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.629
 that is, you only have to go to the piece 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.269
 next always pushing the button 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.390
 that you would find yourself therefore hypothetical 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:36.160
 at next speed it is still at 60 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.470
 still it is so much and so on 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.530
 then always returning to the tap function 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.890
 once you say the network 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.670
 the truth of the piece in this case we say 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.400
 100 98 98 the store through 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.870
 this button here store 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.560
 now stored and inside the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.510
 your lineup what to say then we have 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.099
 indeed we still have all the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.590
 subdivisions to fight sixteenths 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.530
 triplets ok so here you are alone instead 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.959
 let's say to adjust the volume of the kit 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.870
 of the mass in general then we have the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.760
 possibility to attach a pedal here 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.989
 let's say hit this remote 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.000
 let's say to be even more 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.620
 fast so don't make any changes 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.359
 with cries but we only produce with the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.590
 foot through this this reason 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.900
 narrow we think of the temple recam 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.480
 pedal you can buy separately 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.910
 bought separately also you can say 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.160
 a bar an estimate that allows you 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.290
 through a large to position the 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.370
 your click where you prefer where you are 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.680
 it's more comfortable than saying I have used it for a long time 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.690
 time and I am very well on 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.569
 live situation is much more we say 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.540
 fast e 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.400
 I am very comfortable it is also a good one 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.340
 volume in the headphones 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.489
 what to say I invite you to try it here from 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.709
 riff raff e nevis I won't see you at 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.040
 upcoming updates and priced a 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.459
 hug 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.459
 Hello
