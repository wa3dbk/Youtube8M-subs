00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.320 

so<00:00:04.890> here's<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.339> code<00:00:05.520> we're<00:00:05.759> going<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.089> use

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
so here's the code we're going to use

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.230 
so here's the code we're going to use
there's<00:00:06.690> not<00:00:06.960> very<00:00:06.990> much<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:08.030> but<00:00:09.030> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
there's not very much of it but the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.200 
there's not very much of it but the
important<00:00:09.630> thing<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.170> am<00:00:10.440> importing

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
important thing is that I am importing

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.480 
important thing is that I am importing
this<00:00:12.210> redstone<00:00:12.690> library<00:00:13.320> Stephen<00:00:13.980> redstone

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
this redstone library Stephen redstone

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.410 
this redstone library Stephen redstone
and<00:00:15.139> i<00:00:16.730> happen<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.880> written<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and i happen to have written the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.750 
and i happen to have written the
redstone<00:00:18.810> library<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.619> right<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.160> it's

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
redstone library it's right here it's

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.269 
redstone library it's right here it's
not<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.970> complicated<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.320> not<00:00:23.039> going

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
not that complicated but I'm not going

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.120 
not that complicated but I'm not going
to<00:00:23.369> go<00:00:23.490> into<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.210> video<00:00:24.779> tutorial

to go into it in this video tutorial
maybe<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.550> another<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:27.410> but<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> reminder

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
maybe in another one but just a reminder

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.389 
maybe in another one but just a reminder
a<00:00:29.160> library<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.449> code<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.710> or<00:00:32.040> somebody

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
a library is code that you or somebody

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.270 
a library is code that you or somebody
else<00:00:32.730> wrote<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.719> make<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:34.260> code<00:00:34.680> easier<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
else wrote to make other code easier to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.970 
else wrote to make other code easier to
write<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.989> are<00:00:37.020> some<00:00:37.140> code<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.739> wrote<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
write so here are some code I wrote to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.180 
write so here are some code I wrote to
make<00:00:38.510> other<00:00:39.510> code<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.320> deals<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.649> redstone

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
make other code that deals with redstone

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.779 
make other code that deals with redstone
easier<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:43.190> in<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:45.379> particular<00:00:46.789> program

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
easier and in this particular program

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.110 
easier and in this particular program
what<00:00:48.539> I'm<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.640> whenever<00:00:50.640> someone

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
what I'm going to do is whenever someone

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.750 
what I'm going to do is whenever someone
steps<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.870> pressure<00:00:52.620> plate<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.129> teleports

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
steps on a pressure plate it teleports

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.479 
steps on a pressure plate it teleports
me<00:00:53.910> back<00:00:54.090> five<00:00:54.510> blocks<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> let's<00:00:56.190> give<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
me back five blocks so let's give it a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
me back five blocks so let's give it a
shot<00:00:56.520> I'll<00:00:56.969> first<00:00:57.270> make<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.510> redstone<00:00:57.840> lamp

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
shot I'll first make a redstone lamp

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.319 
shot I'll first make a redstone lamp
because<00:00:58.829> i<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.340> use<00:00:59.399> those<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.910> testing

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
because i like to use those for testing

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.600 
because i like to use those for testing
and<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.800> two<00:01:02.789> three<00:01:03.719> four<00:01:04.350> five<00:01:04.610> blocks

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and then one two three four five blocks

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.490 
and then one two three four five blocks
away<00:01:05.880> I'll<00:01:06.380> make<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:08.060> pressure<00:01:09.060> plate<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:10.409> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
away I'll make a pressure plate and I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
away I'll make a pressure plate and I
could<00:01:10.680> destroy<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.220> redstone<00:01:11.580> lamp<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.060> put

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
could destroy this redstone lamp and put

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.450 
could destroy this redstone lamp and put
a<00:01:12.240> pressure<00:01:12.420> plate<00:01:12.689> there<00:01:12.930> instead<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.590> what

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
a pressure plate there instead and what

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.390 
a pressure plate there instead and what
should<00:01:14.640> happen<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.060> when<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.299> step<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.400> get

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
should happen is when I step on it I get

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.120 
should happen is when I step on it I get
teleported<00:01:17.880> back<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.080> didn't<00:01:19.350> didn't

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
teleported back but it didn't didn't

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
teleported back but it didn't didn't
work<00:01:20.340> says<00:01:21.150> unknown<00:01:21.450> command<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> must<00:01:22.500> have

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
work says unknown command so I must have

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
work says unknown command so I must have
mistyped<00:01:23.360> something<00:01:26.000> that's<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.210> you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
mistyped something that's right you

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
mistyped something that's right you
don't<00:01:27.450> need<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.840> /<00:01:28.170> right<00:01:28.439> here<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.610> always

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
don't need this / right here you always

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.050 
don't need this / right here you always
subtract<00:01:30.329> off<00:01:30.540> 1<00:01:30.840> /<00:01:31.490> from<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> way<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> would

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
subtract off 1 / from the way you would

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
subtract off 1 / from the way you would
normally<00:01:33.270> run<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> inside<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.530> game<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> we'll

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
normally run it inside the game so we'll

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.609 
normally run it inside the game so we'll
try<00:01:37.890> again<00:01:38.900> replace<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> pressure<00:01:40.320> plate

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
try again replace that pressure plate

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.609 
try again replace that pressure plate
with<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> redstone<00:01:41.130> lamp<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.380> since<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.470> don't

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
with a redstone lamp and since I don't

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.990 
with a redstone lamp and since I don't
actually<00:01:43.799> want<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> redstone<00:01:44.490> lamp<00:01:44.700> I'll<00:01:44.850> use

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
actually want the redstone lamp I'll use

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.969 
actually want the redstone lamp I'll use
the<00:01:45.210> pressure<00:01:45.390> plate<00:01:45.600> again<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.740> step

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the pressure plate again and when I step

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.950 
the pressure plate again and when I step
on<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.189> pressure<00:01:47.340> plate<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.689> teleported

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
on the pressure plate I get teleported

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620 
on the pressure plate I get teleported
back<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> other<00:01:49.740> pressure<00:01:50.070> plate<00:01:50.630> that's

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
back to the other pressure plate that's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899 
back to the other pressure plate that's
exactly<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.229> mechanic<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.950> want<00:01:53.189> now

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
exactly the mechanic that we want now

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.819 
exactly the mechanic that we want now
all<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.659> craft<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.350> clever<00:01:55.619> way

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
all we have to do is craft a clever way

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
all we have to do is craft a clever way
to<00:01:55.860> disguise<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.939> you're<00:01:57.149> actually<00:01:57.299> getting

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
to disguise that you're actually getting

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.469 
to disguise that you're actually getting
teleported<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.469> then<00:01:59.280> the<00:02:00.030> player<00:02:00.270> will

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
teleported and then the player will

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.179 
teleported and then the player will
think<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.960> they<00:02:01.110> are<00:02:01.140> trapped<00:02:01.500> inside<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:02.100> an

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
think that they are trapped inside of an

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.600 
think that they are trapped inside of an
infinite<00:02:02.490> series<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.750> rooms<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.430> now<00:02:05.430> I'll

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
infinite series of rooms and now I'll

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.690 
infinite series of rooms and now I'll
just<00:02:05.880> build<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.360> base<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.649> two<00:02:08.160> different

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
just build the base for two different

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.699 
just build the base for two different
rooms<00:02:08.910> around<00:02:09.420> these<00:02:09.869> two<00:02:10.050> pressure<00:02:10.379> plates

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
rooms around these two pressure plates

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.220 
rooms around these two pressure plates
on<00:02:11.360> speeding<00:02:12.360> things<00:02:12.629> up

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
on speeding things up

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.540 
on speeding things up
durably<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.830> don't<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.310> watch<00:02:14.519> me

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
durably so you don't have to watch me

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:22.759 
durably so you don't have to watch me
build<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.269> for<00:02:16.019> too<00:02:16.200> long<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:21.590> I'll<00:02:22.590> start

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
build it for too long and I'll start

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.080 
build it for too long and I'll start
building<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.220> second<00:02:23.610> layer<00:02:23.760> here<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:26.060> use<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
building the second layer here and use a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.089 
building the second layer here and use a
little<00:02:27.390> bit<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.540> worldedit<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.440> help<00:02:28.650> build

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
little bit of worldedit to help build

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.600 
little bit of worldedit to help build
the<00:02:29.670> wall<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:33.860> then<00:02:34.860> once<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.250> wall<00:02:35.430> was

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the wall and then once the wall was

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.699 
the wall and then once the wall was
built<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.420> couple<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.840> placeholder<00:02:37.410> blocks

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
built on a couple of placeholder blocks

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.630 
built on a couple of placeholder blocks
and<00:02:38.220> set<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.879> roof<00:02:40.069> now<00:02:41.069> we<00:02:41.129> need<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.400> make<00:02:41.610> sure

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and set a roof now we need to make sure

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.449 
and set a roof now we need to make sure
that<00:02:41.879> once<00:02:42.329> they<00:02:42.629> go<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:42.989> they<00:02:43.650> can't<00:02:43.890> go<00:02:44.129> back

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
that once they go in they can't go back

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.640 
that once they go in they can't go back
out<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.970> same<00:02:45.000> way<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.569> let's<00:02:46.110> put<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.349> door

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
out the same way so let's put a door

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.300 
out the same way so let's put a door
right<00:02:46.680> there<00:02:48.019> we'll<00:02:49.019> use<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.319> simple<00:02:50.040> pressure

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
right there we'll use a simple pressure

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.410 
right there we'll use a simple pressure
plate<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.790> open<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.180> door<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:54.120> now<00:02:54.239> they<00:02:54.390> can

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
plate to open that door so now they can

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.380 
plate to open that door so now they can
go<00:02:54.629> in<00:02:54.959> they<00:02:55.650> can't<00:02:55.920> go<00:02:56.099> back<00:02:56.250> out<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:57.180> that's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
go in they can't go back out so that's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.880 
go in they can't go back out so that's
how<00:02:58.430> they<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.609> trapped<00:03:00.230> then<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.379> between<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
how they get trapped then in between the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.849 
how they get trapped then in between the
two<00:03:02.040> rooms<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.579> want<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.910> door<00:03:06.530> we<00:03:07.530> want<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.769> be

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
two rooms we want a door we want to be

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:15.670 
two rooms we want a door we want to be
able<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.129> open<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.549> door<00:03:08.819> with<00:03:09.299> redstone

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.730 

so<00:03:16.680> now<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.890> can<00:03:17.130> go<00:03:17.310> through<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:18.209> we<00:03:18.680> want<00:03:19.680> a

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
so now you can go through and we want a

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.870 
so now you can go through and we want a
door<00:03:19.980> right<00:03:20.280> here<00:03:21.740> that<00:03:22.740> looks<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.520> you<00:03:23.700> can

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
door right here that looks like you can

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.900 
door right here that looks like you can
open<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.270> with<00:03:24.420> redstone<00:03:24.890> which<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.040> can<00:03:26.280> but

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
open it with redstone which you can but

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.800 
open it with redstone which you can but
that's<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> pressure<00:03:27.930> point<00:03:28.290> pressure<00:03:29.010> plate

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
that's the pressure point pressure plate

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.960 
that's the pressure point pressure plate
that<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:31.080> going<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.650> teleport<00:03:32.310> us<00:03:32.459> back<00:03:32.730> into

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
that is going to teleport us back into

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.760 
that is going to teleport us back into
the<00:03:33.180> room<00:03:33.360> from<00:03:33.569> before<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.880> i<00:03:35.910> try<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.330> open<00:03:36.420> it

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
the room from before so i try to open it

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.090 
the room from before so i try to open it
now<00:03:37.770> suddenly<00:03:38.489> I'm<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.090> other<00:03:39.239> room<00:03:40.100> but

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
now suddenly I'm in the other room but

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.280 
now suddenly I'm in the other room but
still<00:03:41.520> not<00:03:41.700> quite<00:03:41.970> perfect<00:03:42.390> because<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.110> can

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
still not quite perfect because I can

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.620 
still not quite perfect because I can
see<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:44.130> way<00:03:44.250> out<00:03:44.489> right<00:03:44.790> here<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:45.540> that

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
see the way out right here and that

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.520 
see the way out right here and that
spoils<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.290> illusion<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:47.100> we<00:03:47.310> need<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:48.530> fix

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
spoils the illusion so we need to fix

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.090 
spoils the illusion so we need to fix
that<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.870> we'll<00:03:52.140> just<00:03:52.200> put<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.560> little<00:03:52.650> bit<00:03:52.950> on

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
that so we'll just put a little bit on

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.780 
that so we'll just put a little bit on
the<00:03:53.250> outside<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:55.350> last<00:03:55.709> room<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.760> that

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
the outside of the last room so that

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.360 
the outside of the last room so that
when<00:03:57.209> they<00:03:57.330> look<00:03:57.540> out<00:03:57.720> they<00:03:58.050> they<00:03:58.769> don't<00:03:58.920> see

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
when they look out they they don't see

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.020 
when they look out they they don't see
the<00:03:59.580> outside<00:03:59.970> looks<00:04:00.450> like<00:04:00.540> it's<00:04:00.870> another<00:04:01.110> room

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
the outside looks like it's another room

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.190 
the outside looks like it's another room
this<00:04:03.030> doesn't<00:04:03.269> have<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.600> perfect<00:04:04.080> they're

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
this doesn't have to be perfect they're

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.240 
this doesn't have to be perfect they're
never<00:04:04.319> going<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.650> get<00:04:04.800> into<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.130> room<00:04:05.370> anyway

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
never going to get into that room anyway

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.610 
never going to get into that room anyway
and<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.330> think<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.569> last<00:04:09.780> finishing<00:04:10.140> touch<00:04:10.590> is

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
and I think the last finishing touch is

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.550 
and I think the last finishing touch is
to<00:04:10.920> make<00:04:11.069> sure<00:04:11.100> there's<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.489> torch<00:04:11.819> on<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.180> wall

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
to make sure there's a torch on the wall

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:22.540 
to make sure there's a torch on the wall
also<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.890> help<00:04:14.040> control<00:04:14.370> for<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.819> light<00:04:15.000> level

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.340 

you

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.020 

yeah<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.800> think<00:04:28.070> that's<00:04:28.340> perfectly<00:04:28.820> nice

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
yeah I think that's perfectly nice

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:38.559 
yeah I think that's perfectly nice
effect<00:04:29.479> you<00:04:30.470> really<00:04:30.680> can't<00:04:30.949> quite<00:04:31.340> tell

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.270 

yeah<00:04:39.569> I<00:04:39.919> really<00:04:40.919> can't<00:04:41.129> tell<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.550> you're

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
yeah I really can't tell that you're

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.709 
yeah I really can't tell that you're
just<00:04:44.280> going<00:04:44.550> into<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.819> same<00:04:45.030> room<00:04:45.270> over<00:04:45.599> and

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
just going into the same room over and

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:47.360 
just going into the same room over and
over<00:04:45.779> again<00:04:46.050> feels<00:04:46.590> like<00:04:46.830> you're<00:04:47.039> going<00:04:47.189> into

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
over again feels like you're going into

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:57.080 
over again feels like you're going into
a<00:04:47.580> new<00:04:47.669> room<00:04:48.029> each<00:04:48.389> time<00:04:55.490> now<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.639> course<00:04:56.699> for

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
a new room each time now of course for

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.300 
a new room each time now of course for
right<00:04:57.210> now<00:04:57.409> whoever<00:04:58.409> you<00:04:58.680> want<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.919> spring<00:04:59.189> the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
right now whoever you want to spring the

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.330 
right now whoever you want to spring the
trap<00:04:59.340> on<00:04:59.819> you<00:05:00.659> have<00:05:00.749> to<00:05:00.810> put<00:05:01.020> their<00:05:01.169> name<00:05:01.379> right

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
trap on you have to put their name right

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.179

there<00:05:02.960> there<00:05:03.960> are<00:05:04.169> probably<00:05:04.560> some<00:05:04.800> other<00:05:04.979> ways

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189

another series but I wanted to give you

another series but I wanted to give you

you

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.080 

and<00:06:58.660> I'll<00:06:58.930> start<00:06:59.110> building<00:06:59.440> the<00:06:59.560> second<00:06:59.949> layer

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
and I'll start building the second layer

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.320 
and I'll start building the second layer
here<00:07:01.090> and<00:07:02.400> use<00:07:03.400> a<00:07:03.430> little<00:07:03.729> bit<00:07:03.790> of<00:07:03.850> worldedit

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
here and use a little bit of worldedit

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.580 
here and use a little bit of worldedit
to<00:07:04.780> help<00:07:04.990> build<00:07:05.410> the<00:07:06.010> wall<00:07:06.870> and<00:07:10.169> then<00:07:11.169> once<00:07:11.410> the
