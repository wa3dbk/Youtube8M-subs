00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hi how about youtube friends juan 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.330
 Manuel and this time is for 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.130
 show them a very interesting plugin 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.690
 for the 4d cinema program and that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.670
 It can be applied to any figure 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.210
 created with the demographer module then 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.210
 we start 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.750
 although I think we have to do is 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.060
 insert a text we do not go here in 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.970
 demogrÃ£ module we select in this 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.380
 case the object the text here in the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.050
 text option let's change it for 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.520
 advisor after this I will select 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.810
 a font that is thicker so 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.680
 let's click here 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:43.100
 in source resolution for this effect 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 this source des wish 721 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.780
 let's move it a bit on this side 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.269
 so that it is possible to see once 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.899
 we have the text it is important to create a 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.760
 series of divisions so that the 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.010
 effect that we are going to apply for nothing of the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.780
 plugin can be seen here in this part 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.180
 in what would be the outline of our 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.909
 figure here in divisions I'm going to put the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.100
 number 2 and after this I'm also going 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.140
 here in the option of tapas in the part 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.159
 below we are going to modify the option in 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.990
 We're going to put quadrangles on this guy 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.360
 and in the size we are going to activate here 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.520
 regular grid we're going to leave the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.979
 amount of 10 if we increase 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.899
 this parameter the pictures are going to be more 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.550
 great if we reduce this value the 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.429
 which are going to be smaller and so 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.750
 both the detail is going to be greater 10 is 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.580
 good for this example once you 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.159
 we have this we do not go because the module 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.530
 of plugins we will select the option 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.780
 freedom that at one time gave them as 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.490
 install it or from where you can download 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.700
 this interesting plugin then 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.140
 we choose graiver station 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.420
 well now what we are going to do is that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.310
 this text is the son of this effect 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.710
 we're going to drag over 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.229
 this and we will observe how he appears 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.479
 to the text a series of random figures 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.700
 with the extrusion both in the caps and 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.920
 in the singing of the good text now what 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.360
 we have to do is simply see 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.329
 some parameters of the glee option 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.920
 see I'm going to give you a click and well let's 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.019
 see the basic options of this plugin 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.610
 it is already up to each one to inquire 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.440
 a little more to master in detail 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.200
 this plugin that is very very interesting 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.970
 here we have the random shift option what 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.769
 that basically does it establishes a 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.340
 random seed so that in this way 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.250
 when changing it , generate us in this case 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.319
 another type of rendering by changing 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.630
 precisely or redistributing in this 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.910
 case the figures that are on the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.579
 covers of this text either that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.569
 increase the value or decrease 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.280
 the value for example milk 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.709
 simply what happens is that they are a 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.150
 rearrange or redistribute the figures 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.709
 that are formed we also have this 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.450
 option that is called subdivision here there 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.999
 to be careful or caution like that 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.519
 indicated by x and the increase increases the 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.439
 number of objects and therefore the 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.540
 number of calculations and rendering in 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:57.810
 this program so I'm going to put you through 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.330
 example 1 are observed here increase the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.340
 detail 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.980
 of what the objects would be about 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.720
 our text I will leave it at zero 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.000
 another interesting option for example is 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.920
 here in credible state here in the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.260
 save option here come all 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.670
 polygons or figures that precisely 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.040
 they come out here around what is the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.900
 text here we can enable the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.640
 frequency with which they will appear 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.920
 these figures also if we want 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.080
 apply a random rotation of these 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.150
 surfaces and then as we will see here 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.500
 are all the options 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.450
 related to each of these 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.280
 polygons and well now I'm going to add two 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.030
 lights so let's put here in the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.700
 first light 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.950
 we exhale to place here in the part of 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.470
 up on this side 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.970
 let's activate the views I'm going to 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.970
 locate it more or less on this side 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.230
 and a little bit up 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.630
 We click here in this view with 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.310
 central button of the mouse to activate 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.100
 to make it bigger and with control 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.310
 I'm going to duplicate this light we're going to put 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.000
 this side 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.810
 we add to this part 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.160
 we go to this height 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.080
 let's move this towards the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.360
 left 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.460
 again click with the middle button to 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.590
 activate all and once we have this 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.110
 let's click on the middle button in 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.530
 this viewer and we are going to accommodate the 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.530
 text 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.990
 that's fine and good after they're masters 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.610
 what we have to do now is 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.800
 texturize last let's write here to the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.620
 window to what is the browser of 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.330
 content 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.100
 here this browser what we are going to do 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.060
 we go to the option of predefined to 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.770
 prime 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.139
 to materials and in the option of 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.820
 miscellany that would be this we are going to 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.400
 find this that is the velvet factory 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.139
 003 we are going to double-click on it 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.169
 the browser and then simply 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:54.940
 we apply it to our text and 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.940
 rendered to see how we have left 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.160
 now let's add a floor here 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.620
 this option then we are not going to the 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.000
 lights today to select the first light and 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.300
 in the shadow option we are going to define 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.340
 you the soft shadow map let's 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.009
 put the density here at 50 per 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.400
 hundred and the same thing we do with the other 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:18.310
 light alike here in shadow we change it to 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.380
 soft shadows map we put a 50 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.509
 percent and to have a better 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.320
 result is here first let's go to 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:28.330
 lift a little to lift more the text 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.580
 section then suspended and finally 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.930
 here the rendering options and 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.370
 we will activate the occlusion effect 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.880
 environmental to give us some shadows 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:41.340
 more realistic we close and finally 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.340
 rendered and that would be the result 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.430
 and plugin can be downloaded from 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.930
 this page at the bottom in the 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.990
 description of the video I leave the link 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.880
 is this that we have here above and as 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.310
 you can observe this are for several 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.810
 4d cinema versions in my case 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.510
 download this version and it works 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.750
 perfectly for the r13 version of 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.570
 Cinema 4d tell them that this plugin is 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.730
 of payment however the author gives us the 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.110
 option to try it for 30 days time 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.240
 that he considered enough to 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.160
 explore the plugin and do some that 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.290
 another photomontage by default of text 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.240
 with 4d cinema so well there's the 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.100
 option to download it from all 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.560
 I give them a direct link through 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.850
 if you want carlos from my page and well 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.740
 we come to the end of this video tutorial 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.390
 where we saw some of the functions 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.490
 basic of this interesting plugin 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.870
 I hope they write more options and that 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.520
 the they can share through their 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.910
 videos see you next time and 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.910
 Thank you
