so<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.740> said<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> beginning<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.520> video<00:01:44.670> this

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so I said the beginning this video this

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.240 
so I said the beginning this video this
is<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.509> very<00:01:45.689> cool<00:01:45.930> feature<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:47.100> actually

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
is a very cool feature and they actually

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.609 
is a very cool feature and they actually
put<00:01:47.579> into<00:01:47.729> GTA<00:01:48.240> 5<00:01:48.509> online<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.110> believe<00:01:49.259> it's

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
