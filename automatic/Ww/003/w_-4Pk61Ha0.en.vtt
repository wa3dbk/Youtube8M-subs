one of the misconceptions if you'll

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.200 
one of the misconceptions if you'll
notice<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:38.040> wedge<00:01:39.040> there<00:01:39.340> it's<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.970> very

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
notice the wedge there it's a very

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.410 
notice the wedge there it's a very
skinny<00:01:40.750> wedges<00:01:41.200> 3/4<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.009> an<00:01:42.130> inch<00:01:42.189> but<00:01:42.490> may<00:01:43.240> go

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
skinny wedges 3/4 of an inch but may go

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.560 
skinny wedges 3/4 of an inch but may go
through<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.659> full<00:01:43.869> stroke<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:45.759> you<00:01:45.909> split

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
through a full stroke when you split

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.940 
through a full stroke when you split
logs<00:01:46.720> like<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.259> but<00:01:48.810> being<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:49.990> thin<00:01:50.289> what<00:01:50.860> it

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
logs like this but being so thin what it

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.399 
logs like this but being so thin what it
doesn't<00:01:51.100> split<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.640> cut<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:55.049> may<00:01:56.049> go<00:01:56.200> through<00:01:56.380> a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
doesn't split it cut so may go through a

00:01:56.409 --> 00:04:40.069 
doesn't split it cut so may go through a
full<00:01:56.560> stroke<00:01:56.890> but<00:01:57.130> like<00:01:57.369> said

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:40.079 

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.599

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:42.609 
yeah like that is only a five horsepower

yeah well it's 11 gallons per minute

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:51.449 
yeah well it's 11 gallons per minute
that<00:04:49.929> goes<00:04:50.079> to<00:04:50.289> six<00:04:50.529> gallon<00:04:50.889> per<00:04:51.069> minute<00:04:51.339> when

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:51.459 
that goes to six gallon per minute when

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:53.969 
that goes to six gallon per minute when
it's<00:04:51.579> under<00:04:51.969> pressure<00:04:52.179> like<00:04:52.539> that<00:04:52.749> was<00:04:52.989> and

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
it's under pressure like that was and
