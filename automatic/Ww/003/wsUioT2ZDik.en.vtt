the magic have others we have a system

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.010 
the magic have others we have a system
rather<00:04:22.109> than<00:04:22.289> two<00:04:22.710> prompts<00:04:23.220> we<00:04:24.060> have<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.389> system

rather than two prompts we have a system

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.430 
rather than two prompts we have a system
with<00:04:25.229> one<00:04:25.740> pin<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.699> then<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.240> cradle<00:04:27.780> that

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
with one pin and then a cradle that

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.170 
with one pin and then a cradle that
would<00:04:29.000> have<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:31.289> trellis<00:04:31.830> frame<00:04:32.039> sitting<00:04:33.289> so

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
would have the trellis frame sitting so

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.110 
five five fifty with old wheels and four
hundred<00:06:30.930> forty<00:06:31.470> nine<00:06:31.500> you<00:06:31.770> get<00:06:31.920> an<00:06:32.070> additional

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.910 

alright<00:06:36.120> so<00:06:36.450> this<00:06:36.990> is<00:06:37.170> looks<00:06:37.530> like<00:06:37.590> a<00:06:37.680> really

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:37.920 
alright so this is looks like a really

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.760 
alright so this is looks like a really
interesting<00:06:38.510> solution<00:06:39.510> for<00:06:39.840> guys<00:06:40.230> who<00:06:40.500> got

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
interesting solution for guys who got

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.100 
interesting solution for guys who got
trackdays<00:06:41.310> this<00:06:41.790> only<00:06:42.000> weighs<00:06:42.570> probably

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
trackdays this only weighs probably

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.690 
trackdays this only weighs probably
under<00:06:43.290> thirty<00:06:43.500> pounds<00:06:44.010> so<00:06:44.130> it's<00:06:44.250> easy<00:06:44.520> to

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
under thirty pounds so it's easy to

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.550 
under thirty pounds so it's easy to
transport<00:06:45.270> much<00:06:45.480> easier<00:06:45.780> to<00:06:45.900> transport<00:06:46.200> than

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
transport much easier to transport than

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.910 
transport much easier to transport than
three<00:06:47.160> different<00:06:47.490> stands<00:06:48.770> something<00:06:49.770> like

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
three different stands something like

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.540 
three different stands something like
that

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
that

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.850 
that
so<00:06:51.390> rather<00:06:51.960> than<00:06:52.140> carry<00:06:52.380> three<00:06:52.620> different

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
so rather than carry three different

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.560 
so rather than carry three different
stands<00:06:53.100> around<00:06:53.430> now<00:06:53.550> you<00:06:53.610> just<00:06:53.820> carry<00:06:54.120> one<00:06:54.210> to
