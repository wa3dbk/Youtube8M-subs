00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Welcome to this new 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.910
 video of me and of course 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.710
 this video from the apple watch the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.830
 finally arrived at my place 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.150
 is here in the sport version namely in 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.580
 of course, and of course I want to 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.379
 like to unpack with you here now and 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.369
 while I 'm in a live unboxing myself 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.600
 the apple watch not before 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.490
 So I have not looked 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.080
 in a store or somehow 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.910
 possible share medis device already directly 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.320
 and that's why I want to go here 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.830
 now directly my impressions with you 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.570
 divide 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.859
 and I would say after the intro picture 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.170
 which we then directly with the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.730
 we 'll start unpacking 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.480
 first of all with the packaging and that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.309
 from the outside 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 this extremely simple here in now 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.410
 kept white and we have the here 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.610
 imprinted apple watch imprint and that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.010
 you can also feel direct one over here 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.539
 almost otherwise very simple on the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.059
 back we also have one more 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.250
 some inscriptions just like it is from 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.320
 knows apple products and then pack 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 Let's go out and do it for now 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.480
 recommend the best as the first 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.480
 pull foil 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.010
 Here we see again that it is 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 a sports variant in white and acts 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.180
 this is the 38 millimeter version 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.400
 I have chosen because I am very 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.170
 have narrow hands and I will now 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.030
 See if that was worth it 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.920
 or if 42 mm 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.740
 but it would have been better, first of all 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.750
 we put here best the apple bot 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.900
 in itself away this was again in such 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.670
 an extra white box packed and the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.979
 left once aside and see 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.970
 the other things I read in the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.640
 packaging are located 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.030
 Lastly, we have such a white one here 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.979
 part where then all the information 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.770
 for apple watch trainers are so 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.130
 also in this size the apple 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.320
 watch pack so directly adapted here 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.240
 now with all these explanations in 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.030
 short guide and then here are a few 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.189
 hints that we just from other 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.899
 Apple products also know, however 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.149
 here now specifically for the apple watch 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.280
 and also in the matching design 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.710
 besides, we have a second one 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.160
 bracelet or here the version 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.560
 ml and accordingly the larger one 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.380
 version that we get on with it 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.780
 the next page, we then 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.340
 still a power plug then just the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.670
 corner watch to charge 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.430
 and last but not least here the magnetic 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.130
 cable that I now once too 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:34.170
 can unpack something special there 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.569
 not the leyen hit connection blocked 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.330
 but was just this special 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:44.550
 cable for the apple watch and looks like 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.239
 follow me from such a small one 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.350
 adapter also with foil and 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.090
 In addition, a completely normal 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.130
 USB cable then just the apple watch 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.080
 We can of course charge 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.209
 also easy on the computer and so on 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.280
 continue to charge but we dedicate ourselves 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.769
 now just the best watch on 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.980
 and now we pack this 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.540
 Pack once and I'm honest 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.519
 quite excited as I said I still have 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.349
 never an app for somehow watch in the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.280
 hand had we such a 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:24.630
 can relate to the small stripes 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:31.890
 and then we see another one here 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:34.440
 punched apple and a white one 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.940
 Packaging made of plastic in any case 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.180
 again very simple but feels 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.440
 also quite high quality 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:48.389
 and then we have the clock here already 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:52.410
 as I said in white with 38 mm in the 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.819
 sportversion this looks like the whole and 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.920
 I'll just pick it up now 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.569
 out once and I have to be my first 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.970
 impression is definitely that you 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.400
 really small is like already 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.410
 So has already been said by many that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.810
 display really small and also at the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.730
 42 mm variant, the display should also 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.530
 So be quite small you see her 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.440
 now it's not that big 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.959
 But it feels the first impression 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.599
 every case very high quality 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:25.590
 then we remove the others 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:26.280
 plastic sheath here as well 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.030
 here 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.580
 above and then we have here too 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.350
 the clock unpacked so here now 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.480
 a white band which I by the way very 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.000
 feels good and that is really 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.300
 damn small so that 's really small 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.300
 the clock 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.060
 on the back we have the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.310
 different sensors and so on 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.560
 then here are the heads we need 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.640
 and I think I'll do it now 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.340
 you can also just once briefly 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.260
 in the video bad because the display 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.950
 It is quite dark but the clock is 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.570
 started 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.190
 So you see the apple and me here 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.960
 I'll just try the clock now 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.520
 and will definitely be for the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.130
 next day a furnishing video 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.930
 make and then my opinion 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.660
 this apple watch definitely too 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.780
 in a detailed review then 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.490
 tell 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.560
 if you liked this video 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.180
 should like your opinion in the 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.160
 Of course, comments also write 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.300
 also a lighter if you do that 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.270
 liked the video and you are welcome 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.760

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.820

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.680
