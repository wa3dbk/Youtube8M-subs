00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 value for the party because it's a cute 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.960
 gift let's see how we do it 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.599
 of the base mold that emerged 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.370
 only modification or addition that I 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.150
 I made one of the models that is the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.190
 blue is this that is was adding with 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.820
 an internal view 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.519
 not very big 16 centimeters of about 3 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.890
 centimeters and a half with the view in the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.980
 bottom part curve is an aggregate that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.170
 I made him to simulate that he had a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.969
 opening of buttons that will not have 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.440
 obviously but then let's see 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.719
 how are we going to make him carry that is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.579
 easy to do and it looks nice in a 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.190
 short list or because when I see in 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.290
 Scottish says it all the fabric but not being 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.050
 smooth we can play a little more with 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.940
 the details the side pocket 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.370
 pay attention also you will group 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 a trouser for you is very easy 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.670
 they are going to cut the bottom of the pocket of 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.160
 between the double 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.980
 for two for each side one that is in the 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.170
 part of the pocket bottom and the other 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.760
 part what is going to be the stock market we are 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.580
 two parts to do this pocket of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.920
 lateral we started to take one of the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.740
 parties and facing the rights let's 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.369
 to sew previously you to the mold go 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.380
 to see the height of the pocket to 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.210
 three centimeters from the waist 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.460
 approximately and the opening that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.979
 want to give they are going to mark that opening 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.170
 with some pickets come see them 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.750
 there are some brand pickets that will 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.940
 serve you to harass then 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.500
 babies from that extreme towards the other 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.460
 extreme you are going to sew 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.890
 starting from the edge of the fabric 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.870
 following the line of the seam that 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.550
 then it will be done in this case in the 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.470
 separation is little because I left a 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.650
 centimeter of seam margin nothing more 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.250
 once they have that they are going to cut 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.930
 These will reduce the seam allowance 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.310
 so that this when turning around is 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.040
 better trained yes 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.729
 there we go and they are going to make some small 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.979
 pickets here at the end of the seam 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.110
 where does the l 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.560
 so that it is well formed when giving it 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.239
 return 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.750
 this we turn it to the wrong side 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.720
 and with the iron in which I just 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.860
 He said that this is well formed 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.709
 well ironed to settle that 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.870
 seam will pass you a stitching or two 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.959
 according to the model that you want 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.090
 do and they have a part already ready 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.380
 that the bottom is missing the pocket that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.510
 here I have it they are going to locate it there they go to 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.060
 hold with pins in the part of the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.160
 top edge so that this does not move 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.739
 and one here central and we're going to work 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.430
 on the wrong side closing this 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.170
 pocket bag so a stitching and a 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.870
 zig zag so that it is well trimmed 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.030
 now you will have this 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.220
 separated from the waist and side 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.950
 so that it does not get complicated in the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.610
 armed with the short they will pass a 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.830
 backstitch 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.570
 infinite unity to hold it here 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.790
 up and leave it ready to place the 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.640
 waist and here on the side that is a 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.070
 short section to sew it with the part of 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.620
 the back if then the forward 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.380
 until here we have pockets in both 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.190
 parts and let's look, I brought them here 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.230
 this more advanced in your pocket all your 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.120
 prolijito either side by side 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.160
 reverse with the stitching on the part of 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.500
 up as I just told you and we 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.020
 It remains to sew this part, we have the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.630
 two front we're going to do we're going to 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.500
 sew the shot there 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.440
 everything from the crotch there we give that 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.190
 turn up to the waist then once 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.140
 we have this cooked, we are going to turn it 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.240
 and that's where we're going to simulate this 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.170
 part that is like an opening look through 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.140
 there this is already cooked we will pass 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.160
 a stitching to seat well that doubles 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.070
 and then we finish it in a curved part 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.200
 with 23 points can be quietly 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.980
 with the part as we have it here for 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.500
 that you can see it there 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.560
 this already formed opening is left 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.239
 join them in the back part with the 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.490
 front and the back part the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.860
 crotch easy what I want that 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.350
 is very clear is the part that we are going to 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.300
 put your waist and how are we going to 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.330
 place the inside of this pants 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.550
 city ​​that I have well armed see the 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.470
 part all the stitching the pockets 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.780
 finished and we will see how we sew the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.350
 elastic an elastic of 3 or 4 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.090
 centimeters of approximately 75 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.280
 centimeters of the 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.570
 we will be divided into four as 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.090
 that the waist 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.520
 it's going to be long that we have to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.830
 we got the pants for twice as much 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.540
 that is elastic so if we have to 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.240
 four of eight more of the seam allowance 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.449
 of ten yes up there let's go let's 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.740
 place the elastic inside the waist 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.449
 there and we are going to sew stretching the 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.340
 elastic that for that we're going to go to the 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.650
 quickie machine to see how 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.600
 we know what I advise you is to have 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.030
 consider these divisions divide the 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.590
 waist in with the four pins in 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.050
 four parts just like the elastic 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.110
 the machine for this job we are going to 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.150
 advise that they run the zoom dial of the 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.729
 of the machine that is here in the part 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.979
 in the upper right edge and what 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.080
 we put in a point 4 for example 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.240
 then the tip is going to be long and we 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.840
 will make this much easier 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.440
 better start from a pin 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:45.160
 we go down and we are working and stretches come 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.160
 stretch 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:52.670
 I leave the needle stuck so this does not 

00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:55.640
 move again I stretch and here 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.920
 I'm running until he finished giving 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.690
 all round and I'll give you two 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.360
 turns so that this looks good 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.550
 settled then now what you 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.520
 they are going to do is the following we are going to 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.730
 place the inside of the bag 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.920
 of the pants and we are going to place the 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.690
 waist remember that if you want to spend 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.960
 your 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.580
 a cord at the waist will happen to you 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.110
 they will first make a buttonhole if 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.940
 then we turn the waist and the 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.000
 dump again so that this is 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.420
 well neat that 's a way to 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.970
 place them and the other way is by placing 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.370
 first the waist in the part of the 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.830
 South interior then join the waist 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.840
 to the pants and just there when they have 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.800
 the three inner parts intur and 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.270
 located trousers is when they locate the 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.230
 elastic and does not flow like we just saw it 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:54.970
 and would be chosen from honduras to the music 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.970
 they liked it and it's going
