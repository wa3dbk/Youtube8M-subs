00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
box I think you said last time that I

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.560 
box I think you said last time that I
probably<00:00:22.369> wouldn't<00:00:22.699> mind<00:00:22.849> of<00:00:22.999> the<00:00:23.060> case<00:00:23.269> well

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.540 
I think every time one comes out I'm
going<00:00:26.210> to<00:00:26.300> go<00:00:26.359> ahead<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:26.539> buy<00:00:26.659> one<00:00:27.019> just<00:00:27.550> in
