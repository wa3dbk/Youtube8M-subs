00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.490
 marakasi 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.180
 This is a rubric review mods for the game world 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.110
 of tanks 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.889
 specifically for the tap channel and so on 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.880
 traditions i will start with a new hangar hangar 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.439
 quite beautiful I remember I did a review 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.250
 on the winter version of this hangar but by 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.099
 compared to the previous version 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 this hangar has changed a lot in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.180
 First here the summer can also be 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.059
 see what is in the distance 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.120
 boat rather 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.340
 a small ship where there is even 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.850
 animated man waving 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.219
 by hand 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:54.690
 apparently asking for help is also ahead we 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.140
 can see ruined houses he 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.590
 tank stands and you can see on the bridge 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.129
 down there 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.490
 the courtyard is made quite beautiful 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.340
 there are a lot of trees 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 the downed plane also has a little 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.960
 car and a whole lot of small things 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.220
 details but I would like to add something else 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.710
 in this hangar remarkable for example i 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.920
 I think that this ship is made 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.340
 quite creative and some more 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 such interesting details in this hangar 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.420
 he would generally have a banner on one of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.930
 the best but he's pretty good and so 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.479
 I think it is now at the moment 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.210
 one of the best hangars that were 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.840
 made by models 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.049
 In general, I advise everyone to remind you that you are 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.909
 You can download this hangar from the link in 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.640
 description 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.070
 move on to the next fashion next 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.680
 mod modifies standard messages in 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.000
 game for example instead of message 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.890
 how destroyed such an icon is added 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.320
 just as there are other different icons to 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.180
 events in the game such as whether snow is an ally 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.570
 asks for help or for if you need focus on 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.060
 some opponent appears 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:32.910
 the corresponding icon of the mod cosmetic 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.950
 the changes do not introduce it is made easy 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.690
 for beauty 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.270
 next mod adds a new sight and 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.070
 also a new damage indicator 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.950
 The scope itself is different in that the timer 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.000
 recharging here shows so here 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.160
 Filling around are also numbers that 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.030
 show how many meters it targets and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.020
 how much time the recharge is very 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.100
 big and hard to miss 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.870
 sight principle quite good damage indicator 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.790
 I didn't particularly like it because 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.100
 very big and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.519
 difficult to understand exactly where you are 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.110
 fired 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.209
 next small on maybe for 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.380
 someone needed a mod that shows 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.989
 how many ping do you have and how much 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.260
 it's time now 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:31.320
 principle is not bad but it takes 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.040
 quite a lot of space figure there too 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.630
 great especially now possible to someone 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.170
 and the next mod comes in handy 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.110
 new ones 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.410
 vertical tree of development is just 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.630
 Three versions of the color scheme of this mod in 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.989
 In general, the icons are pretty 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.730
 quality styles of orange here 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.370
 elite tanks are shown 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.299
 This blue strip shows that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.560
 there is you in the hangar looks like this 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.560
 equipment as a whole is pretty 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.610
 beautiful 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.560
 I think many will like this mod 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.040
 the next mod adds a huge red 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.520
 line on the borders of the map using this 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.519
 fashion 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.910
 the output is not random you go to the border 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.970
 because just not to notice her 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.120
 impossible next we go mod which 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.090
 adds minimap when loading a battle 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.500
 This mod can be useful for players. 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.020
 which is long loaded and while they go 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.500
 download they will be able to study 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.400
 The minimap is especially interesting. 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.889
 For beginners, I think the next mod adds 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.740
 a short sound that notifies you that 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.590
 you are out of charge mode reloading 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.410
 be useful to those who sometimes do not notice 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.960
 that he has already recharged a lack 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.380
 This mod is that all 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.630
 still 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.600
 if you have a very fast reload on 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.800
 tank this sound is likely to be 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.979
 you very often 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.169
 annoyed the next mod makes almost u 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.470
 all tanks in the game white rollers 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.610
 why do you need to ask this 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.250
 to better notice the rollers in the heat of battle 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.430
 beat them thereby immobilizing 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.039
 this mod can also be an opponent 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.180
 useful to those who want to somehow decorate 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:34.750
 their tanks in principle mod can be 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.270
 useful if you like it 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.910
 you can always download it from the link in 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.800
 description 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.650
 want to increase the range of visibility of the battle 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.789
 then this mod for you it removes the haze 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.630
 on all cards 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:52.620
 as well as all objects far more 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.060
 noticeable thereby you can better 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.600
 aiming enemies that are on 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.940
 a great distance the very same mod on fps 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.090
 no effect even some 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.320
 claim that on the contrary they have pps became 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:11.889
 even more mod useful and experienced players 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.050
 often he likes to bet and on this i 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.750
 I say goodbye to you and remember that all fashion 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.630
