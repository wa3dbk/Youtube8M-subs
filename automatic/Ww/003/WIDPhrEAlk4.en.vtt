 hydraulic systems that must be carried out on the system 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
 by specialized personnel 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.880
 the frequency of maintenance operations depends on 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.820
 system characteristics 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.590
 by type of use 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.260
 the number of trips that will be made each day will obviously be different 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.769
 if the system is installed in a building

 system that guarantees reticence and security 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.580
 in france, for example, the minimum frequency of lift maintenance 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.970
 established by a recent standard and a visit every 6 weeks 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.960
 the technical documentation according to the law in force in Italy

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.440
 this documentation must be made available to the institutions 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.260

 possibly with a procedure included in an ISO 9000 quality system 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.259

 lift maintenance 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.109
 it is a job that requires great experience 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.109
 as there are many and different types of installations 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.129
 some even very ancient 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.079

 vat company that takes care of preventive maintenance 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.279
 and also what is called for elevator repairs in case of

 failure 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:04.069
 the statistics elaborated by the lack show that the best is the 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.879
 quality of maintenance visits performed with adequate frequency 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.679
 the lower the number of faults that occur on the system 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:16.799
 the minor will also be the extraordinary costs due to repairs

 emergency sound activated from the cabin 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.969
 it would be desirable for all installations 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.180
 even those installed before 1999 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.869
 they were equipped with the telephone dialer in the cabin 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:10.649
 which guarantees a safer immediate activation of the emergency

 from hundreds of small and medium-sized companies of dependent professionals
