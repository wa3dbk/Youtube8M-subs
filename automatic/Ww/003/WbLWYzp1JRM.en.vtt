on a burner but the burner isn't on it's
off<00:01:20.720> especially<00:01:21.720> since<00:01:22.350> we're<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> be

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
off especially since we're going to be

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.370 
off especially since we're going to be
pouring<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> cake<00:01:24.509> right<00:01:25.110> away

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
pouring this on the cake right away

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.380 
pouring this on the cake right away
we'll<00:01:26.250> begin<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> center<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> course

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
we'll begin at the center of course

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.859 
we'll begin at the center of course
going<00:01:28.380> toward<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> edges<00:01:29.090> I've<00:01:30.090> taken<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
going toward the edges I've taken out a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.130 
going toward the edges I've taken out a
spatula<00:01:31.610> just<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.759> case<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.689> normally<00:01:34.110> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
spatula just in case but normally you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.920 
spatula just in case but normally you
don't<00:01:34.470> need<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.890> use<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.250> spatula<00:01:35.810> for<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
don't need to use the spatula for the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.539 
don't need to use the spatula for the
simple<00:01:37.229> reason<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.619> there<00:01:37.950> should<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.220> no

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
simple reason that there should be no

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.359 
simple reason that there should be no
marks<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> single<00:01:40.110> mark<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.890> glaze<00:01:41.100> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
marks not a single mark on the glaze of

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
marks not a single mark on the glaze of

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
sheet which means we can collect the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.180 
sheet which means we can collect the
excess<00:02:06.810> chocolate<00:02:07.110> because<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.740> course<00:02:07.979> there

will<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.369> some<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:10.430> you<00:02:11.430> begin<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
will be some you see you begin in the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.880 
will be some you see you begin in the
middle<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.170> pour<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> glaze

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
middle and then you pour the glaze

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.450 
middle and then you pour the glaze
around<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.340> top<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:16.830> pour<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.280> glaze

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
around the top you then pour the glaze

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.850 
around the top you then pour the glaze
onto<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.330> sides<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.990> sponge<00:02:19.290> cake<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
onto the sides of the sponge cake and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.190 
onto the sides of the sponge cake and
now<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.819> size<00:02:21.180> should<00:02:21.569> be<00:02:21.690> covered<00:02:22.050> in

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
now the size should be covered in

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.620 
now the size should be covered in
chocolate<00:02:22.470> glaze<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.060> see<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.510> the
