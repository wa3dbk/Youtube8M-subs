white arrow along that line so try and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
white arrow along that line so try and
go<00:01:00.210> nice<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.480> slow<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.649> go<00:01:01.800> too<00:01:01.859> fast

or get off-track your iPhone will tell

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.420 
or get off-track your iPhone will tell
you<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.590> 240<00:01:07.590> degree<00:01:07.860> panoramic

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.370 
you you can do a 240 degree panoramic
photo<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:09.780> stop<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.260> any

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
photo but you can really stop at any

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.980 
photo but you can really stop at any
time<00:01:10.680> by<00:01:11.280> either<00:01:11.310> hitting<00:01:11.880> done<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.479> just

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
time by either hitting done or just

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.609 
time by either hitting done or just
moving<00:01:13.950> your<00:01:14.040> phone<00:01:14.250> back<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> hair<00:01:16.159> that's<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
it's going to be hard to keep that

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.990 
it's going to be hard to keep that
arrows<00:01:22.630> straight<00:01:23.020> but<00:01:23.649> that<00:01:23.920> being<00:01:24.250> said<00:01:24.640> you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
arrows straight but that being said you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.800 
arrows straight but that being said you
can<00:01:25.450> create<00:01:25.810> some<00:01:26.229> funky<00:01:26.619> photos<00:01:27.069> by

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
can create some funky photos by

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.270
