00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.300 

I'll<00:03:08.020> tell<00:03:08.260> ya<00:03:08.319> I<00:03:08.500> mean<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.709> think<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
I'll tell ya I mean I think the the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.860 
I'll tell ya I mean I think the the
features<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.819> like<00:03:09.970> about<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.300> knife<00:03:10.450> or<00:03:10.690> first

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
features I like about the knife or first

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.740 
features I like about the knife or first
of<00:03:10.989> all<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.140> Teflon<00:03:11.530> coat<00:03:12.150> slides<00:03:13.150> nicest<00:03:13.629> to

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
of all the Teflon coat slides nicest to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.350 
of all the Teflon coat slides nicest to
the<00:03:13.840> fish<00:03:14.050> sharpness<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.040> blade<00:03:15.209> keeps<00:03:16.209> an

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
the fish sharpness of the blade keeps an

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.000 
the fish sharpness of the blade keeps an
edge<00:03:16.510> real<00:03:16.720> nice<00:03:16.900> but<00:03:17.230> probably<00:03:17.860> most

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
edge real nice but probably most

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.960 
edge real nice but probably most
importantly<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.580> handle<00:03:20.280> as<00:03:21.280> build<00:03:21.640> gets

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
importantly the handle as build gets

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.330 
importantly the handle as build gets
stickier<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.450> when<00:03:22.810> wet<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.260> as<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.099> know<00:03:24.220> in

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
stickier and when wet and as you know in

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.949 
stickier and when wet and as you know in
the<00:03:24.400> marine<00:03:24.580> environment<00:03:24.610> our<00:03:25.569> hands<00:03:25.840> are

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
the marine environment our hands are

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.150 
the marine environment our hands are
slick<00:03:26.190> fishy<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.459> slimy<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:28.569> know<00:03:28.720> yes<00:03:29.470> it

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
slick fishy and slimy you know yes it

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.800 
slick fishy and slimy you know yes it
not<00:03:30.370> only<00:03:30.489> makes<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.540> know<00:03:31.569> real

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
not only makes it you know real

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.630 
not only makes it you know real
comfortable<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.650> think<00:03:32.920> also<00:03:33.220> increases

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
comfortable but I think also increases

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.989 
comfortable but I think also increases
the<00:03:33.730> safety<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:34.209> cutting<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.630> lionfish
