00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
this is the second part of how to solve

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.720 
this is the second part of how to solve
a<00:00:03.000> rubik's<00:00:03.330> cube<00:00:03.510> fest<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.370> what<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.460> need<00:00:05.640> to

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
a rubik's cube fest and what you need to

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.110 
a rubik's cube fest and what you need to
do<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:06.240> watch<00:00:06.480> my<00:00:06.810> first<00:00:07.109> video<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.919> then<00:00:08.120> you

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
do is watch my first video and then you

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.740 
do is watch my first video and then you
should<00:00:09.300> have<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.660> green<00:00:10.620> side<00:00:10.889> finished<00:00:11.750> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
should have this green side finished the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.350 
should have this green side finished the
two<00:00:13.019> middle<00:00:13.380> way<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.219> two<00:00:14.460> first<00:00:14.700> layers<00:00:15.000> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
two middle way the two first layers of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.210 
two middle way the two first layers of
every<00:00:16.020> color<00:00:16.369> with<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.730> top<00:00:18.390> middle<00:00:18.800> piece<00:00:19.800> is

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
every color with the top middle piece is

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.050 
every color with the top middle piece is
the<00:00:20.340> same<00:00:20.580> as<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.029> center<00:00:21.600> piece<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:23.100> once<00:00:23.880> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the same as a center piece and once you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.099 
the same as a center piece and once you
have<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.980> lift<00:00:25.980> up<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.279> blue<00:00:26.400> cross<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:27.000> top

counterclockwise right side clockwise
bottom<00:01:15.729> side<00:01:15.940> clockwise<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.860> need<00:01:17.950> to<00:01:18.010> make

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
bottom side clockwise you need to make

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.560 
bottom side clockwise you need to make
sure<00:01:18.190> you<00:01:18.460> do<00:01:18.550> that<00:01:18.760> bottom<00:01:19.090> side<00:01:19.300> clockwise

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.450 
sure you do that bottom side clockwise
or<00:01:20.080> else<00:01:20.290> everything<00:01:20.710> will<00:01:20.950> get<00:01:21.040> messed<00:01:21.280> up

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
or else everything will get messed up

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.450 
or else everything will get messed up
and<00:01:21.750> keep<00:01:22.750> doing<00:01:23.050> it<00:01:23.200> until<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.340> right

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
and keep doing it until it's the right

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.850 
and keep doing it until it's the right
place<00:01:27.760> like<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.470> once<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:29.710> have<00:01:29.800> that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
place like that and once you have that

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.620 
place like that and once you have that
then<00:01:30.369> do<00:01:30.700> top<00:01:31.479> 5<00:01:31.750> counterclockwise<00:01:32.259> until<00:01:33.630> you

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
then do top 5 counterclockwise until you

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.800 
then do top 5 counterclockwise until you
get<00:01:34.840> another<00:01:35.200> corner<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:37.630> in<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
get another corner that that's in the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.330 
get another corner that that's in the
right<00:01:37.960> place<00:01:38.170> but<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.649> cause<00:01:38.830> aren't<00:01:39.070> on<00:01:39.220> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
right place but the cause aren't on the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.790 
right place but the cause aren't on the
right<00:01:39.490> side<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.000> if<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:40.750> do<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.229> you<00:01:41.289> get

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
right side and if you do it and you get

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.690 
right side and if you do it and you get
one<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.009> these<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:42.700> just<00:01:42.729> keep<00:01:43.479> going<00:01:43.840> until

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
one of these and just keep going until

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.430 
one of these and just keep going until
you<00:01:45.700> find<00:01:46.210> one<00:01:46.479> just<00:01:46.750> like<00:01:47.200> that

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
you find one just like that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.720 
you find one just like that
and<00:01:48.560> then<00:01:49.190> do<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.730> move<00:01:50.200> again<00:01:51.250> all<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.640> way

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
and then do the move again all the way

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.230 
and then do the move again all the way
until<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:55.100> get<00:01:55.460> in<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.640> right<00:01:55.760> spot<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.820> a

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
until you get in the right spot and a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.340 
until you get in the right spot and a
real<00:01:59.450> important<00:01:59.960> part<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:02.120> can<00:02:03.050> get

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
real important part is that you can get

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.800 
real important part is that you can get
worried<00:02:03.620> about<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:05.030> Kiwi<00:02:05.450> looking<00:02:05.690> all

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
worried about the Kiwi looking all

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.360 
worried about the Kiwi looking all
scrambled<00:02:06.290> up<00:02:06.410> again<00:02:06.680> because<00:02:06.830> if<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.220> do

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
scrambled up again because if you do

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.850 
scrambled up again because if you do
everything<00:02:08.060> will<00:02:08.180> get<00:02:08.270> listed<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.470> once<00:02:09.740> it

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
everything will get listed and once it

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.990 
everything will get listed and once it
gets<00:02:10.010> in<00:02:10.130> my<00:02:10.250> spot<00:02:10.540> then<00:02:11.540> you'll<00:02:11.750> see<00:02:11.990> that

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
gets in my spot then you'll see that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.990 
gets in my spot then you'll see that
it's<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:14.660> columns<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.940> how<00:02:16.940> you

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
it's just in columns like that how you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's just in columns like that how you
do<00:02:17.210> is<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.720> print<00:02:18.200> them<00:02:18.290> all<00:02:18.440> together<00:02:18.590> and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
do is this print them all together and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.660 
do is this print them all together and
then<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.960> know<00:02:23.890> calling<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.130> way<00:02:25.310> if<00:02:25.520> you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
then you know calling on this way if you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.870 
then you know calling on this way if you
have<00:02:25.790> any<00:02:25.940> problems<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.840> all<00:02:27.770> these<00:02:28.340> shares<00:02:28.700> I

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
have any problems and all these shares I

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.520 
have any problems and all these shares I
hope<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:30.160> hopefully<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.370> be
