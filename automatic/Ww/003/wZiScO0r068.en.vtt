the Strand and then you take it and make

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.359 
the Strand and then you take it and make
sure<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.650> loop<00:01:25.920> like

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
sure that you have a little loop like

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.060 
sure that you have a little loop like
that<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> hook

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
that so that you can put it on the hook

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.190 
that so that you can put it on the hook
and<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.189> clip<00:01:35.460> them<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.790> their

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
and then you just clip them on their

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.690 
and then you just clip them on their
secure<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> class<00:01:38.869> pull<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.049> through<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:53.210 

then<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.020> put<00:01:52.320> your<00:01:52.470> hand<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> middle

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
then so you put your hand in the middle

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.289 
then so you put your hand in the middle
of<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.460> loop<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:55.490> okay<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
of that loop there okay so you have it

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.170 
of that loop there okay so you have it
open<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:59.490> still<00:01:59.729> holding<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
open like this you still holding that

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.609 
open like this you still holding that
other<00:02:00.479> end<00:02:01.159> put<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.189> through<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> loop<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.619> put

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
other end put it through the loop I put

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.859 
other end put it through the loop I put
it<00:02:04.740> through<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.070> twice<00:02:05.719> put<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.840> through

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it through there twice put it through

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.630 
it through there twice put it through
the<00:02:07.229> loop<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.940> then<00:02:08.940> cool<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.739> then<00:02:10.739> BAM<00:02:11.250> it's

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the loop and then cool and then BAM it's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.430 
the loop and then cool and then BAM it's
secure<00:02:12.209> there

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
secure there

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.480 
secure there

brain<00:02:32.610> make<00:02:32.970> sure<00:02:33.000> you're<00:02:33.300> not<00:02:33.330> putting<00:02:33.660> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
brain make sure you're not putting it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.930 
brain make sure you're not putting it
through<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.350> braid<00:02:34.910> under<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> there<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.410> in

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
through the braid under so there it's in

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.810 
through the braid under so there it's in
I'm<00:02:38.940> being<00:02:39.390> brave<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.220> take<00:02:41.220> your<00:02:41.400> strand<00:02:41.700> of

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
hair again find the middle put it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.440 
hair again find the middle put it
through<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.240> loop<00:02:48.710> close<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.980> clasp<00:02:50.450> pull

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
through the loop close the clasp pull

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.150 
through the loop close the clasp pull
through<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.850> then<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.750> want<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.960> take<00:02:55.160> that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
through and then you want to take that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.730 
through and then you want to take that
loop<00:02:56.510> put<00:02:57.510> your<00:02:57.660> two<00:02:57.840> fingers<00:02:57.870> through<00:02:58.500> there

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.410 
loop put your two fingers through there
like<00:02:58.980> that<00:03:01.760> put<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.910> part<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.300> you're

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
like that put the part that you're

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.220 
like that put the part that you're
holding<00:03:03.630> through<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.170> loop<00:03:04.370> once<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:06.230> again

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
holding through the loop once and again

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.350 
holding through the loop once and again
twice<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:09.660> pull<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.050> through<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:11.090> secure<00:03:12.090> and

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
twice you pull it through and secure and

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.940 
twice you pull it through and secure and
it's<00:03:13.200> really<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.860> simple<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:16.230> did<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.800> all

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
almost done here's the front edge and of

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.660 
almost done here's the front edge and of
