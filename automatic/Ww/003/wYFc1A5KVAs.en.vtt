the hills for up and down sideways

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.180 
the hills for up and down sideways
whatever<00:03:15.780> didn't<00:03:16.320> realize<00:03:16.680> what<00:03:16.920> before

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
whatever didn't realize what before

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.270 
whatever didn't realize what before
before<00:03:17.370> he's<00:03:17.670> actually<00:03:17.820> capable<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:19.280> it's

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
before he's actually capable of and it's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.950

got some new technology ani purposely
probably<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.440> best<00:03:22.650> for<00:03:23.400> before<00:03:23.790> around<00:03:24.180> or

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
probably the best for before around or

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.690
