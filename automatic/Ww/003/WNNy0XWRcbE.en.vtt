00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.160
 it the ball here Carmen elms I'm 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.250
 signing this video so they can see 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.310
 part of some photos books that I have 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.240
 created with phishing or since I'm here 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.859
 organizing certain things this Christmas 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.680
 in new things that I want to do and things 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.500
 that I want to explore so I have a 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.830
 background music that I love I 'm going 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.530
 to share look over here you can see me 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.370
 I think this was one of the first 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.250
 photo books that I made with phishing or 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.180
 when it was called live being and this book 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:53.080
 if you notice this on September 8, 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:58.089
 2011 as phishing or as such was 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:01.030
 released in November so it is 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.500
 as historical doubly is not photo 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.040
 book 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.190
 I did it when my sister in one of 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.070
 my sisters marimán had his second 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.600
 baby and as you know then the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.030
 people are always taking 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.940
 photographs already from the cell phone true and 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.490
 an emotion like that of wanting to capture 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.640
 the first image for example the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.530
 baby when the baby comes out when 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.200
 they present when they take it out when 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.900
 I have for the first time in my hand when 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.020
 for example maybe they give you the first 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.759
 bañito my mom was already in daytona in 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.220
 florida where my sister lived I'm 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.659
 here in puerto rico in san juan and it was 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.319
 there to help her 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.679
 and spend that experience with her and everything 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.569
 I remember that we are taking 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.549
 digitally sometimes they disappear 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.719
 when we are going to look for them here one year 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.850
 two years we have taken so many photographs 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.530
 literally I ask people 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.200
 that have cellular candles like this 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.929
 like the iphone or blackberry or any 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.660
 that already at least have a year 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.930
 taking photos have literally taken 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.720
 at least a thousand 1500 photos and myself to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.640
 times in this digital like looking for those 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.160
 special events we do not find 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.980
 so it's important that we start 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.200
 document and to print now 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.480
 remind you to have these moments 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.879
 I'm going to let you go let's see why 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.390
 I'm with a hand here filming let me 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:35.230
 change the light a little 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.510
 somehow if I stop here and we go 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.420
 to close this so they can see it I'm going to 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.830
 pass it quickie 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.080
 here are the footsteps of lucas la s 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.260
 I remember with the details the first 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.810
 photograph that was taken to lukas the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.480
 first literally vogel to the took them 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.850
 and they were me here they are for 10 paul 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.580
 Peron for 2 weeks the photos that 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.220
 they were taking more documentation what 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.890
 I'm going to pass quickie 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.660
 Take advantage of photos that my 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.700
 sister had sent me with her belly 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.270
 all these ornaments the funds are in 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.460
 the same pix system go 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.450
 and here the first photos that take 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.090
 lukas 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.040
 when for the first time I truly know what 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.989
 They give it to her so fast they are taking 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.239
 photos because we all have to be in 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.050
 sakana grella to document and capture 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.160
 that special moment here we see it 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.160
 taken out 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.410
 of the belly with dylan his little brother in 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.200
 the first that share that memory 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.160
 as it was dylan and they say after and 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.170
 lukas see it 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.750
 his little brother the first time true that 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:51.380
 it is ate all all those 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.260
 memories are moments in common as 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.260
 remember truthfully how she was dressed as 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.480
 it was the fourth of the three we are 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.230
 experiences that seeing her here is my mom 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.690
 in the tired hospital asleep this 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.209
 many times they are memories that sometimes 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.340
 we forget how my grandmother says see 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.330
 photos is to live again and so for the 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.459
 style of the first quarter of the entire 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.579
 first bathroom that they gave him in the house 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.520
 the first ride and I uploaded those photos 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.570
 inside the pixie system I was not 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.880
 accommodating and this came to him directly 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.370
 to her because the company prints it and 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.830
 I send it to her by mail and this is 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.120
 one of the best souvenirs and gifts 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.070
 cherished for example here I have another 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.720
 where he could finally document one of 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.770
 the business events that we 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.229
 we do this is version 4 and then the 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.650
 I was able to document in a photobook 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.660
 we typically had them on facebook and 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.110
 I can take him and teach him other 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.940
 people maybe to companies or businesses 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.860
 what we did people 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.640
 I can see it and again and again 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.380
 hands share it and it does not compare everything 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.060
 these ornaments the funds have the 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.470
 same system so I took the opportunity to 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.930
 do something a little more creative 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.070
 and at the end I'll show you quickie 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.900
 because I took the opportunity to document the 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.150
 promotions that we made of the event the 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.520
 speakers the date 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:32.140
 all good cool so it 's a 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.060
 tool to be able to document 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.610
 corporate events also what you 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.440
 like instagram like me, we know 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.960
 that instagram is like a social network 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.200
 like twitter but with pictures by 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.530
 course in a file also of 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.040
 special moments so I took advantage 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.950
 you a web is working all the 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:59.760
 instagram images and I created a 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:02.670
 photobook of that first year where 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.370
 I uploaded photos on Instagram and believe me 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.160
 at the moment these photos that I went is a 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.490
 promotion that we made to announce one 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.230
 of our events on the radio and I nor 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.970
 I remember it is like in egg look at 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.190
 really relive find this 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.640
 photograph that I had made of my dad 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.160
 when small so a good one now 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.310
 I have to sail part 2 for 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.760
 do the new photographs like this 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.980
 the style I have my book vision that was 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.730
 a workshop that we did really is to do 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.520
 to visualize goals things that I want 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.770

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.280

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:48.490

 they demand when giving a quality tool 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.090
