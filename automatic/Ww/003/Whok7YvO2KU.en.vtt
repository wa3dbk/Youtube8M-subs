explained<00:00:19.410> before<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:21.140> have<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.470> new<00:00:22.740> battery

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.170 

it's<00:00:26.279> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> run<00:00:26.609> everything<00:00:26.849> through<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
it's going to run everything through a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.730 
it's going to run everything through a
quick<00:00:27.420> little<00:00:27.720> test<00:00:27.900> light<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.349> guys<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
quick little test light you guys see I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.520 
quick little test light you guys see I
have<00:00:29.070> power<00:00:30.949> now<00:00:31.949> we're<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> battery

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
have power now we're at the battery

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.130 
have power now we're at the battery
power<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.829> into<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> solenoid<00:00:38.989> hope<00:00:39.989> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
power going into the solenoid hope you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.190 
power going into the solenoid hope you
can<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.489> angle<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.210> into<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
can see that this angle here into the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
can see that this angle here into the
fusible<00:00:43.559> link<00:00:45.620> power<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:47.450> out<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
fusible link power there out of the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.049 
fusible link power there out of the
fusible<00:00:49.170> link<00:00:50.329> power<00:00:51.329> there<00:00:52.670> no<00:00:53.670> power<00:00:56.059> to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
fusible link power there no power to

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
fusible link power there no power to
either<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.750> blue<00:00:58.020> or<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:01.440> yellow<00:01:01.680> wire<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
either the blue or the yellow wire on a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.000 
either the blue or the yellow wire on a
solenoid<00:01:04.250> this<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.430> what's<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:07.010> nothing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
solenoid this is what's going on nothing

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.060 
solenoid this is what's going on nothing
on<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> key<00:01:08.760> switch<00:01:08.939> turning<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.140> nothing<00:01:10.920> at

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
on the key switch turning it nothing at

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:19.580 
on the key switch turning it nothing at
all<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> let's<00:01:14.670> move<00:01:15.119> up<00:01:15.299> front<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:19.409> here's

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
all so let's move up front and here's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:29.990 
all so let's move up front and here's
the<00:01:19.740> ECM<00:01:23.750> as<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:25.020> call<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.970> just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the ECM as they call in here so just

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.050 
the ECM as they call in here so just
turn<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.450> real<00:01:30.630> quick<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.020> big<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.820> grid

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
turn this real quick this big the grid

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.350 
turn this real quick this big the grid
wire<00:01:33.270> they're<00:01:34.280> got<00:01:35.280> power<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.850> into<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
wire they're got power going into that

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.800 
wire they're got power going into that
it's<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> only<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.770> place<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.310> power

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
it's the only one place I have power

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.130 
it's the only one place I have power
coming<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:40.049> over<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:41.060> on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.960> other<00:01:43.200> side

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
coming out over here on the other side

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.850 
coming out over here on the other side
it<00:01:46.140> comes<00:01:46.470> out<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.070> third<00:01:47.399> wire<00:01:48.560> which<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
it comes out the third wire which is a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.749 
it comes out the third wire which is a
little<00:01:50.159> red<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.850> side<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.619> again

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
little red one on this side here again

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.980 
little red one on this side here again
so<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.119> our<00:01:54.240> power<00:01:54.420> coming<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
so you can see our power coming out of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.249 
so you can see our power coming out of
that<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.740> red<00:01:55.920> wire<00:01:56.899> comes<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:58.079> into

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that and that red wire comes up into

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.950 
that and that red wire comes up into
here<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.520> that's<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.180> red<00:02:00.390> wire<00:02:00.630> on

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
here and that's the little red wire on

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.149 
here and that's the little red wire on
the<00:02:01.170> dash<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.860> again<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.310> nothing<00:02:04.159> that's

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
the dash but again I have nothing that's

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.959 
the dash but again I have nothing that's
where<00:02:05.369> I'm<00:02:05.430> at

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
where I'm at
