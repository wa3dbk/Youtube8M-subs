00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.570> actually<00:00:00.840> might<00:00:01.260> have<00:00:01.380> lost<00:00:01.500> his

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I think actually might have lost his

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.560 
I think actually might have lost his
Medicare<00:00:02.220> he's<00:00:02.310> coming<00:00:02.610> in<00:00:02.760> with<00:00:03.149> all<00:00:03.389> his

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
Medicare he's coming in with all his

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.869 
Medicare he's coming in with all his
fire<00:00:03.870> batched<00:00:04.140> burning<00:00:05.069> through<00:00:05.430> everything

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
fire batched burning through everything

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.330 
fire batched burning through everything
with<00:00:06.210> his<00:00:06.330> firebats<00:00:06.899> might<00:00:07.890> be<00:00:08.040> able<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.309> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
with his firebats might be able to do a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.799 
with his firebats might be able to do a
sunken<00:00:08.790> break<00:00:08.970> that's<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.420> be<00:00:09.510> close

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
sunken break that's going to be close

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.110 
sunken break that's going to be close
cuz<00:00:10.139> zero<00:00:10.410> he<00:00:10.620> has<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:11.010> ambulance<00:00:11.700> out<00:00:12.090> here

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
cuz zero he has one ambulance out here

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.289 
cuz zero he has one ambulance out here
and<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.679> barely<00:00:14.250> gets<00:00:14.460> fended<00:00:14.759> off<00:00:14.849> by<00:00:15.030> zero

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
and this barely gets fended off by zero

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.660 
and this barely gets fended off by zero
but<00:00:15.570> zero<00:00:16.080> lost<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.529> lot<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.859> drones<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.550> that

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
but zero lost a lot of drones in that

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.090 
but zero lost a lot of drones in that
attack<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.690> was<00:00:18.840> brilliant<00:00:19.260> from<00:00:19.710> coco<00:00:20.070> i

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
attack that was brilliant from coco i

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.000 
attack that was brilliant from coco i
have<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.520> say<00:00:20.760> i<00:00:21.029> mean<00:00:21.600> i<00:00:21.869> wasn't<00:00:22.470> really<00:00:22.650> i

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
have to say i mean i wasn't really i

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.800 
have to say i mean i wasn't really i
mean<00:00:23.279> i<00:00:23.580> was<00:00:23.670> kind<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.880> under<00:00:24.060> estimating<00:00:24.689> go

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
mean i was kind of under estimating go

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.230 
mean i was kind of under estimating go
go<00:00:24.990> going<00:00:25.170> into<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:26.099> OSL<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:26.910> he's<00:00:27.029> shown

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
go going into this OSL but he's shown

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
go going into this OSL but he's shown
some<00:00:27.449> pretty<00:00:27.720> brilliant<00:00:28.199> stuff<00:00:28.680> some<00:00:29.519> pretty

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
some pretty brilliant stuff some pretty

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.189 
some pretty brilliant stuff some pretty
original<00:00:30.300> stuff<00:00:30.510> I've<00:00:30.720> never<00:00:30.840> seen<00:00:30.960> anything

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
original stuff I've never seen anything

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.500 
original stuff I've never seen anything
like<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.489> yeah<00:00:32.730> he's<00:00:32.880> fine<00:00:33.059> he's<00:00:33.300> going

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
like that but yeah he's fine he's going

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.170 
like that but yeah he's fine he's going
to<00:00:33.600> lose<00:00:33.719> his<00:00:33.780> barracks<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.309> i<00:00:35.340> hope<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
to lose his barracks now so i hope the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.110 
to lose his barracks now so i hope the
drone<00:00:36.660> loss<00:00:36.899> from<00:00:37.800> zero<00:00:38.370> will<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.730> enough<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
drone loss from zero will be enough to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.910 
drone loss from zero will be enough to
even<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.899> go<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:40.200> i<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> will

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
even that out for go go i think it will

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.000 
even that out for go go i think it will
be<00:00:41.129> gogo<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.969> building<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.480> turrets<00:00:42.899> by<00:00:43.710> his

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
be gogo is building a turrets by his

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680 
be gogo is building a turrets by his
main<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.940> he's<00:00:45.059> eventually<00:00:45.360> going

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
main right now and he's eventually going

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.830 
main right now and he's eventually going
to<00:00:45.780> put<00:00:45.960> down<00:00:46.079> an<00:00:46.230> expansion<00:00:46.800> oh<00:00:47.450> my<00:00:48.450> god<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to put down an expansion oh my god that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.040 
to put down an expansion oh my god that
was<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.140> nuts<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.640> nuts<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.870> nuts

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
was so nuts so nuts and it's so nuts

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.680 
was so nuts so nuts and it's so nuts
that<00:00:52.230> i<00:00:52.379> actually<00:00:53.120> figured<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.539> he<00:00:54.600> was

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that i actually figured out what he was

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.330 
that i actually figured out what he was
going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.110> too<00:00:55.350> i<00:00:55.379> feel<00:00:55.739> kind<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> crazy

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
going to do too i feel kind of crazy

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.930 
going to do too i feel kind of crazy
myself<00:00:57.410> getting<00:00:58.410> into<00:00:58.620> go-go's<00:00:59.039> head<00:00:59.340> but

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
myself getting into go-go's head but

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.700 
myself getting into go-go's head but
looks<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.359> Go<00:01:00.750> Go<00:01:00.870> building<00:01:01.170> even<00:01:01.320> more

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
looks like Go Go building even more

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.950 
looks like Go Go building even more
turrets<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.420> think<00:01:03.660> he's<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
turrets here and I think he's going to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
turrets here and I think he's going to
be<00:01:04.049> pretty<00:01:04.379> safe<00:01:04.680> against<00:01:05.100> mutis<00:01:05.430> her<00:01:05.549> ass<00:01:05.670> man

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
be pretty safe against mutis her ass man

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.270 
be pretty safe against mutis her ass man
at<00:01:06.000> least<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> while<00:01:06.450> until<00:01:06.900> zero<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.100> get

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
at least for a while until zero can get

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.810 
at least for a while until zero can get
just<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.240> start<00:01:09.360> droning<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.049> again<00:01:10.820> but

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
just can start droning up again but

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.440 
just can start droning up again but
still<00:01:12.060> go<00:01:12.330> go<00:01:12.450> only<00:01:12.780> working<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.439> base

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
still go go only working from one base

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.929 
still go go only working from one base
and<00:01:15.450> let's<00:01:15.900> see<00:01:16.110> did<00:01:16.500> go<00:01:16.680> go<00:01:16.860> did<00:01:17.220> 0<00:01:17.759> actually

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and let's see did go go did 0 actually

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.730 
and let's see did go go did 0 actually
take<00:01:18.330> down<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.570> barracks<00:01:19.020> not<00:01:19.259> exactly<00:01:19.619> sure

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
take down that barracks not exactly sure

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890 
take down that barracks not exactly sure
I<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> barracks<00:01:20.610> floating<00:01:21.030> back<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.750> no

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
I see the barracks floating back so no

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
I see the barracks floating back so no
zero<00:01:22.200> did<00:01:22.439> actually<00:01:22.590> didn't<00:01:23.100> commit<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.909> take

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
zero did actually didn't commit to take

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.280 
zero did actually didn't commit to take
him<00:01:24.210> down<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.540> barracks<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.080> pretty

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
him down that barracks that's pretty

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.170 
him down that barracks that's pretty
insane<00:01:25.439> he's<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> give<00:01:26.580> go<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:26.880> free

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
insane he's going to give go go free

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.520 
insane he's going to give go go free
barracks<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.689> he<00:01:27.780> doesn't<00:01:28.049> take<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.320> down

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
barracks if he doesn't take that down

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.020 
barracks if he doesn't take that down
but<00:01:28.799> yeah<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.189> he<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.460> finally<00:01:29.790> going

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
but yeah I think he is finally going

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.800 
but yeah I think he is finally going
over<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.659> take<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.140> barracks<00:01:32.810> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
over to take down that barracks and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
over to take down that barracks and
there's<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.350> much<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.650> go<00:01:34.680> go<00:01:34.860> would<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.130> able

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
there's not much to go go would be able

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.130 
there's not much to go go would be able
to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.430> about<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.729> unless<00:01:35.850> he<00:01:36.030> runs<00:01:36.479> over<00:01:36.930> there

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to do about it unless he runs over there

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.380 
to do about it unless he runs over there
but<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.829> still<00:01:38.070> don't<00:01:38.400> think<00:01:38.460> he'll<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:39.180> within

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
but I still don't think he'll be within

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.380 
but I still don't think he'll be within
range<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.930> taking<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.320> those<00:01:40.470> muta<00:01:40.890> lyst

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
range of taking out those muta lyst

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.660 
range of taking out those muta lyst
besides<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.530> he<00:01:43.950> might<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.280> able<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
besides I think he might be able to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.859 
besides I think he might be able to
actually<00:01:44.820> float<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> over<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
actually float that over and get it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.710 
actually float that over and get it
repaired<00:01:46.170> by<00:01:46.380> an<00:01:46.530> SUV<00:01:47.149> went<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> find<00:01:48.390> out<00:01:48.509> soon

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720

enough<00:01:48.780> those<00:01:49.049> medical<00:01:49.530> marines<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:49.979> camping

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
enough those medical marines are camping

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.160 
enough those medical marines are camping
by<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:50.970> turrets<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:51.810> probably<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
by the turrets that's probably the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.810 
by the turrets that's probably the
safest<00:01:52.409> place<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.009> them<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.549> at<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
safest place for them to be at this

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.800 
safest place for them to be at this
moment<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:55.770> thing<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.399> go-go

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810

where<00:02:00.570> there's<00:02:00.689> mutis<00:02:01.020> are<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
where there's mutis are because the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.020 
where there's mutis are because the
mutants<00:02:01.920> were<00:02:02.009> attacking<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.520> barracks<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
mutants were attacking the barracks and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.819 
mutants were attacking the barracks and
he<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.840> able<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.049> repair<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
he is going to be able to repair that

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.770 
he is going to be able to repair that
barracks<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.430> use<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> think<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.659> was

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
barracks and use it so I think that was

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.869 
barracks and use it so I think that was
kind<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.079> critical<00:02:07.530> mistake<00:02:07.619> from<00:02:08.009> zero<00:02:08.280> not

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
kind of a critical mistake from zero not

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.580 
kind of a critical mistake from zero not
being<00:02:09.090> at<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:09.750> being<00:02:09.929> able<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> take<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.530> out

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
being at not being able to take that out

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.520 
being at not being able to take that out
earlier

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530

there's<00:02:13.530> go<00:02:13.739> go<00:02:13.980> chasing<00:02:14.430> down<00:02:14.579> that<00:02:14.819> barracks

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
there's go go chasing down that barracks

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.470 
there's go go chasing down that barracks
get<00:02:15.629> back<00:02:16.049> here<00:02:16.079> you<00:02:16.579> barracks<00:02:17.579> looks<00:02:18.329> like

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
get back here you barracks looks like

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.130 
get back here you barracks looks like
more<00:02:18.750> sunken<00:02:19.079> coming<00:02:19.560> down<00:02:19.680> 40<00:02:20.689> so<00:02:21.689> if<00:02:21.840> Go<00:02:21.989> Go

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
more sunken coming down 40 so if Go Go

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.360 
more sunken coming down 40 so if Go Go
wants<00:02:22.409> to<00:02:22.530> get<00:02:22.650> anything<00:02:22.890> done<00:02:23.129> with<00:02:23.280> the

medaka<00:02:23.640> Marine<00:02:23.819> Force<00:02:24.120> he's<00:02:24.360> probably<00:02:24.689> got<00:02:24.930> to

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
medaka Marine Force he's probably got to

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.130 
medaka Marine Force he's probably got to
get<00:02:25.110> out<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.230> dropship<00:02:25.739> soon<00:02:25.950> enough<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.989> he's

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
get out of dropship soon enough and he's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.050 
get out of dropship soon enough and he's
still<00:02:28.409> stuck<00:02:28.650> inside<00:02:28.859> one<00:02:29.280> base<00:02:29.519> i<00:02:29.760> think<00:02:29.819> this

still stuck inside one base i think this

the mineral is actually a very tough

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.229 
the mineral is actually a very tough

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
put down a command center but you know

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.240 
put down a command center but you know

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
what that probably wasn't in his plan he

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.830

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
here he is going to get that base up and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.909 
here he is going to get that base up and
now<00:04:18.419> he<00:04:18.479> has<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.659> Science<00:04:19.049> Vessel<00:04:19.109> out<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:19.680> the

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
now he has a Science Vessel out so the

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.450 
now he has a Science Vessel out so the
medalists<00:04:20.519> aren't<00:04:20.700> going<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.940> do<00:04:21.029> much

Vessel and go get actually reading a low
on<00:04:28.650> minerals<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:29.190> his<00:04:29.729> mane<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.360> he's

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
on minerals and his mane so he's

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.540 
on minerals and his mane so he's
definitely<00:04:30.870> guy<00:04:31.199> get<00:04:31.409> up<00:04:31.500> this<00:04:31.650> base<00:04:31.919> he's

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
definitely guy get up this base he's

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.800 
definitely guy get up this base he's
probably<00:04:32.759> got<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.090> think<00:04:33.270> about<00:04:33.330> putting<00:04:33.599> down

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
probably got to think about putting down

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.770 
probably got to think about putting down
another<00:04:34.080> base<00:04:34.319> very<00:04:34.620> very<00:04:34.800> soon<00:04:35.599> he's<00:04:36.599> going

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
another base very very soon he's going

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.230 
another base very very soon he's going
out<00:04:36.930> with<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.080> pretty<00:04:37.590> sizable<00:04:38.550> force<00:04:38.849> here

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
out with a pretty sizable force here

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.029 
out with a pretty sizable force here
going<00:04:39.930> out<00:04:40.020> with<00:04:40.110> his<00:04:40.229> medical<00:04:40.379> marines<00:04:40.800> he

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
going out with his medical marines he

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.909 
going out with his medical marines he
still<00:04:41.280> has<00:04:41.629> not<00:04:42.629> quite<00:04:43.050> enough<00:04:43.199> Marines<00:04:43.620> to

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
still has not quite enough Marines to

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.640 
still has not quite enough Marines to
really<00:04:44.759> make<00:04:44.909> the<00:04:45.030> difference<00:04:45.060> no<00:04:45.810> did<00:04:46.409> I<00:04:46.470> say

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
really make the difference no did I say

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.200 
really make the difference no did I say
Marines<00:04:46.979> I<00:04:47.069> met<00:04:47.280> medics<00:04:47.669> he<00:04:47.879> doesn't<00:04:48.120> have

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
Marines I met medics he doesn't have

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.110 
Marines I met medics he doesn't have
quite<00:04:48.360> enough<00:04:48.629> medics<00:04:49.319> to<00:04:49.470> really<00:04:49.940> fight<00:04:50.940> this

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
quite enough medics to really fight this

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.640 
quite enough medics to really fight this
off<00:04:51.300> I<00:04:51.509> think<00:04:51.539> Oh<00:04:53.330> scourge<00:04:54.330> almost<00:04:55.229> landing<00:04:55.560> on

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
off I think Oh scourge almost landing on

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.170 
off I think Oh scourge almost landing on
that<00:04:55.680> science<00:04:56.099> muscle<00:04:56.370> that<00:04:56.430> was<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:56.879> close

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
that science muscle that was so close

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.869 
that science muscle that was so close
I'm<00:04:58.139> really<00:04:58.289> surprised<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.919> zero<00:04:59.580> wasn't

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
I'm really surprised that zero wasn't

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.610 
I'm really surprised that zero wasn't
really<00:05:00.030> paying<00:05:00.210> attention<00:05:00.330> there<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.960> pull

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
really paying attention there to pull

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.529 
really paying attention there to pull
the<00:05:01.770> scourge<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.250> Wow<00:05:02.610> Go<00:05:02.909> Go<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.120> going<00:05:03.360> for<00:05:03.509> a

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
the scourge and Wow Go Go is going for a

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.480 
the scourge and Wow Go Go is going for a
suck<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.080> break<00:05:04.289> again<00:05:04.710> I<00:05:04.949> don't<00:05:05.280> think<00:05:05.310> he

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
suck and break again I don't think he

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.610 
suck and break again I don't think he
has<00:05:05.580> enough<00:05:05.610> medics<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.419> do<00:05:06.569> it<00:05:06.719> and<00:05:06.930> zero

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
has enough medics to do it and zero

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.170

it<00:06:13.650> go<00:06:13.770> go<00:06:13.919> should<00:06:14.129> think<00:06:14.310> about<00:06:14.400> investing<00:06:14.759> in

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
drop ships at the moment even though

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.689 
drop ships at the moment even though
that<00:06:17.400> will<00:06:17.520> cut<00:06:17.789> his<00:06:18.029> Science<00:06:18.690> Vessel

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
that will cut his Science Vessel

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.800 
that will cut his Science Vessel

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
production for a while I think you

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.740 
production for a while I think you
should<00:06:21.990> invest<00:06:22.319> in<00:06:22.440> dropships<00:06:23.599> zero<00:06:24.599> is

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:30.879

well<00:06:31.610> he's<00:06:31.939> camping<00:06:32.629> out<00:06:32.749> on<00:06:32.780> the<00:06:32.930> other<00:06:33.080> side

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
well he's camping out on the other side

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.540 
well he's camping out on the other side
of<00:06:33.349> it<00:06:33.499> so<00:06:33.680> he's<00:06:33.770> just<00:06:33.800> taking<00:06:34.189> another<00:06:34.370> base

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
of it so he's just taking another base

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.399 
of it so he's just taking another base
down<00:06:34.729> there<00:06:34.909> basically<00:06:35.240> of<00:06:35.840> the<00:06:36.110> D<00:06:36.229> matrix

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.119 
down there basically of the D matrix
wears<00:06:36.949> off<00:06:37.219> so<00:06:38.060> sad<00:06:38.680> but<00:06:39.680> he<00:06:39.740> might<00:06:39.889> actually

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:40.129 
wears off so sad but he might actually

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.629 
wears off so sad but he might actually
try<00:06:40.490> to<00:06:40.610> break<00:06:40.999> again<00:06:41.330> with<00:06:41.509> another<00:06:41.599> force<00:06:42.169> oh

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
try to break again with another force oh

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.059 
try to break again with another force oh
I<00:06:43.639> think<00:06:44.240> he<00:06:44.569> might<00:06:44.749> actually<00:06:44.960> oh<00:06:45.259> I<00:06:45.800> was<00:06:45.919> going

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069 
I think he might actually oh I was going

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.679 
I think he might actually oh I was going
to<00:06:46.129> say<00:06:46.279> that<00:06:46.490> would<00:06:46.580> be<00:06:46.669> absolutely<00:06:46.939> nuts<00:06:47.419> try

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:48.999 
to say that would be absolutely nuts try

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:49.009
