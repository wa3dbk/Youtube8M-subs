this is a great thing for all those
really<00:01:58.580> big<00:01:58.610> TVs<00:01:59.300> because<00:01:59.690> once<00:01:59.900> you<00:01:59.990> get<00:02:00.110> so

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
really big TVs because once you get so

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.890 
really big TVs because once you get so
big<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.159> detail<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.940> begins<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.330> get<00:02:02.570> lost

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
big the detail and it begins to get lost

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.230 
big the detail and it begins to get lost
a<00:02:03.170> little<00:02:03.320> bit<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:04.040> high<00:02:04.370> resolution<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:05.210> a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
a little bit so a high resolution is a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.090 
a little bit so a high resolution is a
good<00:02:05.540> thing<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.870> think<00:02:06.080> about<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:06.350> for<00:02:06.920> right

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
good thing to think about but for right

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.339 
good thing to think about but for right
now<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.400> price<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:08.090> still<00:02:08.269> pretty<00:02:08.629> high<00:02:08.929> how

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
now the price is still pretty high how

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.350 
now the price is still pretty high how
high<00:02:09.500> exactly<00:02:10.039> well<00:02:10.220> manufacturers<00:02:10.879> are<00:02:11.030> kind

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
high exactly well manufacturers are kind

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.449 
high exactly well manufacturers are kind
of<00:02:11.390> avoiding<00:02:12.019> this<00:02:12.170> price<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:12.890> there<00:02:13.340> are

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
of avoiding this price but there are

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.089 
of avoiding this price but there are
around<00:02:13.610> ten<00:02:14.000> thousand<00:02:14.750> dollars<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.650> not<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
around ten thousand dollars so not the

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.710 
around ten thousand dollars so not the
cheapest<00:02:16.610> thing<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.060> market<00:02:17.420> but<00:02:17.569> they

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
thing I know is the word upscaling is

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.300 
thing I know is the word upscaling is
never<00:02:32.930> really<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.350> good<00:02:33.650> thing<00:02:33.709> you<00:02:34.190> can

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
never really a good thing you can

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.850 
never really a good thing you can
upscale<00:02:34.520> all<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:34.940> want<00:02:35.120> LG<00:02:35.450> it's<00:02:35.600> never

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
upscale all you want LG it's never

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.830 
upscale all you want LG it's never
going<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.010> be<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.190> true<00:02:36.430> 4k<00:02:36.790> resolution<00:02:37.660> and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
going to be the true 4k resolution and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.750 
going to be the true 4k resolution and
that's<00:02:38.140> one<00:02:38.350> big<00:02:38.530> problem<00:02:38.770> TV<00:02:39.280> makers<00:02:39.610> are

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
that's one big problem TV makers are

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.520 
that's one big problem TV makers are
having<00:02:40.120> with<00:02:40.240> this<00:02:40.330> new<00:02:40.510> resolution<00:02:41.170> there's

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
having with this new resolution there's

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.830 
having with this new resolution there's
little<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.010> no<00:02:42.040> content<00:02:42.730> available<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.360> 4k

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
little to no content available in 4k

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.050 
little to no content available in 4k
right<00:02:44.110> now<00:02:44.320> but<00:02:44.740> just<00:02:44.980> like<00:02:45.070> when<00:02:45.250> 3d<00:02:45.550> TVs<00:02:45.880> hit

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
right now but just like when 3d TVs hit

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.340 
right now but just like when 3d TVs hit
the<00:02:46.150> market<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.630> few<00:02:46.780> years<00:02:46.990> ago<00:02:47.200> you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
the market just a few years ago you

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.470 
the market just a few years ago you
needed<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.830> TV<00:02:48.160> first<00:02:48.430> before<00:02:48.880> content<00:02:49.360> is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
needed the TV first before content is

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.030 
needed the TV first before content is
made<00:02:49.660> available<00:02:49.780> for<00:02:50.320> them<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:50.800> it's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
made available for them now it's

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.740 
made available for them now it's
surprisingly<00:02:51.430> easy<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.820> get<00:02:52.000> access<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.420> 3d

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
surprisingly easy to get access to 3d

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.780 
surprisingly easy to get access to 3d
blu-ray<00:02:53.080> content<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:54.040> imagine<00:02:54.280> in<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.580> few

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
blu-ray content and I imagine in a few

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.760 
blu-ray content and I imagine in a few
years<00:02:55.000> 4k<00:02:55.540> will<00:02:55.720> be<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> exact<00:02:56.230> same<00:02:56.440> thing

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
years 4k will be the exact same thing

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.980 
years 4k will be the exact same thing
now<00:02:57.220> whether<00:02:57.460> that'll<00:02:57.820> be<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:57.970> physical<00:02:58.810> copy

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
now whether that'll be a physical copy

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.480 
now whether that'll be a physical copy
of<00:02:59.230> something<00:02:59.380> or<00:02:59.770> if<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.010> will<00:03:00.070> be<00:03:00.190> streamed

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
of something or if it will be streamed

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.949 
of something or if it will be streamed
through<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.790> internet<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.600> no<00:03:01.780> idea

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
through the internet I have no idea

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.960 
through the internet I have no idea

create TVs with even thinner bezels if
you<00:03:15.190> looked<00:03:15.370> at<00:03:15.489> an<00:03:15.610> LG<00:03:15.880> TV<00:03:16.150> lately<00:03:16.390> there's

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
you looked at an LG TV lately there's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.390 
you looked at an LG TV lately there's
literally<00:03:16.989> like<00:03:17.110> no<00:03:17.530> bezel<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.070> them<00:03:18.220> anymore
