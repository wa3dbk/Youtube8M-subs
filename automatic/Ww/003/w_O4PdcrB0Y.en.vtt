00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hi, everyone! 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.740
 Today I'm going to make a special video about 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.300
 Blame the movie of the stars that I had 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.070
 To see it twice I went on the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.640
 Thursday at the premiere here on my 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.439
 city and I was also today that Saturday 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.460
 probably the video approaches tomorrow 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.039
 Sunday 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.199
 and why I went twice because I 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.029
 I did not want to record a video already on Thursday 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.949
 it was the first thing I said 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 When I left the cinema I even commented 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.809
 Punk I did not know it was going to speak in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.610
 video I made of the movie because 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.040
 simply make a video of do not know 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.329
 Ten seconds and we were talking. 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 Perfect 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.129
 see service 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.610
 I wanted to make a video like this 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.500
 but ok I'll talk then what I found 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.500
 blame the stars movie 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.480
 well first I have to put it on 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.180
 top-3 of the best adaptations I've ever 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.670
 I saw because he was extremely faithful to the book 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.740
 much much too much much too much 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.040
 same clear that adaptation does not like 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.830
 to be 100% equal to the book is very difficult 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.720
 I have never seen it but the guilt of 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.530
 star fulfilled very well the role is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.630
 types in the para did not speak and we are 95% is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.369
 faithful to the fact book of the young person having 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 accompanied the recordings was very good 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.409
 because he was there he spoke to the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.250
 fans even from the guilt of the emas who would not 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.810
 leave is the movie has no citation 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.640
 of the book that was not going to be totally 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.640
 I wanted to try to do my best. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.869
 possible fidelity to the book 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.460
 really was 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.680
 I was outraged the first time I 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.950
 I saw a spoke room together with them 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.110
 because I know that cuts the rooms is more 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.140
 of the book then I was very 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.759
 happy to have been a very 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.469
 good a very good adaptation and for whom 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.320
 was complaining that he did not like the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.380
 disease is borges think that's how it 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.950
 pronounced is to make august wars 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.800
 he played a role very well he 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.319
 fully incorporated the super goose I 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.830
 saw augustus in it so i think he 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.360
 did 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.720
 his work very well because it is 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.570
 difficult to interpret some I think it is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.210
 this wit his acidic humor the 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.940
 he did much the same 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.130
 of the book then I was very happy 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.860
 charlie once was perfect 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.230
 I also found it mainly in the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.580
 start because the resolution of the congress 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.330
 It annoyed me deeply. 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.000
 because you are extremely pessimistic and 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.100
 bitter and boring and find him really 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.380
 interpret very well because it is very 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.870
 boring at first well there to help what 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.360
 a person thinks while she is with 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.690
 a disease so serious but I found it 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.570
 very annoying to make the director very annoying 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.780
 and also charlie then she interpreted 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.040
 also very well, and I do not 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.050
 must say that my favorite part 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.670
 was the trip to amsterdam is in the first 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.100
 The time I saw it, I got it twice. 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.660
 that desire to cry but in the 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.550
 the time they went to amsterdam 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.800
 as it is not like that 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.620
 mainly in the Eni museum because 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.700
 very well done has several eni phrases 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.230
 not in the background while they are is she 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.070
 when she is climbing the stairs in 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.380
 several the phrase daniel's background of the scene 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.019
 so I was very very very 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.570
 placed in that part until all 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.180
 signed that appearing in the eni 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.130
 The book I wrote in my review of guilt 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.489
 from my review of anne frank 's diary 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.260
 and I said it was even worse because 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.840
 really signed me that marked me that 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.140
 are in the movie are also other book 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.150
 and for this film is is the plant and commented 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.400
 that she did not like the book much 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.830
 It's the love movie she says it was very good. 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.580
 the film even preferred the movie of 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.500
 book and I went with several friends and everyone 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.350
 they liked I snapped that had not 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.180
 metaphor of the cloud until the nine because 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.630
 I think very beautiful story behind 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.370
 of this metaphor of her having saved the number 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.530
 10 of her where she actually 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.450
 not bear the pain so we entered or 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.830
 10 at the burial of the Augustus ended with 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.479
 My life, that part is very much like me. 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.990
 I do not think it's a movie at all. 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.360
 drama because it really makes you laugh 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.240
 is he very fun he has developed 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.490
 very well the role of speaking this but he 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.729
 he has a very great charisma the edson 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.620
 so it was much more fun the aicep 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.660
 he is very funny too 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.090
 exactly as I imagined in the book 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.800
 exactly knows what's going on like 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.449
 Just imagining that was exactly how 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.940
 there was the war of the stars 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.099
 I was very happy with the result of the 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.690
 movie wants then type dvd've seen two 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.639
 Sometimes I want to see more is deserving 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.169
 all this prestige that is having total 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.120
 success percentage 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.130
 many people are talking about several air 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.229
 criticism of people speaking it is cliche 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.509
 It's meant to cry, I got there. 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.039
 us is not a story about cancer 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:10.460
 It's like not being made out of another 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.979
 way and even is not totally cancer 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.409
 itself is the focus of the film nor is it the 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.020
 The focus of the film is to resolve the 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.240
 likes and is for me 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.220
 the teaching of the film is not like it 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.690
 I did not know that 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.610
 increase is how she took advantage while 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.889
 she was with him as he changed her 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.599
 that only her vision or better me 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.120
 bear she became a person very 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:35.449
 better then I think a lot of people 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.789
 living until the 80's and does not find 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.710
 such a person identifies with it 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.880
 with whom she can count all the 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.650
 secrets that literally changes her so 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.919
 how the region has changed is not because they 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.509
 had cancer that is a tragedy is erol 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:55.880
 foot they knew how to handle very well 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:57.710
 especially nelia games much 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.789
 in love with the light I found everything in 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.669
 Life then I stayed there for those who have read 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:07.340
 the book and have not yet seen the film so that 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.370
 see is I said no no spoilers 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.840
 Aquino to those who have read the clear book 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:16.099
 I spoke in no spoiler here at the end of 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.990
 video because right because everything is 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:19.759
 in the book is in the movie so what I 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.069
 I commented about the eni I just said was a lot 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.440
 well done and has all the phrases it 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.449
 speak those who are in the remarkable book 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.270
 in the movie I was very happy with 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:31.419
 If there's any I do not remember. 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.520
 some kind that marked me a lot and I do not 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.680
 I do not remember because I have this book 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.810
 here showing why the original even 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.249
 first issue I lent then have 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.039
 all my posts need 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.019
 only has one post is a funeral eulogy 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.209
 hasel sus Prôa 

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:50.359
 so I only have one post that they need 

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:52.639
 the admission here in his praise to her 

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:54.319
 I really loved I went with all the 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.539
 my expectations and this movie then 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:59.869
 I was very nervous not to get over it 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:02.089
 or being disappointed 10 is disappointing 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:04.369
 but it was totally the opposite until 

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:07.179
 exceeded my expectations I did not expect 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:10.279
 who was so faithful to the book is really 

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:12.439
 was a was a very good adaptation 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:15.409
 so I advise you to see you 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:17.239
 have not seen yet and now I'm one more 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:20.179
 bad game fan because surely he 

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:22.429
 did a great job is tracking the 

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:25.939
 scenes and accompanying the recordings and 

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:29.749
 then required to ong and Leiria also 

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:32.029
