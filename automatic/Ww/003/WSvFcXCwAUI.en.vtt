00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
flashbacks because one it has guy-sensei

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.720 
flashbacks because one it has guy-sensei
with<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.320> red<00:00:25.560> scarf<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.220> saw<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.550> there

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
with that red scarf that we saw on there

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.810 
with that red scarf that we saw on there
another<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.510> had<00:00:28.019> ran<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.580> kind<00:00:29.760> of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
another is had ran in it so it kind of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.679 
another is had ran in it so it kind of
seemed<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.090> though<00:00:30.210> they<00:00:30.330> were<00:00:30.420> trying<00:00:30.480> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
seemed as though they were trying to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.179 
seemed as though they were trying to
keep<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> time<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.710> they're<00:00:31.859> not<00:00:31.949> too

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
keep up with the time so they're not too

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.530 
keep up with the time so they're not too
far<00:00:32.489> behind<00:00:32.640> what's<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
far behind what's going on with the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
far behind what's going on with the
manga<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.350> filler<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.340> were

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
manga with this a filler but there were

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.500 
manga with this a filler but there were
some<00:00:35.640> problems<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> episode

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
some problems with the episode

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.200 
some problems with the episode
nonetheless<00:00:36.690> which<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.350> probably<00:00:37.890> why<00:00:38.879> they

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
nonetheless which is probably why they

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.910 
nonetheless which is probably why they
were<00:00:39.360> able<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.750> keep<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
were able to keep up with it because the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.500 
were able to keep up with it because the
animation<00:00:41.460> first<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.790> all<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> episode

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
animation first of all on this episode

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.779 
animation first of all on this episode
was<00:00:42.629> pretty<00:00:42.840> bad<00:00:43.020> um<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.250> some<00:00:44.280> very

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
was pretty bad um there was some very

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.549 
was pretty bad um there was some very
simplified<00:00:45.239> stuff<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> backgrounds

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
simplified stuff like the backgrounds

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.869 
simplified stuff like the backgrounds
when<00:00:46.680> they're<00:00:46.829> fighting<00:00:47.160> turn<00:00:47.399> into<00:00:47.700> just

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
when they're fighting turn into just

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.350 
when they're fighting turn into just
like<00:00:48.059> green<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.289> lights<00:00:49.530> across<00:00:49.860> it

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
like green with like lights across it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.369

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320

their<00:01:11.130> voices<00:01:11.400> are<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:12.030> very<00:01:12.479> high-pitched

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
their voices are very very high-pitched

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
their voices are very very high-pitched
and<00:01:13.680> especially<00:01:14.220> Kakashi's<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.689> we

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and especially Kakashi's is like when we

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.510 
and especially Kakashi's is like when we
saw<00:01:15.960> him<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.110> Kakashi<00:01:16.439> Gaiden<00:01:16.950> his<00:01:17.130> voice<00:01:17.310> was

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
saw him in Kakashi Gaiden his voice was

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.740 
saw him in Kakashi Gaiden his voice was
pretty<00:01:17.759> deep<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.330> had<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> same

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
pretty deep because they had the same

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
pretty deep because they had the same
voice<00:01:18.990> actor<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:20.130> plays<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> regular<00:01:20.820> Kakashi

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
voice actor that plays a regular Kakashi

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.179 
voice actor that plays a regular Kakashi
voiced<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.750> little<00:01:21.990> kid<00:01:22.140> version<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
voiced a little kid version but in this

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
voiced a little kid version but in this
one<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.490> had<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> little<00:01:24.270> kid<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
one they had like a little kid or a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.710 
one they had like a little kid or a
female<00:01:25.409> probably<00:01:25.920> voicing<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> voice<00:01:27.540> for

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
female probably voicing the voice for

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
female probably voicing the voice for
Kakashi<00:01:28.049> when<00:01:28.380> he<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.650> younger<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.430> kinda

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
Kakashi when he was younger so it kinda

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.130 
Kakashi when he was younger so it kinda
didn't<00:01:29.850> make<00:01:29.939> sense<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.990> tell

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
didn't make sense because you can tell

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.840 
didn't make sense because you can tell
that<00:01:31.259> Kakashi<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.829> already<00:01:32.070> older<00:01:32.490> than<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that Kakashi was already older than the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.359 
that Kakashi was already older than the
Obito<00:01:33.299> stuff<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.439> flashback<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.250> his

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
Obito stuff and the flashback so his

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
Obito stuff and the flashback so his
voice<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.729> anything<00:01:36.060> should<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.240> deeper<00:01:36.750> or

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
voice if anything should be deeper or

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
voice if anything should be deeper or
you<00:01:37.170> know<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.590> same<00:01:37.829> not<00:01:38.070> higher<00:01:38.790> pitch

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
you know just the same not higher pitch

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.999 
you know just the same not higher pitch
so<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.320> other<00:01:40.409> problem<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
so that was the other problem with the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.429 
so that was the other problem with the
episode<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:42.030> honestly<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.600> mean<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
episode but honestly I mean it was it

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
episode but honestly I mean it was it
was<00:01:43.619> problematic<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> former<00:01:45.240> his<00:01:45.360> like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
was problematic to the former his like

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.910 
was problematic to the former his like
okay<00:01:45.960> come<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.710> could<00:01:46.890> have

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
okay come on you know they could have

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.289 
okay come on you know they could have
done<00:01:47.070> better<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> animation<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> was

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
done better with the animation but I was

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.910 
done better with the animation but I was

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
almost as if the studio was hinting at

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.910 
almost as if the studio was hinting at
something<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.510> I'm<00:02:43.080> not<00:02:43.230> talking<00:02:43.530> about<00:02:43.590> just

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
something and I'm not talking about just

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.350 
something and I'm not talking about just
the<00:02:44.040> chapters<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.610> already<00:02:44.730> read<00:02:45.090> but

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the chapters that we already read but

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.210 
the chapters that we already read but
what<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.080> they<00:02:46.230> were<00:02:46.290> hinting<00:02:46.680> at<00:02:46.860> there's<00:02:47.130> a

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
what if they were hinting at there's a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.210 
what if they were hinting at there's a
possibility<00:02:47.610> Ren<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.360> still<00:02:48.600> alive<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.470> think

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
possibility Ren is still alive and think

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.500 
possibility Ren is still alive and think
about<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.520> as<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.730> could<00:02:50.880> say<00:02:51.030> yeah<00:02:51.240> it's

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
about it as you could say yeah it's

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.060 
about it as you could say yeah it's
filler<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.990> everything<00:02:52.560> like<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.709> but

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
filler and everything like that but

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.699 
filler and everything like that but
remember<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.060> studio<00:02:54.420> has<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> far<00:02:55.140> higher

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
remember the studio has a far higher

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.070 
remember the studio has a far higher
connection<00:02:56.130> with<00:02:56.610> kishimoto<00:02:57.300> than<00:02:57.570> any<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.930> us
