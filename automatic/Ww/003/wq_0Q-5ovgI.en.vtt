00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.960
 good guys one of the big ones 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.480
 what's new with the samsung 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.730
 galaxy s 5 and that certainly protect better 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.800
 the terminal and its data of curious or 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.349
 thieves is the fingerprint sensor 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.260
 apple fingerprints made it fashionable the year 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.690
 past with your iphone 5 and samsung s has 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.480
 followed his footsteps with a similar system 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.699
 although different in the way that 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.040
 it scans with this system the user 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.410
 You can link one or more fingerprints to 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.570
 unlocking the s5 plus other 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.480
 services like paying with paypal without 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.250
 have to put passwords but how do you 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.730
 set the fingerprint scanner 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.420
 galaxy s 5 we will go in parts to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.309
 start 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.100
 we'll go to the settings menu and we'll look 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.989
 finger scanner inside we will see a 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.329
 option called footprint manager 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.640
 digital if we press it we will access 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.820
 directly to the footprint that will serve us 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.800
 to unlock the terminal among others 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.380
 following the animation we will pass the finger 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.030
 in the same way up to eight times the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.430
 system registers the possible 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.000
 variations of pass we can do 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.630
 in each scan at the end of the galaxy s 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.640
 5 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.039
 for us to enter a password 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.840
 alternative so that we can enter 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.299
 in case of an error in the recognition 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.130
 or so that another person with our 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.829
 permission can enter without having 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.240
 registered his traces act immediately if 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.240
 we want to apply the fingerprint scanner 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.369
 When unlocking the s5, we must choose the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.200
 method on the screen that appears to 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.140
 from that moment every time 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.539
 we want to enter the s5 this one will ask us 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.759
 that we go through the scanner the finger that 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.549
 we have used for the record as 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.369
 it said the galaxy s 5 allows you to register 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.530
 up to three different footprints 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.220
 the same person or multiple users 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.220
 what do you think
