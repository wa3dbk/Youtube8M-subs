hello YouTube I'm back and today I've
overclocked<00:00:05.460> my<00:00:05.899> processor<00:00:06.899> my<00:00:07.109> ivybridge

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
overclocked my processor my ivybridge

not expected not expected was that I'd
have<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.840> go<00:00:21.960> almost<00:00:22.170> all<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> way<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> 1.3

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550

have to go almost all the way up to 1.3
volts<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.180> get<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.510> work<00:00:25.220> apparently<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
volts to get it to work apparently I

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.200 
volts to get it to work apparently I
have<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:28.070> lemony<00:00:29.070> tasting<00:00:29.609> one<00:00:29.849> but

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
have one of the lemony tasting one but

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.080 
have one of the lemony tasting one but
it<00:00:30.779> works<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.369> 4.6<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.759> more<00:00:32.940> than

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it works and 4.6 really is more than

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.450 
it works and 4.6 really is more than
enough<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:33.690> anyone<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> I'm<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.370> gonna

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
enough for anyone so I'm just gonna

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
enough for anyone so I'm just gonna
leave<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:38.309> second<00:00:39.530> unexpected

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
leave it at that the second unexpected

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.430 
leave it at that the second unexpected
one<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.280> wine<00:00:41.960> particularly<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.200> game

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
one is that wine particularly this game

guild wars 1 he's now running twice as
fast<00:00:47.450> yeah<00:00:48.450> twice<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.410> fast<00:00:49.969> 800<00:00:50.969> megahertz

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
fast yeah twice as fast 800 megahertz

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.950 
fast yeah twice as fast 800 megahertz
gives<00:00:51.960> me<00:00:52.170> twice<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.710> fast<00:00:52.949> now<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.960> little

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
gives me twice as fast now a little

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
gives me twice as fast now a little
benchmark<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.160> game<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.820> go

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
benchmark I do in this game is I go

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.760 
benchmark I do in this game is I go
stand<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.690> corner<00:00:58.020> i<00:00:58.170> zoom<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
stand up in this corner i zoom all the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.619 
stand up in this corner i zoom all the
way<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> few<00:01:00.090> Polly's<00:01:00.480> as

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
way in so I get a few Polly's as

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.990 
way in so I get a few Polly's as
possible<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.949> lower<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.579> minimum

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
possible and I lower this to minimum

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
possible and I lower this to minimum
quality<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.530> way<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:06.530> then<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.619> look

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
quality all the way to and then I look

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.670 
quality all the way to and then I look
at<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> frame<00:01:08.100> rate<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:09.350> before<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> did<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
at the frame rate and before I did the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.289 
at the frame rate and before I did the
overclock<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.220> frame<00:01:11.549> rate<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.180> in

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
overclock the frame rate in here was in

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.630 
overclock the frame rate in here was in
the<00:01:12.390> low<00:01:12.540> 400s<00:01:13.520> now<00:01:16.159> well<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.610> for

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the low 400s now well you can see for

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
the low 400s now well you can see for
yourself<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> 800<00:01:18.960> while<00:01:19.140> recording

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
yourself it's in the 800 while recording

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.679 
yourself it's in the 800 while recording
and<00:01:20.460> when<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.729> not<00:01:20.850> recording<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.540> was

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and when I'm not recording it was

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.609 
and when I'm not recording it was
getting<00:01:21.960> close<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> 900<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.570> yeah<00:01:24.619> pretty

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
getting close to 900 so yeah pretty

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.840 
getting close to 900 so yeah pretty
freaking<00:01:26.250> fantastic<00:01:28.100> double<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.280> frame<00:01:29.579> rate

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
freaking fantastic double the frame rate

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.580 
freaking fantastic double the frame rate
I<00:01:30.030> can't<00:01:30.329> believe<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.840> did<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.229> there<00:01:31.439> must

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
I can't believe it did that there must

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.410 
I can't believe it did that there must
have<00:01:31.680> been<00:01:31.799> some<00:01:32.130> weird<00:01:32.369> kind<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.909> bottleneck

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
have been some weird kind of bottleneck

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
have been some weird kind of bottleneck
wine<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:33.900> causing<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> weird<00:01:35.310> because

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
wine was causing which is weird because

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.090 
wine was causing which is weird because
wines<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:36.000> supposed<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.390> cause<00:01:36.570> any

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
wines not supposed to cause any

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.550 
wines not supposed to cause any
performance<00:01:38.100> degradation<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:39.380> but<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
performance degradation at all but the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.730 
performance degradation at all but the
point<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.549> working<00:01:42.090> very<00:01:42.630> fucking<00:01:43.259> fast

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
point is it's working very fucking fast

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740 
point is it's working very fucking fast
in<00:01:43.979> fact<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.250> working<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.729> fast<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.299> had<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
in fact is working so fast that I had to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
in fact is working so fast that I had to
limit<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> frame<00:01:46.409> rate<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.130> game<00:01:47.520> by

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
limit the frame rate on this game by

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.800 
limit the frame rate on this game by
adding<00:01:48.390> vsync<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:50.130> didn't<00:01:50.399> then

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
adding vsync because if I didn't then

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.359 
adding vsync because if I didn't then
well<00:01:51.810> quite<00:01:52.079> frankly<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.560> game<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.040> stop

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
well quite frankly the game would stop

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.800 
well quite frankly the game would stop
working<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.270> designed<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.689> run

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
working because it's not designed to run

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.459 
working because it's not designed to run
at<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.020> frame<00:01:55.229> rate<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:57.990> go<00:01:58.290> back

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
at this frame rate so we then go back

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.720 
at this frame rate so we then go back
set<00:01:58.829> everything<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> highest<00:01:59.399> you

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
set everything to the highest you

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.750 
set everything to the highest you
that<00:02:02.520> Ghost<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.790> where<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.030> was<00:02:04.300> second<00:02:05.020> ago

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
that Ghost and where I was second ago

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.150 
that Ghost and where I was second ago
now<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.960> more<00:02:08.110> expected<00:02:08.470> ones<00:02:08.890> is

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
now one of the more expected ones is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.460 
now one of the more expected ones is
that<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:09.730> Union<00:02:10.150> heaven<00:02:10.480> benchmark<00:02:10.630> went<00:02:11.260> up

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
that the Union heaven benchmark went up

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.040 
that the Union heaven benchmark went up
by<00:02:11.650> about<00:02:11.770> seven<00:02:12.310> or<00:02:12.340> eight<00:02:12.490> percent<00:02:13.050> so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
by about seven or eight percent so

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.260 
by about seven or eight percent so
nothing<00:02:14.470> as<00:02:14.590> drastic<00:02:14.830> as<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.460> doubling<00:02:16.120> of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
nothing as drastic as a doubling of

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.570 
nothing as drastic as a doubling of
frame<00:02:16.540> rate<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:19.050> yeah<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.290> went<00:02:20.440> from<00:02:20.710> 77

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
frame rate but yeah it went from 77

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.030 
frame rate but yeah it went from 77
frames<00:02:21.820> per<00:02:22.000> second<00:02:22.360> average<00:02:22.480> 282<00:02:23.470> frames<00:02:23.830> per

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
frames per second average 282 frames per

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.090 
frames per second average 282 frames per
second<00:02:24.370> average<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.900> know<00:02:26.020> modest<00:02:26.830> but

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
second average so you know modest but

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.440 
second average so you know modest but

test<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.890> didn't<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.790> any<00:02:40.270> bugs<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.170> it's

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
test I didn't have any bugs so it's

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.990 
test I didn't have any bugs so it's
perfectly<00:02:41.830> stable<00:02:42.130> or<00:02:42.490> at<00:02:42.550> least<00:02:42.670> that's<00:02:42.850> what

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
perfectly stable or at least that's what

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.330 
perfectly stable or at least that's what
I<00:02:43.030> thought<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:43.800> then<00:02:44.800> while<00:02:44.980> running<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
I thought and then while running the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.880 
I thought and then while running the
Union<00:02:45.910> benchmark<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.600> got<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> kernel<00:02:47.290> panic<00:02:47.320> so

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
Union benchmark I got a kernel panic so

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.250 
Union benchmark I got a kernel panic so
I<00:02:47.920> had<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.460> up<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.090> voltage<00:02:49.270> by<00:02:49.690> another<00:02:49.900> point

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
I had to up the voltage by another point

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.550 
I had to up the voltage by another point
05<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.820> now<00:02:52.270> it's<00:02:52.450> running<00:02:52.630> at<00:02:52.780> point<00:02:53.260> 1<00:02:53.530> point

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
05 so now it's running at point 1 point

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.930 
05 so now it's running at point 1 point
2<00:02:54.130> 95<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:55.140> if<00:02:56.140> there's<00:02:56.440> another<00:02:56.620> bug<00:02:56.920> if<00:02:57.460> it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
2 95 and if there's another bug if it

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.680 
2 95 and if there's another bug if it
crashes<00:02:58.240> again<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.690> looked<00:02:59.050> up<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.260> 1.3<00:02:59.770> but<00:03:00.280> I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
crashes again I looked up to 1.3 but I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.760 
crashes again I looked up to 1.3 but I
sincerely<00:03:01.690> hope<00:03:01.900> doesn't<00:03:02.350> have<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.650> do<00:03:02.740> that

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
sincerely hope doesn't have to do that

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.890 
sincerely hope doesn't have to do that
I've<00:03:03.130> heard<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.460> people<00:03:03.490> getting<00:03:03.900> 4.7

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
I've heard of people getting 4.7

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.870 
I've heard of people getting 4.7
gigahertz<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.470> 1.3<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.250> if<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.490> have<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.760> go<00:03:06.850> all

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
gigahertz on 1.3 so if I have to go all

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.080 
gigahertz on 1.3 so if I have to go all
the<00:03:07.090> way<00:03:07.120> up<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.330> there<00:03:07.600> it's<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:08.140> terrible

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
the way up to there it's just terrible

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.510 
the way up to there it's just terrible
but<00:03:10.090> anyway<00:03:10.480> even<00:03:11.140> when<00:03:11.290> running<00:03:11.500> prime<00:03:11.980> for

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.210 
prime torture test for 12 hours the top
temperature<00:03:16.840> was<00:03:17.650> 70<00:03:18.190> Celsius<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:20.440> yeah<00:03:20.890> my

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
temperature was 70 Celsius so yeah my

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.310 
temperature was 70 Celsius so yeah my
system<00:03:21.610> is<00:03:21.700> extremely<00:03:21.940> well<00:03:22.450> cooled<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:23.020> have

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
system is extremely well cooled I have

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.410 
system is extremely well cooled I have
to<00:03:23.470> say<00:03:23.650> noctua<00:03:24.130> make<00:03:24.340> some<00:03:24.580> very<00:03:24.910> very<00:03:25.150> nice

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
to say noctua make some very very nice

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.620 
to say noctua make some very very nice
coolers<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.140> they're<00:03:26.260> nhd<00:03:26.800> 14<00:03:27.310> which<00:03:27.630> makes

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
coolers and they're nhd 14 which makes

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.940 
coolers and they're nhd 14 which makes
it<00:03:28.750> very<00:03:28.900> hard<00:03:29.020> to<00:03:29.200> get<00:03:29.380> at<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.560> RAM<00:03:29.709> on<00:03:29.739> the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
it very hard to get at the RAM on the

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.449 
it very hard to get at the RAM on the
motherboard<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:31.260> very<00:03:32.260> very<00:03:32.620> good<00:03:32.950> at<00:03:33.070> cooling

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
motherboard is very very good at cooling

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.180 
motherboard is very very good at cooling
my<00:03:33.640> processor<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:35.560> fact<00:03:35.770> that<00:03:35.830> it's<00:03:36.010> in<00:03:36.130> a

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
my processor and the fact that it's in a

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.290 
my processor and the fact that it's in a
half<00:03:36.400> case<00:03:36.700> half<00:03:37.510> x<00:03:37.780> case<00:03:38.700> probably<00:03:39.700> isn't<00:03:40.180> bad

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
half case half x case probably isn't bad

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.060 
half case half x case probably isn't bad
either<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:42.220> yeah<00:03:43.350> here's<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.590> one<00:03:44.800> hundred

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
either so yeah here's to a one hundred

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.970 
either so yeah here's to a one hundred
percent<00:03:45.100> increase<00:03:45.760> in<00:03:45.790> frame<00:03:46.120> rate<00:03:46.330> i<00:03:46.980> would

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
percent increase in frame rate i would

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.400 
percent increase in frame rate i would
show<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.640> crisis<00:03:49.030> benchmarks<00:03:49.600> but<00:03:49.870> after

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
show you the crisis benchmarks but after

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.300 
show you the crisis benchmarks but after
making<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.980> crisis<00:03:51.400> videos<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:52.770> deleted<00:03:53.770> them

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
making the crisis videos I deleted them

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.360 
making the crisis videos I deleted them
and<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:56.170> can't<00:03:56.380> be<00:03:56.500> bothered<00:03:56.620> installing<00:03:57.250> them

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
and I can't be bothered installing them

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.340 
and I can't be bothered installing them
again<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:57.970> know<00:03:58.300> what<00:03:58.540> let's<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:58.989> show

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
again so you know what let's just show

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.170 
again so you know what let's just show
you<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.770> improved<00:04:00.190> performance<00:04:00.820> in<00:04:01.000> the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
you the improved performance in the

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.780 
you the improved performance in the
following<00:04:01.480> videos<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.320> I've<00:04:02.920> got<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.280> deus<00:04:03.580> ex

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
following videos so I've got a deus ex

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.000 
following videos so I've got a deus ex
human<00:04:04.000> revolution<00:04:04.180> coming<00:04:04.989> up<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.380> a<00:04:05.830> dead

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
human revolution coming up and a dead

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.539 
human revolution coming up and a dead
space<00:04:06.310> also<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.500> many<00:04:08.680> games<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:09.160> couldn't<00:04:09.400> play

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
space also so many games I couldn't play

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.520 
space also so many games I couldn't play
before<00:04:09.730> anyway<00:04:10.299> this<00:04:11.079> should<00:04:11.350> hopefully

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
before anyway this should hopefully

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.370 
before anyway this should hopefully
increase<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.549> performance

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
increase the performance

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.590 
increase the performance
significantly<00:04:14.160> when<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:14.790> say<00:04:15.000> significantly<00:04:15.540> I

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
significantly when I say significantly I

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.820 
significantly when I say significantly I
mean<00:04:15.870> massively<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:18.600> yeah<00:04:19.430> see<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.550> soon
