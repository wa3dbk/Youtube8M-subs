so<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.460> my<00:02:00.549> hair<00:02:00.729> is<00:02:00.789> kind<00:02:00.969> of<00:02:01.060> divided<00:02:01.329> like

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
so the my hair is kind of divided like

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.810 
so the my hair is kind of divided like
this<00:02:01.600> then<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.590> have<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.770> up<00:02:02.979> portion<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.579> I<00:02:03.640> have

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
this then I have a up portion and I have

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.999 
this then I have a up portion and I have
the<00:02:03.939> down<00:02:04.119> portion<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:05.409> this<00:02:05.439> is<00:02:05.799> what<00:02:05.920> it

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
the down portion so this is what it

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.850 
the down portion so this is what it
looks<00:02:06.159> like<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:08.320> one<00:02:08.590> side<00:02:10.680> that's<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
looks like that's one side that's the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.100 
looks like that's one side that's the
other<00:02:12.010> side<00:02:12.130> so<00:02:13.060> pretty<00:02:13.300> much<00:02:13.480> what<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.720> did<00:02:13.840> was

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
other side so pretty much what I did was

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.550 
other side so pretty much what I did was
I<00:02:14.790> braided<00:02:15.790> braided<00:02:16.240> rated<00:02:16.540> all<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.870> way<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.500> I

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
I braided braided rated all the way so I

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.680 
I braided braided rated all the way so I
got<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> certain<00:02:17.950> part<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.450> just

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
got to a certain part and then I just

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.230 
got to a certain part and then I just
split<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.740> did<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.010> twist<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:22.120> you

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
split it and I just did a twist and you

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.480 
split it and I just did a twist and you
can<00:02:22.390> see<00:02:22.510> like<00:02:22.660> my<00:02:22.840> ends<00:02:23.200> are<00:02:23.350> not<00:02:24.010> really

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
can see like my ends are not really

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.830 
can see like my ends are not really
braided<00:02:25.300> or<00:02:25.450> twisted<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.260> think<00:02:26.530> because<00:02:27.250> I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
braided or twisted and I think because I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.030 
braided or twisted and I think because I
got<00:02:28.840> either<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.200> butter<00:02:29.409> or<00:02:29.650> isn't<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
got either the butter or isn't the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.410 
got either the butter or isn't the
greatest<00:02:30.250> when<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.640> comes<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:31.000> sealing<00:02:31.330> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
greatest when it comes to sealing the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.009 
greatest when it comes to sealing the
ends<00:02:31.659> and<00:02:31.750> keeping<00:02:32.050> them<00:02:32.170> twisted

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
ends and keeping them twisted

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.530 
ends and keeping them twisted
maybe<00:02:33.829> I<00:02:33.980> screwed<00:02:34.280> up<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.519> don't<00:02:34.700> know<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.450> I'll

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
maybe I screwed up I don't know but I'll

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.759 
maybe I screwed up I don't know but I'll
probably<00:02:35.719> have<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.170> some<00:02:36.409> point<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:36.739> time

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
probably have to some point in time

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.360 
probably have to some point in time
before<00:02:37.579> I<00:02:37.609> take<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:38.450> out<00:02:38.859> or<00:02:39.859> maybe<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.159> might

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
before I take this out or maybe I might

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.539 
before I take this out or maybe I might
take<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.700> out<00:02:40.790> prematurely<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.420> don't<00:02:41.629> know<00:02:41.719> yet

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
take it out prematurely I don't know yet

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.619 
take it out prematurely I don't know yet
we<00:02:43.549> twist<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.879> ends<00:02:44.299> or<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:46.239> take<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.359> out<00:02:47.450> I

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
we twist the ends or just take it out I

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.240 
we twist the ends or just take it out I
don't<00:02:47.810> know<00:02:47.900> but<00:02:48.409> anyway<00:02:48.469> so<00:02:48.650> that's<00:02:48.799> a<00:02:49.010> set<00:02:49.159> up
