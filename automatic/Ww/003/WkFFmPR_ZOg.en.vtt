00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.760
 pirelli tire revolution and for 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.170
 to face the 2013 Formula 1 season 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.210
 the most obvious novelty is the coloring 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.849
 of the da is marked by the band 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.560
 right on the side 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.350
 from the technical point of view there are two i 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.879
 new major changes 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.879
 new compounds construction 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.660
 the work of the pirelli engineers is 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.309
 concentrated on the real combined fraction 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.879
 temperature distribution 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.350
 Performance improvement increases 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.360
 the adhesion available in stages of 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.339
 coordinated traction than in a curved city 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.049
 reduces oversteer and allows to 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.049
 discharge all the engine power 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.280
 improves temperature management 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.019
 the contact area distributes the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.360
 load uniformly and in synergy 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.130
 with the new compounds the distribution 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.050
 more even heat on the tread 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.050
 reduces the phenomena of downloaded books 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.830
 three are the best grip performance a 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.600
 arrangement and better efficiency 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.970
 overall I assure by putting his 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.670
 lower lap and contextually fix 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.800
 at six tenths the time difference between 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.950
 the different options of hardness to everything 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.180
 advantage of tender strategies 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.920
 this year the four options written 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.619
 offers from pirelli include two 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.750
 specific to working ranges two work 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.550
 in hard and soft range they provide the 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.950
 higher thermal parquet with value 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.450
 over 100 degrees supersoft and 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.729
 medium work in a curve of 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.770
 lower temperature with maximum yield a 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.770
 starting at 85 90 degrees 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.260
 change both solutions from 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.340
 wet to widen the range of 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.530
 use have been made 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.330
 interventions on rear constructions 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.619
 which ensure more behavior 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.619
 progressive and effective 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.340
 all new 2013 f1 tires 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.960
 allow you to better cover the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.760
 environmental variables different 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.340
 types of the different circuits 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.470
 right conditions part of teams and pilots 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.050
 all without simplifying performance
