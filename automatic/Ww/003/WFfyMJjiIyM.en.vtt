00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and in a circular motion but I felt that

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.859 
and in a circular motion but I felt that
it<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> come<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.939> go<00:00:21.060> party<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.689> did

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
up for three places and that gave me

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.900 
up for three places and that gave me
more<00:00:27.000> room<00:00:27.330> within<00:00:28.050> my<00:00:28.199> home<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.429> I'm<00:00:29.789> gonna

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.130 
you have an idea why I did what I did
and<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.739> did<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.399> kept<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.480> table<00:00:36.899> top

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and how I did it I kept at the table top

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.520 
and how I did it I kept at the table top
plane<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.850> normally<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:39.989> lay<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
plane just because normally I do lay a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
plane just because normally I do lay a
big<00:00:40.860> clock<00:00:41.160> over<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.730> during<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.239> time

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
big clock over it but during this time

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.030 
big clock over it but during this time
as<00:00:42.750> far<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.079> makeup<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.620> thought<00:00:43.890> it'd<00:00:44.010> be

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
as far as makeup I just thought it'd be

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
as far as makeup I just thought it'd be
easier<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.460> cleanup<00:00:44.910> since<00:00:45.360> mine<00:00:45.570> come<00:00:45.870> doing

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
easier for cleanup since mine come doing

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
easier for cleanup since mine come doing
a<00:00:46.260> common<00:00:46.590> goal<00:00:46.800> party<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.789> when<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.149> person's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
a common goal party so when one person's

a common goal party so when one person's
done<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.260> quickly<00:00:49.440> clean<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.129> wipe<00:00:50.309> up

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
done I can quickly clean up and wipe up

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.510 
done I can quickly clean up and wipe up
the<00:00:50.640> area<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> place<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.960> back<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.440> order<00:00:52.710> then
