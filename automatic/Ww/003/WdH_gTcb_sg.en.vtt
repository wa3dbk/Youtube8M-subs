00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello, how are you welcome? 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.720
 this review or criticism of the gentlemen 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.570
 of the zodiac the legend of the sanctuary 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.700
 To begin with, it is worth mentioning many things 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.769
 as well as things that were seen to come and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 that many will not like everyone anymore 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.730
 know the synopsis the knights 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.039
 they have to cross the twelve houses 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.199
 until you get to the patriarch's in that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.240
 everything is fine in terms of the details of 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.160
 development of the characters to be 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.170
 sincere I liked it but I think that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.779
 they were exceeded in some parts but 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.790
 the perfect 3D design went well 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.550
 now I will go to what is the plot and a 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.980
 little of what the warning script is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.290
 totally spoilers all the following 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 so if you do not see the movie yet and 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.489
 you do not want to find out in this way 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.559
 I suggest you close the video good for 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.809
 begin I will tell you my experience a 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.550
 little when I went to see her I went to the cinema and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.800
 I looked for the best seat to be able 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.989
 appreciate the best when the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.420
 movie I said but I'm watching 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 fuck uncle this is the host the fight 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.160
 among the epic golden saints 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.290
 spectacular give 12 madrazos in the sky 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.720
 although here I was fighting, it becomes hard 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.460
 against ayo 2 which I thought was a bit 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.740
 but I said it does not matter since 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.900
 supposedly saga dies in this way 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.760
 clear faking his death to give 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.830
 explanation because the golden saint of 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.410
 Gemini was not in the Gemini house 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.420
 but the battle was very short then everything 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.100
 the rest happened very summarized but if 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.410
 they did a good job since 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.300
 it was very understandable here dowser is not 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.250
 as in the anime but I think also 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.110
 They did a good job on that because 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.960
 it was not necessary for that to be the same 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.490
 because I think it's not that important 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 well I think it's already known in the order 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.140
 of the twelve houses where they will go 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.900
 the bronze knights true when 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.790
 come to the house of Aries appears very and 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.790
 gives a very short battle with seville 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.189
 then they go to the house of Paul and other 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.000
 battle with sevilla at the end if she 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.000
 cut the horn 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.550
 the next house they arrive at is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.770
 the cancer one confirmation is that 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.900
 dead mask if it is port and its character is 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.180
 totally different from what we saw in 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.400
 the anime retaining only its arrogance 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.650
 and psychopathy for killing in this house 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.050
 cancer sends yoga to the aquarium house 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.660
 and so rive the entrance of hell where 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.490
 that he would take his fight with cancer the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.190
 battle between syrian and dead more me 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.950
 It seemed very short but good what else 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.900
 the house of gemini not to mention because it 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.640
 suppose they had to pass by for 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.830
 get to leo's house but be the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.640
 They sauntered in Leo's house as 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.380
 we know 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.970
 seville versus a georgia to georgia 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.070
 I was after the control of the satan 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.080
 imperial patriarch the battle of 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.450
 I thought it was good here although I feel that 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.400
 missed something then intervenes out of 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.380
 virgo and tells the knights of 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.730
 bronze that continue already georgia that 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.730
 react and stay with him 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.060
 while in the aquarium house camps 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.280
 he finds yoga they talk a little and 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.470
 then between scenes passes while 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.150
 what others do afterwards when they return 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.670
 to this fight between the knights 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.620
 these people have already finished their fight 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.570
 but what the hell is it that I could 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.850
 lose this great battle being there in 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.220
 the cinema but I said it does not matter so 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.080
 I kept seeing up there everything was fine 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.540
 although with lagunas things that I do not 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.660
 they liked now the worst part comes for 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.490
 so getting to the house of good I do not know if 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.740
 it was the house of Capricorn or of 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.570
 scorpion but there's a fight with 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.880
 the bronze knights being 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.650
 beaten like sandbags until 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.750
 comes to another punching bag more than is 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.180
 here and they say wait your turn to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.550
 hit you too x me is 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.470
 woman if she is a woman and I think more to me 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.870
 his brain was fused to allow 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.240
 this and over is a redhead the truth 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.820
 I did not like this then they come to glory 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.860
 very girl and aldebarán saying but 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.590
 because they did not invite us to hit sacks 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.900
 of sand x of no lie arrive and they say 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.640
 they expect these gentlemen protect 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.130
 athens and that the patriarch has a 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.260
 false antenna are put to analyze 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.150
 or draw their conclusions that the only 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.730
 power to control is from the gentleman 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.100
 missing but missing three good 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.930
 they were referring to saga and sura says but saga 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.420
 He died when they fought against tears 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.610
 after this series realizes this 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.200
 and he gets angry and Aphrodite has the bad 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.600
 lucky to go through the temple of 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.660
 patriarch and saga throws to aphrodite of 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.280
 piscis through the window and he kills guatafán 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.470
 but what the fuck how can I die a 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.570
 golden saint that way really that 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.060
 this last half is a disaster because 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.250
 they skipped many battles me what is 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.020
 woman also dies camus dies 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.510
 Aphrodite dies in a very 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.460
 stupid why the hell does he swear he does not die and 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.260
 instead he remains alive and the 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.940
 battle at the end against saga this 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.190
 becoming a kind of 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.290
 monster with the help of the armor of 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.960
 Sagittarius seville manages to defeat him and 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.360
 final saga dies in short movie 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.370
 delay one hour with 30 minutes time 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.260
 limit of a movie in the cinema is 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.180
 only three hours without more because 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.160
 they made a film so short with so 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.200
 good effects the truth is that I 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.120
 I'm disappointed with that half of the half 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.100
 in the end when they could do something 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.760
 it's better as if they had reached the 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.230
 half 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.030
 then they left the address of the 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.310
 movie to someone who does not have even the 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.560
 more fucking idea of ​​what saint seiya or 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.450
 the 12 houses or I do not know but I've been 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.670
 looking for explanations but not the 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.950
 I find that it crossed their minds 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.960
 and where was the feeling because what 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.150
 what I see there is not it does not give you time to 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.130
 earn that love of the characters by 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.260
 lack of good time that's what 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.210
 I think about the movie I would like to know 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.430
 your comments leave it here below 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.740
 to then talk about this thanks for 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.750
 watch the video then upload the video 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.940
 full of the movie but it's that the 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.980
 true the Japanese version has not yet 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.230
 come out and that already has a lot of time 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.180
 have been released while the 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.490
 Latin version is only cinema because 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.440
 He has very little time but I'll keep going 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.480
 pending to see if I find it 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.280
