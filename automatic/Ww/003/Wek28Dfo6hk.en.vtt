00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.159 
the stats on the cards they have no
symbol<00:05:20.640> and<00:05:20.760> are<00:05:20.880> just<00:05:21.090> colored<00:05:21.390> circles<00:05:21.870> and

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
symbol and are just colored circles and

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.320 
symbol and are just colored circles and
most<00:05:22.650> of<00:05:22.800> them<00:05:22.919> are<00:05:23.070> purple<00:05:23.430> this<00:05:24.060> gets

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
most of them are purple this gets

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.560 
most of them are purple this gets
confusing<00:05:24.930> for<00:05:25.290> new<00:05:25.380> players<00:05:26.000> not<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.030> mention

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
confusing for new players not to mention

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.690 
confusing for new players not to mention
that<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.840> XP<00:05:28.350> value<00:05:28.710> is<00:05:28.830> in<00:05:28.950> red<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.610> the

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
that the XP value is in red and that the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.990 
that the XP value is in red and that the
HP<00:05:30.210> value<00:05:30.660> is<00:05:30.840> in<00:05:31.050> purple<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.650> think<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.820> red

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
HP value is in purple I think that red

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.730 
HP value is in purple I think that red
should<00:05:33.300> always<00:05:33.540> be<00:05:33.840> associated<00:05:34.410> with<00:05:34.440> hit

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
should always be associated with hit

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.670 
should always be associated with hit
points<00:05:35.270> it's<00:05:36.270> still<00:05:36.540> a<00:05:36.570> pretty<00:05:36.870> fun<00:05:37.110> game<00:05:37.140> and

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
points it's still a pretty fun game and

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.290 
points it's still a pretty fun game and

if you like Dominion then you might like

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.730

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
yeah I grew what you said about the

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.210 
yeah I grew what you said about the
layout<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.419> cards<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:46.470> stats<00:05:46.770> are<00:05:46.980> messed

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
layout of the cards the stats are messed

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.100 
layout of the cards the stats are messed
up<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.730> confusing<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:48.510> almost<00:05:48.900> all<00:05:49.080> the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
up and confusing and almost all the

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.260 
up and confusing and almost all the
numbers<00:05:49.530> are<00:05:49.710> in<00:05:49.740> purple<00:05:50.220> I<00:05:50.430> like<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.060> fact

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
numbers are in purple I like the fact

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.430 
numbers are in purple I like the fact
that<00:05:51.390> the<00:05:51.540> game<00:05:51.660> is<00:05:51.720> different<00:05:52.200> every<00:05:52.410> time

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
that the game is different every time

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.350 
that the game is different every time
and<00:05:52.650> that<00:05:52.979> each<00:05:53.100> player<00:05:53.370> gets<00:05:53.640> a<00:05:53.729> summary<00:05:54.120> card

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
and that each player gets a summary card

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.750 
and that each player gets a summary card
but<00:05:54.900> again<00:05:55.169> just<00:05:55.530> like<00:05:55.650> in<00:05:55.830> Dominion<00:05:56.130> there

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
but again just like in Dominion there

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.340 
but again just like in Dominion there
will<00:05:56.880> be<00:05:56.910> some<00:05:57.210> cards<00:05:57.570> that<00:05:57.630> no<00:05:57.840> one<00:05:58.020> will<00:05:58.169> ever

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
will be some cards that no one will ever

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.560 
will be some cards that no one will ever

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880
