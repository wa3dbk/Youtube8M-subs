pretty<00:00:40.320> much<00:00:40.410> all<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.739> used<00:00:41.160> except<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
pretty much all I used except for a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.860 
pretty much all I used except for a
little<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.180> bling<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.440> flowers<00:00:43.920> and
