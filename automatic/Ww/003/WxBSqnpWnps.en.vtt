the<00:03:41.730> chance<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:42.930> something<00:03:43.350> different

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
the chance to to do something different

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.410 
the chance to to do something different
yeah<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.459> other<00:03:44.609> thing<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.790> was<00:03:45.000> good<00:03:45.269> that

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
yeah the other thing that was good that

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.630 
yeah the other thing that was good that
I<00:03:45.959> don't<00:03:46.769> this<00:03:46.859> is<00:03:46.980> unique<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.250> where<00:03:47.459> they're

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
I don't this is unique to where they're

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.789 
I don't this is unique to where they're
not<00:03:47.820> but<00:03:48.090> even<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.660> day<00:03:48.810> school<00:03:49.049> students<00:03:49.620> in
