00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
see it's reading empty right now

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.420 
see it's reading empty right now
obviously<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.110> brand<00:00:55.320> new<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:56.039> controls

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
obviously it's brand new the controls

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.950 
obviously it's brand new the controls
are<00:00:56.579> pretty<00:00:56.610> simple<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> on/off

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
are pretty simple you have the on/off

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.520 
are pretty simple you have the on/off
the<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:59.219> switch<00:00:59.430> doesn't<00:00:59.879> turn<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:01.020> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the on switch doesn't turn it on but it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
the on switch doesn't turn it on but it
allows<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> start<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.270> you're

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
allows you to start it and when you're

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
allows you to start it and when you're
done<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.960> flip<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.409> off<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.979> will

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
done then you flip it to off and it will

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.609 
done then you flip it to off and it will
shut<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:05.330> make<00:01:06.330> sure<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.170> regular

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
shut down make sure that is a regular

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.580 
shut down make sure that is a regular

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
car plug 12 volts then you have some

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
car plug 12 volts then you have some
reset<00:01:11.310> switches<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.060> circuit<00:01:12.270> breakers<00:01:12.810> and

have a heavy-duty 120 240 thirty amp and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
have a heavy-duty 120 240 thirty amp and
if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.130> something<00:01:20.369> plug<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.090> one

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
if you have something plug in that one

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600 
if you have something plug in that one
you<00:01:21.659> can't<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.080> any<00:01:22.229> plugged<00:01:22.590> into<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.070> 120

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
you can't have any plugged into the 120

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.660 
you can't have any plugged into the 120
it's<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.360> either-or<00:01:24.920> then<00:01:25.920> lastly<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it's in either-or then lastly you see a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's in either-or then lastly you see a
little<00:01:26.759> screw<00:01:27.210> sticking<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.229> for

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
little screw sticking out that is for

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.039 
little screw sticking out that is for
grounding<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.790> you'd<00:01:29.970> run<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> copper<00:01:30.780> wire<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
grounding so you'd run a copper wire to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.929 
grounding so you'd run a copper wire to
a<00:01:31.409> stake<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.920> drive<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> into<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> ground

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
a stake and drive it into the ground

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.749 
a stake and drive it into the ground
just<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.689> safety<00:01:34.189> here<00:01:35.189> we're<00:01:35.340> looking<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
just for safety here we're looking at it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.710 
just for safety here we're looking at it
from<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.030> side<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.860> has<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.220> air<00:01:39.210> filter

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
from the side it has the air filter

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
from the side it has the air filter
there<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.829> intake<00:01:41.750> that's<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.020> fuel<00:01:43.530> valve

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
there the intake that's the fuel valve

there the intake that's the fuel valve
pull<00:01:45.119> them<00:01:45.329> off<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> on

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
pull them off right now it's in the on

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.160 
pull them off right now it's in the on
position<00:01:47.060> then<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.119> tip<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> generator<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
position then I tip the generator on the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.590 
position then I tip the generator on the
side<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.460> allows<00:01:50.700> me<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.939> take<00:01:51.299> off<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
side and it allows me to take off the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.130 
side and it allows me to take off the
mounting<00:01:51.990> brackets<00:01:52.670> these<00:01:53.670> are<00:01:53.880> put<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.960> it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
mounting brackets these are put on so it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
mounting brackets these are put on so it
just<00:01:55.409> protects<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.890> turn<00:01:56.100> shipping<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.759> that's

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
just protects it turn shipping so that's

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.510 
just protects it turn shipping so that's
four<00:01:57.600> bolts<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.219> off<00:01:59.340> this

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
four bolts and then it can get off this

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.750 
four bolts and then it can get off this
yellow<00:01:59.729> piece

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
yellow piece

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.670 
yellow piece
we<00:02:01.360> get<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:01.570> bolts<00:02:01.810> off<00:02:01.930> use<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.380> wrenches

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
we get the bolts off use the wrenches

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.550 
we get the bolts off use the wrenches
that<00:02:02.740> they<00:02:02.950> gave<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.220> in<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.400> tool<00:02:03.610> bag<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
that they gave you in the tool bag and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.050 
that they gave you in the tool bag and
then<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:05.710> unbolt<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.280> rubber<00:02:06.640> shipping

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
then you unbolt this rubber shipping

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.040 
then you unbolt this rubber shipping
support<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.660> then<00:02:08.200> that's<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:13.050> looking

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
support and then that's it looking

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.980 
support and then that's it looking
underneath<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.680> can<00:02:14.830> see<00:02:15.010> here<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.730> oil

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
underneath you can see here is the oil

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.890 
underneath you can see here is the oil
cap<00:02:17.760> allows<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.060> put<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.330> oil<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:19.690> there

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
cap allows you to put the oil in there

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.870 
cap allows you to put the oil in there
if<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.710> need<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.980> drain<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.310> oil<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.700> can

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
if you need to drain the oil you can

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.630 
if you need to drain the oil you can
unscrew<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.420> bolt<00:02:22.740> I'm<00:02:23.740> getting<00:02:24.340> ready<00:02:24.520> to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
unscrew this bolt I'm getting ready to

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.070 
unscrew this bolt I'm getting ready to
put<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.970> oil<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.300> I'm<00:02:25.360> laying<00:02:25.570> down<00:02:25.630> rag

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
put in the oil so I'm laying down rag

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.260 
put in the oil so I'm laying down rag
because<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:27.100> fill<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.460> up<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.700> let<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:27.910> level

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
because you fill it up and let it level

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.090 
because you fill it up and let it level
off<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.630> it's<00:02:28.750> going<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:28.990> drip<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.650> bit<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
off so it's going to drip a bit on the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.970 
off so it's going to drip a bit on the
ground<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.450> oil<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.990> put<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.620> just

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
ground and the oil you put in is just

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.910 
ground and the oil you put in is just
regular<00:02:33.280> car<00:02:33.670> motor<00:02:33.940> oil<00:02:34.210> I'm<00:02:34.990> using<00:02:35.140> 10w30

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
regular car motor oil I'm using 10w30

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.300 
regular car motor oil I'm using 10w30
and<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.420> manual<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.840> can<00:02:37.900> see<00:02:38.200> what<00:02:38.590> kind

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and in the manual you can see what kind

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.220 
and in the manual you can see what kind
of<00:02:39.430> oil<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.850> need<00:02:40.000> for<00:02:40.360> your<00:02:40.510> area

three-quarters of a quart to fill it up
first<00:02:47.980> thing<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.280> do<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.550> Ram<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.060> hose<00:02:49.240> in

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
first thing you do is Ram the hose in

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.720 
first thing you do is Ram the hose in
get<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.710> pretty<00:02:50.920> far<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.190> make<00:02:51.370> sure<00:02:51.610> it's

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
get it in pretty far to make sure it's

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.230 
get it in pretty far to make sure it's
secure<00:02:53.070> then<00:02:54.070> pour<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> oil<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.970> will<00:02:55.030> take

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
secure then pour in the oil it will take

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.450 
secure then pour in the oil it will take
a<00:02:55.270> while<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.110> drain<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.680> once<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.040> see<00:03:00.280> it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
a while to drain in and once you see it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.950 
a while to drain in and once you see it
pooling<00:03:01.120> at<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.330> bottom<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.750> hose<00:03:01.930> and

pooling at the bottom of the hose and
not<00:03:02.230> filling<00:03:02.530> up<00:03:02.590> anymore<00:03:03.060> pull<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.180> out<00:03:04.330> and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
not filling up anymore pull it out and

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.430 
not filling up anymore pull it out and
then<00:03:04.690> let<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.080> overflow<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.890> spill<00:03:06.070> out<00:03:06.100> I

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
then let the overflow just spill out I

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.600 
then let the overflow just spill out I
try<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.500> catch<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.800> with<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.950> dustpan<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.400> got

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
try to catch it with a dustpan and got

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.250 
try to catch it with a dustpan and got
most<00:03:09.820> of<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.390> still<00:03:10.720> got<00:03:10.930> some<00:03:11.080> on<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
most of it but I still got some on the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.730 
most of it but I still got some on the

position then you need the choke in the
start<00:03:47.170> position<00:03:47.640> then<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:49.030> flip<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.510> switch

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
start position then you flip the switch

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.760 
start position then you flip the switch
on<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.610> then<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.700> can<00:03:51.850> pull<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.120> starter<00:03:52.770> for

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
on and then you can pull the starter for

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.290 
on and then you can pull the starter for
some<00:03:53.920> reason<00:03:54.280> mine<00:03:54.430> doesn't<00:03:54.640> work<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:55.060> well

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
some reason mine doesn't work that well

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.270 
some reason mine doesn't work that well
like<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.510> if<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.930> put<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.560> choke<00:03:56.830> in<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.010> on

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
like that if I put the choke in the on

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:07.000 
like that if I put the choke in the on
position<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.810> can<00:03:58.930> see<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.140> starts<00:03:59.380> right<00:03:59.530> up

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.990 

so<00:04:08.010> now<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.160> thought<00:04:08.340> it'd<00:04:08.490> be<00:04:08.520> interesting<00:04:08.670> to

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
so now I thought it'd be interesting to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.610 
so now I thought it'd be interesting to
do<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.210> noise<00:04:09.480> comparison<00:04:10.080> this<00:04:10.170> generator

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
do a noise comparison this generator

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.230 
do a noise comparison this generator
really<00:04:10.980> isn't<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.370> loud<00:04:11.610> it's<00:04:11.910> not<00:04:12.060> much

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
really isn't that loud it's not much

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.810 
really isn't that loud it's not much
different<00:04:12.270> than<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.690> lawnmower<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.820> recorded

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
different than a lawnmower I recorded

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:36.570 
different than a lawnmower I recorded
both<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.240> you<00:04:15.300> can<00:04:15.450> hear<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.750> difference

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.399 

I<00:04:39.210> thought<00:04:40.210> I'd<00:04:40.389> test<00:04:40.629> the<00:04:40.810> current<00:04:41.139> that<00:04:41.229> it's

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
I thought I'd test the current that it's

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.230 
I thought I'd test the current that it's
produced<00:04:41.770> since<00:04:42.009> I<00:04:42.129> hooked<00:04:42.340> up<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.639> multimeter

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
produced since I hooked up a multimeter

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.360 
produced since I hooked up a multimeter
here<00:04:43.599> and<00:04:43.840> it's<00:04:44.289> reading<00:04:44.849> 117<00:04:45.849> volts<00:04:46.629> which<00:04:47.080> is

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
here and it's reading 117 volts which is

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.860 
here and it's reading 117 volts which is
well<00:04:48.370> within<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.849> range<00:04:49.030> it's<00:04:49.330> really<00:04:49.689> nice

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
well within the range it's really nice

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.020 
well within the range it's really nice
and<00:04:50.139> clean<00:04:50.289> it's<00:04:50.650> not<00:04:50.830> fluctuating<00:04:51.699> up<00:04:51.819> and

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
and clean it's not fluctuating up and

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.929 
and clean it's not fluctuating up and
down<00:04:52.210> so<00:04:53.110> looks<00:04:53.590> pretty<00:04:53.830> good<00:04:53.979> so<00:04:56.939> you're

00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:57.939 
down so looks pretty good so you're

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.490 
down so looks pretty good so you're
supposed<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.240> let<00:04:58.449> this<00:04:58.599> run<00:04:58.810> for<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:59.110> while<00:04:59.229> to

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
supposed to let this run for a while to

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.679 
supposed to let this run for a while to
let<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.740> break<00:04:59.979> in<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:01.060> tried<00:05:01.389> it<00:05:01.509> out<00:05:01.629> I

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.689 
let it break in and I tried it out I

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:03.570 
let it break in and I tried it out I
found<00:05:02.020> no<00:05:02.259> problems<00:05:02.560> with<00:05:02.919> it<00:05:03.069> it<00:05:03.250> started

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
found no problems with it it started

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.379 
found no problems with it it started
perfectly

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
perfectly

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.920 
perfectly
it<00:05:05.020> ran<00:05:05.229> nicely<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:05.800> was<00:05:05.949> quiet<00:05:06.699> I<00:05:06.900> liked<00:05:07.900> a

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
it ran nicely it was quiet I liked a

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.570 
it ran nicely it was quiet I liked a
small<00:05:08.319> generator<00:05:08.710> because<00:05:09.159> it<00:05:09.280> doesn't<00:05:09.520> use

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
small generator because it doesn't use

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.939 
small generator because it doesn't use
much<00:05:09.940> gas<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.080> if<00:05:11.199> I'm<00:05:11.379> using<00:05:11.530> this<00:05:11.770> in

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
much gas and if I'm using this in

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.700 
much gas and if I'm using this in
emergency<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.460> don't<00:05:12.639> want<00:05:12.849> a<00:05:13.030> big<00:05:13.440> generator<00:05:14.440> I

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
emergency I don't want a big generator I

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.010 
emergency I don't want a big generator I
just<00:05:15.039> want<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.370> keep<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.479> fridge<00:05:16.659> running

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
just want to keep the fridge running

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.809 
just want to keep the fridge running
maybe<00:05:17.139> cook<00:05:17.469> something<00:05:17.740> get<00:05:18.370> a<00:05:18.400> little<00:05:18.610> heat

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
maybe cook something get a little heat

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.969 
maybe cook something get a little heat
maybe<00:05:19.030> charge<00:05:19.330> some<00:05:19.599> computer<00:05:20.440> or<00:05:20.590> cell<00:05:20.800> phone

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
maybe charge some computer or cell phone

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.010 
maybe charge some computer or cell phone
batteries<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:21.460> then<00:05:21.550> shut<00:05:21.759> it<00:05:21.789> back<00:05:22.030> down<00:05:22.270> so

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
batteries and then shut it back down so

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.100 
batteries and then shut it back down so
I<00:05:23.490> almost<00:05:24.490> bought<00:05:24.819> one<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.270> was<00:05:25.840> a<00:05:25.870> lot<00:05:26.080> more

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
I almost bought one that was a lot more

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.619 
I almost bought one that was a lot more
powerful<00:05:26.710> but<00:05:26.919> it's<00:05:27.460> really<00:05:27.819> just<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.300> get

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:28.629 
powerful but it's really just to get

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.189 
powerful but it's really just to get
through<00:05:29.139> an<00:05:29.919> emergency<00:05:30.190> not<00:05:31.029> to<00:05:31.270> live<00:05:31.509> nicely

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
through an emergency not to live nicely

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.260 
through an emergency not to live nicely
through<00:05:32.889> an<00:05:33.009> emergency<00:05:33.219> now<00:05:33.909> I<00:05:33.940> plan<00:05:34.210> on

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
through an emergency now I plan on

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.360 
through an emergency now I plan on
storing<00:05:34.900> this<00:05:35.020> generator<00:05:35.590> and<00:05:35.770> only<00:05:35.949> using<00:05:36.279> it

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
storing this generator and only using it

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.309 
storing this generator and only using it
in<00:05:36.580> an<00:05:36.699> emergency<00:05:37.150> so<00:05:37.569> I'm<00:05:37.779> going<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.020> get<00:05:38.169> all

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
in an emergency so I'm going to get all

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.110 
in an emergency so I'm going to get all
the<00:05:38.439> fuel<00:05:38.710> out<00:05:38.889> and<00:05:39.099> to<00:05:39.219> do<00:05:39.370> that<00:05:39.550> let<00:05:39.849> me<00:05:39.939> turn

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
the fuel out and to do that let me turn

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.640 
the fuel out and to do that let me turn
off<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.360> fuel<00:05:40.779> valve<00:05:40.930> while<00:05:41.259> it's<00:05:41.469> running

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
off the fuel valve while it's running

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.980 
off the fuel valve while it's running
and<00:05:41.949> it'll<00:05:42.639> use<00:05:42.819> up<00:05:43.000> whatever's<00:05:43.419> left<00:05:43.719> in<00:05:43.900> the

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
and it'll use up whatever's left in the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.350 
and it'll use up whatever's left in the
hose<00:05:44.199> and<00:05:44.590> in<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:44.830> carburetor<00:05:45.099> and<00:05:45.909> burn<00:05:46.210> it

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
hose and in the carburetor and burn it

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.779 
hose and in the carburetor and burn it
all<00:05:46.479> up<00:05:46.509> and<00:05:47.229> you'll<00:05:47.529> see<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.770> engine<00:05:48.520> start

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
all up and you'll see the engine start

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.279 
all up and you'll see the engine start
to<00:05:48.879> sputter<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.360> sputter<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:50.020> you're<00:05:50.110> going

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
to sputter and sputter and you're going

00:05:50.289 --> 00:06:02.420 
to sputter and sputter and you're going
to<00:05:50.349> stop

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.390 

then<00:06:03.430> I'm<00:06:03.850> going<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.180> disconnect<00:06:04.480> the<00:06:05.170> hose

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
then I'm going to disconnect the hose

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.650 
then I'm going to disconnect the hose
right<00:06:06.400> here<00:06:06.700> by<00:06:06.850> pinching<00:06:07.270> these<00:06:07.420> little

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
right here by pinching these little

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.120 
right here by pinching these little
wires<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:09.490> I<00:06:09.550> can<00:06:09.700> pull<00:06:09.880> the<00:06:09.970> hose<00:06:10.150> off<00:06:11.130> then

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
wires and I can pull the hose off then

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.860 
wires and I can pull the hose off then
I'm<00:06:12.280> going<00:06:12.430> to<00:06:12.460> attach<00:06:12.820> a<00:06:13.000> straw<00:06:13.240> or<00:06:13.600> another

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
I'm going to attach a straw or another
