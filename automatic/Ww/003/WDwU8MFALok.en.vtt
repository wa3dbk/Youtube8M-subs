00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello what a pleasure to be coinciding 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.069
 new with you and then today to 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.069
 request of a user out there we go to 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.320
 to present you this video tutorial on 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.800
 basic animation but very basic in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 flash let's make a banner a banner 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.700
 of 900% pixels is we are here with the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 timeline and we have here we are going to 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.290
 modify through the properties of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.160
 document to make the banner and 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.610
 be able to cheer I repeat very basic 900 by 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.610
 one hundred 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.100
 it is very important to work in layers here 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.620
 in flash to have ordered all 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.110
 our documents and if we have the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.120
 banner and the document then if we want 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.610
 change the color or we're going to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.690
 put someone to change the name of the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.690
 dad number 1 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.440
 If you want to put an image, let's 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.340
 import the library we will search 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.970
 one around here I have a 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.980
 but here is this is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.530
 we're going to bring her to the library we're going 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.760
 to library windows and we're going to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.940
 drag the image 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:32.680
 to the work scenario in this way 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:36.660
 with rosita with pretty rosita and we are going to 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.010
 adjust with you can see adjust 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.670
 here we already have the image about 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.670
 document 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.810
 we are going to add a new layer for the 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.320
 text text let's go 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.280
 to the text tool 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.289
 we have here the background and another layer 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.140
 if you want we are going to put here a 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:12.819
 filter the text to show us 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.250
 Then another image of this text 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.680
 you can add whatever you want 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.140
 how many layers of text do you want or 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.910
 of images depends on what you are 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.560
 Searching depends on your creativity 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.540
 also remember what is always 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.540
 important to work in capacity 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.140
 we go here in frame 90 in both 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.930
 layers to insert a keyframe to 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.599
 that allows me to generate a 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:51.900
 animation with the reproductive head of 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.650
 this way for the first frame of 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.390
 the text layer here we can see when 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.819
 the frame is black and contains 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.030
 information 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.069
 first with the secondary button we go 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.939
 to create a motion interpolation 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.879
 and change the color layer and here is 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.980
 where we can start working already in 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.989
 throughout the 90 frames a 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.739
 small in a small displacement of 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.139
 this text and you select a 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.609
 10 to 15 to 20 25 what you 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.930
 you want and do the tour and here already 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.310
 is a keyframe or a 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.799
 information is this another 20 frames 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.650
 and if you want we are going to apply the 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.460
 transformation tool to do 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.210
 this 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.830
 How are you 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.470
 with scroll more 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.820
 and here we have this so it goes 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.180
 another 20 may be I repeat it every 10 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.040
 every 15 what you want and we do 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.750
 also that of a small turn and 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.340
 we follow but now control painted for 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.340
 see how the animation is going 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.340
 and we have it 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.209
 it's not too rough we're going to try to 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.669
 soften a little you can pass all the 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.389
 as long as you want until you manage to give 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.999
 with that animation that you want 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.259
 It's a matter of time and patience 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:27.259
 first of all 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.530
 We are gonna give 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.530
 to see this 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.070
 like another liter 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:50.689
 although it has a jump there but good 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:52.189
 with suppose you want it to stop or 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.770
 that is not rewinding the 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:57.100
 movie 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.090
 you have to program a stop 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.650
 for that you have to add a layer 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.650
 add a layer 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.990
 actions actions 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.990
 actions is 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:19.330
 and we already have one more layer of actions 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:21.849
 we will schedule you and make a high that 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.559
 stop that discussion there is my dog 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.559
 nothing that is here that comes to see me 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.190
 we select the frame we are going to 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:39.610
 windows actions 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.610
 and here we are going to write stop stop 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:46.599
 I open and close parentheses and semicolons 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.490
 and ready let's give an intro control 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.510
 to see how 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.540
 how's it going 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.870
 how is the animation with already with the 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.870
 stop 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.810
 and comes to the jump there is 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.949
 that's all is very simple is the most 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:09.370
 basic of the basics so I thank you 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:11.500
 your attention and we will continue with more 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.419
 flash issues and thank you very much 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.419
 from dreamweaver very friendly
