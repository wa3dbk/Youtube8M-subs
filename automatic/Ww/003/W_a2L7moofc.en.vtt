00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:57.070
 Even if there are no playground crowds or there are a lot of purpose troubles, 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:03.730
 It's a living thing.

 That's what happens. 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:33.129
 Without comparing with others 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.269
 Things get a little overwhelming yourself so you can really appreciate the wet look back 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.430
