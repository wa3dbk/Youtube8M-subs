00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.830
 alcohol and driving a vehicle 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.920
 are incompatible alcohol alters the 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.610
 ability to focus judgment and 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.100
 reaction 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.780
 the driver will get tired faster and 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.140
 will sometimes behave 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.150
 presumptuous and reckless it's good 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.280
 because a drunk driver represents 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.710
 a danger not only for himself 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.260
 but also for other users 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.980
 that the police often organize 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.980
 alcohol checks 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.260
 anyone who drives is getting ready 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.870
 to drive a vehicle or a mount 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.879
 in a public place may be subject to 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.190
 a blood alcohol test 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.760
 so this includes cyclists and 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.130
 riders 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.079
 the auto school monitor or 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.800
 the coach can also be 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.140
 controlled 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.860
 just like the alleged perpetrator of a 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.050
 accident even if it is a pedestrian 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.690
 passengers or a sleeper 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.310
 in his car or pedestrians will only 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.310
 not subject to a blood alcohol test 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.020
 at a 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.790
 dallennes the police officer you 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.060
 will ask to blow for a few 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.950
 seconds in the tip of the device 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.460
 you can perfectly requested a 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.810
 unique delay of fifteen minutes 6 1 s 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.910
 appears on the screen 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.160
 so everything is fine and you can 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.190
 continue your journey 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:39.540
 the two-alarm letter means that 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:44.159
 you probably have between 0.22 and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.249
 0.35 mg of alcohol per liter of exhaled air 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.049
 while the letter p of positive indicates 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:53.969
 that you probably have a 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.829
 concentration of 0.35 mg or more in 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.069
 the last two cases you will be subject 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.770
 to a breath test if you blow 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.869
 deliberately wrong or you refuse to 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.369
 blow you will have to hand over your 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.369
 allowed for six hours 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.880
 alice of the wool that you can not 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.340
 refuse you must also blown 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.260
 in the tip of a device 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.030
 after a few moments the camera a 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.060
 premium result 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.830
 if you have less than 0.22 mg of alcohol 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.910
 per liter of expired air 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.980
 you can continue your journey 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.140
 if you have between 0.22 and 0.35 mg 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.710
 you must surrender your license 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.490
 drive for three hours 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.370
 if the result is 0.35 or more 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.770
 it's six hours after which you 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.280
 will be submitted a new test or analysis 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.280
 wool 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.780
 when a breath test or 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.030
 wool analysis is impossible by 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.040
 example when the driver has been 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.420
 taken to the hospital we will make him a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.510
 blood sample 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.270
 if the driver is asthmatic or is 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.430
 for example too drunk to blow it 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.930
 may be submitted ex officio 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.849
 sanguine 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.280
 he's not a police officer but a 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.739
 doctor who will take the sample of 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.689
 blood during a saliva test one 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.480
 ask you to collect your saliva 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:27.230
 using a cotton swab to be able to 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.299
 measure the amount of drugs present 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.930
 if the result excess of value 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.760
 authorized 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.030
 you must surrender your license 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.430
 drive for 12 hours besides those 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.739
 who commit this offense exposes himself 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.099
 to a driving ban of five 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.099
 maximum years 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.110
 the drug combination with 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.890
 alcohol is of course more serious than 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.380
 only alcohol 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.680
 some drugs already have effects 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.079
 harmful to driving 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.079
 alcohol will make them even worse
