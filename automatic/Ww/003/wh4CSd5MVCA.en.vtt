too sure why here's my go-to dump

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.710 
too sure why here's my go-to dump
package<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.250> sprite<00:01:47.549> zero<00:01:47.579> gravity<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.570> not

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
package the sprite zero gravity it's not

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.020 
package the sprite zero gravity it's not
impressive<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> locker<00:01:50.369> cold<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.970> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
impressive but it was a locker cold so I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580

figure<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> might<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:51.869> use<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
figure I might as well use it
