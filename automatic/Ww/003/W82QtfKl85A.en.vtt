00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
game I was that bored because I just I

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.770 
game I was that bored because I just I
just<00:04:02.610> get<00:04:02.909> so<00:04:03.090> bored<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.480> game<00:04:03.750> and

just get so bored of that game and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.199 
just get so bored of that game and
snagging<00:04:04.769> on<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:04.950> games<00:04:05.129> even<00:04:05.340> more<00:04:05.610> boring<00:04:05.879> I

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
snagging on the games even more boring I

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.630 
snagging on the games even more boring I
think<00:04:07.079> it's<00:04:07.200> just<00:04:07.319> cuz<00:04:07.590> it's<00:04:07.769> there's<00:04:08.489> no

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
think it's just cuz it's there's no

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.899 
think it's just cuz it's there's no
challenge<00:04:08.909> to<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:10.129> because<00:04:11.129> it's<00:04:11.280> coasting<00:04:11.730> so

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
challenge to it because it's coasting so

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.140 
challenge to it because it's coasting so
fast<00:04:12.239> it's<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:13.739> know<00:04:13.890> because<00:04:14.760> I've<00:04:14.970> got

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
fast it's just you know because I've got

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.449 
fast it's just you know because I've got
used<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:16.709> just<00:04:16.769> not<00:04:16.949> not

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
used to it it's just not not

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.460 
used to it it's just not not
entertaining<00:04:17.910> anymore<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:19.049> think<00:04:19.229> that's

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
entertaining anymore so I think that's

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.680 
entertaining anymore so I think that's
why<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.650> don't<00:04:19.949> enjoy<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.370> game<00:04:20.660> anymore<00:04:21.660> but
