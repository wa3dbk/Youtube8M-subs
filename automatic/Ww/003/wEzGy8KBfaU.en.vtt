00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
three of these a day so probably four of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.880 
three of these a day so probably four of
the<00:01:14.850> greens<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> fill<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.650> up

the greens so you get to fill this up

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.730 
the greens so you get to fill this up
and<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:18.210> may<00:01:18.360> look<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.500> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and it may look little to you but you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.940 
and it may look little to you but you
can<00:01:20.189> fit<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> lot<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.810> definitely<00:01:22.470> will

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
can fit a lot in here I definitely will

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.330 
can fit a lot in here I definitely will
not<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:23.490> hungry<00:01:23.810> at<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.009> plenty

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
not go hungry at all of there was plenty

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.830 
not go hungry at all of there was plenty
of<00:01:26.520> times<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.970> was<00:01:27.150> thinking<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.630> actually

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
of times that I was thinking I actually

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.870 
of times that I was thinking I actually
couldn't<00:01:28.229> eat<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.619> much<00:01:28.799> food<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.369> needed<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
couldn't eat as much food as I needed to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.390 
couldn't eat as much food as I needed to
per<00:01:30.329> day<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.799> definitely<00:01:32.040> won't<00:01:32.280> be

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
per day so you definitely won't be

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.960 
per day so you definitely won't be
hungry<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:34.070> your<00:01:35.070> Purple's<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:35.850> your

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
hungry and your Purple's are for your

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
hungry and your Purple's are for your
fruits<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.470> reds<00:01:37.770> or<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.310> your

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
fruits and then your reds or for your

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.179 
fruits and then your reds or for your
protein<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.450> again<00:01:40.049> they're<00:01:40.470> nice<00:01:40.710> sized

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
protein so again they're nice sized

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.030 
protein so again they're nice sized
portion<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.079> you'll<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.259> multiples<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.860> them

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
portion and you'll get multiples of them

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.630 
portion and you'll get multiples of them
every<00:01:44.490> day<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.840> typical<00:01:46.350> breakfast<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.430> me

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
every day so a typical breakfast for me

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.870 
every day so a typical breakfast for me
