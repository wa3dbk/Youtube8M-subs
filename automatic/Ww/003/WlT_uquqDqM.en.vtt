hi<00:00:01.350> and<00:00:01.650> welcome<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.310> another<00:00:02.520> five<00:00:02.939> minute

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hi and welcome to another five minute

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.690 
hi and welcome to another five minute
tip<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:04.650> tip<00:00:04.710> we're<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.430> look<00:00:05.549> at

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
tip in this tip we're going to look at

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.200 
tip in this tip we're going to look at
the<00:00:05.850> array<00:00:06.270> object<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.790> sort<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.940> little

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
the array object and sort of a little

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.660 
the array object and sort of a little
trick<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.260> figured<00:00:10.740> out<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.130> how<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.370> work

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
trick that I figured out on how to work

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.490 
trick that I figured out on how to work
with<00:00:11.880> objects<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.599> little<00:00:12.840> bit<00:00:12.960> more<00:00:13.170> easily

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
with objects a little bit more easily

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.300 
with objects a little bit more easily
when<00:00:14.009> using<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.580> array<00:00:14.880> object<00:00:15.470> so<00:00:16.470> typically

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
when using the array object so typically

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.670 
when using the array object so typically
we<00:00:17.820> use<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> array<00:00:18.390> object<00:00:18.869> by<00:00:19.080> creating<00:00:19.560> an

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
we use the array object by creating an

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.750 
we use the array object by creating an
array<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.789> then<00:00:21.029> maybe<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.020> cylinder<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.800> then

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
array and then maybe a cylinder and then

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.970 
array and then maybe a cylinder and then
to<00:00:24.000> activate<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.960> place<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.470> cylinder

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
to activate it you place the cylinder

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.419 
to activate it you place the cylinder
inside<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> array<00:00:27.650> this<00:00:28.650> allows<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
inside of the array this allows you to

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.209 
inside of the array this allows you to
do<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> lot<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.689> interesting<00:00:31.170> things<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
do a lot of interesting things but it

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.790 
do a lot of interesting things but it
kind<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.669> takes<00:00:33.059> some<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.020> control<00:00:34.500> away

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
kind of takes some of the control away

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.450 
kind of takes some of the control away
from<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> mean<00:00:36.390> by<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:37.219> well<00:00:38.219> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
from you what I mean by that is well I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.690 
from you what I mean by that is well I
can<00:00:38.579> still<00:00:39.410> into<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> Follette<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> fillet<00:00:41.670> on

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
can still into a Follette or a fillet on

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.869 
can still into a Follette or a fillet on
the<00:00:41.969> Cape's<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.950> still<00:00:44.250> use<00:00:44.640> these

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the Cape's here I can still use these

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.029 
the Cape's here I can still use these
handles<00:00:45.329> interactively<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.559> adjust<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
handles interactively to adjust the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.590 
handles interactively to adjust the
height<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.570> object<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.129> no<00:00:50.280> longer

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
height of the object but I can no longer

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.470 
height of the object but I can no longer
rotate<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.989> cylinder<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:54.180> doesn't

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
rotate the cylinder that that doesn't

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
rotate the cylinder that that doesn't
work<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.050> doesn't<00:00:55.079> work<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> move<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
work it doesn't work when I move the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.849 
work it doesn't work when I move the
cylinder<00:00:56.280> either<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.199> due<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
cylinder either and this is just due to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.709 
cylinder either and this is just due to
the<00:00:59.070> nature<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.699> way<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.879> array<00:01:00.270> object

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the nature of the way the array object

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
the nature of the way the array object
works<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.410> doesn't<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:02.010> care<00:01:02.520> what<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
works it doesn't really care what the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.690 
works it doesn't really care what the
coordinates<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> cylinder<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.369> just

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
coordinates of the cylinder are it just

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
coordinates of the cylinder are it just
cares<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> attributes<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
cares with the attributes of the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.179 
cares with the attributes of the
cylinder<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.830> really<00:01:10.830> wanted<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
cylinder are so if you really wanted to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.920 
cylinder are so if you really wanted to
move<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> cylinder<00:01:11.939> around<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.540> could

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
move the cylinder around you could

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.130 
move the cylinder around you could
convert<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> an<00:01:13.830> editable<00:01:13.979> object<00:01:15.140> choose

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
convert it to an editable object choose

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.080 
convert it to an editable object choose
access<00:01:16.710> mode<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.939> move<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
access mode and then move it like that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.789 
access mode and then move it like that
but<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> way<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> array<00:01:21.900> object<00:01:22.350> really

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
but the way the array object really

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.340 
but the way the array object really
wants<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.130> move<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> cylinders<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.390> by

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
wants you to move the cylinders is by

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.350 
wants you to move the cylinders is by
adjusting<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> radius<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.060> works

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
adjusting the radius now this works

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.030 
adjusting the radius now this works
except<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> little<00:01:28.560> bit<00:01:28.740> fiddly

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
except it can be a little bit fiddly

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
except it can be a little bit fiddly
when<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.030> smaller<00:01:30.390> dimensions

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
when you get down to smaller dimensions

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.510 
when you get down to smaller dimensions
and<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.439> doesn't<00:01:31.710> give<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> any<00:01:31.920> control<00:01:32.490> over

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and it doesn't give you any control over

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.390 
and it doesn't give you any control over
rotation<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.930> here's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.500> simple<00:01:34.650> trick

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
rotation so here's a really simple trick

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300 
rotation so here's a really simple trick
or<00:01:35.670> technique<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> use<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.890> greater

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
or technique that I use to have greater

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.580 
or technique that I use to have greater
control<00:01:38.610> over<00:01:39.180> an<00:01:39.509> object<00:01:39.960> such<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
control over an object such as a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.170 
control over an object such as a
cylinder<00:01:41.040> when<00:01:41.820> using<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.360> array<00:01:42.630> object

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
cylinder when using the array object

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.330 
cylinder when using the array object
create<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.390> cylinder<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.340> then

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
create your cylinder and then

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
create your cylinder and then
immediately<00:01:47.759> place<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.200> null<00:01:49.439> object

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
immediately place it into a null object

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.550 
immediately place it into a null object
the<00:01:50.189> easiest<00:01:50.549> way<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.560> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the easiest way to do that is just to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.330 
the easiest way to do that is just to
group<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> under<00:01:53.909> objects<00:01:54.509> group<00:01:54.990> objects<00:01:55.439> now

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
group it under objects group objects now

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
group it under objects group objects now
we<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> null<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> cylinder<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
we have a null with a cylinder in it and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.530 
we have a null with a cylinder in it and
they<00:01:58.439> share<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.890> exact<00:01:59.399> same<00:01:59.579> coordinate

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
they share the exact same coordinate

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.859 
they share the exact same coordinate
system<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.340> we<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.729> place<00:02:02.939> our<00:02:03.090> null<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
system now we can place our null in the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.139 
system now we can place our null in the
array<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.579> we<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:05.729> still<00:02:06.030> move<00:02:06.600> our<00:02:06.780> cylinder

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
array and we can still move our cylinder

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.320 
array and we can still move our cylinder
we<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.300> even<00:02:09.450> rotate<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.560> cylinder<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.330> it

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
we can even rotate the cylinder and it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.630 
we can even rotate the cylinder and it
obeys<00:02:12.599> everything<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.200> tell<00:02:13.349> it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
obeys everything we tell it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.990 
obeys everything we tell it
do<00:02:14.650> something<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.830> might<00:02:16.310> make<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.670> even

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
do something that might make this even

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.870 
do something that might make this even
easier<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.720> work<00:02:17.870> with<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:19.310> go<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.760> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
easier to work with is to go to the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.110 
easier to work with is to go to the
array<00:02:20.150> object<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.900> set<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.770> radius<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.160> zero

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
array object and set the radius to zero

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.660 
array object and set the radius to zero
it's<00:02:24.110> going<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.319> put<00:02:24.470> everything<00:02:24.709> in<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.430> same

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
it's going to put everything in the same

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.350 
it's going to put everything in the same
spot<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.170> will<00:02:27.319> allow<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.680> to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
spot but it will allow you to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.020 
spot but it will allow you to
intuitively<00:02:29.360> move<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.959> cylinder<00:02:30.170> out<00:02:31.030> and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
intuitively move the cylinder out and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.720 
intuitively move the cylinder out and
sort<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.660> treat<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.200> cylinder<00:02:33.740> as<00:02:33.890> one<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.490> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
sort of treat the cylinder as one of the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.020 
sort of treat the cylinder as one of the
instances<00:02:35.800> now<00:02:36.800> keep<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.160> mind<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:37.610> only

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
instances now keep in mind this only

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.770 
instances now keep in mind this only
works<00:02:39.700> intuitively<00:02:40.700> if<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.209> move<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.570> out

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
works intuitively if you move it out

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.960 
works intuitively if you move it out
along<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.380> z-axis<00:02:42.680> if<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.550> move<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.880> along

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
along the z-axis if you move it along

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.500 
along the z-axis if you move it along
the<00:02:44.239> x<00:02:44.390> axis<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.920> object<00:02:46.550> that<00:02:46.760> you're

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
the x axis the object that you're

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.010 
the x axis the object that you're
controlling<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.090> wireframe<00:02:50.690> view<00:02:50.720> at

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
controlling in in the wireframe view at

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.110 
controlling in in the wireframe view at
least<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.500> not<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:52.100> same<00:02:52.310> object<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:52.820> you're

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
least is not the same object that you're

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.410 
least is not the same object that you're
modifying<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.769> yeah<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.459> move<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.880> along<00:02:55.970> on

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
modifying so yeah you move it along on

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.990 
modifying so yeah you move it along on
the<00:02:56.780> z<00:02:56.959> axis<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.590> at<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:58.519> point<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.209> can

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
the z axis and at that point you can

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.160 
the z axis and at that point you can
still<00:03:02.000> make<00:03:02.209> all<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.720> regular

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
still make all of the regular

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.130 
still make all of the regular
adjustments<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.070> it<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.690> can<00:03:06.050> rotate<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:08.140> you

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
adjustments to it you can rotate it you

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.460 
adjustments to it you can rotate it you
can<00:03:09.320> scale<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.739> move<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.989> all<00:03:12.140> kind<00:03:12.410> of

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
can scale it move it and it all kind of

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.160 
can scale it move it and it all kind of
works<00:03:12.680> pretty<00:03:13.010> intuitively<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.660> if<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.930> use

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
works pretty intuitively so if you use

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.290 
works pretty intuitively so if you use
the<00:03:15.380> array<00:03:15.650> object<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.190> lot<00:03:16.340> but<00:03:16.610> are<00:03:16.730> kind<00:03:17.090> of

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
the array object a lot but are kind of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.150 
the array object a lot but are kind of
frustrated<00:03:17.930> with<00:03:18.110> these<00:03:18.260> limitations<00:03:18.769> that

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
frustrated with these limitations that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.460 
frustrated with these limitations that
it<00:03:19.370> imposes<00:03:19.700> on<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.780> might<00:03:21.079> be<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> nice

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
it imposes on you this might be a nice

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.560 
it imposes on you this might be a nice
way<00:03:21.709> around<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.150> was<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.329> really

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
way around it so this was a really

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.020 
way around it so this was a really
simple<00:03:23.989> tip<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.440> hope<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.100> was<00:03:25.220> useful<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.850> some

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
simple tip I hope it was useful to some

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.180 
simple tip I hope it was useful to some
of<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.209> guys<00:03:26.360> out<00:03:26.570> there<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:27.049> until<00:03:28.040> next

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
of you guys out there and until next

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.780 
of you guys out there and until next
time<00:03:28.630> see<00:03:29.630> you
