00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
when we started designing him steep our

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.780 
when we started designing him steep our
starting<00:00:27.550> point<00:00:27.790> was<00:00:27.880> King<00:00:28.750> Theoden<00:00:29.640> when<00:00:30.640> he

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
starting point was King Theoden when he

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.670 
starting point was King Theoden when he
sits<00:00:31.000> on<00:00:31.149> a<00:00:31.210> horse<00:00:31.540> he<00:00:31.899> should<00:00:32.140> be<00:00:32.259> able<00:00:32.380> to

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
sits on a horse he should be able to

sits on a horse he should be able to
ride<00:00:33.010> through<00:00:33.310> the<00:00:33.550> main<00:00:33.880> gate<00:00:34.149> here<00:00:34.420> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
ride through the main gate here and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.560 
ride through the main gate here and
after<00:00:37.390> that<00:00:37.420> we<00:00:37.950> designed<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.280> main<00:00:40.120> building

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
after that we designed the main building

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.720 
after that we designed the main building
here<00:00:40.600> which<00:00:41.110> which<00:00:41.590> are<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.980> front<00:00:42.340> gate<00:00:42.550> of

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
here which which are the front gate of

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.420 
here which which are the front gate of
the<00:00:43.390> castle<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:45.060> we<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:47.620> very<00:00:47.860> focused<00:00:48.340> in

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
the castle and we was very focused in

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.980 
the castle and we was very focused in
the<00:00:48.550> beginning<00:00:48.940> of<00:00:49.060> a<00:00:49.210> high<00:00:49.390> level<00:00:49.720> of<00:00:49.810> detail

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
the beginning of a high level of detail

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.580 
the beginning of a high level of detail
and<00:00:50.380> that<00:00:50.590> is<00:00:50.710> why<00:00:50.890> we<00:00:51.160> have<00:00:51.370> put<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.780> profile

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
and that is why we have put the profile

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.940 
and that is why we have put the profile
brakes<00:00:53.920> in<00:00:54.100> here<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:55.120> moss<00:00:55.530> green<00:00:56.530> color

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
brakes in here and the moss green color

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.110 
brakes in here and the moss green color
to<00:00:57.790> really<00:00:58.090> give<00:00:58.600> this<00:00:59.230> authentic<00:00:59.980> heidi<00:01:00.820> a

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
to really give this authentic heidi a

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
to really give this authentic heidi a
level<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.750> detail<00:01:02.440> look<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:04.390> we<00:01:04.629> also<00:01:04.839> have<00:01:05.199> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
level of detail look then we also have a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.039 
level of detail look then we also have a
catapult<00:01:06.280> on<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:07.030> top<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:07.329> the<00:01:07.450> wall<00:01:07.600> here<00:01:07.869> and

like that then he can he can attack them
and<00:01:35.979> in<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.999> set<00:01:37.209> we<00:01:37.359> also<00:01:37.539> have<00:01:37.869> healthier

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
and in the set we also have healthier

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.739 
and in the set we also have healthier
who<00:01:38.889> is<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.399> leader<00:01:39.609> of<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.030> else<00:01:40.149> that<00:01:40.509> comes

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:40.749 
who is the leader of the else that comes

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:43.859 
who is the leader of the else that comes
to<00:01:40.929> a<00:01:40.959> rescue<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:41.709> he<00:01:42.490> is<00:01:42.579> exclusive<00:01:43.299> from

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
to a rescue and he is exclusive from

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.709 
to a rescue and he is exclusive from
this<00:01:44.049> set<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:44.999> after<00:01:45.999> we<00:01:46.149> have<00:01:46.299> done<00:01:46.450> this

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
this set and after we have done this

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.649 
this set and after we have done this
construction<00:01:47.319> we<00:01:48.060> thought<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.389> style

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
construction we thought that the style

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.690 
construction we thought that the style
was<00:01:49.869> looking<00:01:50.259> really<00:01:50.529> good<00:01:50.709> so<00:01:50.770> we<00:01:51.130> continued

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
was looking really good so we continued

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.999 
was looking really good so we continued
with<00:01:52.329> these<00:01:52.569> rounded<00:01:53.079> walls<00:01:53.259> over<00:01:53.590> here<00:01:53.799> which

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
with these rounded walls over here which

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.069 
with these rounded walls over here which
is<00:01:54.189> always<00:01:54.459> a<00:01:54.670> challenge<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.299> do<00:01:55.509> in<00:01:55.689> legal

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
is always a challenge to do in legal

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.269 
is always a challenge to do in legal
that<00:01:56.649> is<00:01:56.829> to<00:01:56.950> build<00:01:57.130> rounded<00:01:57.840> shapes<00:01:58.840> but<00:01:59.770> but

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.279 
that is to build rounded shapes but but

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:04.440 
that is to build rounded shapes but but
we<00:02:00.459> managed<00:02:00.849> to<00:02:01.569> do<00:02:02.529> that<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.149> then<00:02:04.149> over<00:02:04.420> here

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
we managed to do that and then over here

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.620 
we managed to do that and then over here
we<00:02:04.749> have<00:02:04.779> the<00:02:05.049> ladder<00:02:05.259> where<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.270> Euro<00:02:07.270> cars

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
we have the ladder where the Euro cars

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.600 
we have the ladder where the Euro cars
are<00:02:07.929> attacking<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.649> are<00:02:09.190> called<00:02:09.429> he's

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
are attacking and are called he's

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.309 
are attacking and are called he's
defending<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.300> when<00:02:10.479> they<00:02:10.599> come<00:02:10.810> up<00:02:10.959> here<00:02:10.990> he

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
defending so when they come up here he

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.920 
defending so when they come up here he
can<00:02:11.530> he<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.099> push<00:02:12.340> them<00:02:12.520> back<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.910> then<00:02:13.570> over

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
can he can push them back and then over

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.050 
can he can push them back and then over
here<00:02:13.960> we<00:02:14.320> have<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.710> strong<00:02:15.640> defensive<00:02:16.360> wall

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
here we have this strong defensive wall

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.780 
here we have this strong defensive wall
and<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:18.560> might<00:02:18.709> remember<00:02:18.890> from<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.490> movie
