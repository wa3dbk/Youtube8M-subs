 tried the pain and then smartly well 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.930
 sounds to beat on the arrow Alexander

 working brewed programmer against 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.840
 hockey player of course it sounds like 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.940

 will understand on the right will change 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.530
 get a little mistake 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.739
 that the programmer looks very hard 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.930
 I'll tell you yes, the programmer is different 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.030
 such a time seems better not to sleep with him 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.780
 about installing windows and alexander 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.729

 live ra feet kicking great yes 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.970
 Yesterday mistakes and quite briskly so not 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.909
 finishes down doesnâ€™t kick a lot 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.290
 scares it starts size hands already 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.750
 see the first blood in the first seconds 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.540
 programmer gives already want heat if I 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.610
 so I understand that the process has begun process 1 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.130
 edge 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.770
 There is already the first blood Pushchino guys from 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.820
 Moscow region before the battle we have as they say 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.020
 not a joke to personally blow still left 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.250
 great hitting lego here this rex he 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.750
 gets up see what he does not 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.310
 professional fighter how beautiful 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.620
 fighting to look yes there is something to see 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.500
 Looked at the bag outside the example where energy 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.360
 many more low kick shows see 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.490
 punches left-right delays 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.920
 head is certainly not very good 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.679
 spin it look it's spinning here 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.380
 that's what we see some kind of crazy 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.420
 Generally on an abscess and still blow blow for 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.910
 I will close the station with a blow and more 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.040
 more so oh guys what and 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.020
 tricky tricks and I left left hit 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.300
 right from the side that's right 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.370
 gendarme youth view more left jab 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.450
 longer arms certainly reach for 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.550
 hockey player catch 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.440
 that's what it does see the programmer 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.430
 dangerous man is not the word 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.940
 great blow science who passed grimace 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.770
 grimace appeared on the street from the hole to 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.190
 well done from not giving up still gets hit 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.810
 true in person 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.760
 look however the guy don't even try 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.940
 cling and fight work goes 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.310
 just hands what boy looks like 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.880
 of course the pain and then the border and here 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.310
 boys again why not key is to the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.570
 face raconteurs turned down on it 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.250
 volt entrenched so in the ground they generally 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.340
 I do not know what to do but nothing 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.140
 professional fighters that's fine 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.170
 hit on the head right trying 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:22.190
 finish yes doing everything right gives 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.720
 gives hockey player head yes I think they don't 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.790
 I can watch it just blood splatters 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.700
 from all sides just like alcohol in a puddle 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.160
 blood redeems the horror here they slide already 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.100
 knees in the blood well, that will finish off 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.840
 no, i think it's a matter of time 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.120
 a matter of time of course of course can 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.700
 wipe us no it doesn't help 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.670
 and here is a very bad situation 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.120
 Of course the hockey player is now pressed 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.460
 a hand 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.830
 the corps of his see what that capture and 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.470
 trying to finish with his right hand to throw here 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.260
 it's a fight look just dude argue 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.890
 imagine that he just might be trying to 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.350
 terrifying tee water but endlessly endure 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.450
 I just need time to fight 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.570
 shocked 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.120
 I'm shocked this fight will certainly pass 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:11.710
 a little of our history, our 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.900
 programs are very cool looking 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.239
 looks like a programmer should 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.590
 look like a real programmer gloves 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:25.900
 blood and while we support and heat 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.670
 our audience well what do i see broken 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.900
 nose is okay this is bruising 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:35.790
 it's ok but you just got blown away 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.160
 capillary it happens too 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:46.630
 Now be afraid to see the doctor say about 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:47.680
 the possibility of continuing this fight I see 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.000
 that's it for all of us 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.160
 programmer killer charged well probably 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.010
 plays a lot of games during business hours 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.000
 Well, what from freshened up to him 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:04.919
 nose removed extra word throws 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.919
 show t-shirts fly right-left 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:15.250
 Well, we continue the metal and calls 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.590
 bloodshed further and we see 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.800
 continuation 2 more cheerfully with maria 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.930
 wiped his nose needed now let's see 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.380
 what's the street put attempt 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.000
 programmer to hit but I think long before 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.030
 he, too, to not just like this pen 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.430
 I throw out the program on the right is an excellent low 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.860
 kick hockey player show but pay 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.509
 attention to the fact that 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.789
 which all the time runs away from him 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.340
 programmers pressure pressing reason 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.960
 people. very strong look and here 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.479
 an attempt to translate everything into a struggle 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.219
 but I think it will not help much 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.319
 to the hockey player in this case up to him somehow 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:52.889
 strangely unpleasant right hand about us 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:55.500
 jotto gives look and now goes there 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.590

 willpower and about hockey player present 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.469

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:09.479
 lies gets hit but not publish from the audience 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.159
 court is an indicator of willpower 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.110
 the main quality buy cannot crush 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.300
 on and pick up the key is not like at least 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.250

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.949
 eat and as you see it more and more 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.870
 more tired again he misses 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.610
