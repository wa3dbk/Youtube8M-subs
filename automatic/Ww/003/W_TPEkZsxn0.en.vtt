00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.179
 fed show today even for a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.009
 little video do it yourself 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.170
 indeed I posted you the picture on 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.090
 instagram of my homemade scrub for 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.500
 the lips and apparently that you 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.699
 interested so I decided to make you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.410
 a little video to show you 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.470
 how do I do it then to start 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.480
 what are the necessary ingredients 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.039
 already coconut oil so if 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.199
 you do not know where to find it I am 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.910
 will put in the info bar the link 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.820
 why we found on amazon 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.170
 then powdered sugar so I 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.850
 prefer to do it with white sugar 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.890
 but if you want to put brown sugar 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.629
 you can also scrub it will 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.030
 just a little bit more aggressive to my 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.430
 meaning and for it to be also a 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 minimum nourishing in addition to the vote that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.500
 at the cost of adding them a spoon to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.930
 honey coffee and a teaspoon 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.129
 olive oil optional if you want 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.989
 they are a little bit colorful for 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.210
 the side will have weaker like me the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.379
 pink despite food dyes and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.600
 you can make the color that you 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.220
 wish and finally concerning the little ones 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720
 pots the smaller pots that I have 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.610
 found that they are hermetic come 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.409
 from cazaril are not 1 euros the pot 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.000
 is there by cons if you know a 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.040
 where I can find even more 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.689
 small and always hermetic say the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.920
 me what I have sought this 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.869
 are really the ones I found 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
 and since we will keep this scrub 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.619
 only about fifteen games of fact 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.729
 that there are no preservatives 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.710
 inside and mixing any 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.299
 food together it's true that it does 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.770
 a little big so I advise you 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.200
 to do only half of course so 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.579
 it's gone I take me so pian and I 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.320
 will start by putting a big 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.100
 tablespoon of coconut oil 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.780
 so yes I like it a lot 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.040
 something that is pretty visible so if you 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.049
 can not get hold of the key 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.280
 hen diet to spend a little bit 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.509
 at the microphone we can soften 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.220
 but I do not like using too much 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.490
 microwave for this kind of product 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.710
 so I'd rather do a little bit more 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.000
 hard but then naturally 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.909
 to know how much sugar 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.930
 added take the container and I'm going 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.930
 fill to 1/3 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.730
 and that gives presided over the amount 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.590
 it takes for the container of his 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.940
 size there now I confess that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.430
 I still roughly the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.319
 measurements to the eye and that of course a 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.459
 time it will be finished if I find a 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.050
 little bit too liquid I will add 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.030
 sugar and if I find a little bit 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.380
 too sturdy I will add a small 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.830
 little coconut oil or a little bit 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.830
 olive oil 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:38.040
 we mix all that gently and in 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.310
 same time that we will soften 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.310
 coconut oil 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:54.870
 this is not bad now I add 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:03:02.250
 my teaspoon honey my spoon to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:10.820
 olive oil coffee and game reviewed at 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.820
 new to what are you doing heinz 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.800
 just drank 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.010
 once again that the mixture well 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.310
 homogeneous on the colorful is the moment 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.140
 your app is the dye so this 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:33.120
 I will try to do it 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:37.500
 So a purple red rib a 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.860
 drop of blue and this part for 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.860
 mix

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.819
 about a fortnight and 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.319
 when we want to use one 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.180
 will not forget to go out a little bit 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.859
 advance for everything cooled if not he 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.530
 is going to be a little bit too hard to use 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.479
 and how do I use then be audois 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.459
 with a baby toothbrush 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.620

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.750
