probably<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> still<00:01:24.509> break<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
probably do but when you still break it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.539 
probably do but when you still break it
down<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.080> 252<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.159> 102

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
down you know 252 that's going to be 102

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.249 
down you know 252 that's going to be 102
speed<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.540> that's<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:27.990> 103

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
speed and then that's going to be 103

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.929 
speed and then that's going to be 103
speed<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.310> guaranteed<00:01:29.640> you're<00:01:29.850> gonna

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
speed so just guaranteed you're gonna

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.429 
speed so just guaranteed you're gonna
out<00:01:30.119> speed<00:01:30.390> at<00:01:30.570> Pokemon<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.079> zoom<00:01:31.229> roll

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
out speed at Pokemon like a zoom roll

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.600 
out speed at Pokemon like a zoom roll
you're<00:01:31.560> gonna<00:01:31.710> lay<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.920> sludge<00:01:32.189> wave<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
you're gonna lay in that sludge wave and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.910 
you're gonna lay in that sludge wave and
you're<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> KO<00:01:33.360> from<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.350> cool

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
you're going to get a KO from it so cool

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.950 
you're going to get a KO from it so cool
stuff<00:01:35.189> right<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.360> it's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
stuff right there but if you know it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.480 
stuff right there but if you know it's
not<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> biggest<00:01:37.530> thing<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.310> kind

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
not the biggest thing you can just kind

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.920 
not the biggest thing you can just kind
of<00:01:38.549> get<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.729> extra<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.240> hit<00:01:39.420> points<00:01:39.689> even

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
of get that extra on hit points even

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.050 
of get that extra on hit points even
though<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.200> feel<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.009> couple<00:01:41.460> points<00:01:41.880> in

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
though I feel like the couple points in

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.420 
though I feel like the couple points in
bulk<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.899> know<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> hit<00:01:43.500> points<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.009> maybe<00:01:44.310> you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
bulk you know to hit points to maybe you

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.889 
bulk you know to hit points to maybe you
get<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.579> potential<00:01:45.030> out<00:01:45.119> speeds<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.840> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
get some potential out speeds and I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.359 
get some potential out speeds and I
think<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.229> worth<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> run<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> 20

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
think it's worth it just to run the 20

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.429 
think it's worth it just to run the 20
speed<00:01:47.610> anyway<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.600> might<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.170> Draco

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
speed anyway now you might see Draco

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
speed anyway now you might see Draco
meteor<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.399> can't<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.850> Draco<00:01:51.210> meteor

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
meteor here you can't have Draco meteor

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.760 
meteor here you can't have Draco meteor
that<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.990> somehow<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.560> hate

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that way if you somehow don't hate

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.200 
that way if you somehow don't hate
something<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.399> super<00:01:53.610> effective<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
something for super effective you have a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
something for super effective you have a
really<00:01:54.659> amazing<00:01:55.229> neutral<00:01:55.740> hit<00:01:55.860> or<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> can

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
really amazing neutral hit or you can

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.440 
really amazing neutral hit or you can
just<00:01:56.579> go<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> dragon<00:01:57.180> pulse

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
just go with the dragon pulse

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.719 
just go with the dragon pulse
dragon<00:01:57.990> pulse<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.640> know

dragon pulse is going to just you know

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.310 
dragon pulse is going to just you know
give<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.329> stab<00:02:00.630> make<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> where<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.229> have

give that stab make it to where you have

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.440 
give that stab make it to where you have
something<00:02:01.619> reliable<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.880> crazy<00:02:03.180> thing

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
something reliable and the crazy thing

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.569 
something reliable and the crazy thing
is<00:02:03.479> goocher<00:02:03.869> has<00:02:04.159> amazing<00:02:05.159> coverage<00:02:05.490> you

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
is goocher has amazing coverage you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.190 
is goocher has amazing coverage you
might<00:02:05.700> notice<00:02:05.939> Blizzard<00:02:06.299> down<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:06.689> well<00:02:07.049> yes

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
might notice Blizzard down here well yes

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.440 
might notice Blizzard down here well yes
it<00:02:07.409> does<00:02:07.590> also<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.190> access<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.550> ice<00:02:08.789> beam<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
it does also get access to ice beam so I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.869 
it does also get access to ice beam so I
mean<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.720> your<00:02:10.470> answer<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.400> pretty<00:02:11.760> much

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
mean you have your answer to pretty much

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.010 
mean you have your answer to pretty much
everything<00:02:12.239> that

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
everything that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.300 
everything that

if you don't even care about dragon

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.560 
if you don't even care about dragon
pools<00:02:14.460> it's<00:02:14.640> not<00:02:14.760> even<00:02:14.910> needed<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.270> I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
pools it's not even needed because I

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.330 
pools it's not even needed because I
speed<00:02:15.990> was<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.350> hit<00:02:16.440> super<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:16.890> dragons

I<00:02:51.060> mean<00:02:51.770> 1970<00:02:52.770> 110<00:02:53.190> 150<00:02:53.820> 80<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.420> took<00:02:54.930> out<00:02:55.080> of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
I mean 1970 110 150 80 it took out of

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.320 
I mean 1970 110 150 80 it took out of
the<00:02:55.350> speed<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.890> bit<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.250> now<00:02:56.520> has<00:02:56.700> absurd

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the speed just a bit and now has absurd

the speed just a bit and now has absurd
tankiness<00:02:57.930> great<00:02:58.320> hit<00:02:58.530> points<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.070> lot<00:02:59.490> of

tankiness great hit points a lot of

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.510 
tankiness great hit points a lot of
offensive<00:02:59.940> potential<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.220> from<00:03:02.220> there<00:03:02.370> you

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
offensive potential and from there you

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.980 
offensive potential and from there you
know<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.670> just<00:03:02.820> start<00:03:03.090> making<00:03:03.210> up<00:03:03.480> weird<00:03:03.630> sets

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
know you just start making up weird sets

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.840 
know you just start making up weird sets
and<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.350> kind<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.620> work<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.310> goodra<00:03:05.700> gets

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
and it can kind of work that goodra gets

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.090 
and it can kind of work that goodra gets
access<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.270> curse<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.260> when<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.620> use<00:03:07.800> curse

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
access to curse so when you use curse

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.980 
access to curse so when you use curse
now<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.550> just<00:03:08.880> like<00:03:09.060> kind<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.390> set<00:03:09.570> up<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:09.870> or

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
now you just like kind of set up one or

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.930 
now you just like kind of set up one or
two<00:03:10.020> curse<00:03:10.350> use<00:03:10.740> rest<00:03:11.070> Chester<00:03:11.460> berry<00:03:11.640> props

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
two curse use rest Chester berry props

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.670 
two curse use rest Chester berry props
and<00:03:12.120> then<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:12.900> start<00:03:13.110> going<00:03:13.290> for

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
and then you just start going for

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.530 
and then you just start going for
coverage<00:03:14.100> from<00:03:14.280> there<00:03:14.430> they<00:03:14.550> can<00:03:14.610> invest<00:03:15.360> into

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
coverage from there they can invest into

it<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.709> also<00:04:10.890> um<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.970> know<00:04:12.090> sleep<00:04:12.330> though<00:04:12.750> not

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
it is also um you know sleep though not

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.550 
it is also um you know sleep though not
pressed<00:04:13.410> but<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:14.580> talk<00:04:14.840> now<00:04:15.840> rust<00:04:16.169> sleep<00:04:16.380> talk

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560

isn't<00:04:16.950> going<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.190> work<00:04:17.340> with<00:04:17.489> hydration<00:04:17.850> but

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
isn't going to work with hydration but

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.699 
isn't going to work with hydration but
if<00:04:18.540> you<00:04:18.630> do<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.930> curse<00:04:19.109> rust

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
if you do have the curse rust

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.010 
if you do have the curse rust
I<00:04:19.739> recommend<00:04:20.430> hydration<00:04:20.910> over<00:04:21.210> SAP<00:04:21.479> sipper<00:04:21.870> if

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
I recommend hydration over SAP sipper if

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.210 
I recommend hydration over SAP sipper if
you're<00:04:22.440> running<00:04:22.950> like<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.220> offensive<00:04:23.760> moves

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
you're running like the offensive moves

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.950 
you're running like the offensive moves
and<00:04:24.310> like<00:04:24.520> earthquake<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.210> things<00:04:25.660> like<00:04:25.810> that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
and like earthquake and things like that

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.480 
and like earthquake and things like that
because<00:04:26.200> with<00:04:26.650> that<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.980> know<00:04:27.100> if<00:04:27.310> your

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
because with that you know if your

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.190 
because with that you know if your
opponents<00:04:27.850> somehow<00:04:28.180> uses<00:04:28.540> rain<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:29.170> just

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
opponents somehow uses rain it just

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.750 
opponents somehow uses rain it just
gives<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.770> chance<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.190> you<00:04:30.310> won't<00:04:30.520> be

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
gives you a chance that you won't be

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.640 
gives you a chance that you won't be
able<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.000> rest<00:04:31.300> or<00:04:31.600> you'll<00:04:32.050> rest<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.560> then

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
able to rest or you'll rest and then

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.630 
able to rest or you'll rest and then
you'll<00:04:32.770> wake<00:04:32.890> up<00:04:32.920> at<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.190> end<00:04:33.370> of<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.490> turn

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
you'll wake up at the end of the turn

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.670 
you'll wake up at the end of the turn
and<00:04:33.850> now<00:04:34.240> you're<00:04:34.720> pretty<00:04:35.080> much<00:04:35.200> healed<00:04:35.530> and

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
and now you're pretty much healed and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.800 
and now you're pretty much healed and
cool<00:04:36.040> things<00:04:36.250> happen<00:04:36.580> from<00:04:36.700> that<00:04:36.880> looking<00:04:37.690> at

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
cool things happen from that looking at

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.330 
cool things happen from that looking at
good<00:04:37.990> result<00:04:38.290> their<00:04:38.380> abilities<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:39.250> know

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
good result their abilities you know

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.070 
good result their abilities you know
there<00:04:39.520> is<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.670> lot<00:04:39.910> of<00:04:40.000> debate<00:04:40.240> that<00:04:40.480> SAP<00:04:40.720> sipper

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
there is a lot of debate that SAP sipper

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.500 
there is a lot of debate that SAP sipper
it<00:04:41.320> can<00:04:41.950> be<00:04:42.130> a<00:04:42.160> really<00:04:42.340> cool<00:04:42.670> outplay<00:04:43.210> kind<00:04:43.450> of

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
it can be a really cool outplay kind of

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.150 
it can be a really cool outplay kind of
thing<00:04:43.630> like<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:43.900> switch<00:04:44.200> in<00:04:44.380> with<00:04:44.560> SAP<00:04:44.740> zipper

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
thing like you switch in with SAP zipper

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.800 
thing like you switch in with SAP zipper
and<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.670> can<00:04:45.880> synergize<00:04:46.120> with<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.600> set

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
and it can synergize with the set

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.930 
and it can synergize with the set
because<00:04:47.110> oh<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.980> get<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> SAP<00:04:48.490> zipper<00:04:48.820> and

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
because oh you get the SAP zipper and

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.190 
because oh you get the SAP zipper and
now<00:04:49.060> you<00:04:49.150> know<00:04:49.360> curse<00:04:49.570> is<00:04:49.750> going<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:49.990> come<00:04:50.080> in

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
now you know curse is going to come in

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.480 
now you know curse is going to come in
so<00:04:50.230> now<00:04:50.530> you're<00:04:50.650> getting<00:04:50.740> all<00:04:50.950> these<00:04:51.070> boosted

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
so now you're getting all these boosted

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.640 
so now you're getting all these boosted
attacks<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:52.060> that's<00:04:52.540> cool<00:04:52.750> but<00:04:52.990> dragons

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
attacks and that's cool but dragons

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.970 
attacks and that's cool but dragons
resist<00:04:54.070> grass<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:55.320> that's<00:04:56.320> kind<00:04:56.650> of<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.830> so

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
resist grass and that's kind of it so

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.290 
resist grass and that's kind of it so
it's<00:04:57.220> not<00:04:57.310> like<00:04:57.490> you're<00:04:57.640> saving<00:04:57.940> a<00:04:58.120> huge

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
it's not like you're saving a huge

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.430 
it's not like you're saving a huge
amount<00:04:58.480> damage<00:04:58.780> you're<00:04:58.870> just<00:04:59.020> going<00:04:59.230> for<00:04:59.320> that

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
amount damage you're just going for that

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.020 
amount damage you're just going for that
outplay<00:04:59.770> potential<00:05:00.100> it<00:05:00.370> does<00:05:00.700> work<00:05:00.880> really

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
outplay potential it does work really

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.510 
outplay potential it does work really
well<00:05:01.210> in<00:05:01.360> doubles<00:05:01.660> as<00:05:01.780> well<00:05:02.310> for<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.370> most

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
well in doubles as well for the most

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.580 
well in doubles as well for the most
part<00:05:03.610> there's<00:05:03.880> that<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.240> then<00:05:04.690> GUI<00:05:04.960> if<00:05:05.440> you're

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
part there's that and then GUI if you're

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.900 
part there's that and then GUI if you're
not<00:05:05.710> running<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.070> curse<00:05:06.220> set<00:05:06.430> like<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.760> could

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
not running the curse set like I could

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.150 
not running the curse set like I could
see<00:05:07.120> GUI<00:05:07.420> working<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.110> this<00:05:08.260> as<00:05:08.470> well<00:05:08.620> like

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
see GUI working on this as well like

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.250 
see GUI working on this as well like
they<00:05:09.310> hate<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:09.580> with<00:05:09.730> fit<00:05:09.970> contact<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.080> then

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
they hate you with fit contact and then

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.720 
they hate you with fit contact and then
you<00:05:11.410> out<00:05:11.440> speed<00:05:11.830> them<00:05:12.010> because<00:05:12.520> if<00:05:12.640> you're

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
you out speed them because if you're

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.070 
you out speed them because if you're
running<00:05:12.850> those<00:05:13.270> couple<00:05:13.570> of<00:05:13.630> extra<00:05:13.930> points

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
running those couple of extra points

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.290 
running those couple of extra points
into<00:05:14.500> speed<00:05:14.740> you<00:05:15.340> might<00:05:15.490> find<00:05:15.669> that<00:05:15.850> out<00:05:15.970> speed

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
into speed you might find that out speed

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.990 
into speed you might find that out speed
on<00:05:16.510> a<00:05:16.930> Pokemon<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:17.830> then<00:05:18.100> cool<00:05:18.430> things<00:05:18.640> happen

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
on a Pokemon and then cool things happen

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.460 
on a Pokemon and then cool things happen
but<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.270> can't<00:05:19.450> be<00:05:19.540> really<00:05:19.750> fast<00:05:19.930> Boca<00:05:20.140> moments

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
but it can't be really fast Boca moments

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.140 
but it can't be really fast Boca moments
let's<00:05:20.680> say<00:05:20.770> hit<00:05:20.919> you<00:05:21.040> twice<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.580> if<00:05:21.880> you<00:05:21.940> spot

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
let's say hit you twice and if you spot

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150 
let's say hit you twice and if you spot
two<00:05:22.360> moves<00:05:22.570> that<00:05:22.660> make<00:05:22.870> contact<00:05:23.320> just<00:05:23.530> you

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
two moves that make contact just you

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.620 
two moves that make contact just you
starting<00:05:24.550> to<00:05:24.640> weird<00:05:24.790> areas<00:05:25.120> but<00:05:25.270> it<00:05:25.360> can

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
starting to weird areas but it can

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.600 
starting to weird areas but it can
potentially<00:05:26.169> catch<00:05:26.800> up<00:05:26.980> with<00:05:27.100> your<00:05:27.250> opponent

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
potentially catch up with your opponent

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.460 
potentially catch up with your opponent
and<00:05:27.730> then<00:05:27.970> you<00:05:28.180> can<00:05:28.360> make<00:05:28.510> supplies<00:05:29.260> from

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
and then you can make supplies from

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.100 
and then you can make supplies from
there<00:05:29.650> we<00:05:30.220> have<00:05:30.430> some<00:05:30.550> other<00:05:30.700> things<00:05:30.970> of<00:05:31.240> toxic

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
there we have some other things of toxic

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.200 
there we have some other things of toxic
infestation<00:05:33.010> I<00:05:33.190> feel<00:05:33.669> it's<00:05:33.850> a<00:05:33.880> really<00:05:34.060> cool

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
infestation I feel it's a really cool

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.970 
infestation I feel it's a really cool
combo<00:05:34.540> they<00:05:34.660> set<00:05:34.870> up<00:05:34.960> infestation<00:05:35.590> they're

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
combo they set up infestation they're

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099 
so it's like a free full hit points you

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:03.890 
so it's like a free full hit points you
can<00:07:02.370> just<00:07:02.909> kind<00:07:03.090> of<00:07:03.150> do<00:07:03.300> whatever<00:07:03.479> you<00:07:03.720> can't

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
can just kind of do whatever you can't

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.300 
can just kind of do whatever you can't
run<00:07:04.020> assault<00:07:04.470> vest<00:07:04.680> on<00:07:04.800> this<00:07:04.949> because<00:07:05.099> it

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
run assault vest on this because it

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.309 
run assault vest on this because it
doesn't<00:07:05.550> work<00:07:05.610> with<00:07:05.789> rest<00:07:06.060> but<00:07:06.810> you<00:07:06.930> just<00:07:07.110> have

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 
doesn't work with rest but you just have

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.080 
doesn't work with rest but you just have
a<00:07:07.530> lot<00:07:07.860> of<00:07:07.949> options<00:07:08.340> and<00:07:08.550> then<00:07:08.669> you<00:07:08.759> can<00:07:08.909> kind

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
a lot of options and then you can kind

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.809 
a lot of options and then you can kind
of<00:07:09.180> run<00:07:10.020> in<00:07:10.440> these<00:07:10.889> weird<00:07:11.190> ways<00:07:11.460> you<00:07:11.639> know<00:07:11.759> you

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 
of run in these weird ways you know you

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.309 
of run in these weird ways you know you
can<00:07:12.000> go<00:07:12.180> with<00:07:12.330> that<00:07:12.360> modest<00:07:12.810> or<00:07:12.960> hit<00:07:13.110> point

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 
can go with that modest or hit point

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:15.050 
can go with that modest or hit point
investment<00:07:13.800> you<00:07:14.159> maybe<00:07:14.370> try<00:07:14.550> to<00:07:14.610> patch<00:07:14.849> in

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
investment you maybe try to patch in

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.550 
investment you maybe try to patch in
your<00:07:15.090> defense<00:07:15.449> as<00:07:15.599> a<00:07:15.629> bit<00:07:15.840> and<00:07:15.960> just<00:07:16.110> since<00:07:16.530> you

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
your defense as a bit and just since you

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.959 
your defense as a bit and just since you
have<00:07:16.740> high<00:07:16.919> base<00:07:17.099> damage<00:07:17.129> moves<00:07:17.669> you<00:07:17.789> don't

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:17.969 
have high base damage moves you don't

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:20.149 
have high base damage moves you don't
invest<00:07:18.150> as<00:07:18.539> hard<00:07:18.780> into<00:07:19.440> your<00:07:19.590> special<00:07:19.919> attack

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:20.159 
invest as hard into your special attack

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:21.890 
invest as hard into your special attack
and<00:07:20.460> then<00:07:20.580> since<00:07:20.940> it<00:07:21.090> could<00:07:21.330> be<00:07:21.509> in<00:07:21.599> doubles

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
and then since it could be in doubles

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.510 
and then since it could be in doubles
you<00:07:22.409> can<00:07:22.530> also<00:07:22.680> look<00:07:22.889> for<00:07:23.069> that<00:07:23.129> support

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 
you can also look for that support

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.999 
you can also look for that support
potential<00:07:23.969> I<00:07:24.270> like<00:07:25.020> citrus<00:07:25.379> berry<00:07:25.590> as<00:07:25.680> an<00:07:25.770> idea

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:26.009 
potential I like citrus berry as an idea

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:27.619 
potential I like citrus berry as an idea
that<00:07:26.190> way<00:07:26.280> it<00:07:26.370> leaves<00:07:26.520> before<00:07:27.150> you<00:07:27.360> have<00:07:27.479> to

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:27.629 
that way it leaves before you have to

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:28.939 
that way it leaves before you have to
rest<00:07:27.840> you<00:07:27.960> get<00:07:28.110> a<00:07:28.139> little<00:07:28.379> extra<00:07:28.440> hell<00:07:28.740> if<00:07:28.860> you

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:28.949 
rest you get a little extra hell if you

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.010 
rest you get a little extra hell if you
get<00:07:29.069> a<00:07:29.099> little<00:07:29.340> extra<00:07:29.400> security<00:07:29.759> and<00:07:30.270> it<00:07:30.870> can

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 
get a little extra security and it can

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.059 
get a little extra security and it can
just<00:07:31.169> kind<00:07:31.349> of<00:07:31.379> play<00:07:31.560> it<00:07:31.680> through<00:07:31.830> really<00:07:31.919> well

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:32.069 
just kind of play it through really well

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:34.730 
just kind of play it through really well
and<00:07:32.629> that's<00:07:33.629> kind<00:07:33.900> of<00:07:33.960> all<00:07:34.080> there<00:07:34.229> is<00:07:34.319> to<00:07:34.500> it<00:07:34.620> so

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
and that's kind of all there is to it so

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.399 
and that's kind of all there is to it so
goodra<00:07:35.129> main<00:07:35.699> set<00:07:36.030> and<00:07:36.240> then<00:07:36.599> weird<00:07:36.840> sets<00:07:37.139> that

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:37.409 
goodra main set and then weird sets that

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:39.020 
goodra main set and then weird sets that
where<00:07:37.620> tries<00:07:37.889> to<00:07:38.039> find<00:07:38.250> its<00:07:38.400> identity<00:07:38.759> and

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.030 
where tries to find its identity and

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.120 
where tries to find its identity and
sometimes<00:07:39.509> these<00:07:39.629> can<00:07:39.840> shine<00:07:40.080> like<00:07:40.379> this<00:07:40.949> has

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.130 
sometimes these can shine like this has

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.010 
sometimes these can shine like this has
been<00:07:41.310> very<00:07:41.639> powerful<00:07:41.849> for<00:07:42.300> me<00:07:42.360> in<00:07:42.449> the<00:07:42.539> past<00:07:42.750> I

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 
been very powerful for me in the past I

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.959 
been very powerful for me in the past I
haven't<00:07:43.409> tried<00:07:43.650> this<00:07:43.800> one<00:07:43.860> app<00:07:44.099> I<00:07:44.279> mean<00:07:44.460> well

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:44.969 
haven't tried this one app I mean well

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:48.029 
I haven't tried this one out but I feel

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:49.430 
I haven't tried this one out but I feel
like<00:07:48.210> it<00:07:48.330> does<00:07:48.449> have<00:07:48.630> some<00:07:48.779> good<00:07:48.900> potential<00:07:49.319> if

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 
like it does have some good potential if

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.689 
like it does have some good potential if
you<00:07:49.469> can<00:07:49.650> set<00:07:49.830> up<00:07:49.949> and<00:07:50.130> you're<00:07:50.219> a<00:07:50.250> lot<00:07:50.490> of<00:07:50.580> your

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:50.699 
you can set up and you're a lot of your

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:52.249 
you can set up and you're a lot of your

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080
