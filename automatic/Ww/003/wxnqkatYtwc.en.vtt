00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.570
 in the face of uncertainty, the possession of 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.010
 rumor makes the media look for 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.420
 that people feel informed in 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.420

 in any port and airport 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.460
 international by which they intend 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.460
 travel 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.840
 the truth in general kills the rumor but 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.960
 there are times 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.420
 where rumor is something for which almost no 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.090
 there is a remedy when people already believe that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.670
 something in a certain way is very difficult 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.890
 change is the intent that rumor works 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.890
 in both senses or be able to rumors 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.030
 of your candidates or your party to 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.369
 that you work that you have to 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.610
 dismantle understand why it is generated 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.790
 tell the truth seek the explanation or 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.739
 compensate it and pass otherwise there 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.319
 things that you want to say and that sometimes 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.549
 the media is not interested in saying them 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.810
 then you are things or other means 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:29.569
 alternatives today do not reach more than 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.340
 rumor mill that social networks the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.610
 glosa has a large component of 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.220
 rumors and has not been said of corridors and 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.799
 inside information that sometimes 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.879
 also the one that the author gives her 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.590
 closa so that the one who wrote to the 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.670
 grace the public under the good faith of 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.739
 that the one who gave him the information is 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.930
 good source I want to bother the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.329
 power and the politics of knowledge 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.680
 detain or management of the rumors that 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.470
 it is a power that they do not control 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.600
 you can press a journalist to 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.600
 that does not say so that it says to defer 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.500
 but as you make people do not say 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.900
 certain things you have to prohibit that the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.200
 people speak and that can not be from the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.700
 only way to stop the rumor is that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.700
 prohibit people from talking
