take<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> look<00:01:55.799> at<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> m3<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.759> illustrate<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
take a look at the m3 to illustrate this

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.889 
take a look at the m3 to illustrate this
point<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.950> m3<00:01:59.369> has<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.850> back<00:02:00.180> panel<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
point the m3 has this back panel and

point the m3 has this back panel and
front<00:02:01.320> panel<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.549> compare<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> m5

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
front panel if you compare it to the m5

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
front panel if you compare it to the m5
you'll<00:02:03.899> see<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.710> same<00:02:05.009> except

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
you'll see that it is the same except

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.210 
you'll see that it is the same except
cut<00:02:05.820> short<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:07.140> allows<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:07.649> Neptune<00:02:08.039> to
