00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.090
 survive the end of the world is something so 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.010
 cruel as paradoxical what would happen if 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.469
 all the accumulated progress and selfishness 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.150
 of people would have been reversed if 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.529
 finish with us so quickly 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.529
 how can we snap our fingers 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.570
 but the end of the world did not come for 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.149
 all a few survive under a 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.110
 sun more gray and farther from us 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.370
 until the plans of the very same 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.370
 Antichrist can go wrong 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.420
 our city ​​survived and it was seen 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.910
 wrapped up in a dictatorship of abuse and 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.320
 violence but they could not themselves 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.460
 foresee how life and freedom 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.460
 they could make their way 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.980
 the key slept in our DNA until 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.600
 our horrible world woke her up and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.600
 began to manifest itself in a few 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.180
 welcome to the bunker 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.150
 the only way to get to cities 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.340
 but they control their accesses alone and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.100
 we do with their control the people are 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.010
 will join our resistance and that there 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.950
 from heaven 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.400
 is the possibility of enhancing all your 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.560
 qualities up to unsuspected limits 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.490
 that's why we can not allow them to 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.490
 put your hands 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.350
 do you think it's worth changing to a 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.350
 dictator for an emperor 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.840
 what would be the difference apart from all 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.840
 the blood spilled on the road
