00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
gradient to the text no just hit OK

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.889 
gradient to the text no just hit OK
they're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> come<00:02:06.509> over<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.689> your

gradient tool or your blend tool and you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.390 
gradient tool or your blend tool and you
make<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.170> leave<00:02:10.410> everything<00:02:10.530> normal<00:02:10.739> if<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
make just leave everything normal if you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.559 
make just leave everything normal if you
haven't<00:02:11.520> messed<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.150> make<00:02:12.450> sure

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
haven't messed with it just make sure

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.730 
haven't messed with it just make sure
the<00:02:12.660> shapes<00:02:12.930> letter<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.410> grade

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the shapes letter in the grade

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.160 
the shapes letter in the grade
is<00:02:13.800> foreground<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.370> background<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:15.900> take

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
is foreground to background then take

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.840 
is foreground to background then take
your<00:02:16.320> tool<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.860> put<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.310> right<00:02:17.340> above<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
your tool and put it right above the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.720 
your tool and put it right above the
highest<00:02:18.030> point<00:02:18.450> highest<00:02:18.900> text<00:02:19.200> point<00:02:19.380> and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
highest point highest text point and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.760 
highest point highest text point and
hold<00:02:20.730> ctrl<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.240> drag<00:02:21.600> down<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> lowest<00:02:22.500> if

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
hold ctrl and drag down to the lowest if

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.710 
hold ctrl and drag down to the lowest if
you<00:02:22.860> can<00:02:22.980> while<00:02:23.130> holding<00:02:23.340> ctrl<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:24.360> will<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.630> in

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
you can while holding ctrl it will be in

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.310 
you can while holding ctrl it will be in
straight<00:02:25.050> lines<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.930> gives<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.140> nice

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
straight lines and that gives a nice

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.590 
straight lines and that gives a nice
gradient<00:02:29.040> effect<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.240> now<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.390> can

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
gradient effect to it and now you can

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.300 
gradient effect to it and now you can
come<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.050> say<00:02:31.260> select<00:02:31.530> none<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.860> deselect

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
come up and say select none to deselect

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.520 
come up and say select none to deselect
the<00:02:32.460> text<00:02:32.850> next<00:02:33.690> thing<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.050> can<00:02:34.200> just<00:02:34.350> delete

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
the text next thing we can just delete

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.730 
the text next thing we can just delete
the<00:02:35.100> original<00:02:35.550> text<00:02:36.330> layer<00:02:36.750> since<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
the original text layer since the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.110 
the original text layer since the
gradient<00:02:38.160> layer<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.550> now<00:02:38.700> what<00:02:38.910> we'll<00:02:39.030> be

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
gradient layer is now what we'll be

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.360 
gradient layer is now what we'll be
working<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:40.710> select<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.250> and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
working with so you just select it and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.190 
working with so you just select it and
you<00:02:41.460> hit<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> trash<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:45.090> now<00:02:45.270> we'll<00:02:46.080> be

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
you hit to the trash can so now we'll be

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
you hit to the trash can so now we'll be
adding<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:47.390> border<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.980> we're<00:02:50.130> going

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
adding a border to it and so we're going

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.370 
adding a border to it and so we're going
to<00:02:50.310> say<00:02:50.490> alpha<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.940> selection<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.990> now<00:02:52.230> we're

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
to say alpha to selection and now we're

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.800 
to say alpha to selection and now we're
going<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.560> go<00:02:52.680> up<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.950> new<00:02:53.550> layer<00:02:53.790> we're<00:02:54.690> going

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
going to go up to new layer we're going

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.480 
going to go up to new layer we're going
to<00:02:54.900> call<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.020> text<00:02:55.350> border<00:02:58.280> now<00:02:59.280> we're<00:02:59.370> gonna

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
to call it text border now we're gonna

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.950 
to call it text border now we're gonna
go<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.640> select<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.330> we're<00:03:00.480> going<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.630> go<00:03:00.780> down

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
go to select and we're going to go down

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.720 
go to select and we're going to go down
to<00:03:00.990> grow<00:03:01.320> this<00:03:01.500> time<00:03:01.770> we're<00:03:02.370> going<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.520> grow<00:03:02.700> up

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
to grow this time we're going to grow up

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.760 
to grow this time we're going to grow up
by<00:03:02.910> six<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.600> will<00:03:03.720> give<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> nice<00:03:04.140> border

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
by six this will give a nice border

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.650 
by six this will give a nice border
around<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.160> edges<00:03:05.370> without<00:03:06.210> overpowering

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
around the edges without overpowering

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.350 
around the edges without overpowering
the<00:03:07.110> text<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.770> we're<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:08.910> fill<00:03:09.180> this

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
the text and we're going to fill this

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.880 
the text and we're going to fill this
with<00:03:09.600> black<00:03:13.070> or<00:03:15.350> yeah<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.410> got<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.620> select

with black or yeah you got to select

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.710 
with black or yeah you got to select
your<00:03:16.950> paint<00:03:17.220> here<00:03:17.460> a<00:03:17.670> bucket<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.300> first<00:03:18.510> side

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
your paint here a bucket to a first side

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.180 
your paint here a bucket to a first side
about<00:03:18.960> that<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.710> we're<00:03:19.800> going<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:19.950> fill<00:03:20.070> out
