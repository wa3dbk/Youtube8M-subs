before because think about it here's the
logic<00:02:22.860> i'm<00:02:22.980> using<00:02:23.310> why<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.180> when<00:02:24.390> it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
logic i'm using why is it that when it

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the shock isn't match we advanced or

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.030 
the shock isn't match we advanced or
intermediate<00:02:48.450> people<00:02:49.170> all<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.590> have<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.860> do

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
intermediate people all you have to do

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.190 
intermediate people all you have to do
is<00:02:50.280> second<00:02:51.090> math<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.690> look<00:02:52.050> at<00:02:52.140> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
is second math you know look at the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.230 
is second math you know look at the
ratio<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:52.860> go<00:02:52.980> from<00:02:53.160> two<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.490> four<00:02:53.700> and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
ratio if you go from two to four and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.790 
ratio if you go from two to four and
means<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.570> multiply<00:02:54.750> by<00:02:55.200> two<00:02:55.260> or<00:02:55.650> your

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
means you multiply by two or your

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.790 
means you multiply by two or your
attitude<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.790> if<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.060> are<00:02:57.210> level<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.750> all<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
attitude so if you are level for all you

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.200 
attitude so if you are level for all you
gotta<00:02:58.980> do<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.130> do<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.400> same<00:02:59.700> use<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> same

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
gotta do is do the same use the same

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.140 
gotta do is do the same use the same

channel<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.510> probably<00:03:45.810> not<00:03:45.990> as<00:03:46.230> big<00:03:46.740> as<00:03:46.830> you

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
channel you probably not as big as you

channel you probably not as big as you
want<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.160> be<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:48.209> doesn't<00:03:48.450> apply<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.660> us

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
want to be so that doesn't apply to us

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.170 
want to be so that doesn't apply to us
so<00:03:49.860> pretty<00:03:50.010> much<00:03:50.100> put<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> sock<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.790> your<00:03:50.940> body

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
so pretty much put a sock on your body

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.880 
so pretty much put a sock on your body
that<00:03:51.300> your<00:03:51.480> body<00:03:51.630> has<00:03:51.720> not<00:03:51.930> seen<00:03:52.110> before<00:03:52.200> as

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
that your body has not seen before as

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.620 
that your body has not seen before as
soon<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.130> one<00:03:53.280> beginners<00:03:53.940> make<00:03:54.150> gains<00:03:54.390> not

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
soon as one beginners make gains not

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.910 
soon as one beginners make gains not
because<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.959> beginning<00:03:55.380> just<00:03:55.560> because<00:03:55.800> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
because the beginning just because the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.860 
because the beginning just because the
shock<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.220> too<00:03:56.610> intense<00:03:56.760> for<00:03:57.180> their<00:03:57.420> body<00:03:57.600> so

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
shock is too intense for their body so

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.840 
shock is too intense for their body so
it<00:03:57.959> really<00:03:58.140> works<00:03:59.040> quickly<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.520> in<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.670> same

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
it really works quickly so in the same

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.420 
it really works quickly so in the same
way<00:04:00.230> apply<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.290> same<00:04:01.500> principle<00:04:01.560> right<00:04:02.190> if

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
way apply the same principle right if

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.270 
way apply the same principle right if
you<00:04:02.550> used<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.940> doing<00:04:03.090> bench<00:04:03.480> pressing<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.280> don't

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
you used to doing bench pressing I don't

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.680 
you used to doing bench pressing I don't
know<00:04:05.370> if<00:04:05.520> I<00:04:05.640> were<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:05.940> switch<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.330> up<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.600> know

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
know if I were to switch it up you know

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.780 
know if I were to switch it up you know
you<00:04:06.870> super<00:04:07.290> says<00:04:07.470> use<00:04:07.650> com<00:04:07.890> process<00:04:08.340> use<00:04:08.550> John

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
four days now the only problem is that i

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.570 
four days now the only problem is that i
never<00:04:19.049> did<00:04:19.230> them<00:04:19.380> for<00:04:19.530> too<00:04:19.680> long<00:04:19.830> but<00:04:20.280> after

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
never did them for too long but after

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.760 
never did them for too long but after
seeing<00:04:21.030> this<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.359> did<00:04:21.840> some<00:04:22.049> research<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.500> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
seeing this I did some research of the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.590 
seeing this I did some research of the
study<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.250> might<00:04:23.669> give<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:23.970> try<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.270> might<00:04:24.450> try

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
study I might give it a try I might try

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.409 
study I might give it a try I might try
to<00:04:24.630> do<00:04:24.810> giant<00:04:25.260> sets<00:04:25.669> for<00:04:26.669> like<00:04:26.850> at<00:04:27.030> least<00:04:27.090> three

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
to do giant sets for like at least three

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.730 
to do giant sets for like at least three
weeks<00:04:27.630> but<00:04:27.780> anyway<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.169> point<00:04:28.290> is<00:04:28.410> readers<00:04:28.680> to
