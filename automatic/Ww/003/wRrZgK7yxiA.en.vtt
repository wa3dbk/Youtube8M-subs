00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 emulsion paint made on 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.420
 water-based and have the meaning of such 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.930
 pungent smell just alkyd film 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.210
 lifi 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.590
 moreover , it can be easily removed using 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:18.630
 water soap 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:21.740
 manual labor first in the factory 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.110
 make a colorless composition 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.349
 then I add the pigment that gives 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.270
 compositions need shade emulsion 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.369
 paint consists of water and latex for 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.520
 titanium dioxide resistance 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.010
 potassium calcium carbonate son to protect 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.610
 from mold and other case ingredients 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.610
 of necessity 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.980
 such as anti-rust agents if 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.980
 paint is applied to metal 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.559
 first big mixer is poured clean 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.559
 water 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.780
 then add it thicken or and 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.280
 stabilizer 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.170
 by need in order to paint not 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.479
 stuck to the walls of the tank and and then to 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.060
 the walls of the can in which she will 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.799
 to be stored 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.799
 vacuum wire sucks up all trash 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.600
 then add all to the solution 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.259
 ingredients one by one 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.090
 except latex after each addition 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.070
 the resulting composition carefully 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.600
 shuffle up affects quality 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.220
 paints 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.240
 further the resulting mass is pumped 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.530
 to another tank 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.530
 containing latex 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.710
 after a few hours of careful 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.700
 mixing composition for future 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.700
 paint and ready 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.450
 sample mix of each tank passes 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.450
 careful control 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.240
 Viscometer measures paint viscosity 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.860
 and this test shows how good 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.240
 all substances dissolved compositions 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.950
 it is carried out before overtaking 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.950
 the solution in baku is famous 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.060
 before you add pigment big 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.060
 the tank spend control mixed 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.540
 this way the master makes sure that 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.540
 the tank will come from the correct hearth 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.110
 to check how the paint goes and and 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.730
 put on the test paper 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.980
 on paper I can detect such 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.670
 defects like foam formation or 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.670
 grain 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.400
 and this test determines the concentration 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.400
 paints 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.710
 when the stain dries it carefully 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.710
 is studying with a device called 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.710
 spectrophotometers 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.760
 when all tests passed paint 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.250
 poured into packaging 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.769
 60 percent maxion and paint consists 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.659
 out of the water therefore steel cans cover 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.659
 special anti-corrosion solution 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.700
 a layer is applied on the back of the can 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.700
 glue 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.520
 and wraps a label that's right there 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.520
 arrives 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.220
 the next step is bursting machine each 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.340
 the bank takes its place located 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.209
 strictly under the tap as soon as the bank 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.190
 gaining the right weight 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.190
 the system turns off the paint supply 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.110
 then the bank fall into the hands and the next 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.110
 a car that puts a lid on it 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.900
 and the next unit is called 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.480
 push them down 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.480
 you will be surprised but you will satisfy the ki in the jar 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.290
 the next machine is attaching the can handle 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.290
 u made iron bar 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.629
 it is fixed percent of both sides so 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.629
 lest he jump out 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.520
 now this paint is ready for sale 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.060
 you just have to choose the color you want.
