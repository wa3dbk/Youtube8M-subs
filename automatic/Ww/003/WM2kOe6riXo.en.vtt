00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.049
 Good evening today we will talk about numerical superiority in water polo 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.280
 due numerical superiority has a foul granada resulting in ejection for 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.320
 20 seconds of a player of the opposing team 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.150
 so is the so-called man on TV 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.320
 plays with modern water polo 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.370
 the key strategic importance for her at the end of the acid game 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.369
 final part 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.809
 the percentage of golf so many goals suffered in numerical superiority determines almost 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.809
 always the final result of himym 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 almost all coaches 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.450
 prefer to deploy their team in numerical superiority in 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.830
 so-called 4 2 that is in 4 players on the first line b 2 meters and in 2 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.140
 players outside the height of such power plants then at the door 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.440
 to the line of 4 5 mac 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.460
 this is 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.690
 this arrangement is to be preferred over the so-called media trettre 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.350
 the normal semicircle pattern for those who were offers a better relationship 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.750
 between the danger of every single hh 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.630
 here then 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.190
 between the distance from the door of each single attacker and the distance from the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.649
 teammate 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.289
 such that it must be such 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.049
 will not allow a single defender 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.049
 to mark two players simultaneously 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.260
 the cut extra man screens can be many 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.340
 I mean they must take to unbalance the opposing defense and accept the error 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.210
 with the choice to exploit 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.210
 in this way and send elea the player 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.830
 and of your team after effect are a comfortable shot 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.710
 and then wait for the advantage of the newspaper 6 attacking environment players 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.659
 against six against 5 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.430
 defenders 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.160
 they said the excavations of more men are many and for lucchi one means 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.770
 afa to achieve 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.080
 these two external players 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.729
 keeping the distance unchanged 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.939
 to let out with a pole 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.510
 so if we make 40 move to succeed I have a player 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:16.900
 of the first line 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.510
 offer offset 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.510
 you can all the first line to prevent players from being found 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.629
 novelty fans on the same line de puta let them cover alternated 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.189
 and in the next appointment we will see in particular our tribe% repeat. 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.359
 the excavations can be many usually they are codified but 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.339
 mostly the skill of the pa 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.299
 is that of knowing how to exploit 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.079
 the error with the imbalance of the opposing defense 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.099
 good evening,
