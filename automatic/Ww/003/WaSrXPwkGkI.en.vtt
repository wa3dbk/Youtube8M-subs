00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.719 
basically what the was on the screen you
might<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.010> lot<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> thing

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
might not think it's a lot but the thing

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
might not think it's a lot but the thing
is<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.299> show<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.479> autosave<00:01:07.020> meaning

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
is about it show the autosave meaning

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.780 
is about it show the autosave meaning
that<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.770> probably<00:01:08.040> close<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that there are probably close to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.390 
that there are probably close to
actually<00:01:09.600> being<00:01:10.350> done<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.250> because

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
actually being done with it because

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.980 
actually being done with it because
reason<00:01:11.700> why<00:01:11.820> i<00:01:11.850> say<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.630> they're

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
reason why i say this is that they're

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
reason why i say this is that they're
already<00:01:13.229> got<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> autosave<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.070> everything

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
already got the autosave and everything

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
already got the autosave and everything
up<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:15.060> they're<00:01:15.240> about<00:01:15.900> clothes<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
up I think they're about clothes so that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
up I think they're about clothes so that
has<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.979> mean<00:01:17.100> dirt<00:01:17.310> they're<00:01:17.790> probably<00:01:17.970> got<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
has I mean dirt they're probably got a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.340 
has I mean dirt they're probably got a
little<00:01:18.360> tweaks<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.869> net<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.110> got<00:01:19.259> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
little tweaks and this net they got to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
little tweaks and this net they got to
do<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.680> look<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> piss<00:01:20.520> via<00:01:20.759> vista<00:01:21.270> verse

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
do but look at the piss via vista verse

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.700 
do but look at the piss via vista verse
that<00:01:21.659> vita<00:01:21.840> version<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.259> finally<00:01:22.530> showing

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that vita version or finally showing

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.320 
that vita version or finally showing
that<00:01:22.860> maybe<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> stages<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.850> final

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that maybe that's the stages of a final

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.539 
that maybe that's the stages of a final
process<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:25.830> me<00:01:25.950> when<00:01:26.460> my

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
