runes or fletching your own boat so that

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.950 
runes or fletching your own boat so that
you<00:05:25.460> don't<00:05:25.700> lose<00:05:25.849> a<00:05:25.910> ton<00:05:26.210> of<00:05:26.270> money<00:05:26.450> off<00:05:26.599> of<00:05:26.840> it

you don't lose a ton of money off of it

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.300 
you don't lose a ton of money off of it
because<00:05:27.229> currently<00:05:27.590> it<00:05:27.770> is<00:05:28.010> not<00:05:28.280> very

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
because currently it is not very

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.540 
because currently it is not very
profitable<00:05:29.000> so<00:05:29.860> other<00:05:30.860> things<00:05:31.160> that<00:05:31.250> I<00:05:31.340> want

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
profitable so other things that I want

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.580 
profitable so other things that I want
to<00:05:31.610> get<00:05:31.669> done<00:05:32.080> obviously<00:05:33.080> I<00:05:33.110> want<00:05:33.289> to<00:05:33.380> start

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
to get done obviously I want to start

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.350 
to get done obviously I want to start
chinning<00:05:34.160> but<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.460> only<00:05:34.580> way<00:05:34.729> that<00:05:34.940> I<00:05:34.970> can<00:05:35.090> do

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
chinning but the only way that I can do

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.330 
chinning but the only way that I can do
that<00:05:35.510> is<00:05:35.720> once<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:36.110> get<00:05:36.260> my<00:05:36.289> magic<00:05:36.530> level<00:05:37.010> fairly

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340
