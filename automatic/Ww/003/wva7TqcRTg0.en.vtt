00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
classes actually we don't have a lot of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.689 
classes actually we don't have a lot of
storage<00:00:18.359> over<00:00:18.660> there<00:00:19.039> where<00:00:20.039> kids<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.460> store

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
their projects and what I started to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.429 
their projects and what I started to
notice<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.810> kids<00:00:25.080> would<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
notice is that so kids would have a

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.620 
notice is that so kids would have a
place<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.769> put<00:00:26.160> their<00:00:26.369> project<00:00:26.910> they<00:00:27.119> would

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
place to put their project they would

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.779 
place to put their project they would
literally<00:00:27.930> smash<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.859> project<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.670> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
literally smash the project of one of

literally smash the project of one of
their<00:00:29.880> fellow<00:00:30.090> students<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.900> started<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> think

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
their fellow students I started to think

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.670 
their fellow students I started to think
that<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.759> needed<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.480> something<00:00:33.510> find<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.500> way

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
that I needed to do something find a way

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.709 
that I needed to do something find a way

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
to make these kids realize that they're

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.180 
to make these kids realize that they're
just<00:00:36.750> thinking<00:00:37.200> about<00:00:37.410> themselves<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:38.040> they

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
just thinking about themselves when they

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.770 
just thinking about themselves when they
do<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.820> make<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.149> realize<00:00:39.450> they<00:00:39.629> have

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
do that so make them realize they have

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.549 
do that so make them realize they have
