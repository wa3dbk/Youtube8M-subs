00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello to everyone today we will do 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.110
 evening but not flashy makeup and let's start 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.360
 as always moan I decided this time 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.740
 use cream with tonal 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 lancome effect 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.449
 and I will distribute it in the face when 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.230
 fingers help 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.070
 I usually put it on my face and sponge it. 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 cream spread 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.220
 but if he is not at hand slippers 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 you can do it no worse after 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.140
 the cream will be absorbed on the face 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.180
 such a slight radiance is noticeable that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.809
 looks very handsome gives healthy 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.540
 the color of the face that is so necessary in such 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.129
 time of year and now we take concealer 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.430
 or corrector I took 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.620
 to the rector from lancome and you can cover it up 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.510
 any redness or flaws 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.110
 and also i will use this 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.550
 corrector as a base under the shadow 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.180
 corrector I also apply only 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.780
 using a finger I put it very 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.840
 soft patting movements and 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.939
 amount of powder and put it on face 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.549
 small little such checkers 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.729

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.460
 powder value line neck here you can say 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.990
 that with one stroke of the brush already 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.110
 there is a beautiful facial contour take blush from 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.869
 dior peach such a delicate shade and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.060
 I put on apples of cheeks slightly literally 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.270
 on the nose a little bit can be on the chin 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.000
 you can immediately see the face contour if 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.180
 choose for example hair back and now 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.689
 we already go and take an eye with a brush 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.969
 from stamps and palette of shadows gerlen most 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.040
 I put a light shade on the top 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.040
 eyelid it will be with us as a base 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.030
 brown tint I'll draw 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.220
 wide arrow and stretch it slightly 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.840
 need to be afraid that you will do something 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.010
 wrong because there shouldn't be 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.890
 be clear boundaries of some little more 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.280
 I will apply a light shade on the outside 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.270
 tick eyes and light brown 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.540
 I'll paint over the inner corners and us so 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.210
 the way is a very mild transition 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.990
 a stroke but also a brush surplus and now gently 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.290

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.250
 arrows, too, do not be afraid to do 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.170
 something is wrong because here I donâ€™t 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.300
 there must be no clear 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.830
 boundaries 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.590
 can also be further darkened 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.650

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.430
