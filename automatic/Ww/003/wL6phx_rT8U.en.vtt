into the spinnaker chute by pulling on
the<00:02:17.860> retriever<00:02:18.340> line<00:02:18.730> but<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.329> careful<00:02:19.780> that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
the retriever line but be careful that

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.509 
the retriever line but be careful that
the<00:02:20.019> sail<00:02:20.260> doesn't<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:20.799> caught<00:02:21.069> around<00:02:21.340> the

the sail doesn't get caught around the

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.479 
the sail doesn't get caught around the
trolley<00:02:21.819> as<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.359> could<00:02:22.540> cause<00:02:22.750> damage<00:02:23.489> with
