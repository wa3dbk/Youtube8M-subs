00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.140 
we're doing a generation 1 micro Master
ground<00:00:24.270> shaker<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.829> probably<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.000> my

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
ground shaker this is probably one of my

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.179 
ground shaker this is probably one of my
first<00:00:27.599> might<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:28.140> micro<00:00:28.560> masters

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
first might actually micro masters

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.560 
first might actually micro masters
review<00:00:29.520> so<00:00:29.700> I<00:00:29.730> might<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.059> done<00:00:30.210> one<00:00:30.419> or<00:00:30.540> two

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
review so I might have done one or two

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.770 
review so I might have done one or two
before<00:00:31.640> but<00:00:32.640> can't<00:00:32.850> remember<00:00:33.210> offhand<00:00:33.390> right

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
before but can't remember offhand right

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.600 
before but can't remember offhand right
now<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.649> gonna<00:00:34.770> start<00:00:35.070> doing<00:00:35.280> quite<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
now but I'm gonna start doing quite a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.440 
now but I'm gonna start doing quite a
few<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> anyway<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.120> micro<00:00:39.120> Master

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
articulation I gave these to be honest

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.250 
articulation I gave these to be honest
there<00:02:25.440> isn't

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
there isn't

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.949

to make sure he stands up I mean you'll

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.380 
to make sure he stands up I mean you'll
stand<00:02:34.000> up<00:02:34.120> pretty<00:02:34.360> well<00:02:34.620> but<00:02:35.620> he's<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:37.090> little

bit side heavy and chance almost very
easily<00:02:41.230> just<00:02:41.590> transform<00:02:42.010> like<00:02:42.129> that<00:02:42.340> and

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
easily just transform like that and

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.670 
easily just transform like that and
we're<00:02:42.670> gonna<00:02:42.760> take<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.209> guy<00:02:43.480> into<00:02:43.959> plane

money joints and there we go and just

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.520 
money joints and there we go and just
fold<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.000> wings<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.329> that<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.599> he's<00:02:55.720> some

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
open up this back piece like that I'm

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.500 
open up this back piece like that I'm
Morgan<00:03:26.590> do<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:27.430> with<00:03:27.549> this<00:03:27.670> red<00:03:27.970> section

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
Morgan do and then with this red section

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.210 
Morgan do and then with this red section
that<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:28.959> needs<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.230> fall<00:03:29.530> around<00:03:29.829> open<00:03:30.069> from

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
that just needs to fall around open from

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.559 
that just needs to fall around open from
eight<00:03:30.400> years<00:03:30.549> well<00:03:30.819> I'm<00:03:30.970> just<00:03:31.120> clicks<00:03:31.359> into

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
eight years well I'm just clicks into

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.550 
eight years well I'm just clicks into
place<00:03:32.220> then<00:03:33.220> we<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:36.870> start<00:03:37.870> splitting<00:03:38.349> the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
place then we just start splitting the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.250 
place then we just start splitting the
sides<00:03:38.889> and<00:03:39.430> then<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.819> size<00:03:40.090> just<00:03:40.120> fold<00:03:40.900> down

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
sides and then the size just fold down

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.509 
sides and then the size just fold down
like<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.859> and<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.319> basically<00:03:44.799> almost

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
like that and that is basically almost

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.120 
like that and that is basically almost
there<00:03:45.730> we<00:03:46.000> just<00:03:46.209> then<00:03:46.389> rotate<00:03:47.109> or<00:03:47.349> slide<00:03:47.889> this

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
there we just then rotate or slide this

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.710 
there we just then rotate or slide this
gun<00:03:48.400> back<00:03:48.549> so<00:03:48.790> some<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:48.970> nice<00:03:49.150> little<00:03:49.329> slide

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
gun back so some a nice little slide

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.050 
gun back so some a nice little slide
enjoy<00:03:50.139> that's<00:03:50.380> pretty<00:03:50.680> cool<00:03:50.849> and<00:03:51.849> then<00:03:52.030> we

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
enjoy that's pretty cool and then we

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.349 
enjoy that's pretty cool and then we
open<00:03:52.660> up<00:03:52.780> these<00:03:53.230> little<00:03:53.680> tab<00:03:54.370> pieces<00:03:55.120> out

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
open up these little tab pieces out

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.430 
open up these little tab pieces out
front<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.169> then<00:03:56.290> we<00:03:56.440> do<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> full<00:03:57.000> rotational

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
front and then we do a full rotational

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.979 
front and then we do a full rotational
movement<00:03:59.440> and<00:04:00.430> then<00:04:00.669> these<00:04:01.000> just<00:04:01.450> tap<00:04:01.690> into

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
movement and then these just tap into

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.080 
movement and then these just tap into
two<00:04:02.139> little<00:04:02.290> connectors<00:04:02.769> just<00:04:03.069> down<00:04:03.310> there

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.720 

I'm<00:04:07.090> going<00:04:07.269> to<00:04:07.359> go<00:04:07.569> in<00:04:07.750> there<00:04:08.049> we<00:04:08.200> go<00:04:08.730> creating

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
I'm going to go in there we go creating

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.150 
I'm going to go in there we go creating
some<00:04:09.910> sort<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.090> learning<00:04:10.269> platform<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.980> that

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
some sort of learning platform and that

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.409 
some sort of learning platform and that
is<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.549> transformation<00:04:13.120> then<00:04:13.239> we

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
is it for the transformation then we

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.140 
is it for the transformation then we
have<00:04:13.569> to<00:04:13.720> do<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:13.989> add<00:04:14.200> all<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.970> almonds<00:04:15.970> back

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
have to do is add all the almonds back

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.680 
have to do is add all the almonds back
on<00:04:16.620> but<00:04:17.620> he<00:04:18.579> does<00:04:18.729> have<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.940> few<00:04:19.150> little<00:04:19.389> ports

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
on but he does have a few little ports

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.060 
on but he does have a few little ports
dotted<00:04:20.019> around<00:04:20.139> he's<00:04:20.470> got<00:04:20.590> one<00:04:20.709> here<00:04:20.950> one

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
dotted around he's got one here one

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.580 
dotted around he's got one here one
there<00:04:21.099> one<00:04:22.060> IAM<00:04:22.300> on<00:04:22.419> there<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:23.199> then<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.470> can

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
there one IAM on there and then you can

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.629 
there one IAM on there and then you can
just<00:04:24.360> as<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.479> please<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:27.070> how<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.310> think<00:04:27.550> it

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
just as you please and how you think it

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.700 
just as you please and how you think it
looks<00:04:27.789> best

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
looks best

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.439 
looks best
so<00:04:29.710> that<00:04:29.860> was<00:04:29.979> swivel<00:04:30.310> all<00:04:30.460> around<00:04:30.729> and<00:04:30.940> be

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
so that was swivel all around and be

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.070 
so that was swivel all around and be
free<00:04:31.720> cool

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
free cool

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.629 
free cool
of<00:04:32.440> course<00:04:32.710> now<00:04:32.889> he<00:04:32.949> does<00:04:33.099> come<00:04:33.280> with<00:04:33.460> these

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
of course now he does come with these

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.300 
of course now he does come with these
two<00:04:34.510> little<00:04:34.780> ramps<00:04:35.289> it's<00:04:35.770> just<00:04:35.950> showing<00:04:36.159> they

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
two little ramps it's just showing they

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.010 
two little ramps it's just showing they
didn't<00:04:36.550> figure<00:04:37.120> out<00:04:37.300> some<00:04:37.479> way<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.599> put<00:04:37.960> them

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
didn't figure out some way to put them

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.360 
didn't figure out some way to put them
in<00:04:38.289> when<00:04:38.680> he's<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:38.890> the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
in when he's in the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.879 
in when he's in the
our<00:04:39.430> mode<00:04:39.820> even<00:04:40.630> just<00:04:40.930> underneath<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.590> figure

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
our mode even just underneath the figure

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.469 
our mode even just underneath the figure
or<00:04:42.100> something<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.520> just<00:04:42.580> like<00:04:42.940> at<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.120> clip<00:04:43.360> on

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
or something I just like at the clip on

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.060 
or something I just like at the clip on
the<00:04:43.510> back<00:04:43.720> also<00:04:43.930> just<00:04:44.199> a<00:04:44.260> clip<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.470> moment<00:04:44.860> that

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
the back also just a clip a moment that

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.980 
the back also just a clip a moment that
would<00:04:45.130> have<00:04:45.250> been<00:04:45.340> cool<00:04:45.570> anyway<00:04:46.570> does<00:04:46.780> have

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
would have been cool anyway does have

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.990 
would have been cool anyway does have
two<00:04:47.260> little<00:04:47.440> tabs<00:04:47.949> just<00:04:48.220> in<00:04:48.520> there<00:04:48.669> and<00:04:48.850> then

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
two little tabs just in there and then

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.659 
two little tabs just in there and then
two<00:04:49.419> little<00:04:49.840> ports<00:04:50.530> just<00:04:50.620> that<00:04:51.040> this<00:04:51.280> front

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
two little ports just that this front

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.860 
two little ports just that this front
one<00:04:51.820> goes<00:04:51.970> here<00:04:53.639> get<00:04:54.639> him<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.540> then<00:04:55.690> he's<00:04:55.810> got

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
one goes here get him and then he's got

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.629 
one goes here get him and then he's got
another<00:04:56.110> one<00:04:56.260> just<00:04:56.590> here<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:57.190> one<00:04:57.430> has

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
another one just here this one has

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.280 
another one just here this one has
double<00:04:58.210> connectors<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.690> can<00:04:58.840> link<00:04:59.050> them<00:04:59.229> up

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
double connectors you can link them up

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.879 
double connectors you can link them up
to<00:04:59.530> all<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.770> other<00:04:59.889> micromaster<00:05:00.520> sets<00:05:01.889> then

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
to all the other micromaster sets then

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.100 
to all the other micromaster sets then
you<00:05:03.010> just<00:05:03.220> push<00:05:03.370> them<00:05:03.520> in<00:05:03.639> on<00:05:04.570> its<00:05:04.720> own<00:05:04.930> it

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
you just push them in on its own it

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.040 
you just push them in on its own it
looks<00:05:05.260> actually<00:05:05.530> pretty<00:05:05.770> good<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:07.750> little

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
looks actually pretty good this little

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.810 
looks actually pretty good this little
thing<00:05:08.620> here<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:08.919> can<00:05:09.100> move<00:05:09.310> this<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.669> does

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
thing here you can move this it does

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.490 
thing here you can move this it does
come<00:05:10.030> off<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:10.449> then<00:05:10.510> will<00:05:10.660> tap<00:05:10.870> into<00:05:11.020> any<00:05:11.320> of

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
come off and then will tap into any of

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.990 
come off and then will tap into any of
the<00:05:11.590> other<00:05:11.710> little<00:05:11.860> ports<00:05:12.280> around<00:05:12.639> it

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
the other little ports around it

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.710 
the other little ports around it
hey<00:05:13.720> you<00:05:13.780> can<00:05:14.199> go<00:05:14.350> up<00:05:14.530> there<00:05:14.740> if<00:05:14.830> he<00:05:14.979> wants<00:05:15.720> demo

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
hey you can go up there if he wants demo

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.700 
hey you can go up there if he wants demo
how<00:05:16.870> it<00:05:16.930> would<00:05:17.020> actually<00:05:17.080> land<00:05:17.500> on<00:05:17.680> that

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
how it would actually land on that

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.350 
how it would actually land on that
that's<00:05:18.310> more<00:05:18.460> of<00:05:18.520> a<00:05:18.550> helicopter<00:05:19.000> thing<00:05:19.090> so<00:05:19.270> you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
that's more of a helicopter thing so you

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.400 
that's more of a helicopter thing so you
think<00:05:19.570> maybe<00:05:19.810> they<00:05:20.050> should<00:05:20.199> have<00:05:20.289> actually

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
think maybe they should have actually

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.020 
think maybe they should have actually
made<00:05:21.340> him<00:05:21.490> come<00:05:21.639> with<00:05:21.669> a<00:05:21.789> helicopter

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
made him come with a helicopter

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.560 
made him come with a helicopter
micromaster<00:05:22.840> maybe<00:05:23.139> but<00:05:23.470> who<00:05:23.770> knows

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
micromaster maybe but who knows

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.850 
micromaster maybe but who knows
alright<00:05:25.570> then<00:05:25.780> all<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.169> can<00:05:26.289> do<00:05:26.440> then<00:05:26.590> is<00:05:26.740> you

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
alright then all you can do then is you

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.180 
alright then all you can do then is you
can<00:05:26.979> transform<00:05:27.430> it<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:32.620> then<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.800> can<00:05:32.949> dock

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
can transform it and then you can dock

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.110 
can transform it and then you can dock
them<00:05:33.310> around<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.669> place<00:05:33.850> you<00:05:33.940> know<00:05:34.060> I'm

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
them around the place you know I'm

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.170 
them around the place you know I'm
standing<00:05:34.720> there<00:05:34.960> man<00:05:35.410> in<00:05:35.590> one<00:05:35.710> of<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.889> gums<00:05:36.190> we

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
standing there man in one of the gums we

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.129 
standing there man in one of the gums we
just<00:05:37.389> bring<00:05:37.510> this<00:05:37.630> around<00:05:37.750> it

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
just bring this around it

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.460 
just bring this around it
I<00:05:39.120> think<00:05:40.120> it's<00:05:40.330> film<00:05:40.570> released<00:05:40.780> as<00:05:40.990> a<00:05:41.020> playset

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
I think it's film released as a playset

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.370 
I think it's film released as a playset
he's<00:05:41.620> actually<00:05:41.860> very<00:05:42.039> good<00:05:43.050> this<00:05:44.050> is<00:05:44.110> one

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
he's actually very good this is one

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.920 
he's actually very good this is one
thing<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.650> micro<00:05:44.950> masters<00:05:45.630> really<00:05:46.630> we<00:05:46.750> did

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
thing the micro masters really we did

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.750 
thing the micro masters really we did
excel<00:05:47.320> I<00:05:47.349> actually<00:05:47.650> was<00:05:47.979> just<00:05:48.010> playable<00:05:48.580> 'ti

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
excel I actually was just playable 'ti

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.920 
excel I actually was just playable 'ti
really<00:05:49.560> um<00:05:50.560> I<00:05:50.970> mean<00:05:51.970> I<00:05:52.180> had<00:05:52.360> a<00:05:52.389> few<00:05:52.630> of<00:05:52.660> them<00:05:52.810> as

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
really um I mean I had a few of them as

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.260 
really um I mean I had a few of them as
a<00:05:52.960> kid<00:05:53.169> I<00:05:53.260> didn't<00:05:53.860> have<00:05:53.950> too<00:05:54.099> many<00:05:54.280> I<00:05:54.550> never<00:05:55.120> had

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
a kid I didn't have too many I never had

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.089 
a kid I didn't have too many I never had
none<00:05:55.389> on<00:05:55.479> the<00:05:55.539> actual<00:05:55.780> places<00:05:55.990> actually<00:05:56.530> but

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
none on the actual places actually but

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.219 
none on the actual places actually but
now<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.940> mean<00:05:58.300> this<00:05:58.450> is<00:05:58.630> one<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.780> the<00:05:58.900> best<00:05:59.050> ones

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
now I mean this is one of the best ones

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.570 
now I mean this is one of the best ones
because<00:05:59.349> look<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.650> can<00:05:59.830> do<00:05:59.950> this<00:05:59.979> with<00:06:00.250> a<00:06:00.310> gun

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
because look you can do this with a gun

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.520 
because look you can do this with a gun
you<00:06:00.610> could<00:06:00.970> just<00:06:01.720> get<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.870> few<00:06:02.020> other<00:06:02.080> micro

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
you could just get a few other micro

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.200 
you could just get a few other micro
masters<00:06:02.919> and<00:06:03.099> like<00:06:03.250> man<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.789> guns<00:06:04.000> it's

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
masters and like man the guns it's

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.180 
masters and like man the guns it's
brilliant<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:04.900> you<00:06:05.080> can<00:06:05.229> link<00:06:05.470> them<00:06:05.680> up<00:06:05.830> I

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
brilliant and you can link them up I

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.580 
brilliant and you can link them up I
think<00:06:07.120> I<00:06:07.240> think<00:06:07.510> was<00:06:07.630> a<00:06:07.660> great<00:06:08.020> idea<00:06:08.229> and<00:06:08.500> you

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
think I think was a great idea and you

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.969 
think I think was a great idea and you
can<00:06:08.740> see<00:06:08.949> where<00:06:09.690> like<00:06:10.690> the<00:06:10.780> cyberverse<00:06:11.349> sets

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
can see where like the cyberverse sets

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.920 
can see where like the cyberverse sets
these<00:06:12.280> days<00:06:12.520> gets<00:06:13.120> all<00:06:13.270> the<00:06:13.389> ideas<00:06:13.780> from

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
these days gets all the ideas from

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.839 
these days gets all the ideas from
really<00:06:14.380> this<00:06:14.949> is<00:06:15.130> basically<00:06:15.430> just<00:06:15.520> them

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
really this is basically just them

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.719 
really this is basically just them
reinvented<00:06:16.570> so<00:06:17.500> I<00:06:17.830> think<00:06:18.250> it's<00:06:18.400> pretty<00:06:18.610> cool

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
reinvented so I think it's pretty cool

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.029 
reinvented so I think it's pretty cool
and<00:06:19.300> this<00:06:19.599> one<00:06:19.840> if<00:06:20.110> you<00:06:20.289> can't<00:06:20.500> get<00:06:20.710> it<00:06:20.800> I<00:06:20.889> mean

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
and this one if you can't get it I mean

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.950 
and this one if you can't get it I mean
I<00:06:21.099> don't<00:06:21.160> go<00:06:21.430> too<00:06:21.490> expensive<00:06:22.060> on<00:06:22.389> eBay<00:06:22.720> or<00:06:22.750> any

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
I don't go too expensive on eBay or any

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.510 
I don't go too expensive on eBay or any
for<00:06:23.050> not<00:06:23.169> that<00:06:23.320> I<00:06:23.440> mean<00:06:23.590> yeah<00:06:23.889> he<00:06:24.099> can<00:06:24.220> get<00:06:24.340> it

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
for not that I mean yeah he can get it

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.250 
for not that I mean yeah he can get it
get<00:06:24.699> it<00:06:24.729> because<00:06:25.060> I<00:06:25.240> think<00:06:25.479> the<00:06:25.660> micro<00:06:25.960> masters

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
get it because I think the micro masters

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.730 
get it because I think the micro masters
do<00:06:26.380> add<00:06:26.590> a<00:06:26.620> lot<00:06:27.130> of<00:06:31.260> explaining<00:06:32.260> it<00:06:32.320> really<00:06:32.590> but

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
do add a lot of explaining it really but

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.800 
do add a lot of explaining it really but
it<00:06:32.949> adds<00:06:33.520> a<00:06:33.669> lot<00:06:33.820> of<00:06:34.740> other<00:06:36.240> extra<00:06:37.240> to<00:06:37.630> your

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810
