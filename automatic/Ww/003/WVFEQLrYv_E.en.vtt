00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
doesn't have to be too bad but this is

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.890 
doesn't have to be too bad but this is
ugly<00:02:59.500> when<00:02:59.860> that<00:03:00.010> thing<00:03:00.220> spun<00:03:00.520> around

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
ugly when that thing spun around

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.320 
ugly when that thing spun around
who<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.379> it<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.310> smoke<00:03:03.640> escape<00:03:04.090> that
