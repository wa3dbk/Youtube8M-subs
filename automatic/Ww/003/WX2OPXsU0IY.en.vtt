00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hi my name is from April decades 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.279
 technologies in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.160
 explain how to do to be able to clean 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.139
 a computer and the care that 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.170
 you have to have to not break the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.890
 fans when using a compressor 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.850
 air or an electric blower like this 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.560
 what can we see here 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.510
 must explain the differences and 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.210
 advantages of equipping with one or the other 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.940
 in this case we have a computer that 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.090
 It is quite dirty inside and apart 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.489
 It has dirt and glue of grease 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.129
 are already percudida is seen that this guy 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.379
 of computers was being used 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.340
 in some kind of restaurant or something 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.620
 the style then has a lot of gratitude 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.080
 inside when these kinds of things happen 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.620
 what is ideal is to disarm the 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.469
 computer completely 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.719
 and use cotton and alcohol and try to 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.820
 clean all contacts all 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.010
 platelets to remove the fat 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.280
 maximum what we are going to see here 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.720
 that would be the first part would be that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.310
 It has a lot of dust, there's no dust 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.070
 problem that can be removed with a 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.320
 compressor or an electric blower like 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.049
 I told you earlier the problem is the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.659
 fat the fat has been if you have to 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.119
 clean it by hand and with more than you 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.060
 you are blowing, you will not be able to remove it 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.770
 then let's start with the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.110
 show so you can see how this is 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.390
 obviously before you start 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.090
 I would recommend that if you are allergic to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.700
 dust you wear a mask for not so 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.280
 be breathing the dust and if you can 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.610
 use some glasses to 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.030
 protect you if there is a lot of dust and 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.920
 if you want to protect your ears use 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.710
 a hearing protector like I have here 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.350
 because sometimes with the pressure of 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.350
 congress as I'll show you now 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.090
 It makes a lot of noise, although it is not 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.640
 too much video but it's always good 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.069
 be protected to the maximum what you have 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.590
 to keep in mind is also when 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.980
 one uses alcohol nipple the peak by 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.720
 example as 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.880
 we have here this pressure is very very 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.300
 powerful because the peak is quite fine 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.680
 so if you put a lot of pressure I do not know 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.630
 still does not give much air to the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.130
 most of the port or of the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.600
 source or that kind of thing one can not 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.880
 get going so you always have to 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.190
 give it very delicately and a 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.370
 prudential distance and little by little go 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.410
 approaching and see that everything works if 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.780
 you are seeing that the world on you side 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.210
 is stuck I recommend you to put it 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.010
 oil if you do not know how you do that 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.500
 I recommend that you see other of my videos 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.960
 that explained how that kind of 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.750
 things usually part 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.270
 fans on the pallets and all that 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.730
 on fans that are dry or 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.250
 which are very low quality so if 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.900
 well you know what kind of pc or what 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.430
 state is going to find we have a lot 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.200
 careful to avoid that kind of 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.780
 problems so let's start with the 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.510
 cleaning 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.110
 in my case I will use the protector 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.110
 auditory 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.150
 let's take out the lid 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:22.300
 and as we see we have a lot of land 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.650
 dust and so here we will use the peak 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.650
 and let's start doing something 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.540
 Y 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 we go 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.030
 the neighborhood 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.120
 good as we can see be clean 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.280
 all the stone that had the one that 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.470
 went in and it was pretty good the only thing 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.080
 as we can see here has spots of 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.389
 fat and things that were stuck inside 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.669
 then as I told you before if 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.740
 well one with the compressor can reach 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.639
 get most of the land and all that 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.020
 I was flying here easy to take 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.500
 all that is fat obviously not what 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.820
 you will be able to remove the difference 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.770
 example between using this or the 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.030
 compressor like I had said before the 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.000
 that this out there you can take it to 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.039
 everywhere and if you have a 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.389
 pretty large deposit of several 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.130
 apples and you have to clean many 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.280
 computers with this kind of thing that 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.840
 you can do pretty fast and it's going to be 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.030
 much more practical than the more wearing 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.520
 the compressor that is something much more 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.160
 Big and harder to walk 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.580
 transporting so good basically 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.750
 is that the constant as I told you before 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.090
 beware of the fans that is 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.130
 fundamental, make sure not to break 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.080
 in with the air pressure and treat 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.940
 to do it a little bit more if they are the 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.169
 first times he does it if one does not 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.110
 is used to doing this kind of 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.860
 things to avoid these kinds of problems 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.530
 I recommend you use cabinets that 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.060
 they have filters in all the entries in 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.729
 all the air intakes then of 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.430
 that way avoid that the computed the 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.199
 Finnish land as you see it now and 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.919
 apart from doing a minimum cleaning every 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.540
 three or four times like this we avoid this 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.750
 type of problems depends on the place 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.510
 obviously out there in offices one can 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.630
 be more spaced every six months and if 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.340
 is somewhere that there is a lot of dust in 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.740
 the air and all that for him you have to 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.710
 do once a month once a month 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.510
 then it depends on the environment of 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.490
 where is the computer of the 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.979
 frequency that you are going to use so 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.870
 I hope you liked this video 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.950
 any query down on the 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.470
 comments 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.050
 and if you had any experience with the 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.440
 pc so this type anything not 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.350
 hesitate to comment and share 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.240
 competition with other people as well 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.500
 that we see each other until the next video 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.420
 see you later 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.640
 thanks for binaries thanks for watching 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.100
 this video if you want to see more videos 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.620
 like this you can see my list 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.600
 reproduction is how you can see here 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.750
 We have six hour networking classes 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.640
 duration in this category you have 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.040
 the playlists is by 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:07.040
 example where it says network courses of 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.100
 here you can see that we have 62 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.650
 videos later here where the course says 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.990
 about backup we have videos and here 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.080
 history and windows introduction 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.780
 server we have six videos later if 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.120
 we go down here we have repair courses 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.280
 of pc notebook maintenance etc and 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.770
 here the same thing tells you seven videos ten 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.480
 videos two videos and if you want you can

 you can go down and see more videos by 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.310
 categories 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.140
 if you want to look for some video in 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.690
 You can click here 

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.490
 says the magnifying glass and you can put the word 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.870
 key that you want to find then 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.570
 for example 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.670
 windows windows press center and 

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.040
 automatically shows you all the 

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.500
 videos that are about windows if you want 

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.440
 search for example monitors write 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:00.500
 monitors or monitor or whatever you want and 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.870
