00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.420 
fighter again getting them used to it
again<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.470> basically<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.070> know<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.250> street

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
again so basically you know the street

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.800 
again so basically you know the street
fighter<00:01:31.640> 2<00:01:31.850> characters<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.600> some<00:01:32.659> of<00:01:32.750> the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
fighter 2 characters and some of the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.090 
fighter 2 characters and some of the
Alpha<00:01:33.080> characters<00:01:33.229> we<00:01:33.619> can<00:01:33.770> think<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:33.979> them<00:01:34.070> as

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
Alpha characters we can think of them as

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.889 
Alpha characters we can think of them as
odd<00:01:34.280> we<00:01:34.399> go<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.729> same<00:01:34.850> school<00:01:34.910> hence<00:01:35.810> the

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
odd we go to the same school hence the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.810 
odd we go to the same school hence the
reunion<00:01:36.410> theme<00:01:36.619> whereas<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.460> street<00:01:37.640> fighter

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
reunion theme whereas the street fighter

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.190 
reunion theme whereas the street fighter
three<00:01:38.060> characters<00:01:38.450> kind<00:01:38.660> of<00:01:38.750> different<00:01:39.080> maybe

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
three characters kind of different maybe

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.480 
three characters kind of different maybe
they<00:01:39.320> went<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.619> same<00:01:39.770> school<00:01:39.830> but<00:01:40.190> they

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
they went to the same school but they

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.790 
they went to the same school but they
were<00:01:40.550> in<00:01:40.640> a<00:01:40.700> different<00:01:41.680> department<00:01:42.680> maybe

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
were in a different department maybe

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.200 
were in a different department maybe
they<00:01:42.950> were<00:01:43.039> putting<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.520> engineers<00:01:44.000> or

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
they were putting the engineers or

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.940 
they were putting the engineers or
something<00:01:44.539> while<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.259> street<00:01:45.410> fighter<00:01:45.590> 2<00:01:45.830> and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
something while the street fighter 2 and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.560 
something while the street fighter 2 and
alpha<00:01:46.039> P<00:01:46.280> for<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.640> humanities<00:01:47.090> Department

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
alpha P for the humanities Department

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.999 
alpha P for the humanities Department
something<00:01:47.810> like<00:01:47.929> that<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.440> little<00:01:48.830> bit

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
something like that a little bit

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.529 
something like that a little bit
different<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:49.640> they<00:01:50.000> were<00:01:50.090> kind<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.300> hard<00:01:50.479> to

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
different and they were kind of hard to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.719 
different and they were kind of hard to
do<00:01:50.720> right<00:01:50.899> away<00:01:50.929> but<00:01:51.619> we<00:01:51.770> saw<00:01:51.979> lose<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.520> fan

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
do right away but we saw lose the fan

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.160 
do right away but we saw lose the fan
reaction<00:01:53.210> after<00:01:53.450> court<00:01:53.660> came<00:01:53.810> out<00:01:53.899> a<00:01:53.929> lot<00:01:54.050> of

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
reaction after court came out a lot of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.380 
reaction after court came out a lot of
people<00:01:54.440> assumed<00:01:54.830> wrongly<00:01:55.220> of<00:01:55.520> course<00:01:55.759> that

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
people assumed wrongly of course that

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.240 
people assumed wrongly of course that
that<00:01:56.929> I<00:01:56.990> somehow<00:01:57.440> didn't<00:01:57.800> like<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.039> Street

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
that I somehow didn't like the Street

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.650 
that I somehow didn't like the Street
Fighter<00:01:58.280> 3<00:01:58.520> series<00:01:59.090> or<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.270> hated<00:01:59.479> those

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
Fighter 3 series or I hated those

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.960 
Fighter 3 series or I hated those
characters<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:01.009> yeah<00:02:01.280> that's<00:02:01.520> definitely<00:02:01.729> not

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
characters so yeah that's definitely not

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.550 
characters so yeah that's definitely not
the<00:02:02.149> case<00:02:02.179> so<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.600> wanted<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.899> show<00:02:03.080> them<00:02:03.259> enough

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
the case so I wanted to show them enough

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.080 
the case so I wanted to show them enough
course<00:02:03.830> freedom<00:02:04.160> just<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:04.550> we<00:02:04.759> love<00:02:04.939> these

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
course freedom just like we love these

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.390 
course freedom just like we love these
characters<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:06.560> we<00:02:06.650> have<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.860> adjust<00:02:06.979> them<00:02:07.340> a

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
characters so we have to adjust them a

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.280 
characters so we have to adjust them a
little<00:02:07.520> bit<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.790> get<00:02:07.880> them<00:02:08.000> in<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:09.049> knew<00:02:09.170> we

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
little bit to get them in so we knew we

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.050 
little bit to get them in so we knew we
wanted<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.619> do<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:10.070> characteristic<00:02:10.519> 3<00:02:10.910> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
wanted to do this characteristic 3 the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.130 
wanted to do this characteristic 3 the
first<00:02:11.209> thing<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.450> want<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.630> do<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.810> figure<00:02:11.989> out

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
first thing you want to do is figure out

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.800 
first thing you want to do is figure out
who<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.950> users<00:02:13.340> wanted<00:02:13.730> we<00:02:14.360> kind<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.600> want<00:02:14.750> to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
who the users wanted we kind of want to

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.210 
who the users wanted we kind of want to
make<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:14.989> sort<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.290> standard

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
make a sort of standard

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.580 
make a sort of standard
game<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.570> all<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.750> our<00:02:17.930> research<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.530> you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
game so all of our research that you

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.470 
game so all of our research that you
were<00:02:18.710> messing<00:02:18.860> forward<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.370> seeing<00:02:19.550> emails<00:02:19.910> we

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
were messing forward to seeing emails we

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.630 
were messing forward to seeing emails we
found<00:02:20.690> consistently<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:21.830> ugly<00:02:22.040> my<00:02:22.280> cousin

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
found consistently just ugly my cousin

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.760 
found consistently just ugly my cousin
is<00:02:22.790> just<00:02:23.090> about<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.450> everyone's<00:02:23.750> list<00:02:23.990> so<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
is just about of everyone's list so the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.940 
is just about of everyone's list so the
three<00:02:25.010> were<00:02:25.130> chosen<00:02:25.370> based<00:02:25.700> upon<00:02:26.060> request<00:02:26.950> and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
three were chosen based upon request and

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.380 
three were chosen based upon request and
that's<00:02:28.190> basically<00:02:28.370> have<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> story<00:02:29.150> behind

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
that's basically have a story behind

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.020 
that's basically have a story behind
that<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.920> when<00:02:31.280> we<00:02:31.400> had<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.550> put<00:02:31.670> characters

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
that so when we had to put characters

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.210 
that so when we had to put characters
from<00:02:32.090> three<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.390> four<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:33.500> know<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.710> wondered

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
from three and four you know we wondered

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.470 
from three and four you know we wondered
about<00:02:34.340> how<00:02:34.580> are<00:02:34.700> we<00:02:34.790> going<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.030> squeeze<00:02:35.300> these

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
about how are we going to squeeze these

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.020 
about how are we going to squeeze these
guys<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:35.900> here<00:02:36.050> without<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.470> area<00:02:36.920> fish<00:02:37.100> up<00:02:37.310> so

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
guys in here without the area fish up so

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.430 
guys in here without the area fish up so
basically<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:38.510> did<00:02:38.690> we<00:02:38.810> took<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:39.050> really<00:02:39.260> close

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
basically we did we took a really close

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.750 
basically we did we took a really close
look<00:02:39.560> at<00:02:39.740> these<00:02:39.860> characters<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:40.550> kind<00:02:40.730> of

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
look at these characters we kind of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.040 
look at these characters we kind of
sliced<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.270> diced<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.630> they<00:02:41.720> figured<00:02:41.960> out

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
sliced and diced and they figured out

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.230 
sliced and diced and they figured out
which<00:02:42.170> parts<00:02:42.520> pertain<00:02:43.520> specifically<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
which parts pertain specifically to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.880 
which parts pertain specifically to
period<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.960> which<00:02:45.080> parts<00:02:45.380> are<00:02:45.470> part<00:02:45.740> of<00:02:45.770> their

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
period and which parts are part of their

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.100 
period and which parts are part of their
regular<00:02:45.950> moveset<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.390> when<00:02:47.510> we<00:02:47.600> sliced<00:02:47.870> off

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
regular moveset so when we sliced off

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.300 
regular moveset so when we sliced off
the<00:02:48.230> parry<00:02:48.470> part<00:02:48.709> we<00:02:48.800> didn't<00:02:48.950> destroy<00:02:49.160> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the parry part we didn't destroy the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.460 
the parry part we didn't destroy the
trash<00:02:49.610> can<00:02:49.880> they<00:02:50.720> took<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:50.959> aside<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.350> said

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
trash can they took it aside and said

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.960

how do we arrange this how do we fix
this<00:02:53.090> how<00:02:53.300> we<00:02:53.360> alter<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:54.470> squeeze<00:02:54.830> it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
this how we alter this to squeeze it

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.260 
this how we alter this to squeeze it
into<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.250> street<00:02:55.400> fighter<00:02:55.580> for<00:02:55.850> mold<00:02:56.120> you

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
to kind of change it up a bit so

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.100 
to kind of change it up a bit so
basically<00:03:00.440> found<00:03:00.860> was<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.160> if<00:03:01.370> we<00:03:02.110> really

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
basically found was that if we really

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.540 
basically found was that if we really
focused<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.709> high<00:03:03.800> level<00:03:04.100> players<00:03:04.190> the

focused on the high level players the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.010 
focused on the high level players the
players<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.970> would<00:03:05.180> have<00:03:05.360> used<00:03:05.510> perianal

rotten<00:03:06.350> trick<00:03:06.560> what<00:03:07.130> we<00:03:07.220> find<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.640> we<00:03:07.760> have<00:03:07.880> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
rotten trick what we find is we have the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.440 
rotten trick what we find is we have the
technique<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.660> PX<00:03:09.500> focus<00:03:10.070> cancer<00:03:10.550> which<00:03:11.270> is<00:03:11.390> a

technique of PX focus cancer which is a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.330 
technique of PX focus cancer which is a

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
really high level for a thing is in it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.770 
really high level for a thing is in it
