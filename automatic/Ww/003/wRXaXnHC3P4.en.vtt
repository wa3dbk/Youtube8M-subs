00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.190

 a lot of things but I'm pretty 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.000

 thank you very much from today to all of you 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.240
 for having been in this video for having 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.039
 been practically in each of the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.599
 videos throughout this year and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.430
 good guys let's start this video 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.810
 and mainly let's start with 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.579
 make it very clear that although we are 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.989
 watching background l today we have background 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.760
 obviously a game of what is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 carlos burgos and a game which is 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.329
 very special for me a game which 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.070
 I was saving for a very moment 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.110
 special and guys I think I give it what 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 it pretty much deserves the last 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 video of the year practically merits 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.780
 everything so guys and I have something very 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.980
 special for you as I said a 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.480
 of the best games that I've 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.059
 got in what is caloric 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.430
 we have a game which is a streak 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.440
 of 45 casualties without dying I'm obviously 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.719
 including a strike and after 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.220
 thus a run of low after 20 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.810
 which is the hell track right now 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.310
 what am I thinking if I had 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.750
 dead between each of the gusts such 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520
 I could have been pretty close to 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.350
 what was 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 however it did not was only 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.890
 a streak of 45 in which really that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.360
 I did not expect it, it was just 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.460
 looking for what yet 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.350
 after that I throw it the responso puts 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.520
 very heavy after pulling the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.960
 that showed that he got very 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.030
 uncontrolled and began to be low is 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.290
 a very fast way so guys already 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.460
 The they'll be fine after a little 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.050
 after he has what is he who 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.550
 mestre so guys is going to be what 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.930
 we are looking at the background already obviously and 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.270
 It goes without saying that we are on the map 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 of war with weapon of the weapon that I bring in 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.560

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.970

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.530
 that we get to ask accessories 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.090
 for the unival has always used what 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.860
 what is the look also what is the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.510
 grip we know that the muffler already 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.650
 it brings it by default but good guys 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.730

 some time ago my channel has grown 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.709
 pretty pretty fast especially 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.420

 things then tell them apart from this 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.569
 we know that I accumulated enough 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.430
 special schools one of them and how 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.319
 I already said the most special thing to me is this 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.970
 arrival at 20,000 subscribers and without 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.590
 But we know that we are less than 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.450
 12 hours of what ends this year 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.280
 as I told you, it's the last video that 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.380
 we'll be seeing until 2014 and well 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.090

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.980

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.510
 dilemma in which state been from the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.280
 yesterday because I'm thinking 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.050
 quite since they have accumulated as 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.160
 I tell you two very special things in 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.260
 which I wanted to make a video which 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.310
 it was very worthwhile and we are talking 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.840
 to be and reach 20,000 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.910
 subscribers and how do I tell them the new 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.170
 arrival of the new year also without 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.640
 But, guys, I feel a little bit 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.319
 confused and I felt a little bit 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.000
 overwhelmed since yesterday because 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.470
 Video to make for this date 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.760
 saleh accumulated quite what I 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.230
 were these two occasions for the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.370
 which I feel happy for which 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.410
 I feel grateful to you 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.880
 really for everything they have done and 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.380
 inherited and I want to tell you the following 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.360
 I was not quite sure what to do as 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.830
 special video was not quite sure how 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.880
 try to reward you for everything 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.410
 what has been done 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.640
 however guys there have been people or 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.930
 people I was talking with 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.850
 lately to which I have commented 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.380
 that recommends me something to do to 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.790
 my special and good many people 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.800
 He also commented reviewing some 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.110
 comments that I will never show my 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.880
 face here in the channel or never or so 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.440
 less currently I have not done it 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.910
 I confess that it's been quite 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.739
 boy's time that at the beginning of 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.419
 this year I made a video in 2.0 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.590
 which obviously many people have not 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.300
 seen in fact almost nobody here in the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.250
 channel obviously because it was when I had 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.170
 a much smaller channel and obviously 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.520
 so many people who watched the videos so 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.710
 guys I had planned to make a 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.300
 special 2.0 a video in which I 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.220
 I knew most of you because 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.110
 obviously they have not done it and obviously 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.400
 to put a touch to whatever that was 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.080
 video so guys for me 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.340
 especially my subscribers the idea goes 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.780
 to be the next and the dynamics in the 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.280
 which I want you to help me and I would like 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.320
 that all of you will participate all the 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.390
 that they will see this video will be 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.980
 the following guys in the current lawsuit 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.330
 thematic base the following I intend 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.580
 observe my special 20,000 subscribers 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.650
 and for my special special end of the year 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.230
 new year I intend to ask a question and 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.300
 answers in 2.0 but from answers 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.890
 with my camera with my face like that so 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.570
 you know me to answer all 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.800
 your questions to answer any 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.350
 doubt that you want to leave me 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.940
 precisely in this video the theme goes 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.290
 to be this way as I already tell you I would like 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.730
 that I give you just below 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.740
 extermination in the comments will leave me 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.270
 all your questions any doubt that 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.830
 you have about me and any 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.990

 about me mainly for 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.040
 that to know us a little more I think 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.510
 that the figure of 21 descriptors I do not know anymore 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.950
 already carries a greater responsibility 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.480
 that leads to having a relationship 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.130
 little bit closer to trying to take 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.660
 this much more seriously and obviously 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.979

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.190

 and answers a special take it as 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.070
 20,000 subscribers take it as 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.690
