inside of the terminal we are going to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.799 
inside of the terminal we are going to
type<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> following<00:00:30.000> CH<00:00:30.929> flax<00:00:31.560> space<00:00:32.809> no

type the following CH flax space no
hidden<00:00:35.180> space<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.290> kind<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
hidden space and then this kind of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.110 
hidden space and then this kind of
waveform<00:00:38.149> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.899> type<00:00:40.559> alt<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.370> then

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
waveform you can just type alt and then

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.930 
waveform you can just type alt and then
hit<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.690> letter<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.579> after<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.670> we're

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
hit the letter and after that we're

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.200 
hit the letter and after that we're
going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> type<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.690> slash<00:00:46.670> library

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.299 

slash<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> our

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
slash and then we if we go now to our

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.850 
slash and then we if we go now to our
finder<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.989> user<00:00:55.199> we're<00:00:55.530> currently

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
finder and the user we're currently

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.470 
finder and the user we're currently
using<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:58.710> click<00:00:59.070> enter<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.120> we're

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
using and now click enter here we're

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.490 
using and now click enter here we're
going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.739> library<00:01:02.070> pop-up<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.500> yeah

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
going to see the library pop-up and yeah

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
going to see the library pop-up and yeah
that<00:01:04.920> pretty<00:01:05.100> much<00:01:05.250> solved<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:05.909> problem<00:01:06.420> if

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that pretty much solved my problem if

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.340 
that pretty much solved my problem if
you<00:01:07.619> want<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.130> hide<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.360> library<00:01:09.869> again

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
you want to hide the library again

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580 
you want to hide the library again
