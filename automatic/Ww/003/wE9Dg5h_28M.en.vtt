makes that slapping noise I haven't
necessarily<00:00:51.360> mastered<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> yet<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.860> do

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
necessarily mastered it yet but I can do

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.389 
necessarily mastered it yet but I can do
it<00:00:53.250> um<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> basically<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> do

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it um so basically what you want to do

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
it um so basically what you want to do
is<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> make<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.870> sound<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.140> your

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
is you want to make it sound like your

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:14.380 
is you want to make it sound like your
saxophone<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> stopping<00:00:59.160> something<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.760> I

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.609 

can't<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.750> he<00:01:15.930> can't<00:01:16.140> cuz<00:01:16.320> he<00:01:16.439> can

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
can't do it like he can't cuz he can

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
can't do it like he can't cuz he can
keep<00:01:17.009> his<00:01:17.159> mouth<00:01:17.310> closed<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.030> that's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
keep his mouth closed but that's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.490 
keep his mouth closed but that's
basically<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> technique<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.990> basically

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
basically the technique and basically

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.219 
basically the technique and basically
what<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.830> doing<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.220> your<00:01:26.400> plenti<00:01:27.229> just

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
what you're doing is your plenti just

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.569 
what you're doing is your plenti just
enough<00:01:28.530> pressure<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> horn<00:01:31.579> air

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
enough pressure into the horn air

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.399 
enough pressure into the horn air
pressure<00:01:33.030> into<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.840> make<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.200> reed

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
pressure into the one to make the reed

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.260 
pressure into the one to make the reed
move<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.329> kind<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:38.270> hitting

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
move but you kind of like you hitting

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.539 
move but you kind of like you hitting
your<00:01:39.420> tongue<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.470> reed<00:01:40.650> when<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> putting

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
your tongue on the reed when you putting

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.580 
your tongue on the reed when you putting
that<00:01:41.610> pressure<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.090> there<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.750> like

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that pressure in there it's like like

00:01:43.590 --> 00:02:00.940 
that pressure in there it's like like
you're<00:01:43.740> you're<00:01:44.070> spinning<00:01:44.369> something<00:01:44.670> out

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.050 

it's<00:02:01.950> almost<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.220> you're<00:02:02.369> spinning<00:02:02.579> out<00:02:02.759> gum

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it's almost like you're spinning out gum

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.749 
it's almost like you're spinning out gum
so<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.530> pretty<00:02:04.680> much<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.399> tell<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
so that's pretty much I can tell you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.429 
so that's pretty much I can tell you
guys<00:02:05.939> you're<00:02:06.450> putting<00:02:06.720> your<00:02:06.810> tongue<00:02:06.990> against

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
guys you're putting your tongue against

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.380 
guys you're putting your tongue against
the<00:02:07.470> reed<00:02:07.740> you're<00:02:08.160> putting<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.550> brief<00:02:09.090> amount

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the reed you're putting a brief amount

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.690 
the reed you're putting a brief amount
of<00:02:09.569> strong<00:02:10.380> air<00:02:10.679> pressure<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.190> there<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
of strong air pressure in there and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.890 
of strong air pressure in there and
you're<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:12.300> enough<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.630> make<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
you're just just enough to make the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.890 
you're just just enough to make the
saxophone<00:02:13.590> say<00:02:13.800> something<00:02:17.390> usually<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
saxophone say something usually for the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.259 
saxophone say something usually for the
best<00:02:19.080> effect<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.590> want<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:20.060> overtone<00:02:21.060> with

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
best effect you want to overtone with

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.390 
best effect you want to overtone with
the<00:02:21.450> lower<00:02:21.780> key<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.500> press<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.800> keys<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the lower key so just press the keys the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.059 
the lower key so just press the keys the
lower<00:02:23.580> keys<00:02:27.230> because<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> ad<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.860> be

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
lower keys because you want the ad to be

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.410 
lower keys because you want the ad to be
able<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.400> through<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> whole<00:02:29.880> instrument

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
able to go through the whole instrument

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.840 
able to go through the whole instrument
and<00:02:30.750> hit<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.989> lower<00:02:31.170> pads<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.160> it'll<00:02:32.489> resonate

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and hit the lower pads so it'll resonate

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.420 
and hit the lower pads so it'll resonate
more<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.930> not<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.260> much<00:02:34.410> about<00:02:34.560> key<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.310> this

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
more it's not so much about key for this

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.300 
more it's not so much about key for this
effect<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.480> much<00:02:36.540> more<00:02:37.019> about<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
effect but it's so much more about the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.880 
effect but it's so much more about the
actual<00:02:38.790> effect<00:02:39.150> getting<00:02:39.390> across<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:40.530> doesn't

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
actual effect getting across it doesn't

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
actual effect getting across it doesn't
matter<00:02:41.040> what<00:02:41.190> key<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.400> mean<00:02:41.519> because<00:02:41.670> people

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
matter what key you mean because people

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.890 
matter what key you mean because people
can't<00:02:42.060> really<00:02:42.239> tell<00:02:42.420> what<00:02:42.569> notes<00:02:42.750> you're
