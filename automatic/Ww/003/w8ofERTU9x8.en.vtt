sucked<00:00:19.779> right<00:00:19.869> into<00:00:20.529> the<00:00:20.830> crucible<00:00:21.310> when

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
sucked right into the crucible when

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.870 
sucked right into the crucible when
destiny<00:00:22.210> was<00:00:22.330> released<00:00:22.660> however<00:00:22.840> there<00:00:23.649> is<00:00:23.829> no

arguing<00:00:24.880> that<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.300> crucible<00:00:25.809> is<00:00:25.960> a<00:00:25.989> fairly

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
arguing that the crucible is a fairly

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.190 
arguing that the crucible is a fairly
limited<00:00:27.009> experience<00:00:27.970> lately<00:00:28.840> I've<00:00:29.050> been

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
limited experience lately I've been

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.870 
limited experience lately I've been
thinking<00:00:29.259> of<00:00:29.619> ways<00:00:29.739> that<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:30.099> crucible<00:00:30.610> could

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
thinking of ways that the crucible could

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.420 
thinking of ways that the crucible could
be<00:00:31.029> improved<00:00:31.450> to<00:00:32.169> make<00:00:32.320> for<00:00:32.469> a<00:00:32.529> more<00:00:32.860> robust

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430

rock strike playlist I love playing

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.410 
rock strike playlist I love playing
crucible<00:01:20.469> but<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.859> definitely<00:01:21.159> a<00:01:21.700> slower

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
crucible but it is definitely a slower

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.410 
crucible but it is definitely a slower
way<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:23.170> upgrading<00:01:23.799> your<00:01:23.829> guardian<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.670> that

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
way of upgrading your guardian and that

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.910 
way of upgrading your guardian and that
just<00:01:25.659> makes<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:25.990> feel<00:01:26.200> like<00:01:26.229> a<00:01:26.439> waste<00:01:26.649> of<00:01:26.859> time

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
just makes it feel like a waste of time

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.599 
just makes it feel like a waste of time
sometimes<00:01:27.689> number<00:01:28.689> 3<00:01:28.959> less<00:01:29.350> special<00:01:29.950> ammo<00:01:30.369> and

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
sometimes number 3 less special ammo and

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.510 
sometimes number 3 less special ammo and
players<00:01:31.389> start<00:01:31.869> with<00:01:32.109> less<00:01:32.350> special<00:01:32.770> ammo<00:01:33.069> so

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
players start with less special ammo so

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.669 
players start with less special ammo so
this<00:01:33.729> would<00:01:33.880> create<00:01:34.119> more<00:01:34.329> hot<00:01:35.049> spots<00:01:35.439> around

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
this would create more hot spots around

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.679 
this would create more hot spots around
the<00:01:36.009> map<00:01:36.249> while<00:01:36.520> players<00:01:37.179> are<00:01:37.359> actually

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
the map while players are actually

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.050 
the map while players are actually
competing<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.409> get<00:01:38.560> those<00:01:38.740> green<00:01:39.279> chests<00:01:39.850> open

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
competing to get those green chests open

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.199 
competing to get those green chests open
it<00:01:40.810> would<00:01:41.020> also<00:01:41.459> lessen<00:01:42.459> the<00:01:42.579> frequency<00:01:43.179> of

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
it would also lessen the frequency of

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.870 
it would also lessen the frequency of

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
shotguns fam and fusion rifle spam and I

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.980 
shotguns fam and fusion rifle spam and I
think<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.240> would<00:01:46.299> be<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.479> welcome<00:01:46.749> addition

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
think that would be a welcome addition

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.099 
think that would be a welcome addition

crucible and I think this would be a big

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.690 
crucible and I think this would be a big
step<00:04:07.030> toward<00:04:07.389> providing<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:08.459> speaking<00:04:09.459> of<00:04:09.549> the

improve the crucible now some of these

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:34.949 
improve the crucible now some of these
are<00:05:32.829> really<00:05:33.339> about<00:05:33.729> maximizing<00:05:34.569> the<00:05:34.689> fun

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:34.959 
are really about maximizing the fun

for the raid but the only way to do that

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.339 
for the raid but the only way to do that
is<00:05:51.039> by<00:05:51.339> rating<00:05:52.089> it'd<00:05:52.329> be<00:05:52.509> nice<00:05:52.779> if<00:05:53.079> the

is by rating it'd be nice if the

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.679 
is by rating it'd be nice if the
crucible<00:05:53.889> was<00:05:54.039> another<00:05:54.429> way<00:05:54.819> of<00:05:54.849> doing<00:05:55.539> that
