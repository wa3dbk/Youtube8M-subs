00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.360
 now they began to be much the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.639
 body everything I should do 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.650
 the first to investigate the cause of this here 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.049
 because poses is very widespread can 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.910
 having a cause is oral then for example 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.560
 there are some medicines that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.939
 develop this picture of acne that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.189
 people call eruption here in the report 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.430
 for example vitamins 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.810
 people have the habit of taking 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.490
 multivitamin multivitamins today 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.439
 have to be very tense has to pay 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.630
 much attention in the dosage of vitamin b6 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.410
 and b12 which can be an imposing building 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 of the female b6 and b12 female 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.050
 court code are some substances that have 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.149
 an immunosuppressive effect then exists 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.829
 a research that must be done should 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.050
 look for a specialist to see if 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.410
 have no laboratory changes 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.840
 a deregulated hormone is see the part is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.539
 the gynecologist to see if the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.460
 hormones are okay and check the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.359
 which she eats every day with the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.969
 medicine 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.159
 ok regina figueiredo de sÃ£o paulo she 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.600
 loves to wear makeup but whenever she uses 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.430
 they look like pimples 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.170
 she said I remove the makeup by washing 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 the face what can i do 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.380
 then beyond the washing of the face of people 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.820
 You know, but let me ask you to wash the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.740
 face with any non-soap 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.080
 contemptible of a specific soap 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.720
 for example the ideal for a mixed skin 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.689
 a bit oily would be a 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.530
 soap that removes oil without 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.240
 beat too much 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.340
 So you know that feeling I'm with. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.710
 a feeling of skin and sanitized is 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.150
 this ideal because there are many people who 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.820
 feel that very 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.890
 would be great but not exactly 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.500
 we have the opposite effect when 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.570
 so what drives her 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.750
 use a suitable soap some 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.720
 bases and cosmetics that are feline oil 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.780
 and that already includes sunscreen 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.850
 not to apply the protector 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.740
 then the cream then the base over 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.399
 which obstructs without a doubt 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.399
 a course
