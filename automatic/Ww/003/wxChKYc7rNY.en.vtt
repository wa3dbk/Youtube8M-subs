actually a nice size I don't know the
exact<00:00:58.469> specs<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.579> feels<00:00:59.850> about

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
exact specs on it but it feels about

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.970 
exact specs on it but it feels about
like<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> four<00:01:00.629> inch<00:01:00.809> handle<00:01:01.170> fits<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> hand

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
like a four inch handle fits the hand

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.299 
like a four inch handle fits the hand
very<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:02.670> maybe<00:01:03.650> yeah<00:01:04.680> probably<00:01:05.100> four

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
very well maybe yeah probably four

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.300 
very well maybe yeah probably four
inches<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.820> under<00:01:06.119> maybe<00:01:06.890> blade<00:01:07.890> looks<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
inches just under maybe blade looks to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.710 
inches just under maybe blade looks to
be<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:08.970> about<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> one-to-one

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
be it's just about a one-to-one

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.500 
be it's just about a one-to-one
relationship<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.680> ratio<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.430> two<00:01:11.549> blade<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
relationship a ratio there two blade so

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.630 
relationship a ratio there two blade so
I<00:01:12.659> guess<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.439> short<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.430> feels

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
I guess it's a little short but it feels

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.120 
I guess it's a little short but it feels
uh<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.630> looks<00:01:15.930> when<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.590> open<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:16.950> got<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
uh it looks when it's open it's got a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.929 
uh it looks when it's open it's got a
very<00:01:17.310> good<00:01:17.520> ratio<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.939> it

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
very good ratio there you can see it

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.520 
very good ratio there you can see it
feels<00:01:21.150> good<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.509> hand<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:23.420> friction

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
feels good in the hand the friction

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
feels good in the hand the friction
flipper<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> little<00:01:27.299> Tang<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
flipper here think is a little Tang is a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.100 
flipper here think is a little Tang is a
fixed<00:01:28.710> very<00:01:28.890> nice<00:01:29.040> thumb<00:01:29.430> rest<00:01:29.810> just<00:01:30.810> feels

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
fixed very nice thumb rest just feels

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.050 
fixed very nice thumb rest just feels
really<00:01:31.409> nice<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> hand<00:01:31.890> again<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
really nice in the hand again it's you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.370 
really nice in the hand again it's you
know<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.299> thin<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> have

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
know it's thin and it's going to have

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.890 
know it's thin and it's going to have
hot<00:01:34.619> spots<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:35.070> over<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.670> any<00:01:36.329> heavy<00:01:36.600> duty

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
hot spots all over it for any heavy duty

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.149 
hot spots all over it for any heavy duty
cutting<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:37.470> not<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> use<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
cutting but that's not what you use this

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249

for it did come with kind of a bitey
edge<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.829> not<00:01:40.979> terrible<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.790> will<00:01:42.479> put<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
edge it's not terrible I will put a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.260 
edge it's not terrible I will put a
wicked<00:01:43.140> edge<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.159> surprisingly<00:01:44.970> it's

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
wicked edge on it but surprisingly it's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.920 
wicked edge on it but surprisingly it's
expected<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:47.240> much<00:01:48.240> worse<00:01:48.450> edge<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.840> it's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
expected to be much worse edge and it's

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.630 
expected to be much worse edge and it's
not<00:01:49.079> bad<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.070> see<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:50.430> flat

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
not bad at all you can see it's flat

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880 
not bad at all you can see it's flat
ground<00:01:51.060> from<00:01:51.390> about<00:01:51.630> midpoint<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.829> I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
ground from about midpoint here so I

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.170 
ground from about midpoint here so I
guess<00:01:53.009> making<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.430> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.759> saber<00:01:54.000> grind

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
guess making that kind of a saber grind

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.609 
guess making that kind of a saber grind
and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.840> flat<00:01:55.079> ground<00:01:55.350> at<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.530> bottom

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
and then just flat ground at the bottom

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.460 
and then just flat ground at the bottom
I<00:01:56.649> have<00:01:57.490> no<00:01:57.700> idea<00:01:57.970> what<00:01:58.149> steel<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.570> is<00:01:58.600> nor<00:01:59.290> do<00:01:59.380> I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
I have no idea what steel it is nor do I

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.279 
I have no idea what steel it is nor do I
