00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.480
 very good all and united this new 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.790
 grand theft video car in which you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.500
 I bring something very different to everything that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.150
 you have seen on my channel so far 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.279
 it would be a little the continuation 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.439
 of the previous video to this that was the one of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.939
 the memories of the saga gta the one of the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.650
 best memories that I spoke 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.210
 little of each iv gta in which I made you 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.340
 that question of what is your 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.500
 preferred my opinion was a very video 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.630
 interesting and in this case I wanted a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.610
 little continue that but addressing the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.590
 subject in a different way so that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 I want you to concentrate jce what you 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
 I'm going to tell you to try to imagine it 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.860
 so I'm not going to put any image 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.449
 just a white background so that 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.100
 let's visualize everything that I am going to narrate 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.900
 but before I conceive and I would like 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.600
 ask you do not know dalai if you 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.600
 like with nothing more than April 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 we start 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.309
 the objective is clear and I must prepare 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.289
 For that, I'm going to the armory and 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.140
 I buy a bulletproof vest without ammunition 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.990
 for me no the m4 rifle and also the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.490
 rocket launcher before going for the gift I 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.770
 I went through the hospital to get 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.810
 some products that improve my health and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.700
 so make sure the victory is over 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.500
 that I go straight home where I 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.659
 find with my two gun mates 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.149
 We are all prepared to receive 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.950
 our great enemy some noises 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.289
 they sound outside and it seems what they would be 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.909
 some cars parking definitely 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.860
 a group of people including the great 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.679
 enemy enter through the door of my house 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.330
 I have him so close and now he sees so far 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.700
 since we are at a huge disadvantage 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.920
 numeric being us only three and 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.990
 them a number that did not reach to count 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.819
 before any dispute and tried 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.220
 solve things through dialogue 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.350
 without reaching the weapons but it seems that 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.179
 the more I speak the more the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.770
 environment and sooner it seems that it's going to 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.869
 start dancing without knowing how it 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.360
 happened one of my two companions to 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.619
 It seems that he is not such a companion and he reveals 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.020
 half of the conversation that has 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.970
 maintained contact with the great enemy and 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.530
 who are more convinced by his arguments 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.430
 amazing way who I thought that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.830
 It was my partner 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.300
 and my friend is really a traitor 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.220
 it seems that now I have two big 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.380
 enemies and many other thugs that 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.060
 down and on my side are only me and my 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.250
 another partner facing such a disadvantage 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.950
 numerica I quickly address my 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.020
 office where I keep all the money and 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.180
 I am ready to protect him and try 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.160
 take a correct position to finish 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.320
 with them two and all the bullies 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.120
 they begin to enter the latter one after 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.860
 another and thanks to the ammunition that was 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.750
 I bought before I got home 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.430
 shoot everyone down with the m4 rifle at 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.470
 through the door he managed to see the traitor 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.790
 and almost without thinking he pulled the weapon 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.100
 great that I bought before coming 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.110
 rocket launcher aimed directly at his 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.090
 head and I try to keep the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.040
 weapon although it costs me because it weighs 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.959
 quite once stabilized I 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.760
 I have to squeeze the trigger I squeeze 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.320
 and the huge rocket has fired towards 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.540
 I charge forward while another 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.400
 although it looks like it's going right to your face 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.040
 explodes a few meters of him on the wall 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.959
 he is very hurt but he is not dead 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.000
 shot the second rocket this yes it seems 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.620
 lift up and so it does in the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.750
 center of your chest although the explosion 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.270
 he does not let me see him I will have dismembered him 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.760
 complete a just death for a 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.210
 unfair traitor I have taken off one over 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.980
 of the 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.630
 but it remains to kill the one that in principle 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.550
 it's going to be the only goal, it's not necessary 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.500
 that they look for it since it is right in the 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.690
 door to the house with two thugs to the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.790
 sides at this time I wonder where 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.650
 is my other partner because I do not 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.750
 help that makes it look like I have to 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.220
 end up with everything and practically 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.320
 the rambo I go out with the mini gum and 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.150
 he peppered everyone leaving their bodies 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.340
 unrecognizable by the large amount of 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.680
 bullets that I have put them are dead 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.330
 both of them and my partner appears 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.210
 hidden as an absolute coward 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.690
 Although one of all has ended, I'm not 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.690
 import 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.260
 is what I just told you is something very 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.450
 special for me it's about the moment 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.579
 most exciting that I've spent playing 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.650
 Specifically, this is the last 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.299
 mission of grand theft auto vice city and 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.189
 although everything does not exactly happen as 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.510
 I have told you in my head yes that 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.099
 I lived like that I remember I had 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.989
 approximately 7 years and it was the first 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.730
 Once a video game was over, it was because 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.170
 the 2002 since then I passed gta 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.420
 vice and so many times that I do not even remember 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.579
 but what I do remember is that only in 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.799
 this one that I've told you things happened 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.930
 as I have told you called 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.489
 imagination calling madness calling 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.380
 as you want but in this is the 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.300
 essence where do I want to go with 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.860
 this video I would like you to tell me 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.289
 the best time you have spent 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.789
 playing a gta but I want you to 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.340
 you have details describing 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.570
 exactly how you felt playing 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.070
 it is clear that I will not be able to read the 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.900
 one hundred percent of those who write to me 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.370
 but I'm going to read all the 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.320
 can because I know I'm going to enjoy 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.389
 reading and I know that many of you 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.280
 you will also enjoy not only 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.660
 writing but also reading the 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.160
 from other people and more I expect you 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.900
 have liked you do not know how to leave your 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.349
 comment and greetings and even the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.130
 next 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.130
 goodbye
