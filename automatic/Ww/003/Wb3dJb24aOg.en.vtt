explaining<00:01:30.240> from<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> lap<00:01:31.140> band<00:01:31.320> has<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
explaining from so the lap band has a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
explaining from so the lap band has a
little<00:01:31.710> reservoir<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.970> inflate<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
little reservoir and you can inflate it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.780 
little reservoir and you can inflate it
like<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> balloon<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.950> idea<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.579> if

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
like a balloon and the idea is that if

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.450 
like a balloon and the idea is that if
you<00:01:35.909> change<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.600> balloon<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.130> change

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you change that balloon you can change

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
you change that balloon you can change
the<00:01:38.700> squeeze<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.170> idea<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the squeeze and the idea is you get it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.399 
the squeeze and the idea is you get it
just<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.630> then<00:01:42.630> you'll<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
just right then you'll have just the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
just right then you'll have just the
weight<00:01:43.590> loss<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.220> want<00:01:44.460> you'll<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.759> able

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
weight loss that you want you'll be able

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.170 
weight loss that you want you'll be able
to<00:01:45.030> eat<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.570> enough<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.200> too<00:01:46.409> much<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.180> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to eat just enough not too much and it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.510 
to eat just enough not too much and it
won't<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.450> too<00:01:48.689> tight<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> also<00:01:50.040> won't<00:01:50.340> be

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
won't be too tight but it also won't be

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
won't be too tight but it also won't be
too<00:01:50.700> loose<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.750> kind<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
too loose and if you get to that kind of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.530

in Washington and I'm from Oregon um

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.060 
in Washington and I'm from Oregon um
during<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.780> time<00:02:16.960> I<00:02:16.990> was<00:02:17.290> thirsty<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.920> was

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
during that time I was thirsty it was

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.040 
during that time I was thirsty it was
breastfeeding<00:02:18.430> my<00:02:18.640> baby<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:19.270> was<00:02:19.480> incredibly

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
breastfeeding my baby it was incredibly

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.740 
breastfeeding my baby it was incredibly
thirsty<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.820> was<00:02:21.820> drinking<00:02:22.270> vomiting

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
thirsty and I was drinking vomiting

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.390 
thirsty and I was drinking vomiting
drinking<00:02:23.140> vomiting<00:02:23.530> during<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.010> night<00:02:24.160> just

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
drinking vomiting during the night just

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.680 
drinking vomiting during the night just
waiting<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.850> get<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> rest<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.450> Phil

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
waiting to get the rest of this Phil

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.080 
waiting to get the rest of this Phil
taken<00:02:26.020> out<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:27.070> think<00:02:27.400> probably<00:02:27.580> caused

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
taken out that I think probably caused

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.810 
taken out that I think probably caused
my<00:02:28.870> band<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.380> slip<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.130> had<00:02:30.280> been<00:02:30.400> sutured

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
my band to slip so it had been sutured

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.270 
my band to slip so it had been sutured
in<00:02:30.940> place<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.500> prevent<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.100> complications

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
in place so to prevent the complications

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.760 
in place so to prevent the complications
I<00:02:33.610> supposed<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.330> slip<00:02:34.570> right<00:02:34.720> yeah<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.200> during

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
I supposed to slip right yeah and during

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.260 
I supposed to slip right yeah and during
that<00:02:35.830> time<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.130> think<00:02:36.400> those<00:02:36.580> sutures<00:02:36.760> probably

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
that time I think those sutures probably

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.480 
that time I think those sutures probably
tore<00:02:37.480> even<00:02:37.780> though<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.870> didn't<00:02:38.170> feel<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.650> at<00:02:39.010> all

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
tore even though I didn't feel it at all

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.260 
tore even though I didn't feel it at all
mmm<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.920> probably<00:02:42.100> about<00:02:42.460> six<00:02:43.120> months

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
mmm and so probably about six months

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.850 
mmm and so probably about six months
after<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.720> is<00:02:44.110> when<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.290> started<00:02:44.350> really

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
after that is when I started really

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.010 
after that is when I started really
experiencing<00:02:45.550> problems<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.240> may<00:02:46.690> be<00:02:46.750> need

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
experiencing problems that may be need

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.720 
experiencing problems that may be need
