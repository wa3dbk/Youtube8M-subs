where<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.870> our<00:00:37.230> light<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.730> in

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
where we have our light in here so in

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.540 
where we have our light in here so in
the<00:00:39.059> moment<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.780> working<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.440> solar<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the moment we are working with solar to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
the moment we are working with solar to
get<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> light<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> show<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
get the light in here and to show you

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.920 
get the light in here and to show you
that<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.460> easy<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.940> store<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that it's so easy to store the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.010 
that it's so easy to store the
electricity<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.800> batteries<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:48.059> convert<00:00:48.840> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
electricity in batteries to convert it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.580 
electricity in batteries to convert it
to<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:50.250> power<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> 110

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
to the power you want to this one is 110

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.130 
to the power you want to this one is 110
this<00:00:53.129> black<00:00:53.430> box<00:00:53.699> here<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.300> brought<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.840> us

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
this black box here we brought with us

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.709 
this black box here we brought with us
from<00:00:55.350> Germany<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.210> convert

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
from Germany and this one will convert

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.040 
from Germany and this one will convert
not<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.170> 110<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.420> 220<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.780> that's

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
not to 110 but to 220 because that's

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590 
not to 110 but to 220 because that's
what<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.440> use<00:01:01.590> over<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.129> Germany<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
what we use over in Germany and then it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200 
what we use over in Germany and then it
goes<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.129> house<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.030> have

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
goes up there to the house and we have

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.710 
goes up there to the house and we have
our<00:01:06.420> plugins<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.740> run<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.510> TV<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
our plugins and you can run your TV and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.550 
our plugins and you can run your TV and
your<00:01:09.780> computer<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:11.720> everything<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
your computer and your everything but is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.190 
your computer and your everything but is
not<00:01:13.830> using<00:01:14.369> too<00:01:14.610> much<00:01:14.790> power<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.720> run<00:01:15.930> on

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
not using too much power you can run on

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.700 
not using too much power you can run on
solar<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:18.140> usually<00:01:19.140> when<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.530> have

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
solar and this way usually when we have

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950 
solar and this way usually when we have
weather<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.310> today<00:01:20.549> beautiful<00:01:21.450> sunshine

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
weather like today beautiful sunshine

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.710 
weather like today beautiful sunshine
and<00:01:22.170> wind<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:23.009> use<00:01:23.189> no<00:01:23.520> electricity<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and wind we use no electricity from the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.710 
and wind we use no electricity from the
grid<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:25.409> grid<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.549> grid<00:01:26.580> means<00:01:27.060> the

moment our meter is does not run at all

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
moment our meter is does not run at all
because<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> our<00:01:36.329> electricity<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:37.350> the

freezer for the refrigerator everything

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.350 
freezer for the refrigerator everything
comes<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> batteries<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.210> have

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
comes out of the batteries when we have

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.440 
comes out of the batteries when we have
bad<00:01:42.570> days<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.530> happens<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.939> no<00:01:45.119> Sun

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
bad days what happens to there is no Sun

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.859 
bad days what happens to there is no Sun
no<00:01:45.689> wind<00:01:46.350> then<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.369> after<00:01:47.850> two<00:01:48.060> days<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
no wind then about after two days the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.560 
no wind then about after two days the
batteries<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.500> empty<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.820> shut<00:01:50.880> down<00:01:51.119> by

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
batteries are empty so they shut down by

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
batteries are empty so they shut down by
themselves<00:01:52.049> nothing<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.710> happen<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.579> then

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
themselves nothing can happen but then

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.179 
themselves nothing can happen but then
we<00:01:53.939> need<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.360> power<00:01:54.540> from<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.049> grid<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.500> so

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
we need the power from the grid and so

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.850 
we need the power from the grid and so
we<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.670> an<00:01:56.880> electricity<00:01:57.360> bill<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.710> we

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
we have an electricity bill and what we

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.730 
we have an electricity bill and what we
pay<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.100> electricity<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.969> month<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:01.020> sometimes

pay for electricity a month is sometimes

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.679 
pay for electricity a month is sometimes
two<00:02:02.040> dollars<00:02:02.399> sometimes<00:02:03.000> eight<00:02:03.299> dollars
