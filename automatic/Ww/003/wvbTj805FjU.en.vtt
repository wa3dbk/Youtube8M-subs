00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.950
 of character as such but we do it 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.030
 happening very well and good guys in this 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.370
 I have a new occasion 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.130
 written for minecraft and 0.11 point zero 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.650
 and 0.12 point x in x I mean 0 point 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.230
 before point 1.2 point 3 to the version 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.150
 0.11 point 9 and nothing extreme is that of 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.039
 spring in snake or in Spanish that would be 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.750
 run and crouch before anything I want 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.150
 thank you aculco troy for giving me the 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.740
 opportunity to record your motorcycle your channel 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.660
 will be in the description and download 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.760
 equally in the description and nothing 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.660
 now you will wonder things because you are 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.969
 in what would be a file manager 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.829
 good guys this mode needs a 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.239
 texture and texture is not installed in 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.190
 block launcher has to be installed 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.840
 from a file manager the manager of 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.190
 files that today are using guys 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.930
 is the explorer 'parade' that we have 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.090
 here that is this one here is a good 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.829
 file manager and they are going to litigate 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.140
 so your explorer can search for it 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.090
 and nothing we're going to get into what would be 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.530
 the explorer let's go 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.989
 well first of all they are going to download 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.790
 the mod is in a folder a zip folder 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.590
 and you have to show them in the folder 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.540
 downloads we are going to go to what would be 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.960
 download let's find what would be the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.119
 binder 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.280
 spring in snake in this case I have it 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.290
 down here and we're going to give you more 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.490
 in more we are going to give him to extract and 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.900
 let's give in ok 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.400
 after those guys, well, me the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.560
 shooting on machine and it goes up it's going to 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.820
 write because I already had it on ok and 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.650
 then overwrite if not them 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.909
 it appears that do not worry good 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.530
 after that they have to appear 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.450
 a folder that we have here that is the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.130
 displina snake already decompressed us 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.530
 let's put and we have three files 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.780
 we have a folder a process of 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.580
 installation and mode the folder is 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.200
 guys we're going to take it and we're going to give it 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.970
 in cutting copy I recommend them 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.130
 cut to not have so many 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.110
 unnecessary files and nothing we're going to 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.929
 give in cut we're going to get out of here 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.030
 and we're going to put the folder here from 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.310
 our file manager folder in 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.229
 this case would be in the beginning what are we going to 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.610
 hit here guys and again I will give 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.830
 here to overwrite because I already had it 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.869
 and nothing this folder contains what 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.119
 it would be buttons that serve to be able 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.220
 do what would be the way to run and 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.039
 duck and now we are not if it was what 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.450
 it would be good and after this no 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.459
 we have to do nothing we are going to leave 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.319
 we're going to go to blog launcher and wells to 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.180
 the free version because the pro almost does not 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.860
 It works for me and after these guys 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.030
 we're going to get in, let's wait 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.500
 we are going to go to the key of 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.570
 minecraft we are going to go to administer 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.380
 the mod pits writes we are going to give to 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.030
 to import 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.890
 after this we go to storage 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.170
 local we look for the nickname in this case what 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.180
 I have in download and we go here in the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.910
 navy spring folder curto droid and what 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.500
 we have here after these guys we 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.870

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.390
 they are serving the buttons ok not 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.490
 we went out let's go out we were going to 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.290
 enter a world let it go down a bit 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.610
 This is because it is very hard to hear and nothing 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.530
 as we can see we are shown two 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.000
 buttons here that would be one that is 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.380
 down and not what is done up 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 which is downwards serves to be able 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.770
 duck guys like we can see 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.060
 and well the second is to be able to run 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.310
 as we can see right now I'm running 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.280
 little faster and I take it off I do not run 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.200
