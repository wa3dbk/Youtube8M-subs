now

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.310 

in<00:00:08.460> sync

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.890 

so<00:00:13.240> it's<00:00:14.240> the<00:00:14.420> Ehime<00:00:15.250> your<00:00:17.590> 125<00:00:18.590> watt<00:00:18.860> heater<00:00:19.310> I

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
so it's the Ehime your 125 watt heater I

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.600 
so it's the Ehime your 125 watt heater I
have<00:00:20.900> it<00:00:21.020> in<00:00:21.140> here<00:00:21.170> with<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.590> bubbler<00:00:22.189> to<00:00:22.430> keep

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
have it in here with a bubbler to keep

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.480 
have it in here with a bubbler to keep
water<00:00:23.029> moving<00:00:23.950> monitoring<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.040> temperature

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
water moving monitoring the temperature

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.089 
water moving monitoring the temperature
with<00:00:25.640> this<00:00:25.820> I<00:00:26.619> obviously<00:00:27.619> have<00:00:27.950> to

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
with this I obviously have to

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.920 
with this I obviously have to
recalibrate<00:00:28.579> it<00:00:29.000> because<00:00:29.270> I<00:00:29.419> have<00:00:29.570> it<00:00:29.689> set<00:00:29.899> to

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
recalibrate it because I have it set to

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.060 
recalibrate it because I have it set to
78<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:30.619> it's<00:00:30.980> at<00:00:31.160> 80<00:00:31.520> 2.2<00:00:32.320> so<00:00:33.320> it's<00:00:33.739> kind<00:00:33.950> of

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
78 and it's at 80 2.2 so it's kind of

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:43.259 
78 and it's at 80 2.2 so it's kind of
pain<00:00:34.250> in<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.489> ass<00:00:35.020> but<00:00:36.020> oh<00:00:36.399> well<00:00:40.960> yeah<00:00:41.960> I

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
pain in the ass but oh well yeah I

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.299 
pain in the ass but oh well yeah I
probably<00:00:44.269> put<00:00:44.449> my<00:00:44.600> heater<00:00:45.109> back<00:00:45.679> a<00:00:45.739> deep<00:00:46.100> end

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
probably put my heater back a deep end

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.669 
probably put my heater back a deep end
you<00:00:46.640> won't<00:00:47.539> have<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.750> as<00:00:48.050> far<00:00:48.260> away<00:00:48.410> from<00:00:48.469> here

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
you won't have it as far away from here

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:49.529 
you won't have it as far away from here
as<00:00:48.890> possible

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
as possible

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.430 
as possible
because<00:00:50.539> your<00:00:50.629> fish<00:00:50.809> aren't<00:00:51.019> gonna<00:00:51.109> be<00:00:51.289> like

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
because your fish aren't gonna be like

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.509 
because your fish aren't gonna be like
just<00:00:51.469> around<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.219> heater<00:00:52.429> so<00:00:56.199> yeah<00:00:57.199> I<00:00:57.649> mean

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
just around the heater so yeah I mean

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.130 
just around the heater so yeah I mean
this<00:00:58.640> might<00:00:58.850> be<00:00:58.999> too<00:00:59.149> small<00:00:59.449> but<00:00:59.629> I<00:00:59.839> don't

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
this might be too small but I don't

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.049 
this might be too small but I don't
think<00:01:00.320> that's<00:01:01.239> have<00:01:02.239> to<00:01:02.420> do<00:01:02.539> with<00:01:02.719> that<00:01:03.760> cuz<00:01:04.760> it

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
think that's have to do with that cuz it

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.530 
think that's have to do with that cuz it
should<00:01:05.300> be<00:01:05.449> accurate<00:01:05.659> enough<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:07.479> you<00:01:08.479> know

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
should be accurate enough to you know

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.440 
should be accurate enough to you know

have to do is take this and set it to
the<00:02:21.870> measured<00:02:22.790> temp<00:02:29.000> make<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> red<00:02:30.329> one<00:02:30.769> push

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
the measured temp make the red one push

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:39.130 
the measured temp make the red one push
it<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.099> your<00:02:32.250> desired<00:02:32.400> temperature<00:02:34.549> on<00:02:36.379> focus

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
it to your desired temperature on focus

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
it to your desired temperature on focus
and<00:02:40.140> you'd<00:02:40.290> set<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> temperature<00:02:41.129> that

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and you'd set it to the temperature that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.460 
and you'd set it to the temperature that
it<00:02:41.370> was<00:02:41.459> at<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.940> that's<00:02:42.090> about<00:02:43.790> 83<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:45.030> now

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
set it to the temperature you want I'm

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.589 
set it to the temperature you want I'm
gonna<00:02:56.400> do<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.910> oh<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:59.310> said<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.849> using

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
this little red thing on the other side

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.260 
this little red thing on the other side
okay<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> get<00:03:03.090> it

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.700 

and<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:10.690> plug<00:03:10.930> here<00:03:11.290> I'm<00:03:11.410> gonna<00:03:11.530> put

all<00:03:40.599> right<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:44.040> before<00:03:45.660> you're<00:03:46.660> going<00:03:46.840> to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
all right so before you're going to

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.770 
all right so before you're going to
right<00:03:47.140> in<00:03:47.379> between<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.920> alright<00:03:48.599> so<00:03:49.599> now<00:03:49.750> it's

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
right in between it alright so now it's

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:59.190 
right in between it alright so now it's
such<00:03:50.080> my<00:03:50.290> desired<00:03:50.680> temp<00:03:54.690> 78<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:57.489> it<00:03:58.480> should<00:03:58.780> be

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
such my desired temp 78 and it should be

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.380 
such my desired temp 78 and it should be
calibrated<00:03:59.920> but<00:04:00.220> then<00:04:00.549> again<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:00.849> never<00:04:00.940> let<00:04:01.299> it

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
calibrated but then again I never let it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.930 
calibrated but then again I never let it
eat<00:04:01.569> up<00:04:01.720> with<00:04:02.010> what<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.099> was<00:04:03.220> about<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.730> eat<00:04:03.790> up

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940
