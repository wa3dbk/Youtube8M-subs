00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
latest forged creation war machine this

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.140 
latest forged creation war machine this
is<00:00:12.139> a<00:00:12.230> classic<00:00:12.709> gears<00:00:12.950> of<00:00:13.070> war<00:00:13.250> one<00:00:13.459> map<00:00:13.670> remade

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
is a classic gears of war one map remade

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.630 
is a classic gears of war one map remade
in<00:00:14.480> Ford<00:00:14.929> for<00:00:15.200> halo<00:00:15.469> reach<00:00:15.710> and<00:00:16.070> it's

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
in Ford for halo reach and it's

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.890 
in Ford for halo reach and it's
something<00:00:17.000> that<00:00:17.150> I'm<00:00:17.360> very<00:00:17.390> proud<00:00:17.840> of

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
something that I'm very proud of

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.870 
something that I'm very proud of
actually<00:00:18.439> it<00:00:18.650> took<00:00:18.830> a<00:00:18.980> lot<00:00:19.130> of<00:00:19.189> time<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:19.759> make

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
actually it took a lot of time to make

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.280 
actually it took a lot of time to make
sure<00:00:20.060> that<00:00:20.240> I<00:00:20.270> got<00:00:20.509> the<00:00:20.630> proportions<00:00:21.200> right

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
sure that I got the proportions right

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.250 
sure that I got the proportions right
and<00:00:21.710> that<00:00:22.519> they<00:00:22.640> worked<00:00:22.939> in<00:00:23.210> halos<00:00:23.689> framework

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
and that they worked in halos framework

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.730 
and that they worked in halos framework
such<00:00:24.680> as<00:00:24.890> things<00:00:25.160> like<00:00:25.250> movement<00:00:26.439> just<00:00:27.439> the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
such as things like movement just the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.250 
such as things like movement just the
evade<00:00:28.039> speed<00:00:28.460> versus<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.359> evade<00:00:29.630> speed<00:00:29.960> and

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
evade speed versus the evade speed and

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.100 
evade speed versus the evade speed and
gears<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:30.980> war<00:00:31.189> is<00:00:31.460> a<00:00:31.730> lot<00:00:32.269> faster<00:00:32.509> and<00:00:32.780> it's<00:00:33.019> a

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
gears of war is a lot faster and it's a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.410 
gears of war is a lot faster and it's a
lot<00:00:33.290> more<00:00:33.320> instant<00:00:33.949> so<00:00:34.580> originally<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:35.360> thought

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
lot more instant so originally I thought

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.850 
lot more instant so originally I thought
okay<00:00:35.900> maybe<00:00:35.930> we'll<00:00:36.140> have<00:00:36.230> a<00:00:36.290> like<00:00:36.559> unlimited

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
okay maybe we'll have a like unlimited

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.950 
okay maybe we'll have a like unlimited
evade<00:00:37.309> just<00:00:37.820> like<00:00:38.030> there<00:00:38.300> was<00:00:38.480> in<00:00:38.690> Gears<00:00:38.870> of

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
evade just like there was in Gears of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.889 
evade just like there was in Gears of
War<00:00:39.050> this<00:00:39.950> pretty<00:00:40.579> much<00:00:40.790> broke<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.239> game<00:00:41.390> this

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
War this pretty much broke the game this

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.420 
War this pretty much broke the game this
is<00:00:42.050> being<00:00:42.230> played<00:00:42.440> on<00:00:42.469> my<00:00:42.649> custom<00:00:43.040> gears<00:00:43.250> of

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
is being played on my custom gears of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.740 
is being played on my custom gears of
war<00:00:43.579> game<00:00:43.610> type<00:00:44.030> there's<00:00:44.270> a<00:00:44.329> link<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.629> the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
war game type there's a link to the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.229 
war game type there's a link to the
download<00:00:44.899> for<00:00:45.410> that<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:46.340> as<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:46.850> can<00:00:46.969> see

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
download for that but as you can see

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.970 
download for that but as you can see
this<00:00:47.450> is<00:00:47.570> not<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:47.750> one-to-one<00:00:48.110> recreation<00:00:48.860> of

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
this is not a one-to-one recreation of

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.680 
this is not a one-to-one recreation of
war<00:00:49.160> machine<00:00:49.460> but<00:00:49.640> rather<00:00:49.789> a<00:00:49.969> halo

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
war machine but rather a halo

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.450 
war machine but rather a halo
reimagining<00:00:51.379> as<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:51.680> can<00:00:51.860> see<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:52.219> sniper

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
reimagining as you can see the sniper

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.520 
reimagining as you can see the sniper
pulls<00:00:52.699> back<00:00:52.850> in<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.090> same<00:00:53.270> spot<00:00:53.480> takes<00:00:54.379> much

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
pulls back in the same spot takes much

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.869 
pulls back in the same spot takes much
same<00:00:54.710> amount<00:00:54.860> time<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.070> get<00:00:55.190> from<00:00:55.309> that<00:00:55.610> spawn

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
same amount time to get from that spawn

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.510 
same amount time to get from that spawn
over<00:00:56.090> there<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:57.140> sniper<00:00:57.469> rifle<00:00:57.800> here<00:00:58.160> from

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
over there to sniper rifle here from

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.880 
over there to sniper rifle here from
that<00:00:58.550> spawn<00:00:59.210> over<00:00:59.629> there<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.410> get<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.680> sniper

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
that spawn over there to get to sniper

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.979 
that spawn over there to get to sniper
rifle<00:01:01.219> here<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.210> that<00:01:02.390> was<00:01:02.510> one<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.840> things

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
rifle here so that was one of the things

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.389 
rifle here so that was one of the things
that<00:01:03.140> I<00:01:03.230> really<00:01:03.590> wanted<00:01:03.769> to<00:01:03.859> make<00:01:03.980> sure<00:01:04.009> is

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
that I really wanted to make sure is

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.160 
that I really wanted to make sure is
that<00:01:04.580> even<00:01:04.789> if<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.000> map<00:01:05.269> was<00:01:05.539> not<00:01:05.899> a

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
that even if the map was not a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.050 
that even if the map was not a
one-to-one<00:01:06.740> scale<00:01:07.070> replica<00:01:07.580> I<00:01:07.759> wanted<00:01:07.970> to

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
one-to-one scale replica I wanted to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.749 
one-to-one scale replica I wanted to
make<00:01:08.149> sure<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.840> was<00:01:09.220> accurate<00:01:10.220> in<00:01:10.729> terms

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
make sure that it was accurate in terms

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.850 
make sure that it was accurate in terms
of<00:01:11.240> movement<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:11.840> felt<00:01:12.140> right<00:01:12.349> you<00:01:12.410> know<00:01:12.649> it

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
of movement it felt right you know it

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.620 
of movement it felt right you know it
feels<00:01:13.039> like<00:01:13.280> it<00:01:13.429> takes<00:01:13.459> a<00:01:13.789> few<00:01:13.970> rules<00:01:14.209> to<00:01:14.420> get

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
feels like it takes a few rules to get

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.809 
feels like it takes a few rules to get
to<00:01:14.750> your<00:01:14.869> objective<00:01:15.380> or<00:01:15.770> your<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.640> know<00:01:16.729> the

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
to your objective or your you know the

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:18.070 
to your objective or your you know the
weapon<00:01:17.030> you're<00:01:17.119> trying<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.420> get<00:01:17.569> to<00:01:17.720> because

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
weapon you're trying to get to because

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.749 
weapon you're trying to get to because
otherwise<00:01:18.319> it<00:01:18.649> feels<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:18.979> cramp<00:01:19.340> there's<00:01:19.700> a

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
otherwise it feels to cramp there's a

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.070 
otherwise it feels to cramp there's a
lot<00:01:19.849> of<00:01:21.369> different<00:01:22.369> maps<00:01:22.610> that<00:01:23.450> I've<00:01:23.599> seen<00:01:23.840> in

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
lot of different maps that I've seen in

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.660 
lot of different maps that I've seen in
with<00:01:24.259> that<00:01:24.349> that<00:01:24.770> try<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:24.950> do<00:01:25.099> the<00:01:25.220> war<00:01:25.369> machine

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
with that that try to do the war machine

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.880 
with that that try to do the war machine
and<00:01:25.789> gears<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.119> war<00:01:26.270> thing<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.720> there<00:01:27.530> I've

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
and gears of war thing and there I've

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.230 
and gears of war thing and there I've
seen<00:01:28.039> a<00:01:28.069> few<00:01:28.160> good<00:01:28.490> ones<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.849> I've<00:01:28.970> seen<00:01:29.119> a<00:01:29.179> few

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
really bad ones one of the most common

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.589 
really bad ones one of the most common
things<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.670> I've<00:01:31.789> seen<00:01:32.000> that's<00:01:32.179> bad<00:01:32.360> about

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:32.599 
things that I've seen that's bad about

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:35.199 
things that I've seen that's bad about
them<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.050> that<00:01:33.410> they<00:01:33.590> try<00:01:34.009> to<00:01:34.069> go<00:01:34.310> straight<00:01:35.000> for

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
them is that they try to go straight for

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
work but anyway another thing i've seen

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.889 
work but anyway another thing i've seen
other<00:02:00.399> maps<00:02:01.399> do<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.940> they<00:02:02.090> will<00:02:02.209> put<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.479> plasma

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
other maps do is they will put a plasma

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.809 
other maps do is they will put a plasma
launcher<00:02:03.259> instead<00:02:03.830> of<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.129> spartan<00:02:04.520> laser<00:02:04.550> is

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
launcher instead of the spartan laser is

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.119 
launcher instead of the spartan laser is
at<00:02:04.970> work<00:02:05.090> bell<00:02:05.300> as<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.450> saw<00:02:05.569> me<00:02:05.780> there<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.259> I

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
at work bell as you saw me there and I

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:08.650 
at work bell as you saw me there and I
think<00:02:07.459> that<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.849> pretty<00:02:08.090> bad<00:02:08.270> idea<00:02:08.599> I

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
think that this is a pretty bad idea I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.240 
think that this is a pretty bad idea I
gave<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.170> shot<00:02:09.200> for<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> while<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.220> i

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
gave it a shot for a while but i

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.100 
gave it a shot for a while but i
realized<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.910> after<00:02:11.000> even<00:02:11.450> just<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:11.690> few

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
realized that after even just a few

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.500 
realized that after even just a few
little<00:02:12.379> play<00:02:12.680> test<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.129> a<00:02:13.160> friend<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:14.240> it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
little play test with a friend that it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.630 
little play test with a friend that it
just<00:02:14.750> was<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.380> plasma<00:02:15.680> hunters<00:02:15.920> too<00:02:16.100> slow<00:02:16.340> it

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
just was the plasma hunters too slow it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.620 
just was the plasma hunters too slow it
doesn't<00:02:17.060> shoot<00:02:17.930> fast<00:02:18.260> enough<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:18.890> easily

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
doesn't shoot fast enough you can easily

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.400 
doesn't shoot fast enough you can easily
evade<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.930> plasma<00:02:22.930> grenades<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.290> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
evade the plasma grenades that it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.410 
evade the plasma grenades that it
launches<00:02:23.710> at<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.040> which<00:02:24.880> makes<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.210> pretty

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
launches at you which makes it pretty

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.940 
launches at you which makes it pretty
much<00:02:25.630> useless<00:02:25.810> because<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.440> evade<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:26.920> a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
much useless because the evade is a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.070 
much useless because the evade is a
critical<00:02:27.400> part<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.180> game<00:02:28.390> type<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.930> can
