like cabbage blow up I didn't work it's
not<00:02:39.480> quite<00:02:39.720> working<00:02:42.709> isn't<00:02:43.709> working<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:46.069> so

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
not quite working isn't working is it so

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.119 
not quite working isn't working is it so
I<00:02:47.099> can't<00:02:47.400> particularly<00:02:48.000> blow<00:02:48.180> him<00:02:48.329> up<00:02:48.920> tie<00:02:49.920> in

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129

with<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.310> gene<00:02:50.549> saw<00:02:51.049> no<00:02:52.049> one<00:02:52.200> conned<00:02:53.629> so<00:02:54.629> show<00:02:54.870> it

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
with a gene saw no one conned so show it

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.589 
with a gene saw no one conned so show it
and<00:02:55.950> then<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.159> had<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.489> kill<00:02:56.670> him<00:02:56.819> but<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.540> think

he<00:02:57.930> may<00:02:58.079> drop<00:02:58.319> some<00:02:58.590> things<00:02:58.620> when<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> you<00:03:00.239> kill

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
he may drop some things when a you kill

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.970 
he may drop some things when a you kill
