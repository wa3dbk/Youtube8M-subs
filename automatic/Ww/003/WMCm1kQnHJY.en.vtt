of<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.570> Lego<00:01:10.750> games<00:01:11.080> is<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.500> they<00:01:11.620> had<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.010> be

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
of the Lego games is that they had to be

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.430 
of the Lego games is that they had to be
creative<00:01:12.760> until<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.330> story<00:01:13.570> without<00:01:13.870> speech

giving<00:01:15.010> them<00:01:15.160> voice<00:01:15.340> actors<00:01:15.850> just<00:01:16.090> makes<00:01:16.420> it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
giving them voice actors just makes it

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.240 
giving them voice actors just makes it
like<00:01:16.690> any<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.200> Marvel<00:01:17.440> game<00:01:17.770> for<00:01:17.980> me<00:01:18.070> and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
like any of a Marvel game for me and

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.370 
like any of a Marvel game for me and
it's<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:18.670> clear<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.060> travelers<00:01:19.600> tales<00:01:19.870> only

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
it's so clear that travelers tales only

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.320 
it's so clear that travelers tales only
added<00:01:20.710> voice<00:01:20.860> actors<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.580> franchise<00:01:22.060> so

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
added voice actors to the franchise so

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.420 
added voice actors to the franchise so
they<00:01:22.510> could<00:01:22.720> make<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:22.960> lego<00:01:23.350> movie<00:01:23.710> they<00:01:24.130> didn't

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
they could make a lego movie they didn't

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.190 
they could make a lego movie they didn't
add<00:01:24.550> voice<00:01:24.760> actors<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.480> benefit<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.020> game

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
add voice actors to benefit the game

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.140 
add voice actors to benefit the game
only<00:01:26.710> because<00:01:27.070> they<00:01:27.220> could<00:01:27.460> get<00:01:27.610> money<00:01:27.880> off

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150

only because they could get money off
making<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.660> movie<00:01:29.140> it's<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:29.710> corporate<00:01:30.490> obvious

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
ironic and weirdly enough the game

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.120 
ironic and weirdly enough the game
doesn't<00:03:55.630> let<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.049> change<00:03:56.350> character<00:03:56.980> at

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
first you have to go to these weird

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.930 
first you have to go to these weird
shield<00:03:59.110> stations<00:03:59.680> to<00:03:59.890> do<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.190> manually<00:04:00.580> and

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
shield stations to do it manually and

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.270 
shield stations to do it manually and
only<00:04:01.480> then<00:04:01.750> can<00:04:01.989> you<00:04:02.049> do<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.680> fly<00:04:02.950> and

my final problem with the free roaming

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.480 
my final problem with the free roaming
is<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:30.750> this<00:04:30.960> city<00:04:31.260> isn't<00:04:31.830> really<00:04:32.280> that

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
is that this city isn't really that

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.130 
is that this city isn't really that
interesting<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.300> guess<00:04:33.540> it's<00:04:33.720> an<00:04:33.810> unfair

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
interesting I guess it's an unfair

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.320 
interesting I guess it's an unfair
