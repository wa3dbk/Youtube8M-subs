00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
acer b29 6 to 96 CL monitor and what's

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.140 
acer b29 6 to 96 CL monitor and what's
amazing<00:00:22.650> about<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.100> monitor<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.029> is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
amazing about this monitor is that it is

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.279 
amazing about this monitor is that it is
29<00:00:24.720> inches<00:00:24.869> diagonal<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:27.019> display<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
resolution is 2560 by 1080 so that makes

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.979 
resolution is 2560 by 1080 so that makes
it<00:00:32.369> an<00:00:32.940> aspect<00:00:33.300> ratio<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.660> something<00:00:33.930> like

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
it an aspect ratio of something like

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.220 
it an aspect ratio of something like
what<00:00:34.230> 21<00:00:35.160> by<00:00:35.520> 9<00:00:35.820> instead<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.390> an<00:00:36.450> almost<00:00:36.719> 16<00:00:37.020> by

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
what 21 by 9 instead of an almost 16 by

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
what 21 by 9 instead of an almost 16 by
9<00:00:37.940> gives<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.570> more<00:00:40.790> real<00:00:41.790> estate<00:00:41.940> on

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
9 gives you a lot more real estate on

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.130 
9 gives you a lot more real estate on
here<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:43.800> better<00:00:43.980> than<00:00:44.190> two<00:00:44.610> monitors

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
here it's a lot better than two monitors

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.260 
here it's a lot better than two monitors
because<00:00:46.140> there's<00:00:46.770> no<00:00:47.010> interruption<00:00:47.550> so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
because there's no interruption so

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.060 
because there's no interruption so
basically<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:49.829> big

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
arrangement view one big session view

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
arrangement view one big session view
you<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.610> because

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
you don't have to like you know because

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.889 
you don't have to like you know because
no<00:00:54.000> matter<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.480> you're<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:54.809> gonna

no matter what you do you're not gonna
want<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> stretch<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.440> across<00:00:55.739> two<00:00:56.309> monitors

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
want to stretch this across two monitors

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.819 
want to stretch this across two monitors
then<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> split<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:58.350> split<00:00:58.620> like

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
then what it split like to split like

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.150 
then what it split like to split like
here<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.550> partway<00:01:00.180> through<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> instead

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
here like partway through so instead

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.359 
here like partway through so instead
with<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.530> see

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.660 
like this and that has the added side
effect<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.530> basically<00:01:57.979> being<00:01:58.400> able<00:01:58.550> to

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
effect of it basically being able to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.210 
effect of it basically being able to
come<00:01:58.880> up<00:01:58.910> really<00:01:59.479> really<00:01:59.690> high<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.440> that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
come up really really high and that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.890 
come up really really high and that
gives<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:01.460> lots<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.940> space<00:02:02.210> underneath<00:02:02.540> it

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
gives you lots of space underneath it

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.749 
gives you lots of space underneath it
which<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.170> really<00:02:03.680> like<00:02:03.860> I've<00:02:04.040> got<00:02:04.220> my<00:02:04.340> push<00:02:04.550> and

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
which I really like I've got my push and

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.550 
which I really like I've got my push and
my<00:02:04.850> machine<00:02:05.210> under<00:02:05.450> here<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.780> eventually<00:02:06.290> I

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
my machine under here and eventually I

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.840 
my machine under here and eventually I
think<00:02:06.710> I'm<00:02:06.800> gonna<00:02:06.890> put<00:02:07.100> my<00:02:07.280> audio<00:02:07.759> interface

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
think I'm gonna put my audio interface

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.840 
think I'm gonna put my audio interface
and<00:02:08.660> some<00:02:08.869> things<00:02:09.130> make<00:02:10.130> some<00:02:10.280> shelves<00:02:10.729> or

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
and some things make some shelves or

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.100 
and some things make some shelves or
something<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.239> can<00:02:11.390> go<00:02:11.510> into<00:02:11.690> there<00:02:11.840> as<00:02:11.930> well

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
something that can go into there as well

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.560 
something that can go into there as well
so<00:02:12.709> I'm<00:02:12.770> really<00:02:12.890> excited<00:02:13.160> about<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.570> you'll
