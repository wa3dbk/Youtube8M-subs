technologies certainly some of them the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.600 
technologies certainly some of them the
brick<00:01:48.170> health<00:01:48.440> etc<00:01:48.850> are<00:01:50.110> energy<00:01:51.110> efficient<00:01:51.710> we

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
brick health etc are energy efficient we

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.840 
brick health etc are energy efficient we
also<00:01:52.880> make<00:01:53.390> sure<00:01:53.420> that<00:01:54.430> enterprises<00:01:55.430> have

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
also make sure that enterprises have

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.330 
also make sure that enterprises have

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
access to be carbon finance so that is

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.400 
access to be carbon finance so that is
performance<00:02:01.340> incentive<00:02:01.910> that<00:02:02.540> in<00:02:02.870> order<00:02:03.380> to
