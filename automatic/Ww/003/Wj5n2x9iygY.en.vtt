00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.470 

so<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:04.859> give<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.220> guys<00:00:05.370> an<00:00:05.490> update<00:00:05.580> on<00:00:05.970> the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
so I give you guys an update on the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.600 
so I give you guys an update on the
custom<00:00:07.020> interface<00:00:07.410> I'm<00:00:07.620> working<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.010> for<00:00:08.460> this

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
custom interface I'm working on for this

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.259 
custom interface I'm working on for this
Arduino<00:00:09.000> card<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:10.580> this<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.820> labview<00:00:12.330> here

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
Arduino card and this is labview here

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.740 
Arduino card and this is labview here
basically<00:00:15.139> you're<00:00:15.500> looking<00:00:15.830> at<00:00:16.599> that's<00:00:17.599> a

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
basically you're looking at that's a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.859 
basically you're looking at that's a
humidity<00:00:18.289> gauge<00:00:18.699> that's<00:00:19.699> the<00:00:20.029> same<00:00:20.300> data

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
humidity gauge that's the same data

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.779 
humidity gauge that's the same data
bring<00:00:21.230> it<00:00:21.320> out<00:00:21.439> on<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:21.800> chart<00:00:23.020> this<00:00:24.020> is<00:00:24.259> the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
bring it out on the chart this is the

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.080 
bring it out on the chart this is the
light<00:00:25.789> intensity<00:00:26.329> chart<00:00:26.980> this<00:00:27.980> is<00:00:28.130> also<00:00:28.489> light

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
light intensity chart this is also light

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.569 
light intensity chart this is also light
intensity<00:00:29.539> meter<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.199> then<00:00:30.800> these<00:00:31.520> two

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
intensity meter and then these two

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.450 
intensity meter and then these two
charts<00:00:32.570> down<00:00:32.840> below<00:00:33.140> our<00:00:34.719> time<00:00:35.719> charts<00:00:36.170> so

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
charts down below our time charts so

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.770 
charts down below our time charts so
after<00:00:37.460> it's<00:00:37.579> been<00:00:37.670> running<00:00:37.910> fall<00:00:38.180> it's<00:00:38.420> after

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
after it's been running fall it's after

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.440 
after it's been running fall it's after
five<00:00:38.989> minutes<00:00:39.230> worth<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:39.770> data<00:00:39.980> collected<00:00:40.450> you

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
five minutes worth of data collected you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.990 
five minutes worth of data collected you
hit<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.559> stop<00:00:42.800> button<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:43.610> will<00:00:43.640> print

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
hit the stop button and it will print

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.110 
hit the stop button and it will print
that<00:00:44.180> data<00:00:44.449> on<00:00:44.719> those<00:00:44.989> screens<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.120> unlike

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
that data on those screens so unlike

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.940 
that data on those screens so unlike
these<00:00:47.300> up<00:00:47.540> here<00:00:47.570> which<00:00:47.960> are<00:00:48.110> real<00:00:48.320> time<00:00:48.560> they

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
these up here which are real time they

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.910 
these up here which are real time they
only<00:00:49.100> show<00:00:49.400> about<00:00:50.110> 20<00:00:51.110> seconds<00:00:51.470> worth<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.739> data

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
only show about 20 seconds worth of data

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.569 
only show about 20 seconds worth of data
as<00:00:52.250> they<00:00:52.460> stroll<00:00:52.820> by<00:00:53.710> now<00:00:54.710> this<00:00:55.010> one's<00:00:55.220> kind<00:00:55.520> of

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
as they stroll by now this one's kind of

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.030 
as they stroll by now this one's kind of
like<00:00:55.700> this<00:00:56.570> will<00:00:56.810> show<00:00:56.989> you<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.230> history<00:00:57.410> ever

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
like this will show you the history ever

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.150 
like this will show you the history ever
since<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:58.550> hit<00:00:59.239> start<00:00:59.630> on<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.899> program<00:01:00.290> like

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
since you hit start on the program like

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.080 
since you hit start on the program like
this<00:01:01.220> light<00:01:01.700> throughout<00:01:02.300> here

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.090 
this light throughout here

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:12.560 
this light throughout here
sensor<00:01:05.090> two<00:01:05.930> blocks<00:01:06.200> from<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.600 

same<00:01:13.230> word<00:01:13.409> looks<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> church

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.710 

waiting

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
waiting

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.399 
waiting
bassist<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> shadow

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.500 

so<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.039> can<00:01:24.249> see<00:01:24.429> it's<00:01:24.850> really<00:01:24.999> fast<00:01:25.590> there's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
so you can see it's really fast there's

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.190 
so you can see it's really fast there's
freeze<00:01:29.510> on<00:01:29.690> it<00:01:29.840> real<00:01:29.990> quick<00:01:30.190> so

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.020 

forget<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.619> stop<00:01:35.950> button<00:01:36.189> you'll<00:01:36.670> see<00:01:36.909> these

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
forget the stop button you'll see these

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.450 
forget the stop button you'll see these
charts<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.600> things

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.180 

me<00:01:40.790> waving<00:01:41.090> my<00:01:41.330> hand

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
me waving my hand

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.240 
me waving my hand
the<00:01:42.640> sensors<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.150> then

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the sensors and then

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.690 
the sensors and then
this<00:01:44.490> bike<00:01:44.820> over<00:01:45.150> here<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.540> me<00:01:45.780> Freda

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.360 

sensor<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.570> light<00:01:51.810> meter<00:01:52.140> Thomas

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.340 

it's<00:01:56.730> pretty<00:01:57.000> accurate<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.570> really<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.110> this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
it's pretty accurate I really like this

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.960 
it's pretty accurate I really like this
this<00:01:58.890> setup

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
this setup

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.940 
this setup
that's<00:02:00.690> where<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:01.020> games<00:02:01.260> I'll<00:02:01.530> keep<00:02:01.740> going

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that's where my games I'll keep going

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.570 
that's where my games I'll keep going
dated<00:02:02.220> as<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.550> add<00:02:03.150> more<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.540> it
