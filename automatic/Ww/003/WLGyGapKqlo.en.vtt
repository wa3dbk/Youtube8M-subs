00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
the bat and going around the world and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.450 
the bat and going around the world and
collecting<00:02:39.500> those<00:02:39.590> things<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.040> pretty<00:02:40.250> fun

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
collecting those things is pretty fun

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.060 
collecting those things is pretty fun
and<00:02:40.670> everyone<00:02:41.420> smile<00:02:41.690> your<00:02:41.930> sim<00:02:42.230> will<00:02:42.590> not

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
and everyone smile your sim will not

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.370 
and everyone smile your sim will not
quite<00:02:43.730> get<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.090> cast<00:02:44.330> right<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.840> fall<00:02:45.050> flat

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
quite get the cast right and fall flat

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.890 
quite get the cast right and fall flat
on<00:02:45.440> his<00:02:45.650> face<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.850> that's<00:02:47.030> we're<00:02:47.300> keeping<00:02:47.600> sort

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
on his face so that's we're keeping sort

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.000 
on his face so that's we're keeping sort
of<00:02:47.960> that<00:02:48.080> humor<00:02:48.320> around<00:02:48.650> as<00:02:48.830> well<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:51.010> we

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
of that humor around as well we have we

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.320 
of that humor around as well we have we
believe<00:02:52.280> we've<00:02:52.520> tried<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.850> keep<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.180> focus

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
believe we've tried to keep the focus

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.120 
believe we've tried to keep the focus
even<00:02:53.870> though<00:02:54.050> we<00:02:54.200> have<00:02:54.380> an<00:02:54.560> open<00:02:54.770> world<00:02:54.920> now

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
even though we have an open world now

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.230 
even though we have an open world now
we've<00:02:55.340> been<00:02:55.580> trying<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.880> keep<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.120> focus

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
we've been trying to keep the focus

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.420 
we've been trying to keep the focus
still<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:56.959> know<00:02:57.080> getting<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.380> home<00:02:57.620> you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
have new objects interactions i want to

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.410 
have new objects interactions i want to
give<00:03:06.770> everything<00:03:07.160> away<00:03:07.370> because<00:03:07.790> there's

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
give everything away because there's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.300 
give everything away because there's
still<00:03:08.600> stuff<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:08.990> that<00:03:09.890> you're<00:03:09.950> gonna<00:03:10.100> find

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
still stuff that that you're gonna find

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.740 
still stuff that that you're gonna find
surprising<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.000> i<00:03:11.060> think<00:03:11.240> that's<00:03:11.390> what<00:03:11.600> makes

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
surprising and i think that's what makes

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.290 
surprising and i think that's what makes
the<00:03:11.930> sims<00:03:12.370> quite<00:03:13.370> addictive<00:03:13.760> it's<00:03:14.060> finding

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
the sims quite addictive it's finding

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.170 
the sims quite addictive it's finding
those<00:03:14.390> surprising<00:03:14.930> things<00:03:15.110> along<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.530> way

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
those surprising things along the way

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.280 
those surprising things along the way
another<00:03:17.180> thing<00:03:17.390> that<00:03:17.480> i<00:03:17.570> really<00:03:17.600> enjoy<00:03:18.050> is<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
another thing that i really enjoy is the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.100 
another thing that i really enjoy is the
the<00:03:18.980> camera<00:03:19.370> phone<00:03:19.580> all<00:03:20.330> sims<00:03:20.630> have<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.870> little

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
the camera phone all sims have a little

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.570 
the camera phone all sims have a little
cell<00:03:21.290> phone<00:03:21.470> it's<00:03:21.680> got<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.830> camera<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.310> they<00:03:22.400> can

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
cell phone it's got a camera so they can

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.500 
cell phone it's got a camera so they can
take<00:03:22.700> pictures<00:03:23.060> all<00:03:23.209> around<00:03:23.239> the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
take pictures all around the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.940 
take pictures all around the
neighborhood<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.260> hang<00:03:24.440> up<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.680> their<00:03:24.800> house

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
neighborhood to hang up in their house

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.229 
neighborhood to hang up in their house
or<00:03:25.220> they<00:03:25.280> can<00:03:25.519> actually<00:03:25.610> go<00:03:25.850> back<00:03:26.000> home<00:03:26.090> and

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
or they can actually go back home and

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.550 
or they can actually go back home and
paint<00:03:26.450> them<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:26.810> they've<00:03:26.930> kind<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.170> memorized

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
paint them so they've kind of memorized

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.900 
paint them so they've kind of memorized
the<00:03:27.650> scene<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.040> go<00:03:28.130> paint<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> picture<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.820> it

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
the scene and go paint a picture of it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.490 
the scene and go paint a picture of it
so<00:03:29.600> that's<00:03:29.840> just<00:03:30.019> some<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.290> really<00:03:30.410> cool

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
so that's just some of the really cool

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.250 
so that's just some of the really cool
stuff<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.890> like<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:32.269> in<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.630> sims<00:03:32.810> 3<00:03:33.019> we've

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
stuff I like so in the sims 3 we've

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.860 
stuff I like so in the sims 3 we've
actually<00:03:33.890> taken<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.580> one<00:03:35.209> meter<00:03:35.420> grid<00:03:35.720> you

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
actually taken that one meter grid you

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.320 
actually taken that one meter grid you
have<00:03:36.050> and<00:03:36.350> broken<00:03:37.220> up<00:03:37.370> into<00:03:37.550> quarters<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.269> you

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
have and broken up into quarters so you

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.470 
have and broken up into quarters so you
can<00:03:38.690> move<00:03:38.810> things<00:03:38.989> at<00:03:39.200> half<00:03:39.350> resolution<00:03:40.480> so

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
can move things at half resolution so

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.850 
can move things at half resolution so
that<00:03:41.510> means<00:03:41.840> if<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:41.989> have<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.140> three<00:03:42.320> tyl<00:03:42.560> couch

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
that means if you have a three tyl couch

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.740 
that means if you have a three tyl couch
you<00:03:43.190> can<00:03:43.220> position<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:43.940> tile<00:03:44.209> TV<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.630> front

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
you can position a to tile TV in front

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.860 
you can position a to tile TV in front
of<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:44.989> perfectly<00:03:45.350> consent<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:45.830> them<00:03:46.870> in

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
of it perfectly consent of them in

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.330 
of it perfectly consent of them in
addition<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.470> we<00:03:48.739> let<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.010> rotate

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
addition to that we let you rotate

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.430 
addition to that we let you rotate
objects<00:03:49.820> at<00:03:50.060> 45<00:03:50.540> degree<00:03:50.750> angles<00:03:51.049> now<00:03:51.170> instead

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
objects at 45 degree angles now instead

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.550 
objects at 45 degree angles now instead
of<00:03:51.500> 90<00:03:52.100> degree<00:03:52.310> angles<00:03:52.959> but<00:03:53.959> for<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.290> experts

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
of 90 degree angles but for the experts

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.770 
of 90 degree angles but for the experts
out<00:03:54.769> there<00:03:54.799> like<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.430> guys<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:56.420> can<00:03:56.540> actually

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
out there like you guys you can actually

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.720 
out there like you guys you can actually
just<00:03:56.930> hold<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.530> Alt<00:03:57.680> key<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:58.070> then<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.549> can

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
just hold the Alt key and then you can

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.850 
just hold the Alt key and then you can
place<00:03:59.060> things<00:03:59.390> off<00:03:59.780> the<00:04:00.049> grid<00:04:00.230> anywhere<00:04:00.650> and

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
place things off the grid anywhere and

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.250 
place things off the grid anywhere and
rotate<00:04:01.820> things<00:04:02.060> at<00:04:02.239> any<00:04:02.450> angles<00:04:02.810> at<00:04:02.900> all<00:04:03.049> and

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
rotate things at any angles at all and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.300 
rotate things at any angles at all and
it<00:04:04.010> all<00:04:04.100> works<00:04:05.410> on<00:04:06.410> top<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.650> that<00:04:06.769> we've

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
it all works on top of that we've

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.310 
it all works on top of that we've
actually<00:04:07.519> added<00:04:07.730> more<00:04:08.150> placement<00:04:09.140> on

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
actually added more placement on

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.770 
actually added more placement on
