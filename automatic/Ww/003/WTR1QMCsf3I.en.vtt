this Gainesville up 8.5 SDL there are a
few<00:00:13.170> other<00:00:13.410> shares<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.070> range<00:00:14.250> also<00:00:14.610> there

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
few other shares in the range also there

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.070 
few other shares in the range also there
are<00:00:15.150> ones<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.420> look<00:00:15.719> slightly<00:00:15.960> different

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
unit here there's a slot behind the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.089 
unit here there's a slot behind the
badge<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:25.140> pulls<00:00:25.380> forward<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
badge that just pulls forward and the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.880 
badge that just pulls forward and the
meed<00:00:26.279> screws<00:00:26.670> behind<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> back<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.890> then

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
meed screws behind the back and then

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.560 
meed screws behind the back and then
extended<00:00:29.310> us<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.730> set<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.150> temperature

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
extended us we set the temperature

extended us we set the temperature
control<00:00:30.960> over<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.560> table<00:00:32.550> top<00:00:32.730> position<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
control over the table top position and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.450 
control over the table top position and
it<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.480> pulls<00:00:33.750> forward<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.290> note<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.340> it

it just pulls forward the note and it
can<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.820> taped<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:38.670> that's<00:00:38.879> how<00:00:39.090> there's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
can be taped and so that's how there's

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
can be taped and so that's how there's
also<00:00:39.989> school<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.559> was<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.829> from<00:00:41.010> underneath<00:00:41.309> in

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
also school it was up from underneath in

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.950 
also school it was up from underneath in
the<00:00:41.610> bottom<00:00:42.030> year<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.329> I've<00:00:42.450> already<00:00:42.600> removed

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the bottom year but I've already removed

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510 
the bottom year but I've already removed
that<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.620> very<00:00:43.680> difficult<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> get

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that because it's very difficult to get

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.990

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
removed now this is the PRD here there

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
removed now this is the PRD here there
are<00:01:16.110> two<00:01:16.290> types<00:01:16.320> depending<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:17.369> model

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
are two types depending on which model

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.350 
are two types depending on which model
you<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> long<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.439> short<00:01:19.740> version

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
you have as a long and short version

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
you have as a long and short version
held<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> two<00:01:21.840> screws<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.189> but

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
held in the two screws here and here but

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.190 
held in the two screws here and here but
what<00:01:24.000> we're<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
what we're going to have to do is that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.640 
what we're going to have to do is that
equate<00:01:26.100> difficult<00:01:26.520> again<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.500> way<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
equate difficult again to so one way to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.050 
equate difficult again to so one way to
do<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.890> take<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> show<00:01:29.280> off<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> wall<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
do is take the show off the wall so you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.319 
do is take the show off the wall so you
can<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.420> where<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> screws<00:01:31.049> are<00:01:32.180> when<00:01:33.180> you're

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
can see where the screws are when you're

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.149 
can see where the screws are when you're
at<00:01:33.420> home<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.380> actually<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.100> with

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
at home you can actually do this with

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.649 
at home you can actually do this with
the<00:01:35.369> show<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.759> place<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.180> difficult<00:01:36.630> getting

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the show in place it's difficult getting

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.690 
the show in place it's difficult getting
the<00:01:36.960> real<00:01:37.110> screw<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.549> not

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the real screw in but it's not

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.039 
the real screw in but it's not
impossible<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.509> gives<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.810> that's

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
impossible it just gives it that that's

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.499 
impossible it just gives it that that's
a<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.380> fiddly<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.549> anyway<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> take

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
a bit fiddly so anyway I'm going to take

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.910 
a bit fiddly so anyway I'm going to take
this<00:01:42.630> note<00:01:42.810> either<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.380> know<00:01:43.500> off<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> wall

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
this note either you know off the wall

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.520 
this note either you know off the wall
so<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.579> we'll<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:45.470> okay<00:01:46.470> so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
so you can see what we'll do okay so

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
so you can see what we'll do okay so
I've<00:01:46.740> removed<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> wall<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.030> just

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
I've removed this from the wall and just

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.420 
I've removed this from the wall and just
a<00:01:48.299> me<00:01:48.420> easy<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.740> screws<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
a me easy to see the screws for the
