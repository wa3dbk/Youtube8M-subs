00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
they look at it and that's the kind of

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.209 
they look at it and that's the kind of
thing<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.780> styling<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.649> brings<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> the

performance that goes with the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.170 
and also with change in transmission
ratios<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.650> took<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.950> opportunity<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.519> redo

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
power output from the bigger engine so

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.330
