00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
we will just be working with just one

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.109 
we will just be working with just one
portion<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.189> start<00:01:08.549> thinking<00:01:09.000> about

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
portion of this but start thinking about

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.230 
portion of this but start thinking about
what<00:01:09.450> else<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.930> could<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> all<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.030> need

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
what else you could do so all you need

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.080 
what else you could do so all you need
to<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.280> bernina<00:01:14.640> 880

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
to do this is to have a bernina 880

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.580 
to do this is to have a bernina 880
because<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> only<00:01:15.689> machine<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because that's the only machine with the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
because that's the only machine with the
stitch<00:01:16.799> designer<00:01:17.220> you'll<00:01:17.820> need<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> USB<00:01:18.299> stick

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689

and you're going to need the designer
plus<00:01:20.909> software<00:01:20.970> 7<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.530> let's<00:01:22.920> take<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> look<00:01:23.520> at

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
plus software 7 so let's take a look at

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.050 
plus software 7 so let's take a look at
how<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.150> works<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.310> this<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> designer

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
how this works so this is the designer

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.030 
how this works so this is the designer
plus<00:01:27.360> software<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.409> need<00:01:28.619> designer

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560 
plus software and you do need designer
plus<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
plus because this is the one that

the<00:02:10.890> stitch<00:02:11.129> designer<00:02:11.610> will<00:02:11.970> design<00:02:12.330> stitches

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the stitch designer will design stitches

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.370 
the stitch designer will design stitches
in<00:02:12.959> nine

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
in nine

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.170 
in nine
millimeter<00:02:13.680> wide<00:02:13.950> says<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.490> can<00:02:14.670> sew<00:02:14.880> with

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
millimeter wide says you can sew with

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.270 
millimeter wide says you can sew with
the<00:02:15.330> regular<00:02:15.720> 9<00:02:15.930> millimeter<00:02:16.350> foot<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.130> you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the regular 9 millimeter foot but you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.300 
the regular 9 millimeter foot but you
also<00:02:17.460> have<00:02:17.760> an<00:02:17.850> unlimited<00:02:18.300> size<00:02:19.020> for<00:02:19.650> sideways

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
also have an unlimited size for sideways

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.940 
also have an unlimited size for sideways
motion<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.720> could<00:02:22.140> actually<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.770> a

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
motion so this could actually be a

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.550 
motion so this could actually be a
sideways<00:02:23.670> motion<00:02:23.940> stitch<00:02:24.390> it's<00:02:24.720> quite<00:02:25.230> large

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
sideways motion stitch it's quite large

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.050 
sideways motion stitch it's quite large
this<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:27.860> 87.8<00:02:28.860> 8<00:02:29.190> millimeters<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:29.940> I'm

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
this is a 87.8 8 millimeters and I'm

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.360 
this is a 87.8 8 millimeters and I'm
going<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.510> know<00:02:30.660> wide<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.320> it's<00:02:31.470> 34<00:02:32.070> and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
going to you know wide and it's 34 and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.030 
going to you know wide and it's 34 and
some<00:02:32.670> millimeters<00:02:33.390> tall<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.470> that's<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.860> big

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
some millimeters tall so that's a big

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.830 
some millimeters tall so that's a big
stitch<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.610> that's<00:02:35.790> not<00:02:35.880> too<00:02:36.210> big<00:02:36.450> for<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
stitch but that's not too big for the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.660 
stitch but that's not too big for the
machine<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.320> stitch<00:02:37.680> out<00:02:37.890> as<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> sideways

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
machine to stitch out as a sideways

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.510 
machine to stitch out as a sideways
motion<00:02:39.110> maybe<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.500> want<00:02:40.740> this<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.070> be<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> nine

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
motion maybe you want this to be a nine

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.240 
motion maybe you want this to be a nine
millimeter<00:02:41.850> stitch<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.990> one<00:02:43.410> way<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.650> handle

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
millimeter stitch so one way to handle

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.960 
millimeter stitch so one way to handle
this<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.880> have<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.140> text<00:02:47.070> selected<00:02:47.790> or

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
this is to have the text selected or

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.740 
this is to have the text selected or
your<00:02:48.330> design<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.980> your<00:02:49.980> lock<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.750> activated

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
your design and your lock is activated

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.870 
your design and your lock is activated
so<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.320> when<00:02:52.500> i<00:02:52.530> change<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.250> size<00:02:53.490> of<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
so that when i change the size of the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.760 
so that when i change the size of the
height<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.450> will<00:02:54.570> also<00:02:54.780> proportionately

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
height it will also proportionately

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.460 
height it will also proportionately
change<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.730> size<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.360> width<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:58.140> i<00:02:58.170> want

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
change the size of the width so i want

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.670 
change the size of the width so i want
this<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.770> be<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> nine<00:02:59.250> millimeter<00:03:00.380> sewn<00:03:01.380> out

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
this to be a nine millimeter sewn out

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.570 
this to be a nine millimeter sewn out
stitch<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:03.170> let's<00:03:04.170> just<00:03:04.470> enlarge<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.520> a

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
stitch and let's just enlarge this a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.600 
stitch and let's just enlarge this a
little<00:03:05.910> bit<00:03:06.210> okay<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.530> now<00:03:07.740> i<00:03:07.800> have<00:03:07.980> changed

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
little bit okay so now i have changed

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.520 
little bit okay so now i have changed
the<00:03:08.760> height<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.210> nine<00:03:09.450> millimeters<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.440> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the height to nine millimeters it's a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.290 
the height to nine millimeters it's a
little<00:03:10.770> bit<00:03:10.920> larger<00:03:11.340> i<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.640> take<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.060> down<00:03:12.270> a

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
little bit larger i can take that down a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.900 
little bit larger i can take that down a
little<00:03:12.390> bit<00:03:12.630> if<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.840> need<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.700> the

now<00:03:46.500> i<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:46.680> my<00:03:46.890> design<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:47.880> if<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.150> wanted<00:03:48.450> to

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
now i have my design now if I wanted to

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.120 
now i have my design now if I wanted to
stitch<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:48.990> out<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.260> think<00:03:49.590> about<00:03:49.920> how<00:03:50.070> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
stitch this out I think about how the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.760 
stitch this out I think about how the
foot<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.120> going<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.390> handle<00:03:51.600> this<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.590> will

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
foot is going to handle this you will

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.310 
foot is going to handle this you will
you<00:03:52.950> also<00:03:53.130> want<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.520> rotate<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:54.180> 45<00:03:54.810> degrees

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
you also want to rotate this 45 degrees

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.130 
you also want to rotate this 45 degrees
so<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:56.040> looks<00:03:56.220> more<00:03:56.520> like<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.900> now
