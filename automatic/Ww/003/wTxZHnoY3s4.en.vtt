all right next thing we're going to talk

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.320 
all right next thing we're going to talk
about<00:00:08.630> is<00:00:09.020> lighting<00:00:09.380> freedom<00:00:09.740> monitors<00:00:10.330> the

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
about is lighting freedom monitors the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.370 
about is lighting freedom monitors the
most<00:00:11.540> important<00:00:11.900> thing<00:00:11.990> that<00:00:12.020> they're<00:00:12.260> going

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
most important thing that they're going

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.500 
most important thing that they're going
to<00:00:12.440> need<00:00:12.620> is<00:00:12.770> heat<00:00:13.040> so<00:00:13.700> here<00:00:14.059> we<00:00:14.150> have<00:00:14.270> a<00:00:14.299> few

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
to need is heat so here we have a few

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.199 
to need is heat so here we have a few
different<00:00:14.840> options<00:00:14.900> that<00:00:15.200> you

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
different options that you

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.569 
different options that you
first<00:00:16.359> one<00:00:16.599> is<00:00:16.779> the<00:00:17.320> zoomit<00:00:17.740> rector<00:00:18.099> basking

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:18.579 
first one is the zoomit rector basking

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.519 
first one is the zoomit rector basking
this<00:00:19.029> gives<00:00:19.269> off<00:00:19.449> a<00:00:19.480> definite<00:00:19.990> bright<00:00:20.230> light

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
this gives off a definite bright light

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.939 
this gives off a definite bright light
that<00:00:20.859> will<00:00:21.820> help<00:00:21.970> to<00:00:22.179> handle<00:00:22.329> them

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
that will help to handle them

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.409 
that will help to handle them
secondly<00:00:23.949> there's<00:00:24.189> a<00:00:24.250> ceramic<00:00:24.789> heater<00:00:24.970> this

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
secondly there's a ceramic heater this

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.089 
secondly there's a ceramic heater this
is<00:00:25.539> gonna<00:00:25.660> put<00:00:25.869> off<00:00:25.960> a<00:00:25.989> lot<00:00:26.140> more<00:00:26.320> heat<00:00:26.859> and

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
is gonna put off a lot more heat and

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.349 
is gonna put off a lot more heat and
heat<00:00:28.090> up<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.239> larger<00:00:28.719> space<00:00:30.119> finally<00:00:31.119> there's

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
heat up the larger space finally there's

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.500 
heat up the larger space finally there's
our<00:00:31.509> rector<00:00:31.840> halogen<00:00:32.409> which<00:00:32.710> is<00:00:33.309> this<00:00:34.000> is<00:00:34.150> 100

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
our rector halogen which is this is 100

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.149 
our rector halogen which is this is 100

duty will last forever this is the rep
de<00:01:14.900> halogen<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.740> works<00:01:16.009> very<00:01:16.159> well<00:01:16.310> when<00:01:16.759> the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
de halogen it works very well when the

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.480 
de halogen it works very well when the
bulb<00:01:17.150> is<00:01:17.300> not<00:01:17.330> moving<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.170> if<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:18.470> in<00:01:18.650> a<00:01:18.830> mini

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
bulb is not moving so if it's in a mini

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.370 
bulb is not moving so if it's in a mini
deep<00:01:19.759> dome<00:01:20.060> that's<00:01:20.240> like<00:01:20.509> inside<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.020> vision

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
deep dome that's like inside the vision

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.330 
deep dome that's like inside the vision
cage<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.860> will<00:01:21.979> work<00:01:22.130> perfectly<00:01:24.340> basically

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
cage it will work perfectly basically

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.010 
cage it will work perfectly basically
what<00:01:25.490> he's<00:01:25.580> saying<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.300> halogens<00:01:26.810> here

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
what he's saying that the halogens here

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.690 
what he's saying that the halogens here
they're<00:01:27.410> just<00:01:27.590> sensitive<00:01:27.890> if<00:01:28.220> they<00:01:28.340> jostle

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
they're just sensitive if they jostle

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.760 
they're just sensitive if they jostle
too<00:01:28.880> much<00:01:29.060> they'll<00:01:29.330> break<00:01:29.539> faster<00:01:30.050> so<00:01:30.710> you

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
too much they'll break faster so you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.930 
too much they'll break faster so you
would<00:01:30.950> just<00:01:30.979> want<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.310> be<00:01:31.399> careful<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.880> make

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
would just want to be careful and make

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.960 
would just want to be careful and make
sure<00:01:32.330> that<00:01:33.259> when<00:01:33.440> you<00:01:33.530> are<00:01:33.560> using<00:01:33.890> them<00:01:34.190> to<00:01:34.610> get

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
sure that when you are using them to get

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.180 
sure that when you are using them to get
their<00:01:35.149> best<00:01:35.450> lifespan<00:01:36.380> they<00:01:36.679> just<00:01:36.860> don't<00:01:37.009> move

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
their best lifespan they just don't move

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.100 
their best lifespan they just don't move
all<00:01:37.670> right<00:01:37.789> finally<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.929> remedy

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
all right finally this is the remedy

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.830 
all right finally this is the remedy
