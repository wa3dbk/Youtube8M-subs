these pad things so you'll want to

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.510 
these pad things so you'll want to
probably<00:00:19.260> initiate<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.650> countdown<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.279> I'll<00:00:20.400> do

platform that he's on will raise when I
use<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> laser<00:01:12.390> beam<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.080> I'll<00:01:13.409> position<00:01:13.740> my

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
use the laser beam so I'll position my

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.550 
use the laser beam so I'll position my
portal<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.900> another<00:01:15.900> one<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> wall

straight ahead and then the laser is

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
straight ahead and then the laser is
savories<00:01:20.220> right<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.580> front<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.850> me<00:01:21.030> yeah<00:01:21.330> so

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
place it right here against this corner

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.870 
place it right here against this corner
wall<00:01:45.770> close<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.670> wall<00:01:47.790> as

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
wall close to the to the wall as

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
possible you want to position a portal

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.210 
possible you want to position a portal
right<00:01:50.370> in<00:01:50.640> front<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.770> hopper<00:01:52.770> thing<00:01:52.980> make

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
right in front of the hopper thing make

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.680 
right in front of the hopper thing make
sure<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.670> right<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.330> front<00:01:54.510> of<00:01:54.600> it
