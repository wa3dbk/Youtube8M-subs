00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.880 
had one 3 button controller which was
fine<00:00:55.550> because<00:00:55.579> I<00:00:55.909> think<00:00:56.030> most<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.539> games

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
fine because I think most of the games

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.500 
fine because I think most of the games
or<00:00:57.890> if<00:00:58.190> not<00:00:58.370> all<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.760> games<00:00:58.789> that<00:00:59.149> it<00:00:59.269> came

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
or if not all of the games that it came

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.889 
or if not all of the games that it came
with<00:01:00.100> you<00:01:01.100> know<00:01:01.219> were<00:01:01.609> original<00:01:02.269> games<00:01:02.690> they

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
with you know were original games they

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.240 
with you know were original games they
didn't<00:01:03.109> require<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.649> 6<00:01:03.920> button<00:01:04.220> controller

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
didn't require the 6 button controller

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.080 
didn't require the 6 button controller
or<00:01:04.879> probably<00:01:05.750> even<00:01:05.840> take<00:01:06.170> advantage<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.770> it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
or probably even take advantage of it

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.149 
or probably even take advantage of it
this<00:01:08.090> one<00:01:08.270> its<00:01:08.870> main<00:01:09.170> features<00:01:09.620> of<00:01:09.830> course

and<00:02:21.770> we'll<00:02:21.890> start<00:02:22.100> with<00:02:22.250> Street<00:02:22.520> Fighter<00:02:22.790> 2<00:02:34.450> so

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
and we'll start with Street Fighter 2 so

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.990 
and we'll start with Street Fighter 2 so
far<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.690> don't<00:02:35.810> think<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.200> music<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:37.730> know<00:02:37.820> is

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
far I don't think the music you know is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.790 
far I don't think the music you know is
really<00:02:38.180> all<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.540> bad<00:02:38.600> there's<00:02:39.410> nothing

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
really all that bad there's nothing

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.340 
really all that bad there's nothing
really<00:02:40.760> standing<00:02:41.300> out<00:02:41.450> here<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:42.020> that's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
really standing out here that that's

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.080 
really standing out here that that's
wrong

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
wrong

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.550 
wrong
but<00:02:44.090> when<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:44.450> get<00:02:44.540> into<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.870> menu<00:02:45.290> you'll

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
but when we get into the menu you'll

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.430 
but when we get into the menu you'll
notice<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.870> when<00:02:47.870> you're<00:02:47.959> changing<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
notice that when you're changing the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.410 
notice that when you're changing the
menu<00:02:48.620> selections<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.490> don't<00:02:49.790> hear<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.390> sound

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
menu selections you don't hear the sound

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.500 
menu selections you don't hear the sound
that<00:02:50.870> should<00:02:51.050> hear<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:53.000> may<00:02:53.150> notice<00:02:53.480> that

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
that should hear and you may notice that

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.000 
that should hear and you may notice that
more<00:02:53.840> hears<00:02:54.170> when<00:02:54.350> you're<00:02:54.470> actually<00:02:54.590> picking

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
more hears when you're actually picking

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.160 
more hears when you're actually picking
your<00:02:55.280> character<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:56.480> should<00:02:56.660> be<00:02:56.780> making<00:02:57.080> a

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
your character it should be making a

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.660 
your character it should be making a
loud<00:02:57.380> like<00:02:57.770> pudding<00:02:57.980> pudding<00:02:58.280> pudding

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
pudding pudding pudding sound as you

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.090 
pudding pudding pudding sound as you
change<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> characters<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.680> can<00:03:03.860> hear

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
change the characters and you can hear

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.820 
change the characters and you can hear
it<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.400> very<00:03:04.640> very<00:03:04.790> silent<00:03:05.630> very<00:03:06.170> quiet<00:03:06.590> in

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
it it's very very silent very quiet in

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.900 
it it's very very silent very quiet in
the<00:03:06.920> background

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
the background

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.340 
the background
but<00:03:09.910> once<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.300> start<00:03:10.480> fighting<00:03:11.050> in<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.230> in

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
but once you start fighting in the in

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.820 
but once you start fighting in the in
under<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.740> fight<00:03:13.200> you'll<00:03:14.200> see<00:03:14.410> it's<00:03:14.530> really

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
under the fight you'll see it's really

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.330 
under the fight you'll see it's really
not<00:03:15.130> all<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.460> bad<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:17.410> music<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.980> think<00:03:18.040> is

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
not all that bad the music I think is

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.400 
not all that bad the music I think is
quite<00:03:18.610> well<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.210> I<00:03:19.540> mean<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.810> voices<00:03:20.230> are

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
quite well and I mean the voices are

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.250 
quite well and I mean the voices are
pretty<00:03:20.770> much<00:03:20.890> as<00:03:21.190> good<00:03:21.610> or<00:03:21.940> bad<00:03:22.360> as<00:03:22.870> they<00:03:23.230> were

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
pretty much as good or bad as they were

00:03:23.260 --> 00:05:14.240 
pretty much as good or bad as they were
on<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.770> genesis<00:03:24.460> in<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.830> voluminous

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.740 

so<00:05:15.250> Street<00:05:15.490> Fighter<00:05:15.700> 2<00:05:15.790> wasn't<00:05:16.300> too<00:05:16.420> bad<00:05:16.720> but

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
so Street Fighter 2 wasn't too bad but

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.250 
so Street Fighter 2 wasn't too bad but
here<00:05:17.560> engines<00:05:18.040> and<00:05:18.280> ghosts<00:05:18.900> it's<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:20.020> little

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
here engines and ghosts it's a little

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.050 
here engines and ghosts it's a little
bit<00:05:20.380> more<00:05:20.590> noticeable<00:05:21.220> some<00:05:21.580> of<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:21.820> sound

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
bit more noticeable some of the sound

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.540 
bit more noticeable some of the sound
effects<00:05:22.420> are<00:05:22.660> too<00:05:23.050> loud<00:05:23.290> some<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.310> sound

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
effects are too loud some of the sound

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.010 
effects are too loud some of the sound
effects<00:05:24.850> are<00:05:25.060> too<00:05:25.240> quiet

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
effects are too quiet

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.690 
effects are too quiet
once<00:05:26.440> again<00:05:26.560> I'm<00:05:26.830> sure<00:05:27.040> it<00:05:27.130> has<00:05:27.280> something<00:05:27.310> to

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
once again I'm sure it has something to

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.770 
once again I'm sure it has something to
do<00:05:27.910> with<00:05:28.710> first<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.920> FM<00:05:30.310> maybe<00:05:31.300> there's<00:05:31.570> not<00:05:31.750> a

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
do with first the FM maybe there's not a

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.720 
do with first the FM maybe there's not a
lot<00:05:32.020> of<00:05:32.050> FM<00:05:32.560> stuff<00:05:32.950> going<00:05:33.220> on<00:05:33.370> a<00:05:33.430> street

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
lot of FM stuff going on a street

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.030 
lot of FM stuff going on a street
fighter<00:05:33.970> tube<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:34.570> kind<00:05:35.440> of<00:05:35.530> works<00:05:35.740> out<00:05:35.980> a

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
fighter tube so kind of works out a

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.940 
fighter tube so kind of works out a
little<00:05:36.190> bit<00:05:36.430> better<00:05:36.550> in<00:05:36.790> that<00:05:36.940> game<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:38.530> here

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
little bit better in that game and here

00:05:38.950 --> 00:06:48.780 
little bit better in that game and here
you<00:05:39.100> know<00:05:39.220> it's<00:05:39.430> definitely<00:05:40.000> worse

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.370 

so<00:06:49.790> there<00:06:50.030> you<00:06:50.060> go<00:06:50.300> I<00:06:50.330> mean<00:06:50.630> it's<00:06:50.780> not<00:06:50.960> too<00:06:51.230> bad

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
so there you go I mean it's not too bad

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.560 
so there you go I mean it's not too bad
as<00:06:51.650> a<00:06:51.680> street<00:06:51.890> fighter<00:06:52.100> a<00:06:52.640> little<00:06:53.270> bit<00:06:53.360> worse

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
as a street fighter a little bit worse

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.960 
as a street fighter a little bit worse
than<00:06:53.780> ghouls<00:06:54.140> and<00:06:54.260> ghosts<00:06:54.680> but<00:06:54.980> it's<00:06:55.730> still

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
than ghouls and ghosts but it's still

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.760 
than ghouls and ghosts but it's still
overall<00:06:56.300> anything<00:06:56.750> as<00:06:56.870> bad<00:06:57.020> as<00:06:57.230> the<00:06:57.350> six<00:06:57.620> in

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
overall anything as bad as the six in

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.620 
overall anything as bad as the six in
one<00:06:57.800> there's<00:06:58.580> none<00:06:58.730> of<00:06:58.790> that<00:06:58.850> overly<00:06:59.420> loud

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
one there's none of that overly loud

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.200 
one there's none of that overly loud
distorted<00:07:00.160> stuff<00:07:01.160> that<00:07:01.340> hurts<00:07:01.460> your<00:07:01.670> ears<00:07:01.940> and

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
distorted stuff that hurts your ears and

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.880 
distorted stuff that hurts your ears and
maybe<00:07:02.390> that's<00:07:02.660> why<00:07:02.810> something<00:07:03.170> stuffs<00:07:03.470> to<00:07:03.620> fly

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890 
maybe that's why something stuffs to fly

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.060 
maybe that's why something stuffs to fly
and<00:07:04.130> swim<00:07:04.690> but<00:07:05.690> so<00:07:05.930> broadly<00:07:06.320> recommended<00:07:06.980> if

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
and swim but so broadly recommended if

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.290 
and swim but so broadly recommended if
you're<00:07:07.220> a<00:07:07.250> street<00:07:07.550> fighter<00:07:07.760> chief<00:07:08.030> and

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
you're a street fighter chief and

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.810 
you're a street fighter chief and
definitely
