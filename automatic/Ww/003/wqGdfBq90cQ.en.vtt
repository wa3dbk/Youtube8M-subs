00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.780
 Hello today I am in Machu Picchu and 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.270
 this is my first video in spanish 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.530
 I was filming others in English but 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.809
 I think it's important to film in 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.490
 Castilian also and today I want 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.980
 talk about why we are naturally 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.200
 vegetarians I have climbed to Machu Picchu 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.790
 thought that the Incas ate how 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.670
 they fed how different their 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.110
 feeding of ours we know 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.780
 they ate mainly grains and 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.910
 vegetables did not have cows so no 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.320
 they took milk and dairy products not 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.300
 they had chickens so they did not eat eggs 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.130
 and well they probably ate some 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.440
 flame meat although its waters 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.440
 llamas and vicunas and alpacas by 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.900
 its wool and if it is said that the Incas 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.629
 they could have fresh fish in 24 hours 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.290
 of the ocean is fine is a whim is 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.360
 something different and if we have to have fun 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.980
 you have to have a good time 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.810
 and we have to eat what we want but 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.570
 we have to think what is what 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.760
 natural for what we are designed this 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.850
 body what is it really designed for 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.900
 we are omnivorous by nature because 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.880
 we can enter a mode of 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.310
 survival and live like man 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.810
 in front of the man of the puna I recommend 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.440
 dad eating yucca eating beans at all 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.290
 our life 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.479
 that is survival we can also 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.220
 eat meat for logical survival 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.270
 it's fine we're designed to 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.090
 survive in any kind of environment 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.799
 but really some people say that 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.479
 we are carnivores because we have teeth 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.880
 canines but our canine teeth do not 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.869
 can be compared to those of a wolf or 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.400
 those of a jaguar in no way 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.070
 the enzymes that we have in our mouths are 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.720
 to digest vegetables not meat the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.250
 carnivorous animals in another type of 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.900
 enzymes we have the same 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.140
 enzymes that vegetarian animals 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.170
 to digest vegetables and then we have 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.240
 a large intestine is a large intestine 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.060
 typical of herbivores carnivores 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.670
 they have 1300 shorts because they absorb 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.210
 quickly the nutrients from the meat and 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.069
 then they get rid of the rest 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.120
 we can also see our hands not 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.270
 we have claws to tear an animal 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.180
 we have hands to gather for 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.160
 Put our food together with your hands if 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.350
 is that we see a cow we do not go running 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.150
 behind the love we show the neck that's not 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.920
 it is natural that our mouth does not water 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.730
 we hardly see an animal that is not true 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.670
 we season the meat we cook it 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.209
 we camouflage so you know well 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.550
 but that is not something natural is something 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.220
 artificial that we have invented how 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.440
 the Incas ate because they were so strong 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.420
 how could they raise tremendous rocks 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.390
 how could they cross mountains so high 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.880
 because they fed well with grains 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.520
 like quinoa the kiwicha with super 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.950
 foods like maca that gives the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.580
 force the coca the camu camu the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.580
 All this fruits and all 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.950
 Food from the jungle and the mountains 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.650
 Peru is a very rich place where 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.870
 we have many vegan foods 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.819
 vegetables 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.319
 they have a lot of protein and many 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.209
 nutrients much better than that of the 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.350
 meat we are not designed to eat 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.300
 meat 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.610
 but as I say we would run behind a 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.770
 animal the best we would give the neck and this 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.750
 We kill him but not walked the 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.280
 market we see the meat section ni 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.190
 we even want to walk around because 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.350
 stinks of death we end up by the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.020
 section of fruit vegetables and sushi 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.430
 it smells good you have to think a little 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.130
 well if you do not want to stop being 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.030
 carnivorous 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.450
 that's your problem 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.810
 but think naturally that it is the best 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.760
 what is the natural diet of the human being 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.180
 which 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.590
 I respect the idea that we are 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.079
 on top of all the other animals and that 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.420
 we can be hunters but today in 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.569
 the city who is hunter hunters are 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.150
 those those people who go and kill 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.819
 animals for pleasure are no longer hunters 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.530
 out of necessity that is not what we are 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.540
 we eat animals that are full of 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.639
 pesticides full of hormones filled with 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.979
 vaccines we do not want to eat that 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.999
 that does not do you any good and I'm going to talk 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.770
 more on those subjects 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:27.740
 I just wanted to mention because 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.740
 naturally we are not carnivores 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.710
 so I try to think like pretty and 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.750
 eat mostly 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.120
 vegan things like the Inca that does not 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.390
 I ate neither eggs nor dairy and very little 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.390
 meat 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.410
 think there 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.050
 try to do the best for your body 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.020
 the most natural what requires less 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.300
 effort for your body to digest what 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.180
 that makes you smarter to make you 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.800
 stronger that will generate more resistance 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.449
 and energy 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.449
 so that you are like the natural man
