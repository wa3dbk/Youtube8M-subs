that fun stuff but this thing right here

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.080 
that fun stuff but this thing right here
with<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.840> bipod<00:04:36.290> is<00:04:36.500> absolutely<00:04:37.460> amazing<00:04:37.730> and

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
with the bipod is absolutely amazing and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.120 
with the bipod is absolutely amazing and
also<00:04:38.419> using<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.960> eight-time<00:04:39.380> scope<00:04:39.710> with<00:04:39.950> all

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
also using the eight-time scope with all

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.550 
also using the eight-time scope with all
these<00:04:40.310> clips<00:04:40.640> um<00:04:40.990> trying<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.080> unlock<00:04:42.380> these

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560

six<00:04:42.860> times<00:04:43.070> for<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.460> think<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.730> six<00:04:43.940> times

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
six times for it I think the six times

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.790 
six times for it I think the six times
might<00:04:44.480> be<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.660> little<00:04:44.930> bit<00:04:45.050> better<00:04:45.200> suited<00:04:45.740> for
