00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
going to do is essentially grind all

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.740 
going to do is essentially grind all
these<00:03:00.890> spices<00:03:01.550> together<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:05.270> prefer<00:03:05.720> to

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
these spices together and I prefer to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.990 
these spices together and I prefer to
use<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.260> pestle<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.709> mortar<00:03:06.800> because<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:08.709> think

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
use a pestle and mortar because I think

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.550 
use a pestle and mortar because I think
with<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.180> crushing<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.870> bruising<00:03:12.380> of

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
with the crushing and the bruising of

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.590 
with the crushing and the bruising of
the<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.070> spices<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.730> herbs<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.240> get

the of the spices and the herbs you get

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.990 
the of the spices and the herbs you get
a<00:03:14.959> better<00:03:15.200> release<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.890> essential<00:03:16.370> oils<00:03:16.730> and

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
a better release of essential oils and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.500 
a better release of essential oils and
therefore<00:03:17.390> taste<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:18.860> prefer<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.190> use

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
therefore taste but if you prefer to use

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.400 
therefore taste but if you prefer to use
an<00:03:20.510> electric<00:03:21.050> chopper<00:03:21.290> by<00:03:21.709> all<00:03:21.890> means<00:03:23.410> the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
an electric chopper by all means the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.910

does help to find things together to get
things<00:04:08.330> into<00:04:08.630> powdered<00:04:09.110> form<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:10.130> can<00:04:10.340> see

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
and right here we go which we put next

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.760 
and right here we go which we put next
the<00:04:20.000> time

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.749 

yeah<00:04:29.509> well<00:04:30.509> I<00:04:30.780> tell<00:04:31.229> you<00:04:31.349> that<00:04:31.500> really<00:04:32.310> smells

good

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
good

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:43.730 
good
okay<00:04:35.220> here<00:04:35.490> we<00:04:35.580> go<00:04:42.409> see<00:04:43.409> when<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.590> make<00:04:43.680> a

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
okay here we go see when you make a

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.309 
okay here we go see when you make a
small<00:04:44.039> amount<00:04:44.220> not<00:04:45.180> only<00:04:45.449> is<00:04:45.569> it<00:04:45.599> easier<00:04:46.110> to

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
small amount not only is it easier to

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.700 
small amount not only is it easier to
control<00:04:47.300> in<00:04:48.300> terms<00:04:48.599> of<00:04:48.840> getting<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.289> all<00:04:49.500> ready

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
control in terms of getting it all ready

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.839 
control in terms of getting it all ready
but<00:04:50.129> I<00:04:50.190> think<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.669> stays<00:04:51.000> fresh<00:04:51.539> as<00:04:52.229> well

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
but I think it stays fresh as well

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.879 
but I think it stays fresh as well
because<00:04:53.849> you<00:04:54.000> know<00:04:54.120> with<00:04:54.599> any<00:04:55.349> spice<00:04:55.680> the

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
because you know with any spice the

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.020 
because you know with any spice the
longer<00:04:56.159> you<00:04:56.250> keep<00:04:56.490> things<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:59.370> less<00:04:59.550> potent

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
longer you keep things the less potent

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.010 
longer you keep things the less potent
it's<00:05:00.240> going<00:05:00.509> to<00:05:00.659> be<00:05:00.840> when<00:05:01.770> it's<00:05:01.979> aroma<00:05:03.020> and

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
it's going to be when it's aroma and

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.409 
it's going to be when it's aroma and
effectiveness<00:05:05.000> there<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.060> go

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
effectiveness there you go

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:13.159 
effectiveness there you go
can<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.870> see<00:05:07.050> that<00:05:10.879> isn't<00:05:11.879> that<00:05:12.180> fantastic

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
can you see that isn't that fantastic

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.930 
can you see that isn't that fantastic
now<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.919> do<00:05:14.490> get<00:05:14.879> the<00:05:15.210> odd<00:05:16.250> seed<00:05:17.250> that<00:05:17.639> path

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
now you do get the odd seed that path

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.879 
now you do get the odd seed that path
that<00:05:18.180> perhaps<00:05:18.360> isn't<00:05:18.810> completely<00:05:19.500> broken
