00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.100
 recording this video here for you one 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.810
 to explain a little about the 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.630
 passing preference in the 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.870
 a theme that the staff has enough 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.960
 doubt then I am going here note that 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.119
 right there on the floor is written 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.790
 which on my right has a 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.980
 stop there where the car is on the other side 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.560
 also has a priest 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.670
 so I 'll execute my stop 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.630
 here, because the signaling that is 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.380
 here from the little one and the stop sign there 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.680
 also 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.770
 the stop sign looks there on the other side of the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.850
 street show you just come here tÃ¡ 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.910
 board 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 so I have to stop part of my side 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.090
 and stop in the opposite direction 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.100
 So what do I do at that moment? 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.750
 confirmed the situation on my side 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.659
 left side of my right has no 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.820
 car has no bike has no pedestrian 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.950
 There's nothing there's no one in front of me. 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.210
 there is way vehicle puts on first 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.820
 I'm going back and I'm on my way now. 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.590
 I'm seeing a car, I hope he passes. 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.609
 his maneuver 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.429
 I follow my travels here, then I follow mine. 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.450
 way 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.450
 I developed my car is and 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:50.900
 no foundation will not take it either 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:53.510
 for the fight is the idea is to go right here 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.160
 then as in this crossing it does not have 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.690
 stop sign 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.690
 my passing preference 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.770
 So there's a street here in front of me. 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.880
 on my left side here where it is 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.880
 passing this white canopy 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.550
 the eco sport passing there then the priest is 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.880
 for him only then all the vehicles will go 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.970
 stop and cross in front of me because I 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.720
 I parked the vehicle here to be able to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.330
 burn this video here for you then O 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.550
 notice that the personnel did the maneuver without 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.280
 worrying went straight through without 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.600
 worry because the park is on the way 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.750
 transversal 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.900
 I'll try to show him here for you alone. 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.430
 in that street where now the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.310
 stop right here where I'm pointing 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.549
 It's good for you here, it's good to try 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.370
 zoom here to put the card to 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.580
 You look her right here. 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.030
 So she stays in that position so I can 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.700
 Do not see it because the priest is for 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.209
 vehicle that is coming down this street here 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.660
 O not to the street which I am 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.280
 traveling the same situation here already 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.040
 It's a little more difficult to 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.410
 see the stop sign because why 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.820
 she's well escondidinha behind the post 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.370
 here o 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.239
 so it appears only one in a little bit 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.700
 It's good here, here it is. 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.610
 near the post but you can see him in the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.120
 The retention line indicates the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.790
 which is an obligatory stop for them here 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.360
 on the floor I have the yellow line if 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.660
 was my stop would have signing 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.800
 floor here too, then how is it not? 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.950
 my way 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.350
 okay then I will walk here we put O 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.140
 the car moving again is not 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.310
 I signaled my maneuver here I am 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.150
 going out and I'll show you the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.690
 I'm going to him 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.140
 there plate and through the portion of the cross 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.250
 there written to the ground nor the 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.340
 I prefer to go on my way 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.250
 calm in peace 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.290
 should I rely on the signaling here? 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.470
 Do not have a stop sign. 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.460
 But I'm going to do the maneuver for the 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.430
 right 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.850
 here the preference of passage is mine 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.720
 fan then because in this case the 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.300
 Stop 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.850
 also on the other side in the transverse 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.900
 allowing me to make my own 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:45.040
 maneuver 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:47.900
 I'm on my way again here 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.440
 compulsory stop signaling 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.229
 I will make a left turn aa 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.200
 board telling you to hold the stop 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.560
 I'm going to put the vehicle here for my 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.560
 maneuver 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:07.370
 I looked, I did not see anyone, I made my 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.990
 square curve here what the maneuver 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.590
 to the left I go my way is always 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.810
 like this 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.810
 this is the rule of crossing
