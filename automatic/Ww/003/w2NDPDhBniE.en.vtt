we're<00:00:12.360> going<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> talk<00:00:12.690> about<00:00:12.870> voice<00:00:13.320> security

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:13.949 
we're going to talk about voice security

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:15.680 
we're going to talk about voice security
and<00:00:14.369> some<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> steps<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.480> take

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
and some of the steps that you can take

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.160 
and some of the steps that you can take
to<00:00:16.199> ensure<00:00:16.320> your<00:00:16.740> calls<00:00:17.010> are<00:00:17.250> secure<00:00:17.610> i<00:00:18.170> think

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
to ensure your calls are secure i think

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.980 
to ensure your calls are secure i think
the<00:00:19.260> first<00:00:19.500> thing<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.070> say<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.420> easiest

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the first thing to say is the easiest

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.590 
the first thing to say is the easiest
step<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.560> all<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.190> to<00:00:23.400> assume<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.390> calls

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
step of all is to assume that your calls

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.380 
step of all is to assume that your calls
are<00:00:24.780> not<00:00:24.810> secure<00:00:25.310> by<00:00:26.310> assuming<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:27.150> calls

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
are not secure by assuming your calls

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.900 
are not secure by assuming your calls
are<00:00:27.600> not<00:00:27.750> secure<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.740> then<00:00:28.980> causes<00:00:29.610> you<00:00:29.760> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
are not secure it then causes you to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
are not secure it then causes you to
take<00:00:30.120> common-sense<00:00:30.660> steps<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.920> ensure<00:00:32.309> that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
take common-sense steps to ensure that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.529 
take common-sense steps to ensure that
people<00:00:32.820> can't<00:00:33.210> easily<00:00:33.510> intersexual<00:00:34.350> calls

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
people can't easily intersexual calls

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.850 
people can't easily intersexual calls
once<00:00:36.539> you've<00:00:36.809> taken<00:00:36.989> those<00:00:37.320> common-sense

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
once you've taken those common-sense

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.950 
once you've taken those common-sense
steps<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.670> instance<00:00:39.060> not<00:00:39.630> having<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
steps for instance not having a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
steps for instance not having a
conversation<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.829> crowded<00:00:41.070> airport<00:00:41.579> lounge

or on a train then there are some other

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.800 
or on a train then there are some other
things<00:00:44.220> that<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.329> ensure<00:00:45.780> that

safe is possible with many phones to be

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
safe is possible with many phones to be
