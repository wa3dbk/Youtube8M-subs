00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 good morning friends i am rubÃ©n and i and 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.339
 we are in a new game of ska 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.200
 same if we are here on the map detail 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.050
 and as you see this time I have taken the kit 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.580
 of the iron armor because in this 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.599
 map if I'm not mistaken there are only two 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.960
 initial chests 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.640
 so if indeed solid to not 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.680
 be not up here or anything and that's why 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.910
 I had the possibility that I 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.529
 play a sword and effectively 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.590
 perfect I have touched a sword of 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.150
 diamond so let's see or think 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.720
 that I think I 've done well sincerely 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.730
 I hope not to mistake that eye here 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.280
 that the ally is worth now if we go to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.620
 put this here here order it as 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.600
 you know what I do I always have a bow 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.930
 with arrows or perfect perfect perfect 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.340
 and this is worth it, so I'll start pretty 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.200
 well sincerely shaman touches things 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.809
 pretty good I have to say it and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.440
 let's see if I can take advantage of it and not 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:57.250
 mess a lot little eye a lot no goal 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.260
 damn it is to break that because mother 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.930
 mine because it's going to make me bitter 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.710
 worth 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.710
 the state that is born 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.039
 today mother is gone, let's see 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.840
 how do I do it in such a way because I have 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.159
 the two that does not leave any 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.490
 rufus 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.140

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.060
 let's see here there's no one to see 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:34.179

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.959

 more game modes it's worth apart from that 

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:35.819
 because I know that maybe it was because 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.349
 bringing too heyward but 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.830
