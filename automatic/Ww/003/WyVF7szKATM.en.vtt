00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
get from smoke eater 908 so physically

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.429 
get from smoke eater 908 so physically
the<00:02:14.329> took<00:02:15.329> six<00:02:15.569> hundred<00:02:15.840> milliliter<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.409> a

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
the took six hundred milliliter is a

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.380 
the took six hundred milliliter is a
shorter<00:02:17.099> squatter<00:02:17.549> your<00:02:17.790> mug

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
shorter squatter your mug

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.869 
shorter squatter your mug
then<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.260> Snow<00:02:20.129> Peak<00:02:20.159> six<00:02:20.549> hundred<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.849> can

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
then the Snow Peak six hundred you can

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.470 
then the Snow Peak six hundred you can
see<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.329> Snow<00:02:21.540> Peak<00:02:21.569> 600<00:02:22.489> almost<00:02:23.489> fits

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
see that the Snow Peak 600 almost fits

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.619 
see that the Snow Peak 600 almost fits
inside<00:02:24.689> of<00:02:24.989> there<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:26.099> looks<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.519> about

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
inside of there it looks like it's about

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.490 
inside of there it looks like it's about
half<00:02:27.629> an<00:02:27.810> inch<00:02:27.930> shorter<00:02:28.799> or<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:31.230> let's<00:02:31.409> look

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
half an inch shorter or so so let's look

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:40.309 
half an inch shorter or so so let's look

thing<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.290> did<00:04:01.650> see<00:04:02.579> that<00:04:02.609> was<00:04:02.909> kind<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.329> little

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
thing I did see that was kind of little

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.619 
thing I did see that was kind of little
quirky<00:04:04.229> to<00:04:04.349> me<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.970> wasn't<00:04:06.120> just<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.419> the

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
quirky to me it wasn't just that the

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.270 
quirky to me it wasn't just that the
handles<00:04:07.049> are<00:04:07.199> long<00:04:07.500> they're<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:08.099> little

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
handles are long they're a little

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.219 
handles are long they're a little
different<00:04:08.459> because<00:04:08.759> they're<00:04:09.090> narrow<00:04:09.900> and

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.229 
different because they're narrow and

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:11.869 
different because they're narrow and
long<00:04:10.379> you<00:04:10.709> hold<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:11.040> kinda<00:04:11.280> like<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.519> like<00:04:11.849> a

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
long you hold it kinda like a like a

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.300 
long you hold it kinda like a like a
frying<00:04:12.209> pan<00:04:12.329> handle<00:04:12.810> but<00:04:13.439> they<00:04:13.919> don't<00:04:14.099> line<00:04:14.280> up

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
it's a design intent so you can collapse

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
about a quarter-inch I'm sure I could

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.910 
about a quarter-inch I'm sure I could

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
I just don't know if that was a design
