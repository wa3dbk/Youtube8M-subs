commentary<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:06.720> actually<00:04:06.989> using<00:04:07.260> my<00:04:07.440> iPhone

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
commentary and actually using my iPhone

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.220 
commentary and actually using my iPhone
to<00:04:08.519> record<00:04:08.609> this<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.359> bear<00:04:09.870> with<00:04:09.900> me

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
to record this so bear with me

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.650 
to record this so bear with me
so<00:04:10.980> first<00:04:11.250> up<00:04:11.400> was<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.700> get<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.030> up<00:04:12.239> on<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
so first up was to get it up on the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.750 
so first up was to get it up on the
jacks<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:14.069> wheels<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:16.250> yeah<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.459> we<00:04:17.579> see

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
jacks and the wheels and yeah so we see

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.750 
jacks and the wheels and yeah so we see
that<00:04:17.940> going<00:04:18.479> on<00:04:18.690> right<00:04:18.900> now<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.470> then<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
that going on right now and then the

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.879 
that going on right now and then the
next<00:04:21.000> step<00:04:21.090> was<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.269> place<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.870> TPMS<00:04:22.500> sensors

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
next step was to place the TPMS sensors

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.440 
next step was to place the TPMS sensors
on<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.280> wheels<00:04:23.460> themselves<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.180> see

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
on the wheels themselves so you see

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.540 
on the wheels themselves so you see
they're<00:04:24.599> not<00:04:24.630> ice<00:04:25.380> cream<00:04:25.410> those<00:04:25.860> on<00:04:26.039> right

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
they're not ice cream those on right

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.529 
they're not ice cream those on right
there<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:29.010> then<00:04:29.250> we<00:04:29.729> got<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.090> front<00:04:30.240> part

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
there and then we got to the front part

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.180 
there and then we got to the front part
we're<00:04:31.229> gonna<00:04:31.320> go<00:04:31.530> ahead<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.770> install<00:04:32.099> the

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
we're gonna go ahead and install the

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.290 
we're gonna go ahead and install the
tires<00:04:32.960> so<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.950> wheel<00:04:35.340> itself<00:04:35.700> gets<00:04:36.030> locked

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
tires so the wheel itself gets locked

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.280 
tires so the wheel itself gets locked
into<00:04:36.510> position

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.140 

and<00:04:39.680> this<00:04:40.040> was<00:04:40.220> actually<00:04:40.490> really<00:04:40.700> cool<00:04:40.970> to

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
and this was actually really cool to

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.930 
and this was actually really cool to
watch<00:04:41.300> so<00:04:41.930> they<00:04:42.020> basically<00:04:42.140> loop<00:04:42.740> up<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.340> tire

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
watch so they basically loop up the tire

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.750 
watch so they basically loop up the tire
with<00:04:44.510> I<00:04:44.750> guess<00:04:45.100> nothing<00:04:46.100> for<00:04:46.340> sure<00:04:46.370> it's<00:04:46.700> the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
with I guess nothing for sure it's the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.250 
with I guess nothing for sure it's the
thing<00:04:46.970> might<00:04:47.120> be<00:04:47.270> some<00:04:47.450> kind<00:04:47.780> of<00:04:47.870> soap<00:04:48.050> or

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
thing might be some kind of soap or

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.830 
thing might be some kind of soap or
something<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:49.580> then<00:04:49.760> they<00:04:49.910> just<00:04:50.150> pretty<00:04:50.720> much

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
something and then they just pretty much

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.950 
something and then they just pretty much
wedge<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.590> tire<00:04:51.920> onto<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.700> wheel<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.870> then

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
wedge the tire onto the wheel and then

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.500 
wedge the tire onto the wheel and then
you'll<00:04:54.080> see<00:04:54.490> them<00:04:55.490> inflate<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:55.940> wheeler<00:04:56.120> and

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
you'll see them inflate the wheeler and

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.470 
you'll see them inflate the wheeler and
that's<00:04:57.440> pretty<00:04:57.680> much<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:58.040> end<00:04:58.070> of<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:58.460> it's<00:04:59.450> a

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
that's pretty much the end of it it's a

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:15.550 
that's pretty much the end of it it's a
pretty<00:04:59.720> basic<00:04:59.870> stuff

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.700 

all<00:05:16.560> right<00:05:16.710> now<00:05:17.070> once<00:05:17.370> that<00:05:17.610> was<00:05:17.760> done<00:05:17.940> I<00:05:18.870> went

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
all right now once that was done I went

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.010 
all right now once that was done I went
ahead<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.010> took<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:20.220> quick<00:05:20.460> video<00:05:20.820> of<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.750> shop

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
ahead and took a quick video of the shop

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.260 
ahead and took a quick video of the shop
so<00:05:22.350> it's<00:05:23.010> a<00:05:23.070> very<00:05:23.310> nice<00:05:23.460> space<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:23.940> be<00:05:24.090> in

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
so it's a very nice space to be in

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.210 
so it's a very nice space to be in
lots<00:05:25.260> of<00:05:25.380> very<00:05:26.220> fast<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:26.730> pretty<00:05:26.850> cars<00:05:28.220> then

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
lots of very fast and pretty cars then

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.880 
lots of very fast and pretty cars then
the<00:05:29.610> wheels<00:05:29.850> went<00:05:30.180> onto<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.660> car<00:05:30.930> itself<00:05:31.170> how

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
the wheels went onto the car itself how

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.010 
the wheels went onto the car itself how
bad<00:05:32.870> also<00:05:33.870> very<00:05:34.260> very<00:05:34.920> careful<00:05:35.310> about<00:05:35.430> this

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
bad also very very careful about this

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.360 
bad also very very careful about this
actually<00:05:37.020> it's<00:05:37.110> more<00:05:37.230> referencing<00:05:37.830> try<00:05:38.310> to

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
actually it's more referencing try to

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.910 
actually it's more referencing try to
get<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.610> help<00:05:38.730> centric<00:05:39.090> rings<00:05:39.420> to<00:05:39.810> be<00:05:40.710> able<00:05:40.770> to

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
get to help centric rings to be able to

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.350 
get to help centric rings to be able to
install<00:05:41.130> your<00:05:41.370> wheels<00:05:41.580> a<00:05:41.700> little<00:05:41.730> bit<00:05:41.970> easier

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
install your wheels a little bit easier

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.960 
install your wheels a little bit easier
that<00:05:42.390> way<00:05:42.720> you<00:05:42.840> don't<00:05:42.990> have<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.490> balance<00:05:44.490> it<00:05:44.790> so

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
that way you don't have to balance it so

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.240 
that way you don't have to balance it so
you<00:05:45.060> can<00:05:45.210> put<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:45.900> lugs<00:05:46.140> on<00:05:46.350> it<00:05:46.800> is<00:05:46.950> so<00:05:47.100> much

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
you can put the lugs on it is so much

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.370 
you can put the lugs on it is so much
easier<00:05:47.550> with<00:05:47.730> a<00:05:47.760> hub<00:05:48.150> centric<00:05:48.450> ring<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:49.290> after

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
easier with a hub centric ring and after

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.130 
easier with a hub centric ring and after
that<00:05:49.620> you<00:05:49.740> saw<00:05:50.030> one<00:05:51.030> of<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.300> harbor's<00:05:51.870> guys

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
that you saw one of the harbor's guys

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.870 
that you saw one of the harbor's guys
put<00:05:52.980> on<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.100> little<00:05:53.340> bit<00:05:53.430> of<00:05:53.520> tire<00:05:53.700> dressing

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
put on a little bit of tire dressing

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.730 
put on a little bit of tire dressing
which<00:05:54.180> is<00:05:54.270> always<00:05:54.420> nice<00:05:54.750> and<00:05:54.990> appreciated<00:05:55.560> and

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
which is always nice and appreciated and

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.470 
which is always nice and appreciated and
then<00:05:56.430> we<00:05:57.120> were<00:05:57.320> gonna<00:05:58.320> go<00:05:58.560> ahead<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:59.480> torque

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
then we were gonna go ahead and torque

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.860 
then we were gonna go ahead and torque
down<00:06:00.630> all<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.440> lug<00:06:01.680> nuts<00:06:02.040> I<00:06:02.390> believe<00:06:03.390> will

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
down all the lug nuts I believe will

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.590 
down all the lug nuts I believe will
Subarus<00:06:04.260> is<00:06:04.500> recommended<00:06:05.010> between<00:06:05.670> 70<00:06:06.240> to<00:06:06.270> 80

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
Subarus is recommended between 70 to 80
