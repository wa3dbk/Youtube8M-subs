isn't as user friendly to update but

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.800 
isn't as user friendly to update but
it's<00:00:25.500> much<00:00:25.769> faster<00:00:26.010> because<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.970> you

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it's much faster because of this you

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.750 
it's much faster because of this you
write<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> content<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.859> different<00:00:29.070> languages
