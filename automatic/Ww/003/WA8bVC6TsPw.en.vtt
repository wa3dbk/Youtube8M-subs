problem with that was it was causing a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.330 
problem with that was it was causing a
lot<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> problems<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.670> said<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.000> would

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
lot of problems like they said it would

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.029 
lot of problems like they said it would
you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.460> take<00:00:44.789> away<00:00:45.000> power<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.800> Xbox

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

you know take away power from the Xbox
itself<00:00:47.610> which<00:00:48.059> was<00:00:48.270> causing<00:00:48.510> things<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.079> fail

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
itself which was causing things to fail

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.010 
itself which was causing things to fail
in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> Xbox<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.570> one

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
in the Xbox so with this one

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
they added the separate power which is

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.610 
they added the separate power which is
really<00:00:56.309> great<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> lot<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.660> they

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
really great I like that a lot and they

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.100 
really great I like that a lot and they
also<00:00:58.800> added<00:00:59.100> a<00:01:01.219> heat<00:01:02.219> sensor<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.539> sensor<00:01:04.019> in

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
also added a heat sensor as a sensor in

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.679 
also added a heat sensor as a sensor in
here<00:01:04.290> they<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.729> automatically<00:01:06.360> turn<00:01:06.659> on

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
here they will automatically turn on

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.060 
here they will automatically turn on
when<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.680> temperature<00:01:07.710> gets<00:01:08.549> too<00:01:08.880> hot<00:01:09.860> on<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
when the temperature gets too hot on the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.980 
when the temperature gets too hot on the
Xbox<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.330> start<00:01:13.049> cooling<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:14.159> way<00:01:14.400> and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
Xbox and will start cooling that way and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.780 
Xbox and will start cooling that way and
it<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.140> turn<00:01:16.439> off<00:01:16.710> when<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.340> temperature

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it will turn off when the temperature

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.210 
it will turn off when the temperature
drops<00:01:18.090> low<00:01:18.299> enough<00:01:18.920> automatically<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.100> when

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
drops low enough automatically so when

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.280 
drops low enough automatically so when
you<00:01:20.460> turn<00:01:20.729> your<00:01:20.970> Xbox<00:01:21.390> off<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:22.080> will

you turn your Xbox off this will

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.020 
you turn your Xbox off this will
actually<00:01:22.439> keep<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:23.220> till<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> temperature

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
actually keep going till the temperature

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.870 
actually keep going till the temperature
in<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.750> Xbox<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:26.040> cool<00:01:26.310> enough<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
in your Xbox is you know cool enough to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.770 
in your Xbox is you know cool enough to
where<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> will<00:01:27.299> shut<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.780> off<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:29.329> as<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.479> see

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
where it will shut it off and as you see

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
where it will shut it off and as you see
I<00:01:31.020> mean<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.619> fits<00:01:31.920> pretty<00:01:32.100> good<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.640> with

and haven't I've had had a little
trouble<00:01:45.700> fitting<00:01:46.450> in<00:01:46.600> between<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.080> power

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
trouble fitting in between the power

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.950 
trouble fitting in between the power
cord<00:01:47.950> because<00:01:48.130> it's<00:01:48.250> kind<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.520> close<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.150> see

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
cord because it's kind of close and see

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.210 
cord because it's kind of close and see
here<00:01:50.490> I'm<00:01:51.490> gonna<00:01:51.670> push<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.479> down<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.660> little<00:01:52.900> bit

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
here I'm gonna push it down a little bit

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.000 
here I'm gonna push it down a little bit
but<00:01:54.220> you<00:01:54.520> know<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:55.300> fits<00:01:55.540> good<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.860> know

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
but you know it fits good and you know

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.040 
but you know it fits good and you know
it's<00:02:00.310> it's<00:02:00.729> it's<00:02:01.060> pretty<00:02:01.420> quiet<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.960> know

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
it's it's it's pretty quiet you know

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.170 
it's it's it's pretty quiet you know
compares<00:02:02.500> like<00:02:02.740> if<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.070> took<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.460> off<00:02:03.670> and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
compares like if you took this off and

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.999 
compares like if you took this off and
your<00:02:04.300> Xbox<00:02:04.660> fan<00:02:04.900> was<00:02:05.080> running<00:02:05.380> itself<00:02:05.740> you

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
your Xbox fan was running itself you

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.520 
your Xbox fan was running itself you
know<00:02:06.160> it's<00:02:06.880> not<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.300> much<00:02:07.450> louder<00:02:07.720> than<00:02:08.140> what

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
know it's not that much louder than what

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.310 
know it's not that much louder than what
your<00:02:08.740> Xbox<00:02:09.250> are<00:02:09.429> probably<00:02:09.700> wrong<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.869> and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
your Xbox are probably wrong so and

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.199 
your Xbox are probably wrong so and
another<00:02:12.040> thing<00:02:12.430> different<00:02:12.910> from<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
another thing different from the

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.310 
another thing different from the
original<00:02:13.620> intercooler<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:17.110> one

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
original intercooler is this one

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.770 
original intercooler is this one
actually<00:02:17.500> blows<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.520> fans<00:02:19.000> blow<00:02:19.300> out<00:02:19.480> I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
actually blows out the fans blow out I

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.170 
actually blows out the fans blow out I
remember<00:02:20.290> with<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.310> believe<00:02:21.820> in<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180
