00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.550
 The shapes of both shoulders are different 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.550
 Only this part is dark metallic purple 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.740

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.299
 Here is how it works 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.040
 This kite parts umbrella parts are 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.340
 If you stick like this 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.570

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.570
 It is somewhat cute 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:53.290
 Next will attach to deluxe and ride 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.290
 First of all the umbrella parts are behind this hinge 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.170
 Run 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.820
 And next is chopsticks parts 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.710
 Expand here 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.060
 Then 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.410
 here 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.410
 This is a ring 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.050
 And it'll be known in this way 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.050
 Deploy like this 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.520
 this 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.520
 I'll give it to you 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:36.380
 What is this ring when attaching it to the body of the Masked Rider Drive and Tri mud 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.880
 This will change direction when you attach it to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:45.400
 So use this ring to invert the connection joint 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.400
 Now than a state obtained by inverting the ring 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.660
 As you can see 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.420
 Can be attached to the pride path 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:14.599
 Finally it's had come to seat in this state body that it up to now in the person who screw is visible 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.599
 Rainbow comes up this time 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.880
 This is and lower this part down 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.540
 Even though this tire umbrella parts I put in the drive of the head 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.650
 There are right and left as you see 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.650
 right left 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.349
 Orientation date will be just like this 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:42.709
 Covered after confirming the right and the left always just to engage perfect for this part 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.709
 Please give me 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.330
 It is Kansai Kamen Rider Drive Type Fruit 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.890
 Please see 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.890
 It is pretty cool, too 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:13.519
 After all I feel that putting an orange umbrella on this head is very novel 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:17.180
 Just that I want you to be careful only one point this umbrella Tsu parts 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:22.130
 Because only this part of this soft part of the drive is attached 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.720
 I think that I will not get damaged if I move only my head by holding only umbrella parts in the second part 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.300
 It seems that a strange habit is attached 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:34.069
 I just thought I was very worried 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.069
 The rest is very good You can turn this part of the tire manually 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.849
 It is not a feeling that and say, so this clean Shurushu look- 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.860
 It feels like I'll stop for a moment 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:49.229
 It is the comparison with the driver steaming 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:52.949
 It's good for both, I think it's like there's one and there's one 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:57.780
 Both or would have been this time of review how in the not say
