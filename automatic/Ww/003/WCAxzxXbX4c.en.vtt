00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
 even though i know a lot too many this is the moment i had been waiting for 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.010
 that has done it 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.490
 check the statistics here 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.490
 the self-confident 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.380
 contador got that far again 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.499
 he is so much better 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.210
 if you do this looks like this 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.749
 with which you come it by cycling 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.749
 you can ask retrospectively what they are wrong with 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.420
 contador 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.910
 place three the big laps that has not ridden once 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.020
 it has become a certain factor 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.060
 this summer 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.020
 although the training 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.750
 it's watching 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.250
 it is also known 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.410
 it's over 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 And it's almost incredible to take off 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.530
 by bike 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.370
 Imagine that your tax has long been targeted relative to 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.810
 the match ended 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 alberto contador wins the time trial 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.910
 therefore doing nothing at all 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.180
 He is in practice for the second time. First it was goodbye 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.960
 colour 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 there is also an arsenal ranking 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.510
 he's really back 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.840
 I was here at the top of the Mont Ventoux x 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.840
 but there's more 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 8 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 yes that goes bad 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.159
 why stood to curb the cutlery 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.329
 the point of attack wietse van alten search 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.339
 that's why he went looking for the sports car tour de france 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.969
 amstrong released on a personal basis from the Schleck brothers 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 frank schleck still rose but places 8 in the rankings 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.489
 especially the father 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.689
 contador got that far again 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.689
 looks like you should look anyway 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.429
 it is the day of the selection is already 78th cda has never been satisfied 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.429
 customers 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.989
 the app store 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.989
 Leekens the top class 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.529
 France 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.709
 van vollenhoven 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.709
 So the battle at the head of the selection is 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.599
 and that at 2 francs at 3 but then the time trial comes 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.979
 the media etc that the first best meantime 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.409
 that punishment was definitely not doing bad 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.379
 not that he's the eighth time 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.379
 the hospital can do security on wall street if we continue like this 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.479
 we are pleased about it 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:39.089
 the Greek deficit 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.160
 exactly 45 15 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.539
 during training in seefeld at 12 seconds 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.740
 the fear of getting the state back on stage 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.020
 well not know a very great time but then the mont ventoux should come there 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.020
 the happening 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.799
 there goes the judge 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.799
 yes i'm sure it was hit hard 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.299
 and that perform poorly 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.699
 hendrik, of course, also swing 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.199
 contador is going off media that is fun in Amsterdam 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.489
 and that site 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.059
 alberto contador 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.659
 Williams Armstrong 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.830
 Frank Schleck is his attack 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.050
 with all due respect 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.150
 to be a loose bag 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.779
 the tour is definitely alberto contador wins for the second time for an interview 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:36.789
 children who did not want to, the building was the most important on stage 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.169
 contador was a win 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.169
 that is at least an hour to the winter circus again 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.299
 the passengers are in the hands of the trains
