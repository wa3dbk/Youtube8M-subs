sometimes these are even called a curls

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.479 
sometimes these are even called a curls
because<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.200> looks<00:02:19.379> like<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.739> letter<00:02:19.890> ate<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.699 
to secure in place and usually I like to
crisscross<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.170> was<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.379> they're<00:02:25.530> more

secure so here you can see the a curl is

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.819 
secure so here you can see the a curl is
slightly<00:02:30.299> hiding<00:02:30.780> off<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.200> top<00:02:31.410> that's
