00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.920 
third i took his fix you now 68 was also
a<00:04:36.130> pretty<00:04:36.400> necessary<00:04:37.090> talent<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.570> thought<00:04:37.780> it

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
a pretty necessary talent I thought it

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.930 
a pretty necessary talent I thought it
frost<00:04:38.260> death<00:04:38.500> Knight<00:04:38.710> needed<00:04:39.040> frost<00:04:39.730> death

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
frost death Knight needed frost death

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.250 
frost death Knight needed frost death
Knights<00:04:40.150> can<00:04:40.480> get<00:04:40.720> pretty<00:04:40.960> squishy

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
Knights can get pretty squishy

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.840 
Knights can get pretty squishy
especially<00:04:42.010> since<00:04:42.160> they<00:04:42.280> don't<00:04:42.400> really<00:04:42.610> have

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
especially since they don't really have

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.760 
especially since they don't really have
a<00:04:42.880> way<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.090> recuperate<00:04:43.480> their<00:04:43.900> health<00:04:44.080> so

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
a way to recuperate their health so

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.680 
a way to recuperate their health so
having<00:04:45.160> as<00:04:45.280> much<00:04:45.490> control<00:04:45.850> over<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.450> other

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
having as much control over the other

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.730 
having as much control over the other
players<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.110> can<00:04:47.410> his<00:04:48.100> mandatory<00:04:49.590> next<00:04:50.590> I

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
players you can his mandatory next I

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.500 
players you can his mandatory next I
took<00:04:50.830> death<00:04:51.280> pack<00:04:51.490> now<00:04:51.760> taking<00:04:52.060> death<00:04:52.240> pact

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
took death pack now taking death pact

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.300 
took death pack now taking death pact
over<00:04:52.870> death<00:04:53.080> siphon<00:04:53.500> was<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> much<00:04:53.980> harder

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
over death siphon was a much harder

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.190 
over death siphon was a much harder
choice<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:55.060> make<00:04:55.180> than<00:04:55.480> the<00:04:55.510> last<00:04:55.750> three<00:04:56.020> were

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
choice to make than the last three were

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.170 
choice to make than the last three were
now<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.890> reason<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.250> took<00:04:57.340> death<00:04:57.640> pact<00:04:57.880> over

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
now the reason I took death pact over

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.909 
now the reason I took death pact over
death<00:04:58.330> siphon<00:04:58.720> was<00:04:58.900> because<00:04:59.260> I've<00:04:59.470> tried<00:04:59.710> him

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
death siphon was because I've tried him

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.860 
death siphon was because I've tried him
both<00:05:00.040> out<00:05:00.310> death<00:05:00.760> siphon<00:05:01.180> seems<00:05:01.510> like<00:05:01.690> it

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
both out death siphon seems like it

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.300 
both out death siphon seems like it
would<00:05:02.020> work<00:05:02.169> better<00:05:02.380> but<00:05:02.890> under<00:05:03.190> the

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
would work better but under the

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.520 
would work better but under the
circumstances<00:05:04.000> death<00:05:04.450> pact<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.960> much<00:05:05.290> more

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
circumstances death pact is much more

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.070 
circumstances death pact is much more
efficient<00:05:06.240> lastly<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.390> took<00:05:07.780> granite

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
efficient lastly I took granite

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.990 
efficient lastly I took granite

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
geared I took granite corruption and

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.320 
geared I took granite corruption and
