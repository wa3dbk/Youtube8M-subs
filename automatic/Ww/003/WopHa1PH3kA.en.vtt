as<00:00:32.529> you<00:00:32.649> can<00:00:32.770> see<00:00:32.980> I've<00:00:33.399> sealed<00:00:33.969> the<00:00:34.629> ceiling

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
as you can see I've sealed the ceiling

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.770 
as you can see I've sealed the ceiling
around<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:36.070> light<00:00:36.520> fit<00:00:36.790> in<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.300> area<00:00:37.660> I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
around the light fit in the area I

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.900 
around the light fit in the area I
intend<00:00:38.170> to<00:00:38.260> wear<00:00:38.379> FX<00:00:38.710> or<00:00:39.040> texture<00:00:39.489> on<00:00:39.640> we're

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
intend to wear FX or texture on we're

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.389 
intend to wear FX or texture on we're
looking<00:00:40.149> for<00:00:40.300> this<00:00:40.390> Sheen<00:00:40.949> before<00:00:41.949> we<00:00:42.040> texture

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
looking for this Sheen before we texture

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.530 
looking for this Sheen before we texture
onto<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:43.050> surface<00:00:44.050> because<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.910> I<00:00:46.090> take<00:00:46.239> just

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
onto the surface because if I take just

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.520 
onto the surface because if I take just
rig<00:00:46.660> onto<00:00:46.930> a<00:00:46.989> mat<00:00:47.290> flat<00:00:48.480> surface<00:00:49.480> this<00:00:50.260> surface

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
rig onto a mat flat surface this surface

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.670 
rig onto a mat flat surface this surface
is<00:00:50.920> quite<00:00:51.129> porous<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:53.050> as<00:00:53.110> soon<00:00:53.260> as<00:00:53.350> I<00:00:53.500> leave

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
is quite porous so as soon as I leave

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.979 
is quite porous so as soon as I leave
the<00:00:53.800> texture<00:00:54.159> onto<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.640> surface<00:00:55.120> it'll<00:00:55.690> draw

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
the texture onto the surface it'll draw

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.229 
the texture onto the surface it'll draw
into<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.559> ceiling<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.699> it<00:00:57.850> will<00:00:57.940> not<00:00:58.089> give

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
into the ceiling and it will not give

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.219 
into the ceiling and it will not give
you<00:00:58.300> enough<00:00:58.420> time<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:59.399> use<00:01:00.399> your<00:01:00.579> home<00:01:00.729> tools

you enough time to use your home tools

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.990 
you enough time to use your home tools
so<00:01:02.229> I've<00:01:02.350> sealed<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:03.040> ceiling<00:01:03.400> along<00:01:03.670> there

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
so I've sealed the ceiling along there

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.290 

I<00:01:24.310> want<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.400> talk<00:01:25.550> about<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.880> tools<00:01:26.120> and

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
I want to talk about the tools and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.420 
I want to talk about the tools and
materials<00:01:26.810> we<00:01:27.140> can<00:01:27.290> do<00:01:27.440> there<00:01:27.770> we<00:01:27.980> can<00:01:28.130> use<00:01:28.280> to

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
materials we can do there we can use to

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.370 
materials we can do there we can use to
create<00:01:28.550> this<00:01:28.760> pattern<00:01:29.180> first<00:01:29.870> of<00:01:30.050> all<00:01:30.110> we<00:01:30.260> have

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
create this pattern first of all we have

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.740 
create this pattern first of all we have
the<00:01:30.710> bucket<00:01:30.980> of<00:01:31.070> texture<00:01:31.640> which<00:01:32.450> will<00:01:32.630> be

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
the bucket of texture which will be

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.480 
the bucket of texture which will be
mixed<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.350> correct<00:01:33.620> consistency<00:01:33.950> for

mixed to the correct consistency for

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.940 
mixed to the correct consistency for
cold<00:01:34.760> I've<00:01:35.150> used<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.540> blunder<00:01:35.990> event<00:01:36.710> that<00:01:36.860> is

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
cold I've used a blunder event that is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.250 
cold I've used a blunder event that is
its<00:01:37.130> tool<00:01:38.530> which<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.910> quite<00:01:40.910> cheap<00:01:41.120> easy<00:01:42.080> to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
its tool which is quite cheap easy to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.100 
its tool which is quite cheap easy to
use<00:01:42.560> for<00:01:42.920> occasional<00:01:43.490> use<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.510> basically

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
use for occasional use and basically

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.790 
use for occasional use and basically
that's<00:01:45.380> it

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
that's it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.430 
that's it
