thing you got to be skilled enough to
use<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.020> because<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.649> recoil<00:00:41.160> comes<00:00:41.640> along

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
use it because the recoil comes along

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.100 
use it because the recoil comes along
with<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.300> power<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.940> accuracy<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> AK

gonna get very many kills that lets you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.939 
gonna get very many kills that lets you
really<00:01:00.570> close<00:01:00.899> range<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.559> you're<00:01:01.800> just

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
really close range and you're just

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.060 
really close range and you're just
pumping<00:01:02.430> into<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.730> gas<00:01:02.969> chest<00:01:03.710> I'd<00:01:04.710> say<00:01:04.979> if

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
pumping into a gas chest I'd say if

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.700 
pumping into a gas chest I'd say if
you're<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> new<00:01:05.760> AK<00:01:06.180> user<00:01:06.450> start<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.290> Egypt

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you're a new AK user start out on Egypt

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.500 
you're a new AK user start out on Egypt
it's<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> easiest<00:01:08.460> map<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.030> kills<00:01:09.270> with

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it's the easiest map to get kills with

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
it's the easiest map to get kills with
it<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.840> slowly<00:01:10.530> work<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:10.950> way<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
it and slowly work your way up to the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.830 
it and slowly work your way up to the
larger<00:01:12.000> scale<00:01:12.210> maps<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.490> reload<00:01:14.880> rate<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.360> not

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
larger scale maps the reload rate is not

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.120 
larger scale maps the reload rate is not
that<00:01:16.020> great<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:18.150> takes<00:01:18.560> just<00:01:19.560> over<00:01:19.710> three

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that great it takes just over three

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.240 
that great it takes just over three
seconds<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.970> empty<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> clip<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.740> AK<00:01:23.070> as

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
seconds to empty the clip in the AK as

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.120 
seconds to empty the clip in the AK as
you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.840> reload<00:01:25.350> rate<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.770> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you can see here the reload rate as you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.840 
you can see here the reload rate as you
can<00:01:26.310> also<00:01:26.460> see<00:01:26.850> takes<00:01:27.409> 2.9<00:01:28.409> seconds<00:01:28.920> which<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
can also see takes 2.9 seconds which is

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.730 
can also see takes 2.9 seconds which is
almost<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.360> long<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> takes<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> empty<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
almost as long as it takes to empty the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.249 
almost as long as it takes to empty the
clip<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.820> that's<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.390> great<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:34.110> not

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
clip so that's not that great it's not

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.730 
clip so that's not that great it's not
the<00:01:34.380> worst<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.990> you're<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.530> might
