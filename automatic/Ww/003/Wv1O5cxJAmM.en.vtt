 booklet and we are in a news 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.000
 started late next cargadita 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.460
 important news first of all what 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.619
 I recommend as always to go through these 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.050
 this morning news that come 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.119
 also with important news 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.460
 said this attention because they are 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.169
 receiving the first complaints of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.800
 developers that work for 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.380
 microsoft 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.960
 specifically for kinect since the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.329
 developer harmonix has reacted to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.860
 the sale of xbox one without kinect 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 remember that harmonix is ​​a study 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.050
 that develops games in which kinect 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.760
 is the main tool and there has been 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.960
 quite strong directions you have them 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.630
 in the source of the description if 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.580
 you want to check it remember that in the 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.860
 yesterday because Microsoft downgraded the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.640
 price of your console in exchange for removing 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 kinect of the pack 399 euros from 9 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.180
 June this can be a great joy 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.000
 for the buyer but attention because 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.080
 for developers especially for 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.560
 those who are working right now 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.990
 for kinect it has been a hard blow 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.549
 and take it without going any further harmonix 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.880
 mainly game developer 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.740
 for kinect has not taken anything well the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.329
 fact that microsoft has decided 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.110
 separate the console from this device 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:28.039
 necessary for your titles the user 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.750
 remember we will have to buy kinect 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.439
 to be able to play these titles 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.420
 specific, what surely will be 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.149
 will notice in the sales number of said 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.039
 game nick chester publicist 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:46.920
 Harmonix has posted on his account 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:49.080
 twitter you good first now 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.319
 according to microsoft the developers have 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.049
 to work harder so that what 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:58.110
 believe in kinect be innovative and they 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.750
 have responded several less badly than 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.000
 we were already doing this there are 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.369
 to remember that the company is 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.349
 currently working on fantasy music 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.349
 evolved whose trailer you have at the source 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:12.299
 in the description is a musical game 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.370
 exclusive of microsoft consoles and 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.020
 what do you need from kinect 2.0 to 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.420
 to interact 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.760
 remember that Microsoft explained its 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.490
 reasons to get to be able to 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.010
 Remove kinect from the sale kits 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.600
 next to the console and said well as 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.360
 can you imagine we have strong 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.340
 relations with developers both 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.440
 we look at the problem in the same way and 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.570
 we love kinect and we love their 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.090
 possibilities but at the same time we want 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.060
 have a large number of users this 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.350
 is the explanation that microsoft has given 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.140
 remember that many new ones are 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.420
 based entirely on kinect and others 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.320
 games are better when used together 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.850
 to kinect but according to mehdi can follow 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.950
 working without it so really 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.070
 these statements these reactions of 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.290
 harmonix because they contrast with the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.940
 Microsoft statements who is 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.220
 convinced that this will not affect the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.290
 development and stability of xbox when 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.560
 in the market and in the future in these 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.630
 supposed games but for me you're 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.460
 developers that will affect them 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.069
 very much and are pissing off following 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.310
 they are the first relationships 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.230
 there are in the market you already know to comment to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.030
 respect to leave your online for 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.900
 share comments we see the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.900
 next chao
