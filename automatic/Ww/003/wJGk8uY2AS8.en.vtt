00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.249 
inner corner sometimes can be a little
bit<00:02:05.939> tricky<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.079> sort

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
bit tricky so what I like to do is sort

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.559 
bit tricky so what I like to do is sort
of<00:02:07.350> tilt<00:02:07.649> my<00:02:07.770> head<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> look<00:02:09.030> down<00:02:09.239> into<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
of tilt my head and look down into the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.380 
of tilt my head and look down into the
mirror<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.610> makes<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.879> easier<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.180> get

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
mirror and it makes it easier to get

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.950 
mirror and it makes it easier to get
into<00:02:12.599> there<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
into there and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.240 
into there and
they're<00:02:13.050> trying<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.320> go<00:02:13.470> at<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.710> like<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:14.070> you

it<00:03:30.120> won't<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.420> quite<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.690> same<00:03:30.960> staying

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
it won't have quite the same staying

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.710 
it won't have quite the same staying
power<00:03:31.470> but<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.800> lasts<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.130> pretty<00:03:32.430> long<00:03:32.610> time<00:03:32.850> so

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
power but it lasts a pretty long time so

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.140 
power but it lasts a pretty long time so
that<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> really<00:03:34.800> good<00:03:34.950> alternative<00:03:35.150> next
