00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.919 
because to me if you must get a lot of
confidence<00:01:50.829> right<00:01:51.100> in<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:51.460> video<00:01:51.700> but<00:01:52.659> live

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
confidence right in that video but live

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.830 
confidence right in that video but live
we<00:01:53.229> really<00:01:53.499> don't<00:01:53.590> get<00:01:53.829> that<00:01:53.889> far<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:54.609> um<00:01:55.210> and

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
we really don't get that far but um and

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.660 
we really don't get that far but um and
I<00:01:55.899> think<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.350> takes<00:01:56.829> a<00:01:57.009> minute<00:01:57.310> for<00:01:57.340> her<00:01:57.549> to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
I think it takes a minute for her to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.069 
I think it takes a minute for her to
gain<00:01:57.819> confidence<00:01:58.119> girl<00:01:58.479> I<00:01:58.569> don't<00:01:58.749> think<00:01:58.929> she

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
gain confidence girl I don't think she

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.599 
gain confidence girl I don't think she
have<00:01:59.229> much<00:01:59.530> confidence<00:01:59.770> going<00:02:00.249> performance

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
have much confidence going performance

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.809 
have much confidence going performance
but<00:02:01.259> overall<00:02:02.259> I<00:02:02.649> really<00:02:02.679> liked<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.280> video<00:02:03.429> so

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
but overall I really liked the video so

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.179
