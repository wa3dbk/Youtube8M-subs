00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
well we've shown me any opposite value

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.780 
well we've shown me any opposite value
but<00:00:01.800> I'm<00:00:01.890> gonna<00:00:02.010> show<00:00:02.220> you<00:00:02.310> something<00:00:02.550> else

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
but I'm gonna show you something else

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.220 
but I'm gonna show you something else
too<00:00:03.030> there's<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.410> thing<00:00:04.410> called<00:00:04.440> ORP<00:00:05.250> meter

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
too there's a thing called ORP meter

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.310 
too there's a thing called ORP meter
this<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:08.150> instrument<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.480> tells<00:00:09.750> me<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
this is a instrument that tells me a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.610 
this is a instrument that tells me a
reading<00:00:10.980> if<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.240> positive<00:00:12.450> reading<00:00:13.080> it's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
reading if it's a positive reading it's

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.220 
reading if it's a positive reading it's
oxidation<00:00:14.190> day<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.360> when<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> Apple<00:00:16.020> turns

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
oxidation day like when the Apple turns

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.519 
oxidation day like when the Apple turns
brown<00:00:16.940> Zahn<00:00:17.940> will<00:00:18.150> take<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.570> probe<00:00:18.869> out<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
brown Zahn will take this probe out and

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.000 
brown Zahn will take this probe out and
I'm<00:00:19.650> gonna<00:00:19.800> try<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.520> see<00:00:20.970> what<00:00:21.180> our<00:00:21.210> reading<00:00:21.660> is

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
I'm gonna try to see what our reading is

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
I'm gonna try to see what our reading is
anywhere<00:00:23.010> from<00:00:23.070> positive<00:00:23.640> 50<00:00:24.449> down<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
anywhere from positive 50 down to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.880 
anywhere from positive 50 down to
negative<00:00:25.439> 200<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.220> good<00:00:26.640> water<00:00:26.910> okay<00:00:27.890> past

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
negative 200 is good water okay past

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.070 
negative 200 is good water okay past
that<00:00:29.189> negative<00:00:29.670> mark<00:00:30.300> your<00:00:30.570> body<00:00:30.810> really

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
that negative mark your body really

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.560 
that negative mark your body really
can't<00:00:31.470> assimilate<00:00:31.769> anything<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:33.360> gonna

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
can't assimilate anything so I'm gonna

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.830 
can't assimilate anything so I'm gonna
just<00:00:33.780> turn<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.450> want<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> see

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
just turn this on and we want to see

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.510 
just turn this on and we want to see
where<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.200> water<00:00:37.530> ends<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:38.040> okay<00:00:40.340> let's<00:00:41.340> just

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
319 okay let's just try the next one

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.380 
319 okay let's just try the next one
just<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> smart<00:01:20.130> water<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.210> does

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
just go to smart water see what it does

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.280 
just go to smart water see what it does
okay<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.729> I'm<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.420> showing<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.780> exactly

okay so I'm just showing you exactly

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.690 
okay so I'm just showing you exactly
whether<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> water<00:01:26.040> member<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
whether the water member if it's a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.120 
whether the water member if it's a
positive<00:01:26.970> number<00:01:27.509> which<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.200> its

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
positive number which it is its

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.660 
positive number which it is its
oxidizing<00:01:29.880> aging<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.990> cells<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.369> doing

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
oxidizing aging the cells it's not doing

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.340 
oxidizing aging the cells it's not doing
anything<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.210> free<00:01:33.420> radical<00:01:33.840> damage<00:01:33.869> it's

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
anything for free radical damage it's

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170 
anything for free radical damage it's
not<00:01:34.470> giving<00:01:34.680> me<00:01:34.740> any<00:01:34.950> any<00:01:35.400> alpha<00:01:35.729> value<00:01:36.000> which

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
not giving me any any alpha value which

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.539 
not giving me any any alpha value which
is<00:01:36.329> obvious<00:01:36.689> from<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> drops<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.380> use<00:01:37.590> okay<00:01:38.490> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
is obvious from the drops we use okay so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
is obvious from the drops we use okay so
this<00:01:38.850> isn't<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> hundreds<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.990> something

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
this isn't the to hundreds and something

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.230 
this isn't the to hundreds and something
I<00:01:40.500> want<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.310> something<00:01:41.579> though<00:01:41.880> when

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
I want you to see something though when

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.899 
I want you to see something though when
I<00:01:42.270> put<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.780> kind<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.140> water<00:01:43.380> through<00:01:43.710> here

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
I put this kind of water through here

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.850 
I put this kind of water through here
let's<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.390> water<00:01:45.689> does<00:01:45.960> okay

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
let's see what this water does okay

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
let's see what this water does okay
let's<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.149> antioxidant<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:49.110> if

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
let's see if it's antioxidant because if

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.630 
let's see if it's antioxidant because if
it<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.409> it'll<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> negative

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it is it'll be in the negative

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.090 
it is it'll be in the negative
okay<00:01:51.240> negative<00:01:51.659> 50<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.140> straight<00:01:52.409> vitamin<00:01:52.890> C

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
okay negative 50 is straight vitamin C

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.340 
okay negative 50 is straight vitamin C
so<00:01:53.729> let's<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.299> where<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.600> ends<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:55.049> let's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
so let's just see where it ends up let's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.649 
so let's just see where it ends up let's

negative 70 something guys this water
right<00:01:59.909> here<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.320> three<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.590> four<00:02:01.890> times<00:02:02.280> what

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
right here is three to four times what

right here is three to four times what
vitamin<00:02:03.750> C<00:02:03.960> would<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> body<00:02:04.740> it's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
vitamin C would be for the body it's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.429 
vitamin C would be for the body it's
very<00:02:05.820> evident<00:02:06.030> through<00:02:06.450> science<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.140> this

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
very evident through science here this

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.469 
very evident through science here this
is<00:02:07.590> why<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:07.950> need<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> water<00:02:08.520> one<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
is why we need the water one of the

been amazing for me in my life with the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.210 
been amazing for me in my life with the
water<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:36.659> it<00:02:36.720> has<00:02:36.750> been<00:02:37.230> for<00:02:37.470> many<00:02:37.620> people<00:02:38.040> I

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
water and it has been for many people I

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.750 
water and it has been for many people I
think<00:02:38.849> this<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.120> around<00:02:39.389> negative<00:02:39.689> 175<00:02:40.760> guys

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
think this is around negative 175 guys

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.610 
think this is around negative 175 guys
that's<00:02:42.060> three<00:02:42.359> and<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.599> half<00:02:42.810> times<00:02:43.260> better

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
that's three and a half times better

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.550 
that's three and a half times better
than<00:02:43.859> vitamin<00:02:44.280> C<00:02:44.430> remember<00:02:44.760> straight<00:02:45.659> vitamin

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
than vitamin C remember straight vitamin

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.280 
than vitamin C remember straight vitamin
C<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:47.010> negative<00:02:47.250> fifty<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.109> pretty

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
C is negative fifty so this is pretty

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.839 
C is negative fifty so this is pretty
much<00:02:49.379> proof<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:50.099> what<00:02:50.280> I'm<00:02:50.400> telling<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.790> is

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
much proof that what I'm telling you is

much proof that what I'm telling you is
the<00:02:51.090> absolute<00:02:51.510> truth<00:02:51.720> okay<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:54.030> we're<00:02:54.359> just

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
the absolute truth okay so we're just

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.720 
the absolute truth okay so we're just
gonna<00:02:54.569> turn<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.109> off<00:02:55.370> we're<00:02:56.370> gonna<00:02:56.489> come

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
gonna turn that off we're gonna come

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.039 
gonna turn that off we're gonna come
over<00:02:56.939> here<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.359> we're<00:02:57.480> gonna<00:02:57.540> do<00:02:57.810> one<00:02:58.019> more

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
over here and we're gonna do one more

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.960 
over here and we're gonna do one more
test<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.829> I<00:02:58.859> think<00:02:59.159> it's<00:02:59.310> real<00:02:59.489> critical

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
test that I think it's real critical

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.970 
test that I think it's real critical
because<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:01.139> we're<00:03:01.409> told<00:03:01.590> all<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:01.950> time

weight in ounces okay so let's just move

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.640 
weight in ounces okay so let's just move
this<00:03:15.569> kind<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:15.959> out<00:03:16.109> of<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.290> way<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.560> I'm

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
this kind of out of the way and I'm

this kind of out of the way and I'm
gonna<00:03:16.829> do<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.040> little<00:03:17.280> simple<00:03:17.669> test<00:03:17.940> here

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
gonna do a little simple test here

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.439 
gonna do a little simple test here
I'm<00:03:19.049> gonna<00:03:19.199> do<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> green<00:03:19.859> tea<00:03:20.250> test<00:03:20.639> let's<00:03:21.269> see

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
I'm gonna do a green tea test let's see

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:22.909 
I'm gonna do a green tea test let's see
about<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.900> absorption<00:03:22.349> rate<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.829> know

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
about the absorption rate you know

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.009 
about the absorption rate you know
because<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.400> I'm<00:03:23.549> gonna<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.599> I'm<00:03:24.720> gonna<00:03:24.840> break

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
because if I'm gonna if I'm gonna break

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.289 
because if I'm gonna if I'm gonna break
the<00:03:25.229> water<00:03:25.379> then<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.250> has<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.609> absorb<00:03:26.909> with<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
the water then it has to absorb with the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.119 
the water then it has to absorb with the
mineral<00:03:27.659> content<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.409> I<00:03:28.500> need<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.919> body

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
mineral content that I need in the body

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.069 
mineral content that I need in the body
now<00:03:29.699> it's<00:03:30.030> been<00:03:30.239> shown<00:03:30.479> that<00:03:30.690> these<00:03:30.870> don't

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
now it's been shown that these don't

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.229 
now it's been shown that these don't
have<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.409> this<00:03:31.620> has<00:03:31.829> no<00:03:32.010> antioxidant<00:03:32.699> we've

I can make ten cups of tea with this
because<00:05:38.890> your<00:05:39.850> cells<00:05:40.210> are<00:05:40.630> 58<00:05:41.410> times<00:05:41.740> so<00:05:42.070> let's

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
because your cells are 58 times so let's

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.140 
because your cells are 58 times so let's
just<00:05:42.490> say<00:05:42.820> that's<00:05:43.000> 58<00:05:43.510> centimeters<00:05:43.870> okay<00:05:45.150> the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
just say that's 58 centimeters okay the

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.090 
just say that's 58 centimeters okay the
water<00:05:46.390> that<00:05:46.990> we<00:05:47.110> had<00:05:47.290> on<00:05:47.440> here<00:05:47.620> is<00:05:47.740> anywhere

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
water that we had on here is anywhere

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.320 
water that we had on here is anywhere
from<00:05:48.160> 75<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.120> 120<00:05:50.050> times<00:05:50.890> or<00:05:51.220> centimeters<00:05:52.180> if

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
from 75 to 120 times or centimeters if

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.300 
from 75 to 120 times or centimeters if
you<00:05:52.420> will<00:05:52.600> just<00:05:52.990> figure<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.440> okay<00:05:54.010> so<00:05:54.070> that

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
you will just figure that okay so that

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.400 
you will just figure that okay so that
we<00:05:54.400> can<00:05:54.550> see<00:05:54.730> what<00:05:54.910> I'm<00:05:55.000> talking<00:05:55.300> about<00:05:55.410> when

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
we can see what I'm talking about when

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.490 
we can see what I'm talking about when
you<00:05:56.560> try<00:05:56.770> to<00:05:56.830> fit<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.490> 75<00:05:58.060> to<00:05:58.240> 120<00:05:58.690> and<00:05:58.720> 58<00:05:59.320> in

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
you try to fit the 75 to 120 and 58 in

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.160 
you try to fit the 75 to 120 and 58 in
the<00:05:59.650> cell<00:05:59.860> it<00:06:00.070> doesn't<00:06:00.100> work<00:06:00.700> it<00:06:01.480> doesn't<00:06:01.780> work

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
the cell it doesn't work it doesn't work

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.580 
the cell it doesn't work it doesn't work
okay<00:06:03.070> but<00:06:03.360> when<00:06:04.360> I<00:06:04.450> changed<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.140> water<00:06:05.320> with

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
okay but when I changed the water with

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.920 
okay but when I changed the water with
the<00:06:05.680> mineral<00:06:06.070> content<00:06:06.310> with<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.240> ceramic<00:06:07.600> all

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
the mineral content with the ceramic all

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.470 
the mineral content with the ceramic all
the<00:06:08.170> ceramic<00:06:08.620> does<00:06:08.830> is<00:06:09.160> let<00:06:09.670> the<00:06:09.790> water<00:06:09.820> absorb

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
the ceramic does is let the water absorb

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.090 
the ceramic does is let the water absorb
in<00:06:10.660> and<00:06:10.870> get<00:06:11.230> the<00:06:11.350> minerals<00:06:11.530> out<00:06:11.860> of<00:06:12.010> the

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
in and get the minerals out of the

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.100 
in and get the minerals out of the
ceramic<00:06:12.760> and<00:06:12.910> give<00:06:13.180> me<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.420> highest<00:06:13.630> water

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
ceramic and give me the highest water

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.970 
ceramic and give me the highest water
quality<00:06:14.650> water

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
quality water

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.850 
quality water
really<00:06:15.580> that's<00:06:15.880> natural<00:06:16.330> water<00:06:16.870> it<00:06:17.380> has<00:06:17.590> high

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
really that's natural water it has high

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.490 
really that's natural water it has high
antioxidant<00:06:18.160> alcohol<00:06:18.820> on<00:06:19.000> the<00:06:19.150> planet<00:06:19.510> what

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
antioxidant alcohol on the planet what

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.860 
antioxidant alcohol on the planet what
it<00:06:20.620> does<00:06:20.800> is<00:06:21.010> it<00:06:21.130> changes<00:06:21.160> up<00:06:21.610> to<00:06:21.730> 51<00:06:22.390> on<00:06:22.630> that

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
it does is it changes up to 51 on that

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.190 
it does is it changes up to 51 on that
58<00:06:23.380> so<00:06:23.920> that<00:06:24.100> it<00:06:24.250> fits<00:06:24.640> into<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.600> cell

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
58 so that it fits into the cell

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.430 
58 so that it fits into the cell
structure<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:27.070> works<00:06:27.340> you<00:06:27.700> get<00:06:28.300> hydration<00:06:28.990> you
