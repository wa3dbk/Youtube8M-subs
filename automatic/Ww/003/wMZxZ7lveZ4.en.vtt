00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
 everyone 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.470
 esther 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.360
 to the width not seen in English 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 fury parkour and this is going to be how 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.520
 making the sites of erc is like a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.170
 sort of side clip but webster is a 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.910
 Sai flip but removing the leg 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.440
 I am videos I will explain in Spanish the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.160
 Saint will explain us in English and we are 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.160
 from parkour 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.940
 we can 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.739
 as we have not seen anyone do this 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.600
 jump we have decided to give us the 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.879
 name mix before side and webster 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.829
 because it's a site quoting the piano 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.269
 so let's start to explain 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.490
 this tutorial to be able to do this 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.500
 jump you have to know how to make the webster 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.110
 and the site because it's a mix of those 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.940
 two then basically what you do 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.130
 it is I recommend that you start 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.690
 practice high or with running 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.909
 because that way it 's easier because 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.310
 you have momentum then for example from 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.869
 height you have more time to fall and with 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.400
 charge and there you have more 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.570
 momentum that can also be made from 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.100
 but it is still quite difficult 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.550
 because you have to help a lot and turn 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.550
 very fast 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
 ah 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.150
 we leave on the screen in saint 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.650
 pierre webster so you can learn 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.830
 and you still do not know and then go back 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.390
 this video then basically it's not 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.330
 very complex if you know how to do those two 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.650
 jumps simply mix webs I'm going to 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.360
 do the example by jumping from a wall to 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.760
 another so that to take a little 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.100
 run is what I recommend you 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.530
 have a height and some running 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.210
 or simply that you take from soil that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.190
 come up and push you eyes because 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.399
 You have plumbing and I'm jumping from 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.899
 the wall then what it would be is you fall and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.130
 It is very important how you throw the leg 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.520
 because you do not have to throw it out 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.260
 side directly but facing 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.280
 you have to throw your leg back 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.280
 but then turn 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.680
 it is possible at speed 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.680
 yes 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.320
 with the webster the leg that stronger 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.660
 can you have the strongest leg 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.340
 is the one that you must launch and the other is the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.130
 of impulse because what counts is the 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.200
 turn then 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.420
 The most important thing of this is knowing how to do 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.610
 the side the webster and pitch well the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.290
 leg when you fall you have to throw 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.780
 water forward I'm going to make a 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.710
 show lances you have it more towards 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:27.830
 back and from there you tour and this is the site 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.830
 on the side would be spears tours and you do use 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.090
 spain 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.660
 with that desire 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.660
 and girls 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.810
 ah 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.000
 and it would be 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.970
 leonard 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.170
 well that's the technique does not have 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.080
 much trick since it's once between 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.550
 the shipping of other different ones and that 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.950
 We recommend that you start practicing 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.360
 height that is easier or with run 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.580
 before starting to do it quietly in 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.010
 flat floor and that if you can expensive do it 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.150
 or in sand or on grass 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.739
 we never recommend you start 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.060
 practice on asphalt in zoom or better 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.450
 always grass or sand to start 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.450
 to practice 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.720
 Y 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.720
 bytes 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:44.910
 landscape 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:49.750
 xanit for its internal dwellings 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.430
 they understood that he has many and good 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.230
 I was doing everything I hope that you 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.030
 have liked the tutorial if it has 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.760
 helped give you like to subscribe and 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.410
 pass me 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.850
 and nothing now I will do one last 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.440
 show and now after we leave 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.080
 examples in slow motion so you can 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.080
 see how to throw the leg and all that 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.950
 to all
