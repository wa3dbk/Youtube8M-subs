pretty<00:00:56.960> neat

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.820 

some<00:01:10.040> of<00:01:10.160> these<00:01:10.250> though<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:11.260> can't<00:01:12.260> use<00:01:12.560> right

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:26.020 
some of these though I can't use right
now<00:01:12.860> because<00:01:13.460> my<00:01:13.490> level<00:01:13.970> is<00:01:14.060> not<00:01:14.180> high<00:01:14.620> enough

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.780 

pretty<00:01:26.750> much<00:01:26.930> all<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.320> weapons<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:27.920> can't<00:01:28.490> but

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
pretty much all the weapons I can't but

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:39.710 
pretty much all the weapons I can't but
three<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.450> shields<00:01:29.900> I<00:01:30.020> can

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:50.650 

see<00:01:40.720> which<00:01:40.990> one

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:02:21.330 

think<00:01:51.660> these<00:01:51.840> were<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.200> ones

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.210 

you<00:02:21.970> can't<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.959> can<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.230> two<00:02:23.260> shields<00:02:23.890> on

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
you can't you can have two shields on

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.509 
you can't you can have two shields on
you<00:02:24.400> at<00:02:24.519> once<00:02:24.760> but<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:26.410> can't<00:02:26.709> block<00:02:27.129> with

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
you at once but you can't block with

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:42.870 
you at once but you can't block with
both<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.360> them<00:02:28.690> at<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.840> same<00:02:28.959> time

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.760 

and<00:02:43.750> that's<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.320> armor<00:02:44.860> pack

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770
