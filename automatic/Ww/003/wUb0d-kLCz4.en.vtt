00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
you don't get hurt it's just that this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.830 
you don't get hurt it's just that this
is<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.149> defensive<00:00:48.690> system<00:00:49.079> basically<00:00:49.579> and

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
is just a defensive system basically and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.529 
is just a defensive system basically and
what<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.680> wanted<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.670> them<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.820> teach

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
what we wanted to do for them is teach

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.270 
what we wanted to do for them is teach
them<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> said<00:00:55.320> there's<00:00:55.500> two<00:00:55.680> methods<00:00:56.160> of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
them in and said there's two methods of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.819 
them in and said there's two methods of
learning<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.989> deliberate<00:00:58.620> way

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
learning it there is the deliberate way

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.580 
learning it there is the deliberate way
and<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> fourth<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.030> thinking<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.289> derm

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and the fourth way of thinking the derm

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.920 
and the fourth way of thinking the derm
deliberate<00:01:02.280> way<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.239> new<00:01:03.539> training

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
deliberate way is just new training

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.560 
deliberate way is just new training
mentally<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.850> open<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.510> your

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
mentally and you know you open up your

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.679 
mentally and you know you open up your
pores<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.430> through<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.640> through<00:01:09.450> these

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
pores and through that through these

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.080 
pores and through that through these
that<00:01:09.960> port<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.439> apertures<00:01:10.890> you'll<00:01:11.100> gain

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that port and apertures you'll gain

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.460 
that port and apertures you'll gain
abilities<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.900> them<00:01:13.610> use<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:15.020> God<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.229> in

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
abilities of them use your God is in

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.219 
abilities of them use your God is in
force<00:01:16.740> waiting<00:01:17.189> someone<00:01:17.580> pouring<00:01:17.850> their<00:01:18.240> rent

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
force waiting someone pouring their rent

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.560 
force waiting someone pouring their rent
into<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.729> you'll<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.090> able<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.509> use

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
into you and then you'll be able to use

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.490 
into you and then you'll be able to use
your<00:01:22.610> on<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.850> you've<00:01:24.030> got<00:01:24.210> 10<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:25.080> protect

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
your on then you've got 10 to protect

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.910 
your on then you've got 10 to protect
yourself<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:27.570> way<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> dangerous<00:01:28.710> way

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
yourself this way is the dangerous way

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.300 
yourself this way is the dangerous way
but<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.850> fast<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.509> way<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.780> doing<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
but this is fast the way of doing you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.179 
but this is fast the way of doing you
and<00:01:32.509> I<00:01:33.509> suppose<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> different<00:01:35.070> way

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and I suppose that the different way

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.560 
and I suppose that the different way
it's<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> better<00:01:35.579> way<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.790> learning<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.390> because

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's a better way of learning it because

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.420 
it's a better way of learning it because
you<00:01:36.750> did<00:01:36.960> bones<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.409> yourself<00:01:37.770> mentally<00:01:38.070> as

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you did bones of yourself mentally as

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.969 
you did bones of yourself mentally as
well<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:40.140> know<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.439> had<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
well but you know they had to do the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.770 
well but you know they had to do the
false<00:01:41.220> way<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.790> they<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.090> don't<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
false way because they have don't have a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.770 
false way because they have don't have a
lot<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> time<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.369> they<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> successfully

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
lot of time and they do it successfully

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.440 
lot of time and they do it successfully
they<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.590> down<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:47.100> about<00:01:47.310> 10<00:01:47.880> from

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
they get down there about 10 from

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.080 
they get down there about 10 from
something<00:01:49.110> p.m.<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.549> go<00:01:50.700> down<00:01:50.880> there

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
something p.m. so they go down there

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.760 
something p.m. so they go down there
they<00:01:51.299> did<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> training<00:01:51.899> breed<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> forth

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
they did the training breed and forth

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
they did the training breed and forth
because<00:01:52.950> these<00:01:53.250> two<00:01:53.490> obviously<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.360> been<00:01:54.689> an

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
because these two obviously have been an

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
because these two obviously have been an
intense<00:01:55.049> situations<00:01:55.770> canoers<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:57.770> experience

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
intense situations canoers on experience

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.050 
intense situations canoers on experience
and<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.040> at<00:01:59.189> firsthand<00:01:59.520> because<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.939> his

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and then at firsthand because of his

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.530 
and then at firsthand because of his
baba<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.610> lack<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> box<00:02:03.360> on

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
baba so they have lack of a box on

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.679 
baba so they have lack of a box on
natural<00:02:04.020> skill<00:02:04.860> or<00:02:05.700> ability<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.509> their
