so<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:55.100> use<00:01:55.369> small<00:01:55.700> little<00:01:56.420> circles<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.229> kind<00:01:57.440> of

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
so I use small little circles to kind of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.889 
so I use small little circles to kind of
get<00:01:57.740> in<00:01:57.920> all<00:01:58.159> of<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.490> little<00:01:58.759> cracks<00:01:59.630> and

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
get in all of the little cracks and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.389 
get in all of the little cracks and
crevices<00:01:59.990> of<00:02:00.649> my<00:02:00.680> face<00:02:02.770> my<00:02:03.770> forehead<00:02:04.190> doesn't

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
crevices of my face my forehead doesn't

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.240 
crevices of my face my forehead doesn't
need<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:05.119> much<00:02:05.390> coverage<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.410> I<00:02:06.740> don't

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
need that much coverage so I don't

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.820 
need that much coverage so I don't
really<00:02:07.369> go<00:02:07.670> over<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:08.179> too<00:02:08.420> many<00:02:08.630> times<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.410> kind

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
really go over it too many times I kind

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.100 
really go over it too many times I kind
of<00:02:09.890> need<00:02:10.100> more<00:02:10.280> coverage<00:02:10.640> like<00:02:10.850> closer<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.019> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
of need more coverage like closer to the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.390 
of need more coverage like closer to the
middle<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.440> my<00:02:12.590> face<00:02:14.739> so<00:02:15.739> we're<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:15.890> kind<00:02:16.280> of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
middle of my face so we're just kind of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.020 
middle of my face so we're just kind of
using<00:02:16.880> each<00:02:17.180> layer<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.739> build<00:02:18.739> up<00:02:19.100> natural

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
using each layer to build up natural

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.930 
using each layer to build up natural
coverage<00:02:20.950> now<00:02:21.950> for<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> subsequent<00:02:22.580> layers

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
coverage now for the subsequent layers

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.060 
coverage now for the subsequent layers
instead<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.480> going<00:02:23.720> everywhere<00:02:24.200> evenly<00:02:24.769> I'm

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
instead of going everywhere evenly I'm

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.370 
instead of going everywhere evenly I'm
just<00:02:25.310> gonna<00:02:25.459> kind<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.030> concentrate<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.110> in

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
just gonna kind of concentrate this in

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.979 
just gonna kind of concentrate this in
large-ish<00:02:28.310> areas<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.090> still<00:02:29.450> need<00:02:29.660> more

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
large-ish areas that I still need more

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.050 
large-ish areas that I still need more
coverage<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.800> like<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.340> said<00:02:31.519> before<00:02:31.670> I'm<00:02:31.910> not

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
coverage so like I said before I'm not

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.030 
coverage so like I said before I'm not
going<00:02:32.120> over<00:02:32.540> my<00:02:32.660> forehead<00:02:32.930> again<00:02:33.319> my<00:02:33.709> nose

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
going over my forehead again my nose

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.670 
going over my forehead again my nose
looks<00:02:34.580> pretty<00:02:34.880> good<00:02:35.150> my<00:02:35.930> chin<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.200> think<00:02:36.530> is

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
looks pretty good my chin I think is

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.069 
looks pretty good my chin I think is
pretty<00:02:37.130> much<00:02:37.280> okay<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:38.329> I<00:02:38.360> need<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.630> little<00:02:38.900> bit

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
pretty much okay but I need a little bit

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.110 
pretty much okay but I need a little bit
more<00:02:39.380> across<00:02:39.739> my<00:02:40.010> cheeks<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.640> I'm<00:02:40.730> just<00:02:40.940> going

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
more across my cheeks so I'm just going

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.199 
more across my cheeks so I'm just going
to<00:02:41.180> kind<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:41.799> do<00:02:42.799> smaller<00:02:43.310> circles<00:02:43.970> in

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
to kind of like do smaller circles in

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.870 
to kind of like do smaller circles in
just<00:02:44.450> those<00:02:44.630> areas

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
just those areas

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.680 
just those areas

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.410 

now<00:02:51.690> I'm<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.410> doing<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.920> same<00:02:53.190> thing<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:54.239> in

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
now I'm just doing the same thing but in

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.390 
now I'm just doing the same thing but in
the<00:02:54.599> tiny<00:02:54.900> areas<00:02:55.440> where<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.739> want<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.160> most

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the tiny areas where I want the most

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.660 
the tiny areas where I want the most
coverage<00:02:57.030> I'm<00:02:57.599> taking<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> same<00:02:58.379> brush<00:02:58.680> same

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
coverage I'm taking the same brush same

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.559 
coverage I'm taking the same brush same
technique<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.510> I'm<00:03:01.379> just<00:03:01.560> pressing<00:03:02.099> on<00:03:02.569> small

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
technique and I'm just pressing on small

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.430 
technique and I'm just pressing on small
sections<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:06.630> reason<00:03:06.900> I'm<00:03:07.019> doing<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.290> is

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
sections so the reason I'm doing this is

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.710 
sections so the reason I'm doing this is
if<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:08.160> immediately<00:03:08.340> go<00:03:08.819> into<00:03:08.849> taking<00:03:09.450> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
if you just immediately go into taking a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.570 
if you just immediately go into taking a
lot<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.110> product<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.680> putting<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.489> a

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
lot of product and putting it in a

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.400 
lot of product and putting it in a
single<00:03:11.880> area<00:03:12.269> it's<00:03:12.450> gonna<00:03:12.569> look<00:03:12.810> really<00:03:13.019> cakey

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
single area it's gonna look really cakey

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.089 
single area it's gonna look really cakey
and<00:03:13.890> obvious<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.690> slight<00:03:16.410> differences

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
and obvious and the slight differences

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.250 
and obvious and the slight differences
between<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.790> foundation<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.510> your<00:03:18.629> skin<00:03:18.989> are

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
between the foundation and your skin are

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.229 
between the foundation and your skin are
going<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.860> really<00:03:20.190> show<00:03:20.430> up<00:03:20.640> like<00:03:20.849> you<00:03:21.060> might

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
going to really show up like you might

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.539 
going to really show up like you might
have<00:03:21.480> like<00:03:21.690> just<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.440> big<00:03:22.620> orange<00:03:22.890> patch<00:03:23.250> right

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
have like just a big orange patch right

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.620 
have like just a big orange patch right
there<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.880> that's<00:03:24.000> what<00:03:24.150> we're<00:03:24.269> trying<00:03:24.390> to

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
there and that's what we're trying to

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.080 
there and that's what we're trying to
avoid<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.470> we're<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:25.890> gonna<00:03:26.190> kind<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.640> build

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
avoid so we're just gonna kind of build

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.289 
avoid so we're just gonna kind of build
it<00:03:27.299> up<00:03:27.420> layer<00:03:27.840> by<00:03:27.870> layer<00:03:28.140> in<00:03:28.920> certain<00:03:29.880> areas

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
it up layer by layer in certain areas

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.270 
it up layer by layer in certain areas
but<00:03:30.599> try<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> make<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.079> look<00:03:31.170> as<00:03:31.349> natural<00:03:31.799> as

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
but try to make it look as natural as

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.640 
but try to make it look as natural as
possible<00:03:32.340> now<00:03:33.120> I'm<00:03:33.209> going<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.569> go<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:34.019> last

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
possible now I'm going to go one last

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.940 
possible now I'm going to go one last
time<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:35.880> some<00:03:36.329> fine<00:03:36.660> pinpointing<00:03:37.650> with

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
time and do some fine pinpointing with

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.400 
time and do some fine pinpointing with
my<00:03:38.069> concealer<00:03:38.489> brush<00:03:38.880> I'm<00:03:39.120> using<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.870> exact

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
my concealer brush I'm using the exact

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.309 
my concealer brush I'm using the exact
same<00:03:40.590> foundation<00:03:41.599> tapping<00:03:42.599> a<00:03:42.720> little<00:03:42.959> bit<00:03:43.110> in

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
same foundation tapping a little bit in

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.729 
same foundation tapping a little bit in
my<00:03:44.040> cup<00:03:44.549> cup<00:03:45.150> with<00:03:45.599> tapping<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.380> little<00:03:46.620> bit

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
my cup cup with tapping a little bit

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.800 
my cup cup with tapping a little bit
into<00:03:47.010> my<00:03:47.130> lid<00:03:47.340> right<00:03:47.489> here<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:48.510> I'm<00:03:48.569> taking

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
into my lid right here so I'm taking

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.080 
into my lid right here so I'm taking
this<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> nice<00:03:50.130> super<00:03:50.849> dense

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
this this is a nice super dense

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.390 
this this is a nice super dense
synthetic<00:03:51.810> brush<00:03:52.079> I<00:03:52.380> really<00:03:52.980> like<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.340> because

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
synthetic brush I really like it because

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.129 
synthetic brush I really like it because
it's<00:03:53.730> kind<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:53.970> rounded<00:03:54.389> on<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.630> top<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.109> you

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
it's kind of rounded on the top so you

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.190 
it's kind of rounded on the top so you
can<00:03:55.380> blend<00:03:55.590> things<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.280> but<00:03:56.579> have<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.790> lot<00:03:57.060> of

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
can blend things in but have a lot of

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.229 
can blend things in but have a lot of
concentrated<00:03:58.200> product<00:03:59.190> so<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.700> does<00:03:59.850> a<00:03:59.880> little

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
concentrated product so it does a little

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.569 
concentrated product so it does a little
bit<00:04:00.420> more<00:04:00.630> coverage<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.350> I'm<00:04:02.130> just<00:04:02.340> tapping

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579

this in with like a pretty concentrated

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.180

amount<00:04:06.600> still<00:04:06.870> tap<00:04:07.109> it<00:04:07.290> out<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:07.709> it's<00:04:07.829> not<00:04:07.950> like

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
dark circles are a huge concern and

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.219 
dark circles are a huge concern and
because<00:05:02.190> mineral<00:05:02.490> makeup<00:05:02.970> is<00:05:03.150> on<00:05:03.419> the<00:05:03.960> more

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
because mineral makeup is on the more

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.290 
because mineral makeup is on the more
like<00:05:04.530> drier<00:05:04.830> side<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.250> wouldn't<00:05:05.819> necessarily

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
like drier side I wouldn't necessarily

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.570 
like drier side I wouldn't necessarily
recommend<00:05:06.449> to<00:05:07.020> just<00:05:07.409> use<00:05:07.740> mineral<00:05:08.130> makeup<00:05:08.460> to

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
recommend to just use mineral makeup to

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.100 
recommend to just use mineral makeup to
cover<00:05:08.699> dark<00:05:08.940> circles<00:05:09.389> I<00:05:09.479> would<00:05:09.599> actually<00:05:09.750> use

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
cover dark circles I would actually use

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.409 
cover dark circles I would actually use
a<00:05:10.349> creamy<00:05:10.979> concealer<00:05:11.460> for<00:05:11.819> that<00:05:11.940> but<00:05:12.150> like<00:05:12.300> I

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
a creamy concealer for that but like I

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.120 
a creamy concealer for that but like I
said<00:05:12.479> I'm<00:05:12.750> going<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.050> skip<00:05:13.289> that<00:05:13.440> step<00:05:13.650> just<00:05:14.039> to

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
said I'm going to skip that step just to

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.070 
said I'm going to skip that step just to
show<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.400> guys<00:05:14.610> what<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.090> looks<00:05:15.300> like<00:05:15.509> by

itself and I'm going to go on to the
mineral<00:05:18.900> veil<00:05:19.169> so<00:05:19.800> this<00:05:20.069> step<00:05:20.370> is<00:05:20.610> one<00:05:21.509> that's

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
mineral veil so this step is one that's

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.990 
mineral veil so this step is one that's
going<00:05:21.990> to<00:05:22.110> sort<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.620> help<00:05:22.919> set<00:05:23.370> everything
