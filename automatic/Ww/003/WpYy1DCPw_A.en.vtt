intrigued<00:00:56.460> me<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.690> pillar<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.620> houses

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
intrigued me is this pillar that houses

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.360 
intrigued me is this pillar that houses
the<00:00:59.730> spring<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.539> what's<00:01:01.440> nice<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the spring and what's nice about it is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.660 
the spring and what's nice about it is
it<00:01:02.579> has<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> wheel<00:01:03.120> adjustment<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> instead<00:01:05.580> of

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it has a wheel adjustment so instead of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.190 
it has a wheel adjustment so instead of
the<00:01:05.760> usual<00:01:05.939> getting<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> your<00:01:06.900> drum

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the usual getting out of your drum

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.770 
the usual getting out of your drum
throne<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.520> finding<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.270> drum<00:01:09.510> key

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
throne you know finding your drum key

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.880 
throne you know finding your drum key
adjusting<00:01:10.560> all<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:13.350> bend

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
adjusting all I have to do is just bend

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.969 
adjusting all I have to do is just bend
down<00:01:14.930> while<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.020> sitting<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.350> my<00:01:16.439> throne<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
down while I'm sitting on my throne and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.359 
down while I'm sitting on my throne and
I<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.220> adjust<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.210> play<00:01:19.159> adjust<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
I can adjust it and then play adjust it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.210 
I can adjust it and then play adjust it
it's<00:01:20.850> easier<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.630> compare<00:01:22.259> adjustments

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
it's easier to compare adjustments

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.880 
it's easier to compare adjustments
because<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:24.030> down<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
because I don't have to get down and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.590 
because I don't have to get down and
mess<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.280> pedal<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.850> could<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
mess with my pedal I could just do it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.850 
mess with my pedal I could just do it
from<00:01:28.020> where<00:01:28.200> I'm<00:01:28.350> sitting<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:30.650> it's<00:01:31.650> got

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
from where I'm sitting and it's got

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.010 
from where I'm sitting and it's got
numbers<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.270> remember<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
numbers here so I can remember the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.950 
numbers here so I can remember the
adjustments<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.490> feel<00:01:35.729> good<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.689> I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
adjustments that really feel good so I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.660 
adjustments that really feel good so I
dig<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:39.979> another<00:01:40.979> thing<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.490> really

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
dig that another thing that's really

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.039 
dig that another thing that's really
nice<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.290> cam<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
nice is this cam that you can put in the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.380 
nice is this cam that you can put in the
forward<00:01:46.560> position<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> back<00:01:47.729> position

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
forward position or the back position

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.580 
forward position or the back position
and<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.409> changes<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> feel<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:52.170> throw

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and that changes the feel of the throw

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.679 
and that changes the feel of the throw
when<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> throw<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.549> beater<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.240> changes

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
when you throw your beater it changes

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.340 
when you throw your beater it changes
that<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:56.040> tweakable<00:01:56.850> things<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that I like tweakable things I like to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.870 
that I like tweakable things I like to
be<00:01:58.469> able<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:59.240> get<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.780> feel<00:02:01.700> exactly<00:02:02.700> how

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
be able to get this to feel exactly how

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
be able to get this to feel exactly how
I<00:02:02.909> want<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.329> feel<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.140> important

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
I want it to feel so that was important

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.999 
I want it to feel so that was important
to<00:02:04.710> me<00:02:05.719> another<00:02:06.719> nice<00:02:06.990> touch<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.770> this

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
to me another nice touch is this

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.190 
to me another nice touch is this
weighted<00:02:08.550> beater<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.179> got<00:02:09.390> three<00:02:09.869> weights

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
weighted beater it's got three weights

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.760 
weighted beater it's got three weights
in<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:10.979> magnets<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:13.260> again<00:02:13.530> it's

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
in it that are magnets and so again it's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.920 
in it that are magnets and so again it's
more<00:02:13.980> tweaked<00:02:14.220> ability<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.660> know<00:02:15.780> it's

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
more tweaked ability it's you know it's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.530 
more tweaked ability it's you know it's
like<00:02:16.110> four<00:02:16.440> different<00:02:16.650> fields<00:02:17.400> no<00:02:17.730> wait<00:02:18.090> one

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
like four different fields no wait one

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.050 
like four different fields no wait one
way<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.440> eights<00:02:19.709> three<00:02:20.310> weights<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:20.849> that's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
way to eights three weights so that's

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.059 
way to eights three weights so that's
nice

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.470 

another<00:02:24.939> thing<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:27.030> didn't<00:02:28.030> win<00:02:28.239> me<00:02:28.450> over

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
another thing that didn't win me over

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.809 
another thing that didn't win me over
this<00:02:29.079> I<00:02:29.290> could<00:02:29.620> take<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:29.860> or<00:02:30.069> leave<00:02:30.099> it<00:02:30.340> but

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
this I could take it or leave it but

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.420 
this I could take it or leave it but
some<00:02:31.209> people<00:02:31.239> will<00:02:32.230> really<00:02:32.470> dig<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.189> it's
