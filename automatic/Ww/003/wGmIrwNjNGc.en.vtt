00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 what a beautiful mattress 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.259
 nice guys here was sher talking to you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.410
 and today I came back with this new one 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.789
 video I came back after it seems little more 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.539
 two weeks of inactivity 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.189
 so let's say i apologize to you for 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.840
 the precisely this inactivity these two 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.170
 weeks when I didn't upload videos 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.180
 but if I have to tell you the truth the reasons 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.190
 indeed the reason why I didn't upload 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.620
 video in this period was 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.600
 simply because I didn't feel like it 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.340
 in the end the desire to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.100
 upload videos to youtube 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.720
 I've always had that is not that it is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.570
 going 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.120
 however the main reason was that up 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.950
 this game that is call of duty ghost mi 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.270
 he was boring even though I was pulling 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.750
 that in 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.200
 almost all the games I could not 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.000
 so I was really bored 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.880
 I haven't played for so long 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.310
 in the last week however when it is 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.650
 was I think a week ago I 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.800
 come the new headphones that is the headphones 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.590
 of turtle beach those in edition 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.020
 limited ghost I do not know if you have it 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.450
 present are the adobe turtle beach 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.430
 so thank you also turtle beach e 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.970
 activision for sending me these 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.340
 headphones 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.990
 I really thank them so much they are 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.060
 excellent headphones anyway I was there 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.250
 I am saying since I arrived 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.979
 these headphones started playing a lot 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.560
 in all against all precisely by exploiting 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.750
 headphones hearing the steps and these things 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.660
 here and I must say that I really have 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.509
 started having fun like I never had 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.619
 done on this game because I don't know about you 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.710
 but this game in some circumstances 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.790
 it is also quite boring though 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.380
 just the gameplay I haven't yet 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.509
 talked about the gameplay you're seeing 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.009
 in fact it is a hack and strike done on 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.140
 all against all 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:13.330
 in three minutes and 5 on fluid with the fat 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.940
 muted and with increased magazines 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.690
 then the perks I used were 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.860
 quick predator readiness installation 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.650
 what's the name for headphones 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.360
 dead silence and amplification that 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.310
 I have to say if you play in this mode 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.069
 tomb silences are really useful 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.840
 because they practically do 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.700
 pisa you know where i come from 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.800
 enemies thanks to really ve headphones 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.910
 I recommend it if you don't have any 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.670
 headphones 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.730
 now in a while it's also Christmas then 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.819
 let them give you as a present to me 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.860
 I am more amused, I don't know why 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.209
 because maybe I feel more inside the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.510
 game, however, is just so anyway 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.860
 it should also be the kehm made up 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.860
 all against all faster than Italy 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.629
 I give you some advice to do these 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.480
 chem on all against all in the event 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.010
 you want to try then you have to find yourself 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.140
 a zone 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.870
 an area that you can control well 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.319
 an area where there are spots in the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.079
 nearby and you have to turn around that 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.180
 area for example as I'm doing in 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.269
 this video just looking for thanks 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.639
 to headphones to anticipate enemies and to 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.639
 kill them just as soon as they arrive 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.909
 to say that this is really not true 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:35.069
 however, it is easy enough 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.049
 simple to make a cam strike e 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.150
 above all and fun at the end for 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.980
 me that is what counts that is me 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.459
 enjoy doing these chem strikes in 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.629
 this way and then I do it this way 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.419
 however the video is already about to end here 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.459
 I tell you a very last thing even if not 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:53.010
 I would like to spoil this thing for you but I will 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.250
 I say I made a cam on search and 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.950
 destroy is a cam up 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.750
 rescue so if we arrive not 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.090
 I know you put so many like it if you put 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.120
 I like so many I will try to bring it to you 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.040
 as soon as possible and I do not invite anything 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.990
 pass on the facebook page to leave 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.690
 I like to sign up if you don't have 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.680
 still done and nothing to be born here 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.680
 all beautiful
