00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:09.989
 park 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.769
 so was 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.329
 there is a lot of work 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:15.759
 all over the country 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.009
 the salesman 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.499
 the tukkers gamer 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.939
 on the menu this has too much butterfly walking son mpe 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 a stronger dollar l 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.970
 ultimately it comes to it 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.970
 one but in any case 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.300
 it right 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.430
 pick up inafune 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.720
 but taking the true time for time from a free kick who becomes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 reason for the measures on the shares 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 shortly after the vvd you have 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.070
 feels five weeks that did wilders lie in bed 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.090
 5 I have then I am fit again because I have 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 at the appointment of an employee children who have their opinion ready 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.480
 the bell 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.790
 and we love going there 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.270
 the older employees work on 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.270
 but keep an eye out 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.549
 they have 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.220
 but where 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.220
 well that has been hard since india 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.800
 once arrived 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.400
 I will turn there 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400
 look at the shopping cart 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.590
 9 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.590
 earlier 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 study conditionally another year 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.110
 of which the ball is twice a dredge and this project by a recognized one 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080
 can do 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.280
 This is how employees want to create 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.960
 by an increasing number I think I found 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.829
 no longer profiles out anymore 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.829
 in margins 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.459
 the concept is simply short-lived 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:23.129
 the world 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.309
 easy 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.309
 I have 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.419
 we have many opportunities 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.699
 to tackle the room 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.969
 because the sector emerged after being in unison 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.969
 r yes 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.829
 he thinks the chief executive 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.499
 eurostat confessed it kept where the stuff got its web 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:29.649
 for having fun with a birdie 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:31.939
 nothing in a home
