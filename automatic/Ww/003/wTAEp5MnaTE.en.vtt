chapter on muscular diseases and I came
across<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.990> couple<00:01:19.290> words<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.130> know<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.700> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
across a couple words that I know for a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.030 
across a couple words that I know for a
fact<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.600> been<00:01:21.780> confusing<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.710> students

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
fact have been confusing for students

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.969 
fact have been confusing for students
along<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.659> let's<00:01:24.689> cover<00:01:25.170> three<00:01:25.619> terms

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
along the way so let's cover three terms

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
along the way so let's cover three terms
I<00:01:26.189> always<00:01:26.460> tell<00:01:26.670> students<00:01:27.090> take<00:01:27.330> two<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.750> three

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
I always tell students take two to three

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.219 
I always tell students take two to three
terms<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.650> day<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:30.119> only<00:01:30.240> memorize<00:01:30.930> them

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
terms a day and not only memorize them

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.010 
terms a day and not only memorize them
but<00:01:31.619> understand<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.210> let's<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.869> this

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
but understand them so let's do this

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.620 
but understand them so let's do this
together<00:01:34.200> okay<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.250> I'm<00:01:35.970> gonna<00:01:36.090> take<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> word

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
together okay so I'm gonna take the word

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.490 
together okay so I'm gonna take the word
strain<00:01:37.430> STR<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.909> i-n<00:01:39.540> okay

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
strain STR a i-n okay

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.490 
strain STR a i-n okay
it<00:01:40.680> occurs<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.180> muscle<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:42.720> tendon<00:01:42.780> is

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it occurs when a muscle or tendon is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.230 
it occurs when a muscle or tendon is
stretched<00:01:44.840> beyond<00:01:45.840> its<00:01:46.829> elastic<00:01:47.040> limits<00:01:47.759> okay

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
stretched beyond its elastic limits okay

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.690 
stretched beyond its elastic limits okay
it's<00:01:48.479> usually<00:01:48.659> caused<00:01:49.079> by<00:01:49.290> trauma<00:01:49.649> then<00:01:50.579> we

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
it's usually caused by trauma then we

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.969 
it's usually caused by trauma then we
have<00:01:50.880> sprain<00:01:51.890> SP<00:01:52.920> Rai<00:01:53.670> n<00:01:54.180> okay<00:01:54.840> these<00:01:55.530> are<00:01:55.770> two

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
have sprain SP Rai n okay these are two

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
have sprain SP Rai n okay these are two
that<00:01:56.219> often<00:01:56.640> when<00:01:56.759> we're<00:01:56.909> reading<00:01:57.090> some<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
that often when we're reading some of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.209 
that often when we're reading some of
these<00:01:57.600> questions<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.229> our<00:01:58.259> exams<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.920> might

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
these questions on our exams we might

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.130 
these questions on our exams we might
confuse<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.030> two<00:02:00.210> words<00:02:00.420> okay

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
confuse the two words okay

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.100 
confuse the two words okay
a<00:02:01.170> sprain<00:02:02.009> also<00:02:02.579> caused<00:02:02.820> by<00:02:03.060> trauma<00:02:03.329> occurs

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
a sprain also caused by trauma occurs

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.340 
a sprain also caused by trauma occurs
when<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> ligament<00:02:04.740> or<00:02:05.040> joint<00:02:05.520> capsule<00:02:06.420> become

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
when a ligament or joint capsule become

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.800 
when a ligament or joint capsule become
stretched<00:02:07.920> beyond<00:02:08.369> its<00:02:08.550> elastic<00:02:08.670> limits<00:02:09.330> so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
stretched beyond its elastic limits so

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.500 
stretched beyond its elastic limits so
cap<00:02:10.140> cell<00:02:10.770> has<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> P<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.790> spring<00:02:12.540> has<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
cap cell has a P just like spring has a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.880 
cap cell has a P just like spring has a
so<00:02:14.260> strain<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.069> tendon<00:02:15.930> sprain<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.290> capsule

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
so strain and tendon sprain and capsule

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.330 
so strain and tendon sprain and capsule
ligaments<00:02:18.879> okay<00:02:19.330> then<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.290> have<00:02:20.319> muscle<00:02:20.830> spasm

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
ligaments okay then we have muscle spasm
