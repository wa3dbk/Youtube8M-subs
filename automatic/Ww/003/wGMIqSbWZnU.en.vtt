00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
scared to hit him because I thought if I

if I hit him he'd hit me harder so I

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.540 
if I hit him he'd hit me harder so I
don't<00:05:28.530> know<00:05:28.590> I've<00:05:28.650> never<00:05:28.710> actually<00:05:29.130> done<00:05:29.370> a
