00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
of chocolate chips on top so that they

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.459 
of chocolate chips on top so that they
can<00:01:12.679> be<00:01:12.799> melting<00:01:16.539> okay<00:01:17.539> now<00:01:17.810> I'm<00:01:17.990> going<00:01:18.200> to

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
can be melting okay now I'm going to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.230 
can be melting okay now I'm going to
place<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:19.039> bowl<00:01:19.249> of<00:01:19.670> chocolate<00:01:20.209> chips<00:01:21.670> on<00:01:22.670> top

of<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.409> simmering<00:01:24.770> water<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:25.639> will<00:01:26.359> use<00:01:26.389> a

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
of the simmering water I will use a

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.649 
of the simmering water I will use a
spoon<00:01:27.770> as<00:01:28.249> they<00:01:28.520> start<00:01:28.819> to<00:01:28.969> melt<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.329> storm

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
spoon as they start to melt the storm

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.389 
spoon as they start to melt the storm
around<00:01:29.899> so<00:01:30.289> that<00:01:30.319> it<00:01:30.709> evenly<00:01:31.069> gets

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
around so that it evenly gets

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.730 
around so that it evenly gets
distributed<00:01:32.079> it<00:01:33.079> will<00:01:33.170> take<00:01:33.349> just<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.709> few

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
distributed it will take just a few

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.289 
distributed it will take just a few
minutes<00:01:35.349> in<00:01:36.349> the<00:01:37.189> meantime<00:01:37.429> I'm<00:01:37.939> going<00:01:38.149> to

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
minutes in the meantime I'm going to

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.199 
minutes in the meantime I'm going to
place<00:01:38.539> a<00:01:38.569> cookie<00:01:39.139> sheet<00:01:39.469> in<00:01:39.709> the<00:01:39.889> freezer<00:01:40.249> so

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
place a cookie sheet in the freezer so

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.169 
place a cookie sheet in the freezer so
that<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:42.380> will<00:01:42.529> be<00:01:42.679> quicker<00:01:43.219> and<00:01:43.399> easier<00:01:43.849> for

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
that it will be quicker and easier for

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.599 
that it will be quicker and easier for
the<00:01:44.389> chocolate<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:44.929> set<00:01:45.229> once<00:01:45.740> we<00:01:46.069> dip<00:01:46.369> the

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
the chocolate to set once we dip the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:53.919 
the chocolate to set once we dip the
fruit<00:01:50.799> okay<00:01:51.799> before<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.130> get<00:01:52.340> started<00:01:52.789> you<00:01:53.419> on

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
fruit okay before you get started you on

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.959 
fruit okay before you get started you on
the<00:01:54.169> cookie<00:01:54.560> sheet<00:01:54.590> after<00:01:55.219> you've<00:01:55.520> removed<00:01:55.669> it

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
the cookie sheet after you've removed it

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.989 
the cookie sheet after you've removed it
from<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.209> freezer<00:01:56.599> with<00:01:57.409> waxed<00:01:57.979> paper<00:02:00.999> the

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
from the freezer with waxed paper the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.449 
from the freezer with waxed paper the
bananas<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:02.719> use<00:02:03.109> to<00:02:03.349> do<00:02:03.499> this<00:02:03.770> with<00:02:04.039> as

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
bananas that I use to do this with as

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.749 
bananas that I use to do this with as
you<00:02:04.700> can<00:02:04.880> see<00:02:05.149> are<00:02:05.479> brown<00:02:06.349> spotted<00:02:07.189> bananas

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
you can see are brown spotted bananas

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.260 
you can see are brown spotted bananas
the<00:02:08.390> reason<00:02:08.780> for<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.410> they<00:02:10.250> are<00:02:10.520> wrapping

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
the reason for this is they are wrapping

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.720 
the reason for this is they are wrapping
up<00:02:11.450> where<00:02:12.200> they<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> sweet<00:02:13.010> creamy<00:02:13.610> taste

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
up where they have a sweet creamy taste

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.080 
up where they have a sweet creamy taste
when<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.060> freeze<00:02:15.480> them<00:02:16.099> but<00:02:17.099> they're<00:02:17.519> not<00:02:17.550> so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
when you freeze them but they're not so

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.350 
when you freeze them but they're not so
hard<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.530> still<00:02:19.830> has<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.159> green<00:02:20.879> bitter

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
hard that it still has that green bitter

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.229 
hard that it still has that green bitter
taste<00:02:21.780> from<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.200> banana<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.370> brown<00:02:23.580> spotted

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
taste from a banana so the brown spotted

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.149 
taste from a banana so the brown spotted
ones<00:02:24.480> are<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.989> best<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.409> use<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:28.159> okay

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
ones are the best to use for this okay

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.250 
ones are the best to use for this okay
now<00:02:29.310> at<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.790> point<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> chocolate<00:02:30.989> seems

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
now at this point if the chocolate seems

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.229 
now at this point if the chocolate seems
a<00:02:31.349> little<00:02:31.590> thick<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.549> add<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> little

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
a little thick you can add a little

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.320 
a little thick you can add a little
vegetable<00:02:33.569> oil<00:02:34.140> or<00:02:34.650> shortening<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
vegetable oil or shortening to the
