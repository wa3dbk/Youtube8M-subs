00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
something sound that could have been a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.140 
something sound that could have been a
felon<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.920> think<00:02:56.920> we<00:02:57.070> did<00:02:57.220> get<00:02:57.370> some<00:02:57.430> some

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
felon I think we did get some some

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.000 
felon I think we did get some some
pressure<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.810> secretary<00:02:59.560> was<00:02:59.710> starting

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
pressure that secretary was starting

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.290 
pressure that secretary was starting
from<00:03:00.130> all<00:03:00.250> kinds<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.520> pressure<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.910> really

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
from all kinds of pressure that really

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.110 
from all kinds of pressure that really
turns<00:03:01.540> me<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:02.350> thought<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:02.830> our<00:03:03.130> players<00:03:03.820> that

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
turns me I thought that our players that

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.520 
turns me I thought that our players that
came<00:03:04.300> in<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.660> played<00:03:04.750> played<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> really

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
came in and played played a really

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.880 
came in and played played a really
strong<00:03:05.860> game<00:03:06.070> person<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.460> thought<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
strong game person I thought that the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.890 
strong game person I thought that the
younger<00:03:08.890> players<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.610> they<00:03:10.090> realized<00:03:10.690> that

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
younger players that they realized that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.110 
younger players that they realized that
we<00:03:11.200> mean<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:12.250> were<00:03:12.310> going<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.520> need<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.730> lean<00:03:13.090> on

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
we mean we were going to need to lean on

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.610 
we mean we were going to need to lean on
them<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.480> lot<00:03:13.660> more<00:03:13.930> against<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.380> team<00:03:14.590> like

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
them a lot more against a team like

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.200 
them a lot more against a team like
Manchester<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.520> they<00:03:15.640> stepped<00:03:15.940> up<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
Manchester and they stepped up to the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.460 
Manchester and they stepped up to the
challenge<00:03:16.300> but<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:16.960> don't<00:03:17.170> know<00:03:17.260> what's
