with kind of Handy the new photo app is

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.490 
with kind of Handy the new photo app is
worth<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:23.510> which<00:03:23.630> we<00:03:23.870> believe<00:03:24.140> is<00:03:24.200> going<00:03:24.380> to

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
worth in which we believe is going to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.720 
worth in which we believe is going to
completely<00:03:24.650> replace<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.220> gallery<00:03:25.549> soon

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
completely replace the gallery soon

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.810 
completely replace the gallery soon
enough<00:03:26.000> if<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:26.900> hasn't<00:03:27.140> already<00:03:27.200> in<00:03:27.620> fact<00:03:27.860> it

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
enough if it hasn't already in fact it

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.970 
enough if it hasn't already in fact it
really<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.360> fantastic<00:03:29.630> departure<00:03:30.590> from<00:03:30.769> the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
really is a fantastic departure from the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.930 
really is a fantastic departure from the
previous<00:03:32.350> rather<00:03:33.350> crummy<00:03:33.920> app<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.519> my<00:03:34.670> opinion

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
previous rather crummy app in my opinion

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.580 
previous rather crummy app in my opinion
so<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.690> can<00:03:35.810> see<00:03:35.900> those<00:03:36.019> backing<00:03:36.230> up<00:03:36.410> one

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
so you can see those backing up one

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.020 
so you can see those backing up one
photo<00:03:36.860> it's<00:03:37.160> actually<00:03:37.400> backing<00:03:37.579> up<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.850> video

at the moment

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.199 
at the moment
and<00:03:39.049> Google<00:03:39.620> probably<00:03:39.920> just<00:03:40.069> need<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.370> tidy

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
and Google probably just need to tidy

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.720 
and Google probably just need to tidy
that<00:03:41.510> up<00:03:41.569> a<00:03:41.840> little<00:03:41.959> bit<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.439> that<00:03:42.470> it's<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.579> bit

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
that up a little bit so that it's a bit

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.979 
that up a little bit so that it's a bit
more<00:03:43.909> obvious<00:03:44.030> what<00:03:44.329> it's<00:03:44.450> doing<00:03:44.720> its<00:03:44.840> back

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
more obvious what it's doing its back
