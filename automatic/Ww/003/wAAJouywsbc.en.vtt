 i 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.889
 Hello girls, how are you today? 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.839
 from my experience using clarisol and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.150
 for those who do not know what this is 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.039
 device here that is a brush 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.440
 facial cleansing has a characteristic 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.880
 is that it emits vibrations that 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.230
 help to cleanse the face in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.210
 depth in concrete this is the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.700
 model mia 2 and this one has two 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.470
 speeds for cleaning but 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.090
 I sincerely see it as nonsense because 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.189
 I always use the same speed 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.079
 for which you have never tried it 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.540
 what is the brush to the best we 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.570
 It seems something aggressive like that at first glance 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.910
 but it is very very soft and when we 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.680
 we are cleaning the face there is no need 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 exert any pressure because what is 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 the brush and does the work for you are 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.070
 300 movements per second what I do 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.870
 I use it twice a day one per 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.399
 tomorrow in the shower that's one thing that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 I like it a lot because it's completely 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 sealed 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.460
 while you shower you can go washing 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.440
 the face and then I use it too 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.899
 after removing makeup I can be used 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.450
 to remove makeup that is what I 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.070
 I notice is that it becomes very dirty the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.470
 brush and these brushes are pretty 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.300
 expensive and although then you wash it but if 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.159
 you have a very heavy makeup because 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.350
 so much that I'm feeling something of 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.570
 residue is going to stay then I 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.190
 undoing and then I wash myself with a 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.369
 gel cleans what is the program 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.470
 cleaning lasts one minute is 20 seconds 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.539
 to clean your chin area and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.759
 the nose another 20 seconds to 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.429
 clean your forehead and then 10 seconds 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.530
 on each side is one minute and the truth is 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.420
 that leaves your face about cleaning the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.000
 edition and that is patented and they 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.800
 they say they make up six more times and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.840
 that removes grease and dirt two 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.700
 times more than if you then clean the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.009
 face with any other method 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.009
 traditional good I do not know if it 's 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.050
 exactly six times more or double 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.610
 but what I do tell you is that with clark 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.610
 and sonic is your face completely 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.840
 clean to eliminate any kind of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.600
 dead skin you have I have skin 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.429
 with a dry trend before starting 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.490
 I used clarisol and I used to go out 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.550
 quite bright in the area t 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.220
 So I've been using it for nine months 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.260
 from the first moment I liked it but I 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.760
 I do not know if you have read any reviews or 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.610
 you have seen some other video a lot 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.680
 people who at the beginning give me as 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.319
 a reaction and they get some granite 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.830
 well I've always had something of 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.049
 granites in this area especially when 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.880
 I was younger and I 've never had a 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.420
 excessive problem of acne but yes that 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.660
 you had that kind of granite like 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.730
 small ones and when I bought that ariza I 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.549
 I was afraid that they irritate me because 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.470
 I have sensitive skin then good 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.209
 tell you that at no time I get irritated 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.610
 the skin did not even notice that I got more 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.620
 granites or anything that would be advised 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.319
 is that you do not start to use two 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.299
 times a day when you buy it but that 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.129
 start doing it gradually and see 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.049
 how it reacts shows skin because that 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.090
 has gone well to me because it does not mean that 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.610
 You will be fine then 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.440
 According to my experience, what I notice 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.960
 start using it and during these 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.960
 nine months is that all this area that I 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.640
 I had some small granites 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.250
 improved enough 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.620
 another thing I had are the pores of the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.360
 pretty open nose and I'm not going to 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.000
 say to close them completely 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.010
 because it's not true but I think it's 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.690
 really that when doing such a cleaning 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.820
 deep does not have any kind of 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.500
 dirt and that causes them to close 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.750
 In addition to the products you use 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.680
 later as the tonic but good I have 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.140
 helped keep those pores clean and 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.120
 that's why they have reduced me a lot and in 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.010
 Overall, yes, I think it contributes 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.630
 luminosity to the face ahm well says that 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.570
 helps to improve expression lines 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.660
 I in that honestly have not noticed 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.580
 difference but to me what I like the most 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.459
 to use clear and sonic is the 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.820
 feeling of cleanliness in the face you're 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.070
 the super exfoliated skin super soft and 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.680
 then I like that when applying products 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.319
 then a serum 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.969
 a cream notes as it penetrates more into 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.739
 the skin and that makes you more do this 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.209
 video about clarion are the hundred days 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.489
 because there are many of you know that 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.500
 I use it in my facial routine and I 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.509
 you have used many messages and 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.100
 comments asking me why so 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.320
 are and so I have decided to do this 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.449
 video and so maybe it helps you if 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.430
 you are thinking of buying it, because we 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.520
 helps to decide if you buy it or if not 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.460
 When I bought it, I came in this 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.220
 box I bought it for a certain new york 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.259
 when I went last summer and I bought 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.750
 this kit because they gave away the three 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:43.039
 products and then well in addition to coming 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.199
 The clark is with the sensitive brush 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.479
 that this one came with this that I 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.000
 I'm going to teach although this one I have not 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.580
 used because it has given me a bit of 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.080
 fear this is called paul cleansing or be 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.110
 which is to clean the dust in 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.020
 depth and just this brush then 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.310
 I had seen some YouTube video that 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.770
 some people had caused them 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.570
 problems of granites or 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.419
 irritation on all heads 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.260
 they come in little boxes so this good one is 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.150
 I commissioned it to 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.480
 when it was new york and I think I 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.070
 It cost 15 dollars this also this disc 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.960
 sensitive and inside comes the 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.870
 information on the different types of 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.000
 brushes that you have the normal one you have 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.620
 for sensitive skin and for skin 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.230
 delicate what the one that usually comes is 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.760
 for sensitive skin so let's go I 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.010
 with this and I tell you I have not had any 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.110
 problem and then you have the acne and 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.700
 pore cleansing one of the things that 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.710
 I like them a lot, it's that you have to carry them 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.180
 long hard is much the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.710
 battery for about a month 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.020
 depending on how much they use it if 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.060
 you use every day because more or less 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.140
 will last a month and this is the charger and 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.650
 it's magnetized it leaves it 24 hours and 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.990
 I see how I have this plug 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.750
 us but I have an adapter and there's 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.970
 problem 24 hours and then you have then a 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.860
 month practically statement then 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.140
 as a conclusion, it deserves or does not deserve 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.510
 worthwhile according to my experience if 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.040
 it's worth it because although I do not think that 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.990
 be something essential because there 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.280
 many options in the market although not 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.310
 they are the same but there are others 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.290
 and brush or manual brushes that you 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.450
 can cleanse the face very well I 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.980
 honestly I had never noticed the 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.570
 face so clean and another thing that we've 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.520
 said is that when applying the makeup is 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.780
 like you do not have any kind of 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.520
 imperfection after having used 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.110
 klare sonic and that I like 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.389
 very much with cesc I think it's a 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.040
 investment but if it gives you good results 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.660
 like me because of course it's 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.950
