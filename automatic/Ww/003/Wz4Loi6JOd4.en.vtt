 windows environment 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.789

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.500
 only for people who have 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.099
 people I do not know if there are any 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.630

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.159
 with things for which that 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.810
 not work because they put a 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.270

 I will surely add things so 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.950
 look carefully in the list 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.660
 in addition you can find things 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.060
 that may interest you and there you 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.580
 go to download their courses if 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.470
 windows 7 for snowbreeze debts 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.570
 we will click download you go 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.660
 be redirected to multiupload you 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.900
 click on direct download here and there 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.370
 you go directly done download 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.770
 the file in question the file of which 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.040
 we need 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.180
 so leave you snowbreeze open there 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.220
 they must have said complete the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.170
 wanted it's good snowbreeze open I 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.920
 will explain to you why after so 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.410
 there I would just like them not to 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.410
 download my thing until that bug 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.570
 a little bit says safari does not succeed 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.470
 to open the page 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.150
 I will try to trace the 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.540
 download if it does not work I 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.830
 I'll go elsewhere so if that 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.970
 apparently does not work the link that 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.359
 I did not work we will go 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.920
 on megaupload 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.510
 you go on megaupload megalo 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.050
 should work normally 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.640
 here and there we have dab cizia zyke you 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.030
 download this file there I got you 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.830
 claude and you wait 40 seconds 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.350
 I do not think that those who want 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.880
 pay a premium account what have already 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.320
 an account on megaupload 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.690
 it's not worth paying an account 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.900
 to download that you wait for them 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.800
 40 seconds and we're going to download 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.570
 the shortcut that will allow us 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.710
 to actually go in search of 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.820
 applications can be 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.090
 uploaded with snowbreeze to are 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.610
 present a place in the computer 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.440
 I know more actually the game knows 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.070
 plus the exact location so what I 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.620
 you did was I got you 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.780
 blood is directly the link you 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.660
 zips and the link and you enter the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.570
 link it's going great or lead directly 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.580
 on the cover aubry this stock the dab 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.600
 so you click download 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.890
 regular 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.630
 we will wait a little bit and there he 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.620
 proposes you have the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.790
 file he's really not fat he's gonna 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.590
 download immediately as we 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.750
 can see it will close the advertisement 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.630
 excuse me close the ad there you 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.640
 are going to have a zip file like that it 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.950
 can do it but of course you 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.040
 leave snowbreeze open otherwise it'll 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.650
 all messed up so there you click on everything 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.460
 just extra mound there that's fine 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.460
 extract actually 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.210
 a file you do here is where you 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.310
 are going to have a new shortcut on 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.539
 your office that will be called custom 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.300
 you enter in 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.530
 and there you will have your debts present that 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.729
 you just download so lime to 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.050
 download bio icon which is actually the 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.150
 application dependency you that you 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.949
 downloaded the icon actually from the 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.430
 source but do not care and you recover 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.720
 tons fx 2 points there concludes me i 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.370
 took the example of fixed thunder but you 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.289
 get your apps back to you a 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.419
 time you put the debate another 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.740
 place that where you take 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.630
 shortcuts you can close snowbreeze 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.860
 if you try to open the shortcut 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.680
 so if not broken off you're going to have 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.789
 a message like that the element of the custom 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.130
 which shortens referral has been 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.820
 modified or moved so that they do not 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.009
 work more correctly 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.240
 do you want to delete it actually no one 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.229
 can see that if I break snowbreeze and 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.449
 I'm downloading one of the blues 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:37.000
 shortcut will refine so do 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.610
 well be careful call him delete 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.560
 so that's it we can delete it 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.630
 now so here it is that it was 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.680
 the lot of 451 after the start 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.659
 What is it used for? 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.699
 in fact it's used to post them on his 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.500
 own source or ssh installs on 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.270
 his iphone so I will make a video for 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.580
 how to install the application on his 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.110
 iphone or ipod touch in ssh and i already have 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.270
 does the video for how to create it 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.260
 source cydia so look in in my 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.940
 youtube channel you will find the 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.860
 video created its source cydia and it allows 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.180
 to create that on cydia under any 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.070
 which operating system since 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.389
 it's a source you've been creating since
