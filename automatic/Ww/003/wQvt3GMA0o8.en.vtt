00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.849
 rolex king of staff okay 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.400
 here who talks about amarante and today I bring 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.940
 for you a really weird video is a 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.300
 disk is probably another hacker it is in 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.539
 pc is for the code goals is the room was 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.150
 fully disclosed is the start of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.400
 level two on a connection was rich 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.099
 so solved is to enter once in the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.469
 Four goals to check how it was 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.800
 connection and look this is dude 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.719
 I was interferes yes I played with 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.420
 phyto goals inter Ferguson 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.270
 do you see the score the score 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.370
 is quite expensive disclosed is okay 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.760
 very weird I could not look 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.300
 in people when I killed someone is this 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.890
 kill him turn up if they will watch looks 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.739
 only us in the championship a little bit 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.960
 face will appear from the end killing him 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.939
 watch was mutants now watch was 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.140
 and it 's this 12,080 charge to watch it 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.260
 This is not the first time that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.270
 question is to type and subjugate it in some 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.119
 motherfuckers at 30,400 from watching 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.610
 This already made me lightly slap the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.060
 you see how ridiculous the community is 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.450
 of codes on pc how awful 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.860
 playing with the crockery is not then 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.420
 the first time this happens is the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 first time the universe ever 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.200
 had seen I started looking in the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 internet to see if the last zip is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.119
 I put it on if I had it. 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.700
 really the option to play and have party 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.009
 but I saw that there was nothing I looked for 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.979
 in the options to watch some keys 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.960
 and made fashion promo back 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.840
 Protest for partial closure is not 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.409
 sorry and really did not have it and look at it 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.440
 As a lawyer I could not aim and it is 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.180
 that 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.510
 really to do to you + 1 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.820
 complaining about this bet from and again 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.740
 I tell myself the game does not're not okay 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.260
 Bad if you have an xbox one 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.920
 playstation 3 1 edson or any other 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.320
 thing 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.290
 the game is more or less is now the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.320
 players and with 11 goals in the pc 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.050
 they're a bunch of that we can not 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.150
 Call father I know but it really is 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.230
 making one down from all the players 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.180
 they play 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.420
 that's what we find a player 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.370
 So that's why I do not know. 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.130
 When I'm going to play but goals are 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.920
 another will allow her only to you 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.840
 you wait for a like only for 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.760
 try to disclose this shit not for 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.430
 video in question but to show how 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.230
 that the community here is not the cob 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.660
 others on a pc are being super 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.030
 impaired and we'll see if someone something 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.700
 really can get a 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.890
 the shit that is making game not to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.730
 end to so great franchise that was 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.070
 colloquy 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.070
 so this is valid paulo
