00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
extraordinary dealing with children he's

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.499

them<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.330> respect<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.960> they<00:00:16.920> know<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:20.390> he

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
them with respect and they know it he

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.950
