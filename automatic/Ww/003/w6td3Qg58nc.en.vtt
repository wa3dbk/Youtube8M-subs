redesigned<00:00:24.499> s-pen<00:00:24.949> it's<00:00:25.130> longer<00:00:25.579> and<00:00:25.939> a<00:00:26.269> bit

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
redesigned s-pen it's longer and a bit

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.149 
redesigned s-pen it's longer and a bit
thicker<00:00:26.720> than<00:00:26.839> the<00:00:26.960> original<00:00:27.380> just<00:00:27.949> to<00:00:28.039> make

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:28.159 
thicker than the original just to make

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.040 
thicker than the original just to make
for<00:00:28.339> a<00:00:28.400> extra<00:00:29.150> group<00:00:29.480> ability

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
for a extra group ability

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.679 
for a extra group ability
I've<00:00:30.470> also<00:00:30.619> got<00:00:30.769> a<00:00:30.829> retexture<00:00:31.789> button<00:00:32.419> on<00:00:32.539> that

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
I've also got a retexture button on that

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.819 
I've also got a retexture button on that
so<00:00:32.809> it's<00:00:32.930> easier<00:00:33.199> to<00:00:33.230> feel<00:00:33.530> where<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:33.770> is

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
so it's easier to feel where it is

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.220 
so it's easier to feel where it is
compared<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.670> original<00:00:35.030> one<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.140> its

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
compared to the original one so its

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.360
