let<00:00:01.740> me<00:00:01.860> talk<00:00:01.979> about<00:00:02.040> just<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.429> minute<00:00:02.669> for

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
let me talk about just a minute for

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.639 
let me talk about just a minute for
about<00:00:04.819> ventilators<00:00:05.870> they<00:00:06.870> don't<00:00:07.109> know<00:00:07.290> if<00:00:07.379> I'm

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
about ventilators they don't know if I'm

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.500 
about ventilators they don't know if I'm
about<00:00:07.740> them<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.130> little<00:00:08.460> bit<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.790> mothers<00:00:09.330> who

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
about them a little bit of mothers who

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.110 
about them a little bit of mothers who
ever<00:00:09.840> as<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.019> say<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.769> comes<00:00:10.980> up<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.429> it's

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
ever as I say that it comes up and it's

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.879 
ever as I say that it comes up and it's
actually<00:00:12.420> pretty<00:00:12.630> easy<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:13.650> just<00:00:13.769> that

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
actually pretty easy and it's just that

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.140 
actually pretty easy and it's just that
most<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> time<00:00:14.309> just<00:00:14.549> hand<00:00:14.700> off<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.820> patient

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
most the time just hand off the patient

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.050 
most the time just hand off the patient
the<00:00:15.210> ICU<00:00:15.570> guide<00:00:15.780> leave<00:00:16.410> right<00:00:16.710> which<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.670> right

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the ICU guide leave right which is right

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.120 
the ICU guide leave right which is right
there<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.539> mean<00:00:18.690> that's<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.990> do<00:00:19.130> so

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
there I mean that's what you do so

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.150 
there I mean that's what you do so
ventilators<00:00:20.670> justice<00:00:21.230> just<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
ventilators justice just think of it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.290 
ventilators justice just think of it
this<00:00:23.310> way<00:00:25.250> more<00:00:26.250> or<00:00:26.340> less<00:00:26.400> you're<00:00:26.789> only<00:00:26.970> messy

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
this way more or less you're only messy

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.669 
this way more or less you're only messy
two<00:00:27.480> modes<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.779> ventilation<00:00:28.730> from<00:00:29.730> simv<00:00:30.679> right

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
two modes of ventilation from simv right

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.700 
two modes of ventilation from simv right
for<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> sick<00:00:32.790> there's<00:00:33.780> others<00:00:34.170> out<00:00:34.290> there<00:00:34.350> but

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
for a sick there's others out there but

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
for a sick there's others out there but
by<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.100> large<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.270> you're<00:00:36.390> doing

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
by and large this is what you're doing

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.280 
by and large this is what you're doing
is<00:00:36.840> AC<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.590> si<00:00:37.920> today<00:00:38.750> for<00:00:39.750> both<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.170> those

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
is AC or si today for both of those

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.110 
is AC or si today for both of those
modes<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.680> ventilation<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.030> have

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
modes of ventilation you can have

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.290 
modes of ventilation you can have
pressure<00:00:42.420> control<00:00:42.870> or<00:00:43.140> volume<00:00:43.440> control<00:00:44.300> so

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
pressure control or volume control so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
pressure control or volume control so
think<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.370> tribe<00:00:47.370> AC<00:00:48.079> simv<00:00:49.079> then<00:00:49.739> two

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
think of a tribe AC simv then two

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.010 
think of a tribe AC simv then two
pressures<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.910> go<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.270> off<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
pressures that go down off of that and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.160 
pressures that go down off of that and
both<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:52.770> say<00:00:52.949> Bob<00:00:53.129> control<00:00:53.520> de<00:00:53.670> pressure

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.959 

when<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.320> go<00:00:58.469> when<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> go<00:00:59.280> into<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> overall

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
when you go when you go into the overall

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.849 
when you go when you go into the overall
in<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> ICU<00:01:00.600> don't<00:01:01.079> know<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.500> numbers

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
in the ICU don't know right this numbers

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.770 
in the ICU don't know right this numbers
after<00:01:01.980> slippers<00:01:02.430> when<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> ICU

after slippers when you go in the ICU

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.800 
after slippers when you go in the ICU

comes up to you and it goes okay doctor
what<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> want<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.270> say<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.350> want<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
what you want and you say you want a

five fifty percent

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.770 
five fifty percent
what<00:01:21.650> he's<00:01:21.890> just<00:01:21.920> interpreted<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.570> want

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
what he's just interpreted it you want

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.330 
what he's just interpreted it you want
simv<00:01:24.440> volume<00:01:25.210> with<00:01:26.210> pressure<00:01:26.510> and<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:28.070> reason

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
simv volume with pressure and the reason

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.340 
simv volume with pressure and the reason
he<00:01:28.370> knows<00:01:28.730> that<00:01:28.940> is<00:01:29.150> first<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:30.020> all<00:01:30.140> if<00:01:30.230> you

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
he knows that is first of all if you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.280 
he knows that is first of all if you
gave<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.770> partial<00:01:31.250> support<00:01:31.370> in<00:01:32.240> addition<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.200> he

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
gave a partial support in addition so he

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.280 
gave a partial support in addition so he
knows<00:01:33.440> it's<00:01:33.650> like<00:01:33.770> they<00:01:33.950> see<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:35.200> since<00:01:36.200> you

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
knows it's like they see and since you

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.350 
knows it's like they see and since you
gave<00:01:36.410> a<00:01:36.470> volume<00:01:36.980> versus<00:01:37.400> of<00:01:37.520> pressure<00:01:37.790> he

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
gave a volume versus of pressure he

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.910 
gave a volume versus of pressure he
knows<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:38.720> want<00:01:38.930> you<00:01:39.080> want<00:01:39.290> simv<00:01:40.070> body<00:01:41.650> now<00:01:42.650> if

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
knows you want you want simv body now if

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.670 
knows you want you want simv body now if
you<00:01:43.040> came<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.200> he<00:01:45.200> asked<00:01:45.410> you<00:01:45.470> what<00:01:45.620> you

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
you came in and he asked you what you

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.390 
you came in and he asked you what you
wanted<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.160> you<00:01:46.220> want<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:49.690> peep<00:01:50.690> of<00:01:50.840> five<00:01:51.400> Delta

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
wanted and you want a peep of five Delta

P of twenty precious supported five what

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.600 
P of twenty precious supported five what
did<00:01:57.170> he<00:01:57.200> interpret<00:01:57.800> that<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:57.980> be<00:01:59.950> s<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:01.220> am<00:02:01.370> being

pressured because again and he knows
it's<00:02:05.510> simv<00:02:05.990> because<00:02:06.410> you<00:02:06.500> gave<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.740> pressure

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
it's simv because you gave a pressure

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.930 
it's simv because you gave a pressure
support<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.570> and<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.770> gave<00:02:09.950> delta<00:02:10.700> which

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
support to it and you gave delta which

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.640 
support to it and you gave delta which
is<00:02:11.090> which<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.510> pressure<00:02:11.900> versus<00:02:12.290> volume
