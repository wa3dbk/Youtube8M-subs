00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
more recently I thought this was just a

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.729 
more recently I thought this was just a
cool<00:02:37.060> color<00:02:37.299> this<00:02:37.989> color<00:02:38.049> here<00:02:38.409> is<00:02:40.560> till<00:02:41.560> I'm

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
blue over you and I thought this was

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
electric blue color which is I thought

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.699
