say<00:04:43.880> as<00:04:44.240> a<00:04:44.300> child<00:04:44.600> you<00:04:44.720> kind<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:44.990> had<00:04:45.169> to

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
say as a child you kind of had to

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.020 
say as a child you kind of had to
compare<00:04:45.680> them<00:04:45.830> with<00:04:45.950> these<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.729> you<00:04:46.790> had<00:04:46.910> to

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
compare them with these and you had to

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.430 
compare them with these and you had to
make<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> decision<00:04:47.389> if<00:04:47.750> you<00:04:47.810> like<00:04:47.990> this<00:04:48.139> one<00:04:48.320> or

make a decision if you like this one or

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.840 
make a decision if you like this one or
this<00:04:48.560> one<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:48.889> you<00:04:48.979> could<00:04:49.100> only<00:04:49.310> be<00:04:49.520> on<00:04:49.639> one

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
this one so you could only be on one

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.000
