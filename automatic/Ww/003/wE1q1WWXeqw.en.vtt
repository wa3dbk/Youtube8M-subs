00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
actually testing this losing it would be

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:42.070 
actually testing this losing it would be
pretty<00:01:31.479> likely

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
my pole yesterday after we reviewed the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.190 
my pole yesterday after we reviewed the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
footage we realized that you probably

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.780 
footage we realized that you probably
only<00:03:13.470> want<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.740> do<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.130> someone<00:03:14.400> else<00:03:14.640> is

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
only want to do that if someone else is

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.490 
only want to do that if someone else is
filming<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.210> with<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.450> pole<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:16.110> footage<00:03:16.320> is

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
filming you with the pole the footage is

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.810 
filming you with the pole the footage is
not<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.830> impressive<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.370> today<00:03:17.640> I'm<00:03:17.700> going

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
not that impressive so today I'm going

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.530 
not that impressive so today I'm going
to<00:03:17.910> try<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.960> chest<00:03:19.410> mount<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:21.390> we'll

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
to try it on a chest mount and we'll

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.180 
to try it on a chest mount and we'll
actually<00:03:21.750> going<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.170> be<00:03:22.260> moving<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.770> GoPro

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
actually going to be moving the GoPro

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.590 
actually going to be moving the GoPro
from<00:03:23.430> Sarah's<00:03:23.730> helmet<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> chest<00:03:24.450> mount

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
from Sarah's helmet to a chest mount

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.000 
from Sarah's helmet to a chest mount
also<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.140> for<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.290> little<00:03:25.440> different<00:03:25.800> video

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
also just for a little different video

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.950 
also just for a little different video
but<00:03:26.490> other<00:03:26.700> than<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.450> performed

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
but other than that this performed

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.980 
but other than that this performed
pretty<00:03:28.080> well<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.590> video<00:03:28.830> looks<00:03:29.130> ok<00:03:29.990> except

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
pretty well the video looks ok except

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.890 
pretty well the video looks ok except
that<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.470> has<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:31.740> awesome<00:03:32.060> 1980<00:03:33.060> style<00:03:33.450> time

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
that it has this awesome 1980 style time

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.380 
that it has this awesome 1980 style time
and<00:03:34.230> date<00:03:34.530> stamp<00:03:34.890> in<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.820> bottom<00:03:36.120> I'm<00:03:36.240> sure

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
and date stamp in the bottom I'm sure

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.670 
and date stamp in the bottom I'm sure
there's<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.660> way<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.780> go<00:03:36.960> into<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.320> magical

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
there's a way to go into the magical

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.370 
there's a way to go into the magical
settings<00:03:38.070> on<00:03:38.310> your<00:03:38.340> TV<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.240> like<00:03:39.900> change<00:03:40.110> that

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
settings on your TV and like change that

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.450 
settings on your TV and like change that
but<00:03:40.560> we<00:03:40.680> couldn't<00:03:40.890> figure<00:03:41.010> out<00:03:41.100> how<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.400> I

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
but we couldn't figure out how and I

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.250 
but we couldn't figure out how and I
think<00:03:41.670> it's<00:03:41.760> kind<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:41.940> funny<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.360> we're<00:03:43.170> going

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
think it's kind of funny so we're going

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.020 
think it's kind of funny so we're going
to<00:03:43.350> leave<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.620> we'll<00:03:44.310> see<00:03:44.430> how<00:03:44.460> these<00:03:44.640> guys<00:03:44.850> do

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030

of<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.610> blinding<00:05:09.060> white<00:05:09.330> so<00:05:10.170> this<00:05:10.320> looks<00:05:10.440> all

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
of a blinding white so this looks all

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.530 
of a blinding white so this looks all
right<00:05:10.850> from<00:05:11.850> my<00:05:12.060> mind<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:14.820> want<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.270> camera

right from my mind the want the camera
that<00:05:15.690> proved<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.900> easiest<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:16.380> use<00:05:16.410> in<00:05:16.620> the

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
that proved the easiest to use in the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.140 
that proved the easiest to use in the
most<00:05:16.890> reliable<00:05:17.160> despite<00:05:17.640> some<00:05:17.820> battery

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
most reliable despite some battery

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.360 
most reliable despite some battery
issues<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.530> pretty<00:05:19.710> difficult<00:05:19.890> for<00:05:20.340> a

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
issues and it pretty difficult for a

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.330 
issues and it pretty difficult for a
more<00:05:20.520> upgrade<00:05:21.020> how<00:05:22.020> did<00:05:22.140> we<00:05:22.230> go<00:05:22.320> pro<00:05:22.530> yeah<00:05:23.310> I

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
more upgrade how did we go pro yeah I

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.800 
more upgrade how did we go pro yeah I
hate<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.730> say<00:05:23.910> it<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.120> usually<00:05:24.420> pull<00:05:24.600> for<00:05:24.780> the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
hate to say it I usually pull for the

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.590 
hate to say it I usually pull for the
underdogs<00:05:25.320> but<00:05:25.650> exactly<00:05:26.490> it's<00:05:27.210> not<00:05:27.330> like<00:05:27.480> we

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
underdogs but exactly it's not like we

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.880 
underdogs but exactly it's not like we
don't<00:05:27.690> love<00:05:27.930> them<00:05:28.170> but<00:05:28.410> they're<00:05:28.590> just<00:05:28.740> you
