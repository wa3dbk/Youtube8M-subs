00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
printer or bread or an alien I think and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.099 
printer or bread or an alien I think and
those<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> aliens<00:00:24.750> over<00:00:24.900> there<00:00:24.990> I've

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
those are the aliens over there I've

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.470 
those are the aliens over there I've
three<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.619> them<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.539> this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.869> new<00:00:28.050> mod<00:00:28.260> by

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
three of them and this is a new mod by

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.580 
three of them and this is a new mod by
someone<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.660> haven't<00:00:30.840> checked<00:00:31.170> their<00:00:31.380> name

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
someone I haven't checked their name

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.580 
someone I haven't checked their name
very<00:00:32.279> well<00:00:32.520> obviously<00:00:33.360> well<00:00:34.170> I'm<00:00:34.320> not<00:00:34.440> very

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
very well obviously well I'm not very

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.630 
very well obviously well I'm not very
good<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.430> alrighty<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
good to that alrighty so this is the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.680 
good to that alrighty so this is the
predator<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:40.430> he<00:00:41.430> acts<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.329> zombie

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
predator and he acts more like a zombie

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.709 
predator and he acts more like a zombie
pigmen<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.440> if<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.920> hit<00:00:44.670> him<00:00:44.820> he<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.360> fight

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
pigmen so if you hit him he will fight

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.170 
pigmen so if you hit him he will fight
back<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.829> he<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.940> fight

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
back but if you don't he will not fight

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.040 
back but if you don't he will not fight
back<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.500> he's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.820> bit<00:00:51.360> safer<00:00:51.809> than<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
back so he's a little bit safer than the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.680 
back so he's a little bit safer than the
aliens<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> aliens<00:00:53.489> are<00:00:53.690> basically

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
aliens because the aliens are basically

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.779 
aliens because the aliens are basically
zombies<00:00:56.210> but<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.360> drop<00:00:57.629> different<00:00:58.050> items<00:00:58.789> so

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
zombies but they drop different items so

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.400 
zombies but they drop different items so
they<00:00:59.910> will<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.210> keep<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.719> running<00:01:01.050> into<00:01:01.289> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
they will just keep on running into you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.490 
they will just keep on running into you
no<00:01:01.590> matter<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.300> they<00:01:03.300> will<00:01:03.480> try<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
no matter what and they will try and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.899 
no matter what and they will try and
destroy<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.610> see<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:11.250> alien

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
destroy you so as you can see that alien

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.609 
destroy you so as you can see that alien
dropped<00:01:12.450> em<00:01:14.330> this<00:01:15.330> piece<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.960> thing<00:01:16.409> that

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
dropped em this piece of thing that

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.760 
dropped em this piece of thing that
looks<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.950> little<00:01:17.220> flame<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:19.530> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
looks like a little flame and that is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.899 
looks like a little flame and that is
called<00:01:20.310> alien<00:01:21.060> acid<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.130> take<00:01:23.369> alien

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
called alien acid so if you take alien

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.039 
called alien acid so if you take alien
acid<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:26.490> bow<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.000> an<00:01:27.180> arrow<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.540> me<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
acid and a bow and an arrow I me and

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.310 
acid and a bow and an arrow I me and
then<00:01:29.009> put<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.689> get<00:01:30.780> acid

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
then put it like that you can get acid

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.730 
then put it like that you can get acid
arrows<00:01:31.710> now<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.990> sad<00:01:33.990> thing<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:36.590> if<00:01:37.590> you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
arrows now a sad thing is that if you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.690 
arrows now a sad thing is that if you
take<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> bow<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:39.890> get<00:01:40.890> rid<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> normal<00:01:41.460> arrows

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
take a bow and get rid of normal arrows

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.469 
take a bow and get rid of normal arrows
the<00:01:42.659> bow<00:01:42.890> will<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.070> shoot<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.409> acid<00:01:46.409> arrows<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
the bow will not shoot the acid arrows I

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.310 
the bow will not shoot the acid arrows I
don't<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.810> hear<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.229> I'm

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
don't know if you can hear that but I'm

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.649 
don't know if you can hear that but I'm
clicking<00:01:49.590> pretty<00:01:49.890> hard<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.240> it's<00:01:51.240> not

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
clicking pretty hard and it's not

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.969 
clicking pretty hard and it's not
working<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.530> doesn't<00:01:53.040> work<00:01:53.070> yet<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.979> that's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
working it doesn't work yet so that's

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.069 
working it doesn't work yet so that's
true<00:01:56.670> bad<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> predator<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:59.759> drop<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.880 

predator<00:02:04.079> spear<00:02:04.409> which

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
predator spear which

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.130 
predator spear which
it<00:02:06.460> looks<00:02:06.670> pretty<00:02:06.820> awesome<00:02:07.090> but<00:02:07.479> I<00:02:07.540> don't

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
it looks pretty awesome but I don't

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.940 
it looks pretty awesome but I don't
think<00:02:08.319> you're<00:02:08.380> going<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.590> throw<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:08.830> either

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
think you're going to throw it either

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.600 
think you're going to throw it either
and<00:02:10.500> here's<00:02:11.500> another<00:02:11.590> one<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.280> does<00:02:15.430> do

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and here's another one but it does do

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.900 
and here's another one but it does do
more<00:02:15.819> damage<00:02:16.030> than<00:02:16.450> like<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.140> normal<00:02:17.910> hand

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
more damage than like a normal hand

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.020 
more damage than like a normal hand
wheelers<00:02:19.450> whatever<00:02:19.900> right<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.670> guess<00:02:21.790> it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
wheelers whatever right so I guess it

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.090 
wheelers whatever right so I guess it
isn't<00:02:22.180> all<00:02:22.420> useless<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:25.450> more<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.100> iron

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
isn't all useless it's more like a iron

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
isn't all useless it's more like a iron
sword<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:27.940> guess<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.860> yeah<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.850> will<00:02:30.970> also

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
sword I guess so yeah and it will also

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.320 
sword I guess so yeah and it will also
drop<00:02:31.800> predator<00:02:32.800> wristbands<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.640> think<00:02:34.209> they're

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
drop predator wristbands I think they're

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.910 
drop predator wristbands I think they're
also<00:02:34.450> called<00:02:34.690> combi<00:02:35.230> sticks<00:02:35.500> on<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.860> web<00:02:36.130> page

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
also called combi sticks on the web page

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.350 
also called combi sticks on the web page
yeah<00:02:38.920> I'm<00:02:39.070> not<00:02:39.220> sure<00:02:39.430> about<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.760> but<00:02:40.000> these

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
yeah I'm not sure about that but these

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.860 
yeah I'm not sure about that but these
are<00:02:41.520> there<00:02:42.520> aren't<00:02:42.730> arm<00:02:42.940> right<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.480> can't<00:02:43.720> put

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
are there aren't arm right you can't put

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.920 
are there aren't arm right you can't put
them<00:02:43.989> on<00:02:45.600> but<00:02:46.600> i<00:02:46.900> think<00:02:47.320> they<00:02:47.410> act<00:02:47.590> like<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.810> a

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
them on but i think they act like like a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.890 
them on but i think they act like like a
sword<00:02:50.230> also<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.269> get<00:02:52.390> two<00:02:52.600> different

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
sword also so you can get two different

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.220 
sword also so you can get two different
types<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.260> sword<00:02:54.010> from<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:57.000> from<00:02:58.019> predator<00:02:59.019> and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
types of sword from a from predator and

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.340 
types of sword from a from predator and
you<00:02:59.590> can<00:02:59.769> get<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.130> new<00:03:00.610> type<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.269> row<00:03:02.100> from<00:03:03.100> the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
you can get a new type of a row from the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.250 
you can get a new type of a row from the
alien<00:03:05.790> also<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.850> do<00:03:07.060> with<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.330> alien<00:03:08.070> is<00:03:10.260> this

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
alien also to do with the alien is this

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.150 
alien also to do with the alien is this
which<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.510> alien<00:03:13.510> egg<00:03:13.720> I'm<00:03:14.440> not<00:03:14.680> sure<00:03:14.920> they

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
which is a alien egg I'm not sure they

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.060 
which is a alien egg I'm not sure they
hatch<00:03:16.000> or<00:03:16.239> anything<00:03:16.660> because<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.829> haven't

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
hatch or anything because I haven't

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.630 
hatch or anything because I haven't
actually<00:03:18.370> seen<00:03:18.790> any<00:03:18.970> hatch<00:03:20.430> but<00:03:21.430> I'm

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
actually seen any hatch but I'm

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.050 
actually seen any hatch but I'm
supposing<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.269> once<00:03:22.810> they<00:03:22.959> get<00:03:23.079> dark

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
supposing that once they get dark

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.120 
supposing that once they get dark
outside<00:03:26.010> they<00:03:27.010> hatch<00:03:27.220> or<00:03:27.430> something<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.860> I'm

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
outside they hatch or something so I'm

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.479 
outside they hatch or something so I'm
not<00:03:30.310> sure<00:03:30.519> about<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:30.850> one<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:32.250> haven't<00:03:33.250> they

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
not sure about that one I haven't they

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.420 
not sure about that one I haven't they
haven't<00:03:33.549> worked<00:03:33.910> out<00:03:34.030> for<00:03:34.239> me<00:03:34.299> yet<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.430> did

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
haven't worked out for me yet so I did

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.449 
haven't worked out for me yet so I did
plant<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.180> few<00:03:37.360> if<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.660> can<00:03:37.810> call<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:41.459> all
