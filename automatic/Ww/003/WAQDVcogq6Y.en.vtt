00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
in here is a nail polish and I think

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.899 
in here is a nail polish and I think
this<00:01:31.020> might<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.259> been<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.619> an<00:01:31.770> extra<00:01:32.340> this

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this might have been like an extra this

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.630 
this might have been like an extra this
is<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> Nicole<00:01:33.810> by<00:01:34.079> OPI<00:01:34.110> nail<00:01:34.860> polish<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
is the Nicole by OPI nail polish and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.340 
is the Nicole by OPI nail polish and
this<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> shade<00:01:38.509> pretty<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.720> plum<00:01:40.049> it's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
this is in the shade pretty in plum it's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.880 
this is in the shade pretty in plum it's
just<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.250> pearlescent<00:01:42.290> kind<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> neon

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
just kind of a pearlescent kind of neon

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130 
just kind of a pearlescent kind of neon
plum<00:01:44.520> color<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.329> i<00:01:45.360> guess<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
plum color so i guess it's from the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.810 
plum color so i guess it's from the
Selena<00:01:46.500> Gomez<00:01:46.950> collection<00:01:47.399> I'm<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.700> really

it's a moisturizer it looks like and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.460 
it's a moisturizer it looks like and
it's<00:03:13.350> organic<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.850> SPF<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.600> 20<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.170> wish

it's organic and it's a SPF of 20 I wish

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.780 
it's organic and it's a SPF of 20 I wish
that<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.769> would<00:03:16.920> be<00:03:17.040> higher<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.580> don't<00:03:17.730> know

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
that it would be higher I don't know

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.280 
that it would be higher I don't know
especially<00:03:17.910> because<00:03:18.239> it's<00:03:18.390> summer<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.900> feel

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
especially because it's summer I feel

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.289 
especially because it's summer I feel
like<00:03:19.410> SPF<00:03:19.920> 30<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.370> more<00:03:20.610> appropriate<00:03:21.090> special

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
like SPF 30 is more appropriate special

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.640 
like SPF 30 is more appropriate special

the most pig
I<00:04:20.980> shadows<00:04:21.430> which<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:22.180> would<00:04:22.330> expect<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:22.870> if

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
I shadows which I would expect that if

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.140 
I shadows which I would expect that if
you're<00:04:23.170> sampling<00:04:23.560> this<00:04:23.890> your<00:04:24.220> your<00:04:24.670> goal<00:04:24.940> is

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
you're sampling this your your goal is

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.060 
you're sampling this your your goal is
to<00:04:25.180> kind<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.630> introduce<00:04:26.080> your<00:04:26.650> product<00:04:27.010> to

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
to kind of introduce your product to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.550 
to kind of introduce your product to
people<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.610> want<00:04:27.820> them<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.410> purchase<00:04:29.410> the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
people and want them to purchase the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.380 
people and want them to purchase the
full<00:04:29.710> size<00:04:30.010> in<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:30.400> case<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.880> California

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
full size in this case the California

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.820 
full size in this case the California
pallets<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.260> would<00:04:32.470> think<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.650> they<00:04:32.800> would

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
pallets so I would think that they would

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.740 
pallets so I would think that they would
showcase<00:04:33.160> like<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.730> most<00:04:33.970> pigmented<00:04:34.360> ones

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
showcase like the most pigmented ones

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.960 
showcase like the most pigmented ones
and<00:04:34.990> if<00:04:35.110> these<00:04:35.440> are<00:04:35.770> then<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.280> don't<00:04:36.820> really

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
and if these are then I don't really

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.400 
and if these are then I don't really
think<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.300> says<00:04:37.480> a<00:04:37.510> lot<00:04:37.600> about<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:38.050> palette

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
think that says a lot about the palette

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.800 
think that says a lot about the palette
but<00:04:38.590> um<00:04:38.860> yeah<00:04:39.520> if<00:04:39.760> there<00:04:40.060> are<00:04:40.210> more<00:04:40.390> pigmented

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
but um yeah if there are more pigmented

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.880 
but um yeah if there are more pigmented
shades<00:04:41.020> i<00:04:41.200> would<00:04:41.320> think<00:04:41.440> they<00:04:41.590> would<00:04:41.710> put

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
shades i would think they would put

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.710 
shades i would think they would put
those<00:04:42.070> in<00:04:42.310> there<00:04:42.460> instead<00:04:42.970> just<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.330> kind<00:04:43.600> of

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
those in there instead just to kind of

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.540
