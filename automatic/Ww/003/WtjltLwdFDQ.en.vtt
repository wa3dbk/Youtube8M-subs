00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.299
 framed activity 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.529
 very permanent 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.859
 i she has been like this for millions of years 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.589
 but lately we 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.800
 as it is not like that naturally but we wanted 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.579
 dancing in the jungle and eating based on running after another for Roman 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.739
 norri and running because he does not eat us 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.890
 voluntarist for that important them 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.820
 before sports has been even 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.310
 the healing was a girl have seen things 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.380

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.480
 we put enemies 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.850

 but because it is saved in its moment with its representative 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.230
 When a person 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.310
