now<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.710> loop<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.250> therefore<00:01:41.820> we'll

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
now we can also loop it therefore we'll

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.160 
now we can also loop it therefore we'll
just<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> click<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.020> little

just have to click on to this little
arrow<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
arrow here and then you can see that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.380 
arrow here and then you can see that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
looping and now as you can see here in

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.590 
looping and now as you can see here in
the<00:01:48.479> level<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.590> moves

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the level it moves

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
the level it moves
ok<00:01:51.600> yeah<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> that's<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.890> basic<00:01:53.280> form

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
ok yeah so that's it that's a basic form

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.950 
ok yeah so that's it that's a basic form
how<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.329> course<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.810> can

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
how we can do that of course you can

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.510 
how we can do that of course you can
create<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> much<00:01:55.560> more<00:01:55.710> complex<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.430> you

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
create a much more complex one as you

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.639 
create a much more complex one as you
can<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> elemental<00:01:57.869> demo<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.530> on

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
can see in the elemental demo and so on

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.249 
can see in the elemental demo and so on
but<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.579> will<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.909> keep<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> simple<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
but I will just keep it simple now and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
but I will just keep it simple now and
that<00:02:01.770> are<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> basics<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:03.030> also<00:02:03.180> add

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
that are the basics so you can also add

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.380 
that are the basics so you can also add
a<00:02:03.540> turn<00:02:03.840> or<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.409> chump<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.299> my

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
a turn or a chump and so on but in my

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.540 
a turn or a chump and so on but in my
case<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.810> will<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:07.020> let<00:02:07.229> him<00:02:07.380> walk<00:02:07.560> from<00:02:08.310> here

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
case I will just let him walk from here

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.960 
case I will just let him walk from here
to<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.039> we<00:02:11.069> close<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.610> one<00:02:11.790> here

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
to here so now we close this one here

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.910 
to here so now we close this one here
then<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:12.989> go<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.590> blue

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
then we go to the blue

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.559 
then we go to the blue
prints<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.700> open<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.330> level

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
prints and then I open up the level

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.520 
prints and then I open up the level
blueprint<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> select<00:02:18.510> our<00:02:18.810> meta<00:02:19.110> nectar

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
blueprint now I select our meta nectar

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.520 
blueprint now I select our meta nectar
and<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.430> another<00:02:20.700> right<00:02:20.940> click<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.530> here

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and I do another right click and here

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.890 
and I do another right click and here
we'll<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.709> type<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:23.370> clay<00:02:23.730> enter<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.810> we'll

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
we'll just type in clay enter and we'll

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.199 
we'll just type in clay enter and we'll
add<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.170> play<00:02:25.459> then<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.550> course<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:26.910> your<00:02:27.000> event

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
add to play then of course in your event

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.360 
add to play then of course in your event
so<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.690> right<00:02:27.959> click<00:02:28.170> add<00:02:28.440> event<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.160> then

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
so to right click add event and then

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.970 
so to right click add event and then
let's<00:02:29.520> say<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:30.090> taking<00:02:30.239> play<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.860> will

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
let's say I'm taking play and we will

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.320 
let's say I'm taking play and we will
connect<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.310> when<00:02:32.489> here<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.730> play<00:02:32.940> and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
connect this when here is play and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.390 
connect this when here is play and
compile<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:35.580> now<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:35.940> already<00:02:36.060> see<00:02:36.270> here

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
compile and now we can already see here

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.229 
compile and now we can already see here
he<00:02:38.400> moves<00:02:40.040> there<00:02:41.040> as<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.250> said<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.880> can<00:02:42.060> create

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
he moves there as I said you can create

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.420 
he moves there as I said you can create
cutscenes<00:02:42.720> with<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.349> any<00:02:43.920> other<00:02:44.010> stuff

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
cutscenes with that and any other stuff

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.520 
cutscenes with that and any other stuff
but<00:02:45.090> that's<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.660> basic<00:02:45.989> form<00:02:46.200> or<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.410> do

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
but that's just the basic form or to do

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.500 
but that's just the basic form or to do
that<00:02:46.709> now<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.220> know<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.819> yeah<00:02:48.090> thank<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
that now you know it and yeah thank you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.980 
that now you know it and yeah thank you
for<00:02:48.600> watching<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.080> until<00:02:49.530> next<00:02:49.590> time
