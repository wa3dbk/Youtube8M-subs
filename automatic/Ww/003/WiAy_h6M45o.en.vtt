total<00:01:09.930> distance<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.619> has<00:01:10.770> traveled<00:01:11.280> from<00:01:11.700> the

total distance it has traveled from the

total distance it has traveled from the
plane<00:01:12.959> of<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.410> was<00:01:13.670> discharging<00:01:14.670> been

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
plane of which it was discharging been

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999 
plane of which it was discharging been
about<00:01:15.270> two<00:01:15.509> kilometers<00:01:16.110> about<00:01:16.410> 2,000<00:01:16.890> yards

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
about two kilometers about 2,000 yards

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.680 
about two kilometers about 2,000 yards
and<00:01:18.440> it's<00:01:19.440> right<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.550> fringes<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
and it's right on the fringes of the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.480 
and it's right on the fringes of the
forest<00:01:22.050> reserve<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.679> is<00:01:22.770> burning<00:01:23.190> some<00:01:23.399> of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
forest reserve so it is burning some of

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.880 
forest reserve so it is burning some of
the<00:01:23.550> trees<00:01:23.819> there<00:01:24.410> fortunately<00:01:25.410> again<00:01:25.679> it's

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the trees there fortunately again it's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.800 
the trees there fortunately again it's
at<00:01:26.039> an<00:01:26.220> altitude<00:01:26.459> or<00:01:26.970> elevation<00:01:27.509> up<00:01:27.630> their

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
at an altitude or elevation up their

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.749 
at an altitude or elevation up their
words<00:01:27.929> been<00:01:28.170> getting<00:01:28.410> some<00:01:28.649> moisture<00:01:29.099> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
words been getting some moisture the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.270 
words been getting some moisture the
fuels<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.630> pretty<00:01:30.899> green<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> wet<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.130> we

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
fuels are pretty green and wet so we

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.609 
fuels are pretty green and wet so we
haven't<00:01:32.580> had<00:01:32.700> any<00:01:32.729> fire<00:01:33.149> threat<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:33.750> all

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
haven't had any fire threat up there all

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.440 
haven't had any fire threat up there all
the<00:01:34.920> fire<00:01:35.160> activity<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.670> limited<00:01:36.179> to<00:01:36.270> what's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the fire activity is limited to what's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.210 
the fire activity is limited to what's
burning<00:01:36.869> along<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.289> fringes<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.709> the<00:01:37.979> flow

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
burning along the fringes of the flow

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.460 
burning along the fringes of the flow
and<00:01:38.550> it<00:01:39.060> may<00:01:39.270> burn<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.539> little<00:01:39.899> bit<00:01:40.140> further

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and it may burn a little bit further

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.770 
and it may burn a little bit further
away<00:01:40.770> i<00:01:41.280> would<00:01:41.580> estimate<00:01:41.640> based<00:01:42.300> on<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.539> saw

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
away i would estimate based on we saw

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.710 
away i would estimate based on we saw
you<00:01:43.410> know<00:01:43.530> maybe<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.310> 10<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.000> 20<00:01:45.300> yards<00:01:45.630> from

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
you know maybe a 10 to 20 yards from

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.480 
you know maybe a 10 to 20 yards from
that<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.410> quickly<00:01:46.590> self<00:01:47.009> extinguishes

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that but quickly self extinguishes

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.380 
that but quickly self extinguishes
because<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.300> high<00:01:49.110> moisture<00:01:49.349> content<00:01:49.739> and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
because of the high moisture content and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.570 
because of the high moisture content and

are those erroneous reports that are
going<00:04:30.510> out<00:04:30.660> there<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.280> creating<00:04:32.280> some
