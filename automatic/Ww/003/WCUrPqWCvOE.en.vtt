attached to it and then also pivots up

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.270 
attached to it and then also pivots up
and<00:01:03.840> down<00:01:04.489> you've<00:01:05.489> got<00:01:05.580> two<00:01:05.790> cupholders<00:01:06.090> there

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
and down you've got two cupholders there

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
and down you've got two cupholders there
by<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.420> power<00:01:09.420> function<00:01:09.990> servo<00:01:10.350> motor<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
by the power function servo motor the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.010 
by the power function servo motor the
thing<00:01:14.070> about<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.520> hood<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.180> redesign

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
thing about this hood and the redesign

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.800 
thing about this hood and the redesign
windscreen<00:01:16.759> supports<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> hood<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
windscreen supports is that the hood is

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.429 
windscreen supports is that the hood is
kind<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.259> shifting<00:01:20.159> around<00:01:20.780> it's<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:21.990> firmly

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
kind of shifting around it's not firmly

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.520 
kind of shifting around it's not firmly
attached<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.549> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> wedges<00:01:24.530> in

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
attached so it just kind of wedges in

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.240 
attached so it just kind of wedges in
between<00:01:26.009> those<00:01:26.430> two<00:01:26.790> red<00:01:27.509> Technic<00:01:28.259> connectors

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
between those two red Technic connectors

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.560 
between those two red Technic connectors
there<00:01:29.780> got<00:01:30.780> some<00:01:30.900> rally<00:01:31.140> lights<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.390> rear

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
spoiler now that kind of hides the ugly

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.440 
spoiler now that kind of hides the ugly
battery<00:01:36.750> box<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.350> rear<00:01:38.009> bumper<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.700> don't<00:01:39.390> know

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
battery box a rear bumper I don't know

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.440 
battery box a rear bumper I don't know
if<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:42.210> front

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
if I like that or not and the front

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.210 
if I like that or not and the front
grille<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:44.270> has<00:01:45.270> some<00:01:45.840> teeth<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.100> make

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
grille that has some teeth on it to make

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760 
grille that has some teeth on it to make
it<00:01:47.280> more<00:01:47.549> aggressive<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> let's<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.530> how<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it more aggressive so let's see how the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:02:09.090 
it more aggressive so let's see how the
different<00:01:50.700> gearing<00:01:51.590> drives<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.520> big

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.320 

anyway<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.310> see<00:02:10.460> that<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:10.789> pretty<00:02:11.060> fast

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
anyway you can see that it's pretty fast

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.390 
anyway you can see that it's pretty fast
if<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.690> knew<00:02:11.840> how<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.050> drive<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.590> take<00:02:12.830> pictures

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
if I knew how to drive and take pictures

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.060 
if I knew how to drive and take pictures
at<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.640> same<00:02:13.850> time
