00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:24.560
 I thought in the diogrande debate 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.949
 request for a title of partner god I 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.039
 I'm supposed to go look after the first one year 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.650
 I decided that I wanted to make a menu with 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.210
 Saint's food is inspired by the 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.000
 food inspired by the saint 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.390
 offered to the other 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.430
 and after that I thought it was 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.430
 important to spend time in the bathroom 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.820
 the truth is that it would make millions 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.950
 - inspired by so rich that is is is that 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.579
 this story is very very rich 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.890
 of truths are many orishas sounds 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.989
 that we know more than each other 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.200
 likes a specific food is 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:10.520
 complex in this as a material of 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:15.049
 creation is a full droid dish that I 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.229
 I prepared it for those who came rereading 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.509
 from malata go which is an honor an expensive 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.500
 in the case of xangô we do the same 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.820
 An expensive thing but with oxtail and there goes 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.990
 to call himself the bag of xango 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.570
 I already use this as a bed ever one 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.120
 grilled shrimp at the point I think 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.869
 ideal is not much of the past 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.310
 obviously grilled cord on the same grill 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.259
 hence the capsules of palm oil sprouts 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.130
 of cilantro ends with a cachaça 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.720
 a special treat a flaming cachaça 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.000
 representing the fire 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.160
 the evidence is that it is the elements of the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.700
 nature that came to representing 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.119
 he exerts this reinterpretation I hope 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.119
 that you have enjoyed
