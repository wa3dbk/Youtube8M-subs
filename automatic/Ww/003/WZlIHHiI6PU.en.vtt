18<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.019> 7<00:00:10.320> during<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:20.930> whole<00:00:21.930> team<00:00:22.199> guys

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
18 and 7 during this whole team guys

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.740 
18 and 7 during this whole team guys
we're<00:00:22.890> all<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.279> party<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.180> just

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
we're all on the party and I just

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.200 
we're all on the party and I just
randomly<00:00:25.050> joined<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> match<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.039> had<00:00:26.220> four

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
randomly joined the match and had four

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.660 
randomly joined the match and had four
other<00:00:27.420> people<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.170> had<00:00:28.920> no<00:00:29.099> mics<00:00:29.340> or

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
other people that had no mics or

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.370 
other people that had no mics or
anything<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.480> didn't<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.230> any

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
anything so we didn't really have any

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
anything so we didn't really have any
communication<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.250> strategies<00:00:32.880> or<00:00:33.000> teamwork

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
communication or strategies or teamwork

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.870 
communication or strategies or teamwork
so<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.899> basically<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.520> every<00:00:35.520> man<00:00:35.670> for

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
so it's basically just every man for

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.639 
so it's basically just every man for
himself<00:00:35.940> was<00:00:36.420> I'm<00:00:36.540> still<00:00:36.780> managed<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.079> win<00:00:37.410> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
himself was I'm still managed to win it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.670 
himself was I'm still managed to win it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
made this one way more different than

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.760 
made this one way more different than
any<00:01:14.590> halo<00:01:15.040> has<00:01:15.100> ever<00:01:15.310> been<00:01:15.520> done<00:01:15.550> as<00:01:16.770> usually

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
any halo has ever been done as usually

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.920 
any halo has ever been done as usually
everyone<00:01:18.640> started<00:01:19.030> off<00:01:19.149> people<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:19.720> have<00:01:19.810> the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
everyone started off people and have the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.190 
everyone started off people and have the
same<00:01:20.110> things<00:01:20.470> but<00:01:20.920> now<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:22.659> got<00:01:22.840> class

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
same things but now we got class

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.169 
same things but now we got class
customisation<00:01:24.780> feels<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.899> lot<00:01:26.020> more<00:01:26.080> like<00:01:30.179> but

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
customisation feels a lot more like but

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.850 
customisation feels a lot more like but
there's<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.420> lot<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.600> cheap<00:01:31.929> factors<00:01:32.440> into<00:01:32.710> it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
there's a lot of cheap factors into it

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.249 
there's a lot of cheap factors into it
where<00:01:33.100> some<00:01:33.940> players<00:01:34.149> don't<00:01:34.390> have<00:01:34.539> like<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
where some players don't have like the

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.840 
where some players don't have like the
gums<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.679> other<00:01:35.830> people<00:01:36.190> do<00:01:36.310> we're<00:01:36.610> not<00:01:36.729> the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
gums that other people do we're not the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.240 
gums that other people do we're not the
gums<00:01:37.060> but<00:01:37.270> like<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.390> perks<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.020> whatnot<00:01:38.320> maybe

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
gums but like a perks and whatnot maybe

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
the that little pistol yes you do that

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.570 
the that little pistol yes you do that
you're<00:01:50.080> not<00:01:50.170> very<00:01:50.470> nice<00:01:50.649> person<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.369> thing's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
you're not very nice person that thing's

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.980 
you're not very nice person that thing's
basically<00:01:51.729> kind<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.270> shotgun<00:01:52.539> as<00:01:52.840> your

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
basically kind of a shotgun as your

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.800 
basically kind of a shotgun as your
secondary<00:01:53.440> it's<00:01:54.250> actually<00:01:54.550> really<00:01:54.909> stupid<00:01:55.569> so

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
secondary it's actually really stupid so

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.570 
secondary it's actually really stupid so
that<00:01:56.020> there's<00:01:56.350> almost<00:01:56.470> no<00:01:56.830> reason<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.369> game

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
that there's almost no reason this game

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.249 
that there's almost no reason this game
the<00:01:57.700> rush<00:01:57.909> power<00:01:58.179> weapons<00:01:58.690> it<00:01:58.810> seems<00:01:59.020> like

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
the rush power weapons it seems like

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.110 
the rush power weapons it seems like
because

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.910 

kind<00:02:04.120> of<00:02:04.180> like

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
kind of like

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.460 
kind of like
like<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.700> if<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:06.909> die<00:02:07.119> your<00:02:08.110> weapons

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
like is if you die your weapons

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.410 
like is if you die your weapons
disappear<00:02:09.069> in<00:02:09.160> like<00:02:09.310> 10<00:02:09.580> seconds<00:02:10.030> seems<00:02:10.300> like

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
disappear in like 10 seconds seems like

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.839 
disappear in like 10 seconds seems like
we'll<00:02:10.539> see<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:10.720> back<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.989> your<00:02:11.050> body<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.700> guy

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
we'll see you back to your body the guy

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.910 
we'll see you back to your body the guy

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
hasn't you take them up no one's husband

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.120 
hasn't you take them up no one's husband
disappeared<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.690> ordnance<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.709> don't<00:02:17.890> care

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
disappeared and ordnance I don't care

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.920 
disappeared and ordnance I don't care
for<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.370> much<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.880> look<00:02:19.330> like<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.540> killstreak

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
for that much you look like a killstreak

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.610 
for that much you look like a killstreak
it<00:02:20.440> just<00:02:20.560> feels<00:02:20.739> more<00:02:20.950> like<00:02:21.010> call<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.370> duty<00:02:21.670> but

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it just feels more like call of duty but

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.360 
it just feels more like call of duty but
hopefully<00:02:23.620> halo<00:02:23.950> 5<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.640> more<00:02:25.150> coal<00:02:26.050> baby<00:02:26.370> type

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
hopefully halo 5 is more coal baby type

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.100 
hopefully halo 5 is more coal baby type

community on what to put back I think

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.360 
community on what to put back I think
basically<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:47.020> just<00:04:47.470> try<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.680> make<00:04:47.890> this<00:04:48.070> but

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
basically to just try to make this but

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.790 
basically to just try to make this but
you<00:04:48.520> can<00:04:48.630> make<00:04:49.630> it<00:04:49.780> more<00:04:49.900> like<00:04:50.140> Call<00:04:50.350> of<00:04:50.380> Duty

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
you can make it more like Call of Duty

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.610 
you can make it more like Call of Duty
just<00:04:51.790> so<00:04:51.880> people<00:04:52.090> would<00:04:52.330> go<00:04:52.450> get<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.840> not<00:04:53.140> suck

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
just so people would go get it not suck

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.230 
just so people would go get it not suck
and<00:04:53.890> give<00:04:54.040> up<00:04:54.190> after<00:04:54.430> like<00:04:54.670> a<00:04:54.700> game<00:04:55.000> or<00:04:55.210> two

and give up after like a game or two

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.850 
and give up after like a game or two
because<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.690> lets<00:04:55.930> face<00:04:56.110> that's<00:04:56.380> what<00:04:56.530> happens

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
because it lets face that's what happens

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.540 
because it lets face that's what happens
