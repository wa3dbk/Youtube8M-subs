00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.480
 how are you and well are you welcome 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.309
 here this new video good for them 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.750
 I bring gameplays of revolution and good 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.150
 because I tell them gameplays because they are 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 several ok then a people well let's go 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.170
 to start with this video are not the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.939
 changes that I would like it to have 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.400
 revolution before the game's exit 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.529
 ok this can still be done 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 the goal stage is still missing 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.460
 about a week and a half to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.990
 golf this stage if I remember good 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.090
 three weeks before the departure of the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.059
 game here in what is america not 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.590
 two weeks are not missing the same 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 same three weeks me a little bit in 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.030
 these weeks two weeks and five days 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.950
 to come out in japan and well then 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.350
 now yes that these changes in my opinion 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.390
 they can be easily made even 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.670
 if they can not be put in with a patch or 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.230
 that this game we know that the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.629
 main problems they have are the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.720
 world pride and the countertenor but good 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.510
 there is more that is ok 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.480
 problems with huge awakenings 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.360
 with reinforcements ok is something completely 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.520
 stupid in the sense that good of 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.430
 by itself the fact of bringing the character in 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.810
 that in that form is already an advantage as 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.119
 so that apart from everything you allow 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.000
 Well let's say it allows you to use it or 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.470
 is not to use the fact of being able to use 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.020
 a reinforcement do not imagine the fact of 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.820
 bring healing more now yes that giant and 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.700
 apart from everything because it allows to use 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.780
 reinforcements like that is not very logical and not 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.360
 it's very balanced ok 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.970
 the fact that awakenings can 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.760
 use counter is ok as I mention them 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.270
 is an advantage that already brings, let's say 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.930
 that kind of that fighting style is not 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.030
 you know you can not use it the last 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.860
 jutsu since there is your advantage the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.899
 that they use so now that the mode 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.000
 normal or what is the drive time 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.619
 Well there you have the advantage this 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.440
 then the fact that awakenings 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.440
 can use the counter is it 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.149
 rather silly, more than anything 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.550
 giant espartales ok put it not 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.350
 you the normal awakenings but the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.959
 made of the giant awakenings that 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.870
 when you use a hard con it is a 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.700
 rolling problem that if it takes wave 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.950
 because there are people that apart from that good 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.750
 as it abused because what is being 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.130
 the frames of him 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.080
 It seems that the characters 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.640
 following everything else they spend 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.770
 doing control do not imagine yourself then 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.350
 counter and apart as awakening is 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.840
 you're practically going to lose in automatic 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.490
 not another of the things we would like 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.950
 that will obviously change all these are 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.220
 options I say are this comments then 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.650
 let's say my opinion and my opinion and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.270
 now yes that another one of the two then 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.040
 I wanted them to change would be the speed 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.020
 of the game but I do not mean the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.270
 combo speed for example but in 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.180
 the speed at which the character gives 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.550
 jumps in which for example this one throws 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.580
 ones an island to the accessories or 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.050
 the tools that we have available 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.480
 this obviously all that kind of stuff 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.470
 I would like it to be increased since 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.080
 Well, if you leave a little, let's say the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.970
 gameplay in a way then of 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.890
 kick back so to speak if so what 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.900
 they want to see, this is not like 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.670
 recoil obviously, now that 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.430
 I tell you this you know my point of view 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.810
 the good ones let's say what is the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.239
 speed reduction of some 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.070
 characters ok I think it's not very 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.380
 difficult to see what this option is and 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.870
 is that well we know perfectly what 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.180
 Naruto, there has always been a 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.460
 speed difference with some 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.200
 characters which limits its use by 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.000
 example is not the same to use handles that 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.980
 for example in being in three and using 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.870
 to anger since he will use queue for example 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.210
 not that they are characters that 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.040
 unfortunately they are affected by the 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.510
 made of its speed and good thing not 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.100
 they have the same as that kind of 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.170
 characters for example in the demo of 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.460
 revolution you know that as I mentioned it in 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.860
 several videos is the one that the character that 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.840
 hit faster and you can hit one and 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.270
 half a time in what you hit a no 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.370
 then that is an obvious advantage not 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.780
 it is an obvious advantage that 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.160
 obviously you have to correct if it is 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.600
 who want to use others 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.210
 characters because if you do not come back 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.950
 boring as boring 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.530
 let's say that using this aspect 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.360
 here comes the next hand that 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.480
 I would like them to correct and it is the fact 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.580
 so balance some characters not 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.980
 to the same fact as well as you know that it has 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.560
 too much speed for example there's 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.240
 characters that do too much damage that 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.450
 They have loaded too much damage to farms 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.910
 very very 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.560
 fast with respect to others and 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.270
 Obviously, maybe you can say 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.220
 No, it's just that it's 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.080
 characterization of the character obviously 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.180
 I do not know Naruto is going to load more 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.700
 quick that that cure or things like that 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.820
 then it is an aspect that obviously 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.800
 be this one then have to measure by 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.390
 example in that case you show me 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.030
 I would like more the fact of correction 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.860
 of speed not to correct in the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.350
 speed some characters do not and good 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.110
 The most important is the reduction of 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.360
 damage and counter time ok you 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.400
 they know that good lasts too hard 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.380
 too much what is the counter and is something 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.900
 annoying is not something annoying other than 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.820
 there are people who really abuse this and 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.820
 Well, they do not really let you play at ease 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.680
 with this system it is obviously not the fault 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.390
 of knowing connects entirely since 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.800
 could have done better things not 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.630
 They can honestly have done things 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.950
 more effective than this that is 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.110
 it happened that the truth is that it's not like 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.220
 what a good idea but good is not 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.480
 good people then let me here the 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.190
 comments you what they think 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.390
 they should change the revolution before 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.010
 of their output that they would like 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.910
 will change no people because I here 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.910
 dismissal see you next
