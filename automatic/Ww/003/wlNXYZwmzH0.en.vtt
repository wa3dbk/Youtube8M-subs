00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.809
 hello good i 'm vicente alfonso and i come 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.150
 to show you a tripod of the company 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.110
 vanguard vanguard is a multinational 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.630
 that is dedicated to photography products 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.349
 how can tripods be mono feet 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.869
 Photography bags and other types of 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:30.919
 accessories and high quality because today 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.570
 I'm going to test the level or 245 go here is a 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.540
 pretty tripod 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.530
 quite light is thought about everything 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.960
 for cameras because micro four thirds 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.290
 lightweight reflex, it is a tripod 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.989
 that supports up to 33 kilos generally 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.710
 the conversion for the tripods is usually 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.570
 be that if a tripod has endurance 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.339
 up to 5 kilos his is that the weight that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.470
 let's put it at most to the 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.940
 half or so is what is usually 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.340
 do although good if you put a little more 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.670
 nothing is happening either 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.360
 the tripod is from the following the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.360
 next form 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.580
 comes with this bag to transport 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.330
 good as you see the tripod is very 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:33.920
 foldable because it has a central part 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.920
 what is good for apart from this well 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.479
 this would be the tripod with the bar 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.460
 raised central and this as you see that 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.159
 it was in the down side it serves 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.260
 for macro photography it's great 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.380
 well 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.330
 lowering this down and placing it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.090
 in very close areas as best to 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.640
 photograph of mushrooms or insects in the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.410
 that we need a performance speed 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.290
 very low with a very close macro 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.220
 we can the pulse movement is bad 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.810
 for that kind of photos 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.910
 Well, we have these types of 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.030
 tripods that come in handy for 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.400
 make these kind of photos good as you see 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.420
 gets up with a simple the system of 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.250
 pressure here we press then the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.260
 Tripod consists of four parts 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.460
 four extensible parts for the legs 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.220
 that go by thread open and close is 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.100
 it's that simple the system we open 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.600
 we stretch closed we are worth it with all 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.210
 the legs 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.290
 let's unfold the entire tripod in the 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.710
 tripod in total height this measures 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.390
 around 1 meter 60 so it has 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.000
 a pretty good height for any 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:51.240
 person to not have to stoop or 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.240
 make any kind of weird gesture 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.220
 the tripod consists of this patella is a 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.140
 break in its very simple part is a 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.590
 kneecap that simply has two 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.590
 mechanisms has one for to turn 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.950
 as you see to turn in the plane 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.950
 vertical 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.810
 then we have another one that is to rotate in 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.989
 the horizontal plane good because the shoe 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.390
 what is this little thing that comes in 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.329
 the tripod that is hooked with the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.840
 compass with a very curious system good 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.360
 this is what we will put in the camera 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.970
 that we screw all for the compact 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.400
 of micro four thirds any type 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.410
 camera has the same system 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.790
 subject we place in 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.310
 on the tripod 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.939
 in this case to take photograph of 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.939
 landscape 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.210
 once we place it, the 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.030
 hook that is where the compass is and 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.910
 is already subject to the camera we are going to 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.160
 regulate a little bit as you see the system 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.989
 the fastening system is of legs is 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.770
 very comfortable is very fast it is simply 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.260
 tour we turn again and we have good 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.720
 as you see with this camera maybe it is not 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.450
 is the tripod weighs very little with this 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.640
 camera that weighs a lot more than what 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.800
 should allow this tripod so good 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.690
 we are touching the limits there are also 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.590
 to know that you have another extension here 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.780
 spinning on the tube and we can lift 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.380
 the height of about 60 which is the maximum of 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.980
 this tripod to make good photography 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.620
 well 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.270
 what else has this type of apart can 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.210
 open the legs as you see 25 degrees 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.300
 we can also have pressing on these 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.980
 sure we can open the 50 degrees 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.170
 also incorporates good an anchorage 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.810
 here subject to hang weight at 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.030
 better is going to play also has then 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.280
 some bags is very cool that 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.230
 hooks to each of the legs and remains 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.160
 the here the bag hanging where it 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.770
 they can put stones and so on to 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.900
 this type of photographs 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.419
 As you can see, it is a very good tripod 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.789
 small very light so you can see how 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:31.560
 the system for photography works 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:34.849
 macro we have here in the subjection with what 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.849
 that we would lower the camera 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.270
 we would put it in mode 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.450
 so that the camera is down 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.140
 and for example we could go down much more 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.140
 the legs 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.130
 we would do more 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.169
 we would go down here 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.030
 and we could be doing with this 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.700
 we rotate the camera as we said in 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.010
 horizontal and with this one it would be in vertical 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.160
 with the sixth horizontally and we could 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:13.070
 be approaching us to do photography 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.080
 of macro photography the truth is that it is 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.570
 a great system is very fast for 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.790
 place good things good things of 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.300
 This tripod has mainly 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:26.600
 liked the security system of the 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.460
 legs is very fast is open and close 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.330
 right away 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.070
 immediately it is placed 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.020
 the only problem with that system has 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.060
 liked because it's very fast but the 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.760
 The only problem with that system is that 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.370
 you know when it's embedded when or 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.860
 when it is not then until what 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.990
 we do not see that it moves down or moves 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.510
 legs we are not sure because it does not have 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.280
 no indicator tells you towards this side 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.919
 you open the safety to this side you close 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.750
 the insurance but we do not have any 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:01.289
 indicator so we know that really 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.149
 we are in the area in the blocked area 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:05.159
 the tripod is very light it is very 

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:08.009
 very compact teeny is great for 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:09.839
 take a trip to anywhere maybe 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:11.729
 it's not a tripod thought because it was to be 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:14.279
 so light it is not thought so for 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:17.309
 extreme photography for photography in 

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:19.110
 very complicated conditions but so 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:21.629
 other is a perfect tripod for 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.309
 anyone to make their trips 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:25.559
 as another part that I did not like 

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:27.809
 very good, because the kneecap is a break 

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:32.399
 very simple as I told you then it has 

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:34.649
 for horizontal has for vertical and the 

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:36.839
 true then with a few systems a little bit 

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:40.740
 complicated in very small 

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:43.259
 Well, as I said, it's a tripod for 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.419
 Low-end low-weight cameras for 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.699
 micro four thirds for compact 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:50.669
 our nothing more I say is very light 

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:52.900
 very easy to transport very foldable 

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:56.169
 it occupies very little space 

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:58.300
 It can be a perfect option for 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:01.419
 that have a tight budget and do not 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.729
 they do not need a tripod of range either 

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:06.229
 high 

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:06.229
 this has been a greeting
