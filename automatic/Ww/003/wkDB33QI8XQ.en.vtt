since<00:00:32.579> sometimes<00:00:33.059> if<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.360> don't<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
since sometimes if I don't do that the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.690 
since sometimes if I don't do that the
video<00:00:34.440> isn't<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.800> greatest<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.149> record<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
video isn't the greatest to record and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.639 
video isn't the greatest to record and
this<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.879> an<00:00:39.030> extremely<00:00:39.510> entertaining<00:00:39.899> paddle

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649

for<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> 3<00:00:41.250> v6<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.090> from<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> first<00:00:45.239> move<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.989> can

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
for a 3 v6 so from the first move I can

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.910 
for a 3 v6 so from the first move I can
see<00:00:46.350> right<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.820> isatai<00:00:47.820> plans<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.920> it's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
see right here isatai plans and it's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.880 
see right here isatai plans and it's
just<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.250> huge<00:00:50.550> hit<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.820> Haxorus<00:00:51.620> which<00:00:52.620> makes

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570

me think he either didn't expect an ice
beam<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.379> opponent<00:00:56.190> isn't<00:00:56.489> extremely

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
