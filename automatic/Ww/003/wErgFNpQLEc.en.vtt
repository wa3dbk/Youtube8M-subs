that when you do this first of all the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.960 
that when you do this first of all the
hole<00:02:49.819> is<00:02:50.060> way<00:02:50.209> too<00:02:50.269> small

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
hole is way too small

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.670 
hole is way too small
second<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.090> all<00:02:53.209> what<00:02:53.900> happens<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.379> that<00:02:54.500> you

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
second of all what happens is that you

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.270 
second of all what happens is that you
need<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.040> raise<00:02:55.250> your<00:02:55.280> your<00:02:56.269> chin<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.660> do<00:02:56.780> that

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
okay when the muscles Karno get all

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.449 
okay when the muscles Karno get all

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
cramped up here and it creates this kind

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.130

that<00:03:14.690> we<00:03:14.959> do<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.769> that<00:03:16.989> our<00:03:18.010> expression<00:03:19.010> is

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
that we do is that our expression is

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.690 
that we do is that our expression is
basically<00:03:21.610> shaping<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:24.440> airflow<00:03:24.890> that's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
basically shaping the airflow that's

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.690 
basically shaping the airflow that's
that's<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.360> way<00:03:26.510> we<00:03:26.690> create<00:03:27.489> sound<00:03:28.489> and

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
that's the way we create sound and

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.580 
that's the way we create sound and
that's<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.150> way<00:03:29.299> we<00:03:29.540> create<00:03:29.780> art<00:03:30.200> when<00:03:30.440> we

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
that's the way we create art when we

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.140 
that's the way we create art when we
play<00:03:30.799> on<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.069> little<00:03:31.220> thing<00:03:31.340> we<00:03:31.549> shape<00:03:31.879> the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
play on this little thing we shape the

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.110 
play on this little thing we shape the
airflow<00:03:32.599> this<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.440> our<00:03:33.560> medium<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.700> airflow

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
airflow this is our medium the airflow

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.080 
airflow this is our medium the airflow
so<00:03:36.040> by<00:03:37.040> doing<00:03:37.100> this

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.900 

you<00:03:40.870> cannot<00:03:41.050> restricting<00:03:41.770> it<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.980> lot<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.819> you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
you cannot restricting it a lot so you

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.180 
you cannot restricting it a lot so you
have<00:03:43.060> no<00:03:43.239> hair<00:03:43.420> flow<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.690> shape<00:03:44.080> so<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:44.950> can

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
have no hair flow to shape so you can

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.170 
have no hair flow to shape so you can
imagine<00:03:45.690> when<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.720> started<00:03:47.290> doing<00:03:47.530> this<00:03:48.180> doing

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
imagine when I started doing this doing

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.150 
imagine when I started doing this doing
bends<00:03:49.540> was<00:03:49.840> impossible<00:03:50.470> with<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.770> kind<00:03:51.010> of

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
bends was impossible with this kind of

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.210 
bends was impossible with this kind of
ambusher<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:52.120> mean<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.440> draw<00:03:53.920> was

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
ambusher I mean the to the to draw was

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.309 
ambusher I mean the to the to draw was
possible<00:03:54.640> because<00:03:54.819> it's<00:03:55.150> it's<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.900> kind<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.170> an

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
possible because it's it's a kind of an

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.009 
possible because it's it's a kind of an
easy<00:03:56.440> man<00:03:56.800> right

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.780 

it<00:04:02.019> was<00:04:02.200> alright<00:04:02.500> with<00:04:02.680> this<00:04:02.860> ambition<00:04:03.340> but

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
it was alright with this ambition but

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.870 
it was alright with this ambition but
the<00:04:03.910> three<00:04:04.269> draw<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.920> was<00:04:06.069> impossible<00:04:06.670> I

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
the three draw that was impossible I

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.210 
the three draw that was impossible I
think<00:04:07.599> even<00:04:07.840> now<00:04:08.110> with<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.470> sin<00:04:08.680> bisher<00:04:08.830> alia

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
think even now with the sin bisher alia

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.949 
think even now with the sin bisher alia
wouldn't<00:04:09.700> be<00:04:09.790> able<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:12.330> well<00:04:13.330> I<00:04:13.360> get<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.690> now<00:04:13.930> a

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
wouldn't be able to well I get it now a

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.319 
wouldn't be able to well I get it now a
bit<00:04:14.290> more<00:04:14.530> but<00:04:14.769> at<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.340> time<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.970> even<00:04:16.030> there

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
bit more but at that time and even there

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.280 
bit more but at that time and even there
that's<00:04:16.540> just<00:04:16.739> that's<00:04:17.739> just<00:04:18.000> one<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.290> three

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
that's just that's just one of the three

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.890 
that's just that's just one of the three
possible<00:04:21.040> positions<00:04:21.639> of<00:04:21.910> Bend<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:22.510> can<00:04:22.750> be

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
possible positions of Bend that can be

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.920 
possible positions of Bend that can be
under<00:04:23.830> on<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.220> three<00:04:24.520> whole<00:04:24.669> draw<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:27.930> lesson

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
under on the three whole draw so lesson

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.800 
under on the three whole draw so lesson
I<00:04:29.020> want<00:04:29.139> to<00:04:29.260> shame<00:04:30.280> not<00:04:30.729> give<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.600> but

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
I want to shame not give you that but

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.330 
I want to shame not give you that but

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
the thing I want to share with you today

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.219 
the thing I want to share with you today
and<00:04:33.700> tell<00:04:34.180> me<00:04:34.330> if<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:34.510> makes<00:04:34.630> sense<00:04:34.750> for<00:04:35.110> you

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
and tell me if it makes sense for you

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.890 
and tell me if it makes sense for you
and<00:04:35.260> if<00:04:35.470> I'm<00:04:35.620> wrong<00:04:35.800> about<00:04:36.010> this<00:04:36.450> is<00:04:37.450> that<00:04:37.720> this

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
and if I'm wrong about this is that this

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.480 
and if I'm wrong about this is that this
is<00:04:37.960> wrong<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:39.389> instead<00:04:40.389> this<00:04:40.900> is<00:04:41.110> right<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
is wrong and instead this is right the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.170 
is wrong and instead this is right the
key<00:04:45.729> element<00:04:46.120> is<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:48.450> jaw<00:04:49.450> drops

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
key element is the jaw drops

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.070 
key element is the jaw drops
automatically<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:54.070> opens<00:04:54.820> up<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.180> lot<00:04:55.450> of<00:04:55.479> space

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
automatically it opens up a lot of space

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.590 
automatically it opens up a lot of space
in<00:04:56.380> your<00:04:56.410> mouth<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.100> air<00:04:57.310> can<00:04:58.120> come<00:04:58.330> in

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
in your mouth and the air can come in

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.070 
in your mouth and the air can come in
and<00:04:58.840> go<00:04:58.960> out<00:04:59.110> much<00:04:59.440> more<00:04:59.710> easily<00:05:00.990> see<00:05:01.990> the

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
and go out much more easily see the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:12.659 
and go out much more easily see the
difference<00:05:02.110> between<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:11.490> try<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.550> for

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
difference between and try it for

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.360 
difference between and try it for
yourself<00:05:13.030> you'll<00:05:13.180> see<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.389> big<00:05:13.600> difference<00:05:14.370> if

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
yourself you'll see a big difference if

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.200 
yourself you'll see a big difference if
you<00:05:15.580> don't<00:05:15.760> already<00:05:15.940> do<00:05:16.300> it<00:05:16.479> as<00:05:16.690> a<00:05:17.260> harp<00:05:17.560> player

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
you don't already do it as a harp player

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.790 
you don't already do it as a harp player
and<00:05:19.210> in<00:05:19.450> terms<00:05:19.660> of<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.900> sound<00:05:20.139> it<00:05:20.320> produces<00:05:20.410> it

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
and in terms of the sound it produces it

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.740 
and in terms of the sound it produces it
all<00:05:20.919> it<00:05:21.250> also<00:05:21.400> makes<00:05:21.789> a<00:05:21.940> difference<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.419> don't

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
all it also makes a difference I don't

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.050 
all it also makes a difference I don't
know<00:05:22.840> if<00:05:22.960> you'll<00:05:23.110> be<00:05:23.229> able<00:05:23.289> to<00:05:23.500> hear<00:05:23.770> it<00:05:24.060> with

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
know if you'll be able to hear it with

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.200 
know if you'll be able to hear it with
your<00:05:25.090> computer<00:05:25.840> speakers<00:05:26.289> but<00:05:26.680> I<00:05:26.970> pick<00:05:27.970> it<00:05:28.090> up

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
your computer speakers but I pick it up

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.450 
your computer speakers but I pick it up
when<00:05:28.419> I<00:05:28.450> hear<00:05:28.780> myself<00:05:28.960> play<00:05:29.440> I<00:05:29.470> can<00:05:30.220> tell<00:05:30.370> the

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
when I hear myself play I can tell the

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.420 
when I hear myself play I can tell the
difference<00:05:30.580> between<00:05:30.850> this<00:05:34.800> I'm<00:05:35.800> sure<00:05:36.130> I<00:05:36.160> used

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
difference between this I'm sure I used

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:53.360 
difference between this I'm sure I used
to<00:05:36.550> do

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.060 

I<00:05:54.020> think<00:05:55.020> there's<00:05:55.199> a<00:05:55.290> big<00:05:55.470> difference<00:05:55.650> there

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
I think there's a big difference there

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.600 
I think there's a big difference there
in<00:05:56.220> terms<00:05:56.430> of<00:05:56.580> tone<00:05:56.910> that<00:05:57.270> it's<00:05:57.810> more<00:05:58.080> heavy

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
in terms of tone that it's more heavy

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.100 
in terms of tone that it's more heavy
than<00:05:59.610> new<00:06:00.120> to<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.330> new<00:06:00.540> and<00:06:00.810> be<00:06:00.900> sure<00:06:01.080> that

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
than new to the new and be sure that

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.750
