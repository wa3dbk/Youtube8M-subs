00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.850
 Today is again a recipe and wish 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.750
 Although of poly and consists of carrots 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.480
 and ruby mail 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.760
 yes, it even has the small one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.670
 simple and even two variants of it 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.640
 namely always sweet and one-sided and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.009
 yes, should be such a small thing 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.430
 which one can eat well to salad for 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.050
 example yes go off as I said two 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.820
 I want to do some variations 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.000
 two bowls in one 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.030
 with a relative entry a pretty 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.379
 great effort 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 this will be the salty variation 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.420
 That's why I have a little one now 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.840
 onion and I cut him 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.750
 really small cubes 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:09.750
 then there are 3 success families 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:14.580
 heaped and the spoon also shopping 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.920
 a half to 1 teaspoon of gum and a 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:24.689
 teaspoon salt you can already do that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:27.509
 little bit of stirring they hear everything 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.240
 a bit covered with rule 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.340
 in addition a cold water really comes 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.369
 sip by sip just a few 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.490
 tablespoon and that you know and after 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:44.189
 after the hand in the mass rows of 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.310
 So far, that was just a thing 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.649
 until two tablespoons similar and then has 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.829
 he gives you a little bit of water 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.689
 klebold is mushy and where she is 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.250
 Actually, I believe you first 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.509
 then aside, it's the sweet dough 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.890
 so once again a carrot however 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.100
 a small 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.310
 or stop 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.630
 except have a half listen again 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.330
 with the fine grater or still needs 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.160
 a small apple and the animal with 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.069
 the rougher grater you can 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.760
 just leave a whole piece and 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.180
 just always up to the housing in and out 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.300
 then turn the apple to come 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.040
 a bit sugar though about two 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.290
 teaspoon and half a teaspoon 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.989
 turmeric could do it now 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.560
 Stir in a little bit 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.980
 and then we come to the other three 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.450
 heaped tablespoon flour and a 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.600
 heaped tablespoon of flour 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.760
 that is very nice red and then comes 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.959
 again a tiny speaker about it now 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.489
 a little less than that 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.019
 other because the apple in any case 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.030
 a little more fluid is needed 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.630
 bit only until you were here 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.730
 easily capped max then he needs one 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.829
 coated pan and a bit 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.220
 rapeseed oil or lying when the oil is hot 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:18.880
 can you shape such little balls 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.390
 press a bit flat and easy 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.390
 contact the investigators 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.540
 so when I have already turned brown 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.630
 then it could take out already 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.570
 so and it goes to the sweet variant too 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.810
 again a bit of rapeseed oil or olive oil 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.300
 and then make little balls again 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.660
 Press flat and just put in the pan 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.660
 put 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.520
 they should not be that dark either 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.780
 So on it 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.220
 and as you said the salty ones you can 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.630
 I also do a good salad 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.670
 here's a bit of lamb's lettuce and 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.490
 salad leaves but basically you can 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:19.170
 any salad will take that 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:23.020
 People know are pretty tasty 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:26.980
 not too sweet and yes I think it is 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:41.460
 for in between always los albers 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:44.890
 ladder has sweet and salt worthy of him 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.430
 and said, because it is simply because so 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.740
 becker yes I'm great on this is for you 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.450
 and there is a little bit too late 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.270
 probably so far but without 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.530
 Ton, but I hope you look at it 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.300
 new anyway, the recipe was Prussian and 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.970
 yes we have other suggestions for you 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.580
 can you pay me as always payment cards 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.230
 write in the comments 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.660

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.660
