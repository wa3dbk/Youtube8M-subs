next it's the library has a really big
window<00:00:49.260> I'm<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> 1<00:00:50.910> by<00:00:51.090> 2<00:00:51.620> clear

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
window I'm going to get a 1 by 2 clear

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.319 
window I'm going to get a 1 by 2 clear
plate<00:00:53.270> put<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.390> right<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:57.230> then<00:00:59.000> two<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
plate put it right there and then two of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.230 
plate put it right there and then two of
these<00:01:02.449> see-through<00:01:03.449> clear<00:01:04.019> cheese<00:01:04.650> slopes

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.870 
these see-through clear cheese slopes
and<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.630> putting<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.880> facing

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and I'm going to be putting them facing

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.469 
and I'm going to be putting them facing
outward<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> should<00:01:12.360> be

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
outward like this so you should be

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
should be looking like this so far and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.130 
should be looking like this so far and
then<00:02:17.890> I'm<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.220> top<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.610> off<00:02:18.760> with<00:02:19.390> 2

jumper plates and I'll put them on the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.530 
jumper plates and I'll put them on the
two<00:02:23.620> ends<00:02:24.390> like<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.970> I'm<00:02:28.090> going<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.330> get

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
two ends like this then I'm going to get

so<00:02:40.570> you'll<00:02:40.810> be<00:02:41.020> looking<00:02:41.140> like<00:02:41.320> this<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.420> I'm

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
so you'll be looking like this and I'm

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.800 
so you'll be looking like this and I'm
going<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.750> set<00:02:43.990> this<00:02:44.110> aside<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.590> make<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.130> roof

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
going to set this aside to make the roof

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.630 
going to set this aside to make the roof
so<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.110> make<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.440> roof<00:02:47.620> I'm<00:02:47.860> going<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.070> get<00:02:48.220> two

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
so to make the roof I'm going to get two

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.800 
so to make the roof I'm going to get two
2<00:02:49.300> by<00:02:49.330> 3<00:02:49.480> plates<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:52.180> I'm<00:02:52.390> going<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.660> get

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
2 by 3 plates and then I'm going to get

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.250 
2 by 3 plates and then I'm going to get
a<00:02:53.080> 1<00:02:53.770> by<00:02:53.890> 3<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.460> didn't<00:02:54.790> have<00:02:55.000> one<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.810> dark

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
a 1 by 3 but I didn't have one in dark

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.220 
a 1 by 3 but I didn't have one in dark
tan<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:57.070> I'm<00:02:57.160> going<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.370> do<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.580> 1<00:02:57.820> by<00:02:57.970> 1<00:02:58.050> plate<00:02:59.050> in

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
tan so I'm going to do a 1 by 1 plate in

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.820 
tan so I'm going to do a 1 by 1 plate in
a<00:02:59.350> 1<00:02:59.500> by<00:02:59.650> 2<00:02:59.710> plate<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.630> then<00:03:01.630> place<00:03:01.990> those<00:03:02.440> two

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
a 1 by 2 plate and then place those two

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.620 
a 1 by 2 plate and then place those two
along<00:03:03.520> there<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.330> should<00:03:07.510> be

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
along there and then you should be

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.500 
along there and then you should be
looking<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:09.210> then<00:03:10.210> we're<00:03:10.330> going<00:03:10.450> to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
looking like this then we're going to

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.699 
looking like this then we're going to
get<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.930> 1<00:03:11.830> by<00:03:11.980> 4<00:03:12.010> plate<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.910> 1<00:03:13.840> by<00:03:13.990> 1<00:03:14.170> plate<00:03:14.470> in

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
get a 1 by 4 plate and 1 by 1 plate in

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.030 
get a 1 by 4 plate and 1 by 1 plate in
back<00:03:15.459> pan<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.690> I'm<00:03:16.750> just<00:03:16.870> going<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.380> set<00:03:17.830> those

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
back pan and I'm just going to set those

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.530 
back pan and I'm just going to set those
along<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.880> middle<00:03:19.239> right<00:03:19.570> there<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.360> this

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
along the middle right there so this

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.729 
along the middle right there so this
will<00:03:22.750> be<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.380> roof<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> library<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:25.739> then

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
will be the roof of the library and then

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.110 
will be the roof of the library and then
since<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.400> didn't<00:03:27.910> have<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.090> 1<00:03:28.390> by<00:03:28.540> 3<00:03:28.890> plate<00:03:30.120> I'm

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
since I didn't have a 1 by 3 plate I'm

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.590 
since I didn't have a 1 by 3 plate I'm
going<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.360> get<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.480> 1<00:03:31.750> by<00:03:31.900> 2<00:03:32.130> tile<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:34.239> put<00:03:34.450> that

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
going to get a 1 by 2 tile and put that

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.170 
going to get a 1 by 2 tile and put that
along<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.320> side<00:03:35.590> right<00:03:36.220> there<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.430> this

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
along the side right there so that this

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.100 
along the side right there so that this
one<00:03:40.540> can<00:03:41.350> attach<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:43.269> then<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:46.239> rest<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.840> that

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
one can attach and then the rest of that

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.070 
one can attach and then the rest of that
will<00:03:47.560> be<00:03:48.630> 1<00:03:49.630> by<00:03:49.780> 1<00:03:49.810> tiles<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:52.390> can<00:03:52.630> get<00:03:52.870> all

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
will be 1 by 1 tiles and you can get all

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.240 
will be 1 by 1 tiles and you can get all
of<00:03:53.140> these<00:03:53.590> pieces<00:03:54.239> from<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.750> village

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
of these pieces from the village

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.670 
of these pieces from the village
microworld<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:58.660> if<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.930> buy<00:03:59.110> another<00:03:59.380> one<00:03:59.620> you

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
microworld so if you buy another one you

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.759 
microworld so if you buy another one you
could<00:04:00.120> make<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.690> have<00:04:01.959> some<00:04:02.459> leftovers

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
could make this and have some leftovers

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.570 
could make this and have some leftovers
of<00:04:05.769> all<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.720> dark<00:04:07.720> tan<00:04:07.959> pieces<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.920> make<00:04:09.100> the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
of all the dark tan pieces to make the

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.750 
of all the dark tan pieces to make the
roofs<00:04:12.300> so<00:04:13.300> I'm<00:04:13.360> going<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.660> put<00:04:13.870> all<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:15.010> 1<00:04:15.370> by<00:04:15.519> 1

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
roofs so I'm going to put all the 1 by 1

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.840 
roofs so I'm going to put all the 1 by 1
tiles<00:04:16.120> on<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.630> side<00:04:17.290> right<00:04:17.500> there<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:18.729> then

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
tiles on the side right there so then

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.200 
tiles on the side right there so then
you<00:04:18.970> should<00:04:19.000> be<00:04:19.270> looking<00:04:19.450> like<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:21.210> then

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
you should be looking like this then

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.480 
you should be looking like this then
we're<00:04:22.330> going<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.479> get<00:04:22.630> another<00:04:23.080> 1<00:04:23.530> by<00:04:23.680> 4

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
we're going to get another 1 by 4

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.570 
we're going to get another 1 by 4
dark<00:04:24.669> tan<00:04:24.970> plate<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.569> put<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.500> across<00:04:26.710> the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
dark tan plate and put it across the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.830 
dark tan plate and put it across the
other<00:04:28.210> one<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.090> will<00:04:31.389> be<00:04:31.509> looking<00:04:31.780> like

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
other one so it will be looking like

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.890 
other one so it will be looking like
this<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:34.210> then<00:04:34.690> another<00:04:34.810> one<00:04:35.319> by<00:04:35.500> one<00:04:35.710> plate

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
this and then another one by one plate

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.890 
this and then another one by one plate
put<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:38.050> right<00:04:38.830> there<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:41.639> then<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:43.449> top<00:04:43.660> that

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
put it right there and then to top that

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.990 
put it right there and then to top that
off<00:04:43.960> put<00:04:44.650> 1<00:04:44.919> by<00:04:45.099> 1<00:04:45.569> tiles<00:04:47.039> all<00:04:48.039> along<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.759> top

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
off put 1 by 1 tiles all along the top

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.879 
off put 1 by 1 tiles all along the top
and<00:04:50.160> so<00:04:51.160> this<00:04:51.699> will<00:04:51.910> be<00:04:52.139> your<00:04:53.139> roof<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.770> your

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
and so this will be your roof to your

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.749 
and so this will be your roof to your
library<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:55.380> then<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.590> attach<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:57.280> roof<00:04:57.460> on

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
library and then to attach the roof on

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.110 
library and then to attach the roof on
to<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.449> onto<00:04:59.259> the<00:04:59.289> building<00:04:59.740> you<00:05:00.610> will<00:05:00.759> put

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
to the onto the building you will put

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.580 
to the onto the building you will put
the<00:05:01.570> jumper<00:05:02.320> plate<00:05:03.030> stud<00:05:04.139> right<00:05:05.139> in<00:05:05.380> the

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
the jumper plate stud right in the

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.390 
the jumper plate stud right in the
center<00:05:06.099> of<00:05:06.870> this<00:05:07.870> one<00:05:08.110> so<00:05:08.830> that<00:05:09.009> little

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
center of this one so that little

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.480 
center of this one so that little
crevice<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.660> guess<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.199> then<00:05:12.130> you're<00:05:12.280> going<00:05:12.370> to

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
crevice I guess and then you're going to

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.120 
crevice I guess and then you're going to
put<00:05:12.729> it<00:05:12.849> at<00:05:13.000> an<00:05:13.150> angle<00:05:13.740> right<00:05:14.740> in<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.919> middle

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
put it at an angle right in the middle

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.950 
put it at an angle right in the middle
so<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:16.840> be<00:05:16.990> looking<00:05:17.320> like<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:18.330> microworld<00:05:19.330> of

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
so to be looking like the microworld of

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.129 
so to be looking like the microworld of
the<00:05:20.289> village<00:05:20.650> won't<00:05:21.130> houses<00:05:21.840> be<00:05:22.840> looking<00:05:23.110> like

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139
