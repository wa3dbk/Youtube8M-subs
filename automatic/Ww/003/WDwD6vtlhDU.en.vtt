00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
this goes into the pocketwizard unit and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
this goes into the pocketwizard unit and
this<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.600> no<00:01:33.810> idea<00:01:33.900> what<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.470> so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
this one I have no idea what is it so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039

stereo<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.460> stereo<00:01:35.820> jack<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> i<00:01:36.659> believe

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
stereo two stereo jack and i believe

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
stereo two stereo jack and i believe
this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.439> Met<00:01:37.979> adapter<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.670> stereo

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
this is the Met adapter for that stereo

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.140 
this is the Met adapter for that stereo
jack<00:01:39.680> down<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.890> side<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.520> also<00:01:41.640> comes<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240 
jack down the side it also comes with a
little<00:01:42.420> yet<00:01:42.810> lanyard<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.890> pocketwizard

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
little yet lanyard for the pocketwizard

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.469 
little yet lanyard for the pocketwizard
which<00:01:44.909> i<00:01:45.090> assume<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.820> here

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.020 

I'm<00:01:51.479> gonna<00:01:51.600> put<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> Box<00:01:52.110> away

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.020 

so<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:57.560> seems<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.190> be<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.340> majority<00:01:58.909> of<00:01:58.940> the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
so that seems to be the majority of the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.820 
so that seems to be the majority of the
hardware<00:01:59.299> that<00:01:59.510> comes<00:01:59.659> with<00:01:59.869> it<00:01:59.900> other<00:02:00.650> stuff

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
hardware that comes with it other stuff

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.420 
hardware that comes with it other stuff
is<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.100> pocketwizard<00:02:01.430> guide<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:02.180> comes<00:02:02.210> in

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
is the pocketwizard guide that comes in

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
transceiver modes so let's test it out

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.620 
transceiver modes so let's test it out
real<00:03:27.440> quick<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:28.430> guy<00:03:28.640> is<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.570> go<00:03:29.950> and

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.509 
we're going to test it one thing that
I've<00:03:35.840> found<00:03:36.140> interesting<00:03:36.709> about<00:03:36.980> this<00:03:37.310> was

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
I've found interesting about this was

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.150

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
have a super crazy range of believe it's

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.530 
have a super crazy range of believe it's
like<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:43.100> thousand<00:03:43.700> yards<00:03:44.060> or<00:03:44.180> something<00:03:44.480> like

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
that but when they're up really close

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.610

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.250 
sometimes it misfires when I was
literally<00:03:48.890> holding<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.400> next<00:03:49.609> to<00:03:49.730> each<00:03:49.850> other

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
literally holding it next to each other

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.630 
literally holding it next to each other
as<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.410> can<00:03:51.500> see<00:03:51.650> sometimes<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.220> just<00:03:52.459> doesn't

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
as you can see sometimes it just doesn't

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.390 
as you can see sometimes it just doesn't
fire<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:53.930> don't<00:03:54.109> know<00:03:54.350> what<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.769> technical

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
fire and I don't know what the technical

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.099 
fire and I don't know what the technical
reason<00:03:55.820> for<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.329> if<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.600> guys<00:03:56.810> actually

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
reason for that is if you guys actually

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.199 
reason for that is if you guys actually
know<00:03:57.440> what<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.859> is<00:03:57.890> please<00:03:58.640> feel<00:03:58.850> free<00:03:58.910> to

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
know what that is please feel free to

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.490 
know what that is please feel free to
let<00:03:59.329> me<00:03:59.390> know<00:03:59.510> within<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.959> comment<00:04:00.320> but<00:04:00.470> I

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
let me know within the comment but I

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.390 
let me know within the comment but I
just<00:04:00.739> thought<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:00.950> was<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.220> pretty

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
just thought that was a pretty

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.340 
just thought that was a pretty
interesting<00:04:01.640> thing<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.150> note<00:04:02.269> once<00:04:03.079> you<00:04:03.170> pull

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
interesting thing to note once you pull

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.809 
interesting thing to note once you pull
it<00:04:03.470> slightly<00:04:03.769> further<00:04:04.159> away<00:04:04.340> from<00:04:04.400> each<00:04:04.700> other

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
it slightly further away from each other

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.210 
it slightly further away from each other
it<00:04:05.180> pops<00:04:05.569> pretty<00:04:05.900> reliably<00:04:06.440> but<00:04:06.769> yeah<00:04:06.980> when<00:04:07.190> I

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
it pops pretty reliably but yeah when I

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.590 
it pops pretty reliably but yeah when I
get<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:07.550> up<00:04:07.700> close<00:04:07.940> as<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.480> can<00:04:08.599> see<00:04:08.840> for<00:04:09.140> some

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
get it up close as you can see for some

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.120 
get it up close as you can see for some
it's<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:09.930> not<00:04:09.990> popular<00:04:10.290> that's<00:04:10.620> pretty<00:04:10.980> much

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
it's just not popular that's pretty much

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.090 
it's just not popular that's pretty much
it<00:04:11.190> for<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:12.360> pocketwizard<00:04:13.020> plus<00:04:13.620> 3<00:04:13.920> unboxing
