like a storyline and it feels way too

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.909 
like a storyline and it feels way too
much<00:04:24.539> like<00:04:24.720> something<00:04:24.930> that's<00:04:25.050> fake<00:04:25.289> you<00:04:25.770> mean

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
much like something that's fake you mean

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.650 
much like something that's fake you mean
we<00:04:26.039> all<00:04:26.160> know<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.430> these<00:04:26.789> are

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
we all know that these are

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.660 
we all know that these are
determined<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.380> scripted<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.310> whatever<00:04:29.550> but

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
determined and scripted and whatever but

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.330 
determined and scripted and whatever but
just<00:04:29.820> seems<00:04:30.210> fake<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:30.930> I<00:04:31.170> think<00:04:32.040> it's<00:04:32.160> one<00:04:32.280> of

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
just seems fake and I think it's one of

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.530 
just seems fake and I think it's one of
the<00:04:32.430> reasons<00:04:32.520> why<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:32.850> fans<00:04:33.150> haven't<00:04:33.390> gotten

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540

behind Daniel Bryan as much lately

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.830

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
because they're infusing too much

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.420 
because they're infusing too much
storyline<00:04:37.380> as<00:04:37.560> opposed<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.100> real<00:04:38.250> life
