which I feel you know in a dark

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.099 
which I feel you know in a dark
situation<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> works<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.059> fine<00:00:59.960> it's<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
situation it works just fine it's a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.899 
situation it works just fine it's a
really<00:01:01.890> neat<00:01:02.280> watch<00:01:03.619> it<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.799> got<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> bunch

really neat watch it just got so a bunch

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.859 
really neat watch it just got so a bunch
of<00:01:06.030> functions<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.110> track<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.950> mean<00:01:08.869> pretty

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
of functions it can track I mean pretty

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.390 
of functions it can track I mean pretty
much<00:01:09.990> everything<00:01:10.650> gives<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
much everything gives you the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.740 
much everything gives you the

fairly<00:01:23.540> level<00:01:24.190> but<00:01:25.190> it<00:01:25.310> seems<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.729> work<00:01:25.940> great

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
fairly level but it seems to work great

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.790 
fairly level but it seems to work great
i've<00:01:26.479> heard<00:01:26.659> people<00:01:26.690> say<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.350> doesn't<00:01:27.409> really

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
think it's a great watch I mean it's

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.479 
think it's a great watch I mean it's
real<00:03:24.950> solid<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:26.690> only<00:03:26.840> its<00:03:27.140> water

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
real solid it's only its water

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.250 
real solid it's only its water
waterproof<00:03:28.489> up<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:29.239> think<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.930> hundred

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
waterproof up to I think it's a hundred

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.550 
waterproof up to I think it's a hundred
feet<00:03:30.350> or<00:03:30.890> something<00:03:31.310> like<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.520> but<00:03:32.560> that's

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
feet or something like that but that's

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.220 
feet or something like that but that's
fine<00:03:33.890> for<00:03:33.950> me<00:03:34.400> i'm<00:03:34.700> not<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:34.940> diver<00:03:35.330> or<00:03:35.840> anything

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
fine for me i'm not a diver or anything

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.490 
fine for me i'm not a diver or anything
like<00:03:36.260> that<00:03:36.470> so<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:40.700> is<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.970> all<00:03:41.120> black<00:03:41.510> they

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
like that so this is the all black they

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.860 
like that so this is the all black they
call<00:03:42.770> it<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.010> military<00:03:43.220> version<00:03:44.150> i<00:03:44.360> don't

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
call it the military version i don't

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.830 
call it the military version i don't
know<00:03:44.989> why<00:03:45.200> i<00:03:46.209> guess<00:03:47.209> just<00:03:47.360> because<00:03:47.510> it's<00:03:47.720> all

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
know why i guess just because it's all

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.220

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
looks too terrible the clasp is pretty

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.180 
looks too terrible the clasp is pretty
neat<00:04:42.240> it<00:04:43.240> actually<00:04:43.389> has<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.870> little<00:04:44.500> too<00:04:44.860> thin

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
neat it actually has a little too thin

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.020 
neat it actually has a little too thin
side<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.639> their<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:47.560> once<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.280> get<00:04:48.699> it<00:04:48.850> into

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
side of their that once you get it into

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.800 
side of their that once you get it into
the<00:04:49.360> groove<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:50.560> actually<00:04:50.949> grabs<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.810> like

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
the groove it actually grabs it like

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.110 
the groove it actually grabs it like
locks<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.350> in<00:04:53.500> so<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.919> doesn't<00:04:54.280> won't<00:04:54.850> just

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
locks it in so it doesn't won't just

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.570 
locks it in so it doesn't won't just
pull<00:04:55.330> out
