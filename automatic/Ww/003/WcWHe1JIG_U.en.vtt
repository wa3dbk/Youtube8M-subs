00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
go something like a crash washer are

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
go something like a crash washer are
through<00:00:32.309> c3<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> love<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.600> I

through c3 but do you love it but I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.970 
through c3 but do you love it but I
don't<00:00:33.719> think<00:00:33.840> mine<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.140> working<00:00:34.290> right<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.770> can

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
don't think mine is working right I can

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.350 
don't think mine is working right I can
record<00:00:35.219> something<00:00:35.489> clean<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.880> my<00:00:35.940> amp<00:00:36.120> then

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
record something clean in my amp then

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.880 
record something clean in my amp then
when<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> change<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.930> dirty<00:00:37.200> everything

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
when I change it to dirty everything

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.180 
when I change it to dirty everything
gets<00:00:38.160> distorted<00:00:38.460> what's<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.360> well

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
gets distorted what's going on well

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.100 
gets distorted what's going on well
basically<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:41.520> you're<00:00:41.640> doing<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.719> way<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
basically what you're doing the way the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.720 
basically what you're doing the way the
guitar<00:00:43.170> system<00:00:43.620> set<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.399> when<00:00:44.579> you're

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
guitar system set up but when you're

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.630 
guitar system set up but when you're
doing<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.090> you're<00:00:45.510> playing<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.930> guitar<00:00:46.640> into

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
doing that you're playing a guitar into

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
doing that you're playing a guitar into
the<00:00:48.539> pedal<00:00:48.899> which<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.350> pointing<00:00:49.559> into<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the pedal which are pointing into the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
the pedal which are pointing into the
front<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> amp<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.520> anything<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> change

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
front of the amp so anything you change

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840 
front of the amp so anything you change
on<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.559> amp<00:00:52.739> any<00:00:53.070> settings<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.610> had<00:00:53.730> any

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
on the amp any settings have you had any

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.490 
on the amp any settings have you had any
effects<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
effects or you have that it's going to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.540 
effects or you have that it's going to
change<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> sound<00:00:56.039> that's<00:00:56.100> coming<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
change the sound that's coming out of

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
change the sound that's coming out of
the<00:00:56.610> looper<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.480> an<00:00:57.600> ABC<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the looper so it's like an ABC with the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
the looper so it's like an ABC with the
Loop<00:00:58.920> Station<00:00:59.129> being<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> middle<00:00:59.879> so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
Loop Station being in the middle so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.910 
Loop Station being in the middle so
that's<00:01:00.570> why<00:01:00.750> that's<00:01:00.930> happening<00:01:01.350> there<00:01:01.590> but

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
that's why that's happening there but

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.080 
that's why that's happening there but
there<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.070> two<00:01:02.280> ways<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.789> sort<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
there are two ways you can sort of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
there are two ways you can sort of
combat<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.350> clean<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
combat this if you want to do clean and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.550 
combat this if you want to do clean and
dirty<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.760> lean<00:01:05.970> sounds<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.479> whatever<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
dirty or do lean sounds or whatever the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.160 
dirty or do lean sounds or whatever the
first<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:08.070> it'd<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> most<00:01:09.170> convenient

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
first way it'd be the most convenient

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.899 
first way it'd be the most convenient
way<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.710> some<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.340> guys<00:01:11.430> who<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.760> use

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
way for some of you guys who want to use

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
way for some of you guys who want to use
channel<00:01:12.240> switching<00:01:12.540> amps<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.960> using<00:01:13.530> your

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
channel switching amps is using your

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.420 
channel switching amps is using your
effects<00:01:14.100> loop<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.390> use<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.350> mass<00:01:17.070> 8

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
effects loop so I use a little mass 8

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.210 
effects loop so I use a little mass 8
from<00:01:17.729> dr.<00:01:18.090> Z<00:01:18.630> amps<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.619> does<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.100> an

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
from dr. Z amps and it does have an

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
from dr. Z amps and it does have an
effects<00:01:20.490> loop<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> back<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.140> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
effects loop on the back here so as you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.859 
effects loop on the back here so as you
can<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.560> plugged<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> RC<00:01:24.000> 2<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
can see I plugged the RC 2 into that and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
can see I plugged the RC 2 into that and
while<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.740> isn't<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.979> channel<00:01:26.280> switching<00:01:26.580> amp

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
while this isn't a channel switching amp

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.850 
while this isn't a channel switching amp
I<00:01:26.939> am<00:01:27.240> able<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> sort<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.049> use<00:01:28.140> my<00:01:28.259> volume<00:01:28.680> knob

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
I am able to sort of use my volume knob

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.130 
I am able to sort of use my volume knob
to<00:01:29.549> change<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.420> sort<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> clean<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
to change the sort of the clean and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.990 
to change the sort of the clean and
dirty<00:01:31.259> textures<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
dirty textures of that so that's the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.160 
dirty textures of that so that's the
easiest<00:01:33.240> thing<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.659> plug<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:33.990> Loop

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
easiest thing just plug your Loop

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.319 
easiest thing just plug your Loop
Station<00:01:34.380> into<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.549> effects<00:01:35.850> loop<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
Station into your effects loop and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.330 
Station into your effects loop and
because<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> way<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.290> amps<00:01:37.650> work<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
because of the way that amps work the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.230 
because of the way that amps work the
effects<00:01:38.970> loop<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:40.020> usually<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.590> after<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
effects loop is usually in after in a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.289 
effects loop is usually in after in a
circuit<00:01:42.570> after<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:44.640> preamp<00:01:45.060> which<00:01:45.210> is

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
circuit after the the preamp which is

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.910 
circuit after the the preamp which is
where<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.540> gain<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> coming<00:01:46.320> from<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
where all your gain is coming from so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.020 
where all your gain is coming from so
plug<00:01:47.070> into<00:01:47.189> your<00:01:47.280> effects<00:01:47.520> loop<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.850> should

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
plug into your effects loop you should

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.780 
plug into your effects loop you should
have<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> problem<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:49.140> easier<00:01:50.009> still<00:01:50.340> if

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
have a problem there or easier still if

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
have a problem there or easier still if
you<00:01:50.939> guys<00:01:51.149> are<00:01:51.299> using<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.540> clean<00:01:51.840> kind<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.200> amp

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you guys are using a clean kind of amp

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.139 
you guys are using a clean kind of amp
as<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> platform<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.310> pedals<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.820> things<00:01:54.030> like

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
as a platform for pedals and things like

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
as a platform for pedals and things like
that<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:55.079> plug<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> store<00:01:55.740> ssin<00:01:55.890> pedals

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
that just plug in the store ssin pedals

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.580 
that just plug in the store ssin pedals
in<00:01:56.280> before<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.969> turn<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.439> your

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
in before that turn it on for your

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.410 
in before that turn it on for your
leaves<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:59.159> your<00:01:59.280> heavier<00:01:59.579> rhythm<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.299> your

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
leaves for your heavier rhythm for your

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.719 
leaves for your heavier rhythm for your
gain<00:02:00.630> whatever<00:02:00.899> turn<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.590> off<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:02.040> claims<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
gain whatever turn it off for claims and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.789 
gain whatever turn it off for claims and
that's<00:02:02.880> kind<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> easiest<00:02:03.540> way<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.799> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that's kind of the easiest way to to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.469 
that's kind of the easiest way to to
have<00:02:04.950> both<00:02:05.100> clean<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.430> dirty<00:02:05.729> while<00:02:06.090> using<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
have both clean and dirty while using a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.270 
have both clean and dirty while using a
loop<00:02:06.630> station<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.590> hope<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.129> video

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
loop station so I hope this video

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
loop station so I hope this video
answers<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.789> question<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.420> realize<00:02:09.989> this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
answers that question I realize this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.199 
answers that question I realize this
isn't<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.440> apply<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> everybody<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:12.000> at

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
isn't going to apply to everybody but at

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.870 
isn't going to apply to everybody but at
the<00:02:12.270> same<00:02:12.420> time

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the same time

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.810 
the same time
I<00:02:13.210> get<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.600> question<00:02:13.930> more<00:02:14.230> times<00:02:14.760> than<00:02:15.760> I

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
I get this question more times than I

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.260 
I get this question more times than I
can<00:02:15.940> count<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.470> that's<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.860> happy<00:02:18.580> 2013

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
can count so so that's that happy 2013

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.760 
can count so so that's that happy 2013
hopefully<00:02:19.750> do<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> lot<00:02:20.020> more<00:02:20.170> videos<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.620> here

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
hopefully do a lot more videos is here

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.930 
hopefully do a lot more videos is here
on<00:02:20.860> pedals<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.280> stuff<00:02:21.400> like<00:02:21.550> that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
on pedals and stuff like that

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.970 
on pedals and stuff like that
this<00:02:22.690> one's<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> first<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.440> hope<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.830> have<00:02:23.920> a
