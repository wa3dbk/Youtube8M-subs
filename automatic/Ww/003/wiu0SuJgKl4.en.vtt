00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460 

um<00:00:01.700> g1<00:00:02.700> Megatron<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.510> did<00:00:03.780> improve<00:00:04.080> him<00:00:04.290> though

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
um g1 Megatron I did improve him though

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.780 
um g1 Megatron I did improve him though
as<00:00:04.859> for<00:00:05.460> using<00:00:06.080> this<00:00:07.080> part<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.560> hook<00:00:07.830> up<00:00:08.490> gun

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
as for using this part to hook up gun

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.030 
as for using this part to hook up gun
piece<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:09.420> not<00:00:09.510> completely<00:00:10.040> attached

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
piece on so it's not completely attached

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.470 
piece on so it's not completely attached
on<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.550> way<00:00:11.730> when<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.300> take<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.660> off<00:00:13.160> um

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
on so that way when you take it off um

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.700 
on so that way when you take it off um
pieces<00:00:15.480> don't<00:00:15.750> cut<00:00:16.320> off<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.770> yeah<00:00:17.449> yeah<00:00:18.710> he

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
pieces don't cut off so yeah yeah he

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.040 
pieces don't cut off so yeah yeah he
same<00:00:19.920> height<00:00:20.330> he<00:00:21.330> has<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> different<00:00:21.810> kind<00:00:21.960> of

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
same height he has a different kind of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.120 
same height he has a different kind of
trigger<00:00:22.320> though<00:00:23.029> mm<00:00:24.109> shorter<00:00:25.109> then<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.010> will

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
trigger though mm shorter then you will

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.769 
trigger though mm shorter then you will
Megatron<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:26.760> because<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> extra

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
Megatron just because of the extra

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.900 
Megatron just because of the extra
silent<00:00:28.380> sets<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.250> make<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> science<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
silent sets if you make the science a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.030 
silent sets if you make the science a
little<00:00:30.179> shorter<00:00:31.040> he<00:00:32.040> would<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:33.059> as

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
little shorter he would actually be as

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.040 
little shorter he would actually be as
long<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.940> want<00:00:36.149> Megatron<00:00:36.570> even<00:00:36.809> longer

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
long as if you want Megatron even longer

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.830 
long as if you want Megatron even longer
because<00:00:37.380> Joe<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.950> Megatron<00:00:38.399> has<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.850> stock

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
because Joe and Megatron has the stock

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.250 
because Joe and Megatron has the stock
so<00:00:40.140> yeah<00:00:40.610> okay<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.879> haven't<00:00:42.750> found<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.079> use<00:00:43.230> for

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so yeah okay I haven't found a use for

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.420 
so yeah okay I haven't found a use for
this<00:00:43.610> part<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.090> top<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.510> him<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.100> yeah<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
this part that on top of him but yeah I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.400 
this part that on top of him but yeah I
put<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> little<00:00:48.239> red<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.140> I

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
put a little red here just because I

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.860 
put a little red here just because I
needed<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.829> hinge<00:00:50.070> piece<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> sorry<00:00:51.660> about

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
needed the hinge piece so sorry about

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.930 
needed the hinge piece so sorry about
that<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:53.059> yeah<00:00:56.120> I'm<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.710> see<00:00:58.920> two<00:00:59.129> things

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that but yeah I'm you can see two things

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.170 
that but yeah I'm you can see two things
in<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.469> arm<00:01:02.000> well<00:01:03.000> from

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
in there the one on the arm well from

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.560 
in there the one on the arm well from
the<00:01:03.300> youtubes<00:01:03.600> perspective<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> right

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
the youtubes perspective on the right

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.000 
the youtubes perspective on the right
right<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> grey<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.530> supposed<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
right there the grey one is supposed to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.429 
right there the grey one is supposed to
be<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.850> hand<00:01:09.090> part<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.869> black<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
be on the hand part and the black is

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.200 
be on the hand part and the black is
supposed<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> gun<00:01:11.310> part<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.790> think

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
supposed to be the gun part I think

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.090 
supposed to be the gun part I think
there<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.780> handing<00:01:13.500> gun<00:01:13.710> part<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.159> yeah

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
there was like handing gun part but yeah

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.800 
there was like handing gun part but yeah
so<00:01:18.979> put<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> toy<00:01:20.850> yellow<00:01:21.060> dots<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> don't

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so put the toy yellow dots there I don't

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
so put the toy yellow dots there I don't
know<00:01:22.020> why<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:23.869> yeah<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:25.890> course<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.400> can

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
know why and yeah of course so I can

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.219 
know why and yeah of course so I can
flop<00:01:26.939> about<00:01:27.210> loosely<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> hold

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
flop about loosely if you have to hold

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.590 
flop about loosely if you have to hold
them<00:01:28.470> together<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.549> they<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.850> fall<00:01:30.180> apart

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.590 

and<00:01:33.600> yeah<00:01:34.130> first<00:01:36.409> take<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.560> part<00:01:37.829> off<00:01:38.600> wait

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and yeah first take this part off wait

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.319 
and yeah first take this part off wait
here<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.320> haven't<00:01:41.189> found<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.520> use<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.060> part

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
here I haven't found a use for this part

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.639 
here I haven't found a use for this part
yet<00:01:42.540> though<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.140> when<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.220> put<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:44.670> on

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
yet though and when you put it back on

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.340 
yet though and when you put it back on
it's<00:01:46.649> kind<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.189> impossible<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.229> have

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it's kind of impossible to so you have

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's kind of impossible to so you have
to<00:01:49.500> take<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.920> part<00:01:50.220> off<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.659> then<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to take this part off and then put it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.700 
to take this part off and then put it
back<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:53.369> timing<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.810> then<00:01:55.140> put<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> like

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
back in on timing and then put it like

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.389 
back in on timing and then put it like
this<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.829> yeah<00:01:58.979> first<00:01:59.280> take<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.670> part<00:01:59.850> off

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
this so yeah first take that part off

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
this so yeah first take that part off
now<00:02:02.630> put<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.780> legs<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:05.960> flip<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.350> arms<00:02:07.680> down

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.440 

that's<00:02:11.370> where<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.549> met<00:02:11.579> by<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> little<00:02:12.120> purple

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
that's where I met by a little purple

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.750 
that's where I met by a little purple
there<00:02:13.340> flip<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.549> head<00:02:14.760> up<00:02:14.909> and<00:02:15.709> done<00:02:17.390> here<00:02:18.390> is

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
there flip the head up and done here is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.569 
there flip the head up and done here is
g1<00:02:20.760> shockwave<00:02:21.719> and<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.920> know<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.250> head<00:02:23.400> has

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
g1 shockwave and you know the head has

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.979 
g1 shockwave and you know the head has
like<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> black<00:02:24.120> part<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.629> then<00:02:24.689> there's<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
like a black part and then there's a

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.349 
like a black part and then there's a
yellow<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.469> in<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.859> mail<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.310> yeah<00:02:26.430> let's<00:02:27.180> try

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
yellow I in the mail so yeah let's try

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.220 
yellow I in the mail so yeah let's try
to<00:02:27.420> indicate<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.930> i<00:02:28.319> made<00:02:28.650> these<00:02:28.859> two<00:02:30.230> these

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
to indicate that i made these two these

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.250 
to indicate that i made these two these
lights<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.829> I<00:02:31.859> don't<00:02:32.159> know<00:02:32.250> why<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
lights here I don't know why the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.369 
lights here I don't know why the
articulation<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.099> legs<00:02:36.079> first<00:02:37.079> turn<00:02:37.799> move

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
articulation the legs first turn move

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.140 
articulation the legs first turn move
like<00:02:40.379> that<00:02:40.579> articulating<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.730> arms<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.090> little

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
like that articulating the arms a little

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.940 
like that articulating the arms a little
more<00:02:42.540> dis<00:02:43.970> dis<00:02:45.409> so<00:02:46.409> with<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> other<00:02:46.769> our

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
more dis dis so with the other our

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.129 
more dis dis so with the other our
market<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.849> head<00:02:48.060> can't<00:02:48.780> move<00:02:48.959> any

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
market in the head can't move any

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.339 
market in the head can't move any
forward<00:02:49.709> but<00:02:50.180> can<00:02:51.180> move<00:02:51.389> backwards<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:52.079> a

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
forward but can move backwards like a

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.339 
forward but can move backwards like a
little<00:02:52.620> more<00:02:52.769> than<00:02:52.950> 90<00:02:53.310> degrees<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:55.019> um<00:02:56.120> yeah

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
little more than 90 degrees so um yeah

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.520 
little more than 90 degrees so um yeah
but<00:02:58.349> we'll<00:02:58.530> find<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.919> use<00:02:59.129> for<00:02:59.159> this<00:02:59.730> I<00:03:00.530> was

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
but we'll find a use for this I was

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.429 
but we'll find a use for this I was
hoping<00:03:03.230> can<00:03:04.230> like<00:03:07.099> mmm<00:03:08.810> attach<00:03:09.810> onto<00:03:10.079> his<00:03:10.260> arm

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
hoping can like mmm attach onto his arm

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
the recording found a use for it but as

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.990 
the recording found a use for it but as
you<00:03:46.169> have<00:03:46.290> seen<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.889> don't<00:03:47.400> know<00:03:47.489> if<00:03:47.639> it's<00:03:47.790> used

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
you have seen I don't know if it's used

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.080 
you have seen I don't know if it's used
in<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.720> toy<00:03:48.959> as<00:03:49.349> something<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.099> gree<00:03:50.699> bit<00:03:50.729> but

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
in the toy as something the gree bit but

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.929 
in the toy as something the gree bit but
aged<00:03:51.329> as<00:03:51.629> his<00:03:51.840> cannon<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:53.159> then<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.549> makes<00:03:53.729> his

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
aged as his cannon but then it makes his

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.050 
aged as his cannon but then it makes his
articulation<00:03:54.269> shorter<00:03:54.989> only<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:56.060> so

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
articulation shorter only like this so

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.330 
articulation shorter only like this so
yeah<00:03:57.180> that's<00:03:57.329> really<00:03:57.599> lame<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:59.069> it's

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
yeah that's really lame and it's

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.199 
yeah that's really lame and it's
attached<00:03:59.669> by<00:03:59.879> this<00:04:00.259> hopefully<00:04:01.579> it's<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.819> lot<00:04:03.000> to

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
attached by this hopefully it's a lot to

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.640 
attached by this hopefully it's a lot to
do<00:04:03.359> that<00:04:03.629> it<00:04:04.139> so<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.560> way<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:06.060> won't<00:04:06.500> get<00:04:07.500> in

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
do that it so that way it won't get in

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.210 
do that it so that way it won't get in
the<00:04:07.680> way<00:04:07.769> when<00:04:07.919> it<00:04:08.189> transforms<00:04:08.729> but<00:04:09.030> yeah<00:04:09.650> um

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220
