the<00:03:07.360> time<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:08.319> college<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:08.799> had<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.980> use

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
the time and in college I had to use

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.270 
the time and in college I had to use
avid<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.849> lot<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.810> I'm<00:03:10.959> pretty<00:03:11.290> efficient<00:03:12.160> in

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
avid a lot so I'm pretty efficient in

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.190 
avid a lot so I'm pretty efficient in
both<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.579> those<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:13.150> I'm<00:03:13.269> not<00:03:13.450> very<00:03:13.810> efficient

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
both of those but I'm not very efficient

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.840 
both of those but I'm not very efficient
in<00:03:14.350> Premiere<00:03:14.829> so<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.250> first<00:03:15.430> thing<00:03:15.519> I<00:03:15.579> did<00:03:15.730> was

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
in Premiere so the first thing I did was

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
in Premiere so the first thing I did was
actually<00:03:16.000> change<00:03:16.390> all<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.630> keyboard

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
actually change all the keyboard

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.720 
actually change all the keyboard
shortcuts<00:03:17.140> over<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.160> same<00:03:18.340> things<00:03:18.579> they

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
shortcuts over to the same things they

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.900 
shortcuts over to the same things they
are<00:03:18.760> into<00:03:19.299> Final<00:03:19.900> Cut<00:03:20.079> but<00:03:20.560> just<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.549> programs

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
are into Final Cut but just the programs

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.449 
are into Final Cut but just the programs
just<00:03:22.150> laid<00:03:22.329> out<00:03:22.359> differently<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.140> it's<00:03:23.459> it's

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
just laid out differently and it's it's

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.819 
just laid out differently and it's it's
really<00:03:24.760> hard<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.390> used<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:26.019> mean

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
really hard to get used to I mean

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.430 
really hard to get used to I mean
there's<00:03:27.040> there's<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.340> few<00:03:27.730> aspects<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.440> like

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
there's there's a few aspects I like

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.670 
there's there's a few aspects I like
about<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.400> but<00:03:31.269> most<00:03:31.630> of<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.019> just<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.470> don't

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
about it but most of it I just I don't

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.000 
about it but most of it I just I don't
like<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.970> just<00:03:34.600> really<00:03:34.959> miss<00:03:35.139> Final<00:03:35.560> Cut<00:03:35.650> and

like I just really miss Final Cut and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.039 
like I just really miss Final Cut and
it's<00:03:36.130> really<00:03:36.549> hard<00:03:36.850> adjusting<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.630> something

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
it's really hard adjusting to something

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.379 
it's really hard adjusting to something
that<00:03:38.079> you're<00:03:38.500> just<00:03:38.560> not<00:03:38.859> used<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.310> anyway<00:03:40.060> it

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389
