00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.580
 ah 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.190
 ah 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.300
 at this year's Frankfurt show 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.279
 Massa presented his mass 3 and now we have 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.820
 the ability to drive and see 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.820
 how does it behave 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.160
 everything in it is new and even some of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.450
 its characteristics do not get used to 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.460
 see in this segment 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.590
 The new kodo design line is 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.080
 really very striking and tonality 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.480
 of the red of the test car from beyond 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.780
 more red and metallic is really 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.780
 beautiful 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.370
 although not only for that reason the mazda3 calls 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.350
 the attention as soon as we take them out to the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.360
 street but also because they have the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.230
 proportions of the boxster with a butt 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.420
 short but strong and a more elongated bonnet 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.190
 in the first tests around the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.620
 city ​​of barcelona we realize 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.070
 its agility this is because that new 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.380
 70 kilos lighter mazda3 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.120
 the gearshift is really smooth 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.620
 and precise as well as the transmission 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.210
 direct allows a greater 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.850
 sensitivity in driving 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.920
 the chassis with the skyactiv system 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 shows especially comfortable besides 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.220
 present little lateral tilt has 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.220
 even sports capabilities 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.500
 the design of the new mazda3 is based on 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.690
 same as the largest more than six in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.790
 the only one with the typical grill of 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.200
 mazda with chromed cross pieces 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.500
 that extend to the inside of 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.500
 headlights 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.229
 the characteristic arcs of the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.420
 body the long hood and cabin 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.759
 slightly oriented backwards like this 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.710
 as the rear window closer you 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.810
 give this car a pretty silhouette 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.850
 sporty 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.979
 this also helps the lines 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.599
 more active laterals that join the 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.780
 height of door handles 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.780
 front 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.370
 the back is more modern and 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.439
 remember two of the crossover models of 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.439
 they are fashionable these days 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.670
 the boot with 364 liters of volume 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.410
 which is larger and has a 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.980
 Loading surface almost completely 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.980
 flat 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.810
 in the cabin everything is in place 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.239
 indicated 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.190
 adore more important is the screen of 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.020
 7 inches in the center of the console 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.370
 with which systems are controlled 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.370
 information and entertainment 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.700
 the shark's fin on the roof is no more 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.580
 that the gps antenna just to clarify 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.020
 the doubts about the engines 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.300
 the model they see on the screen is 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.740
 equipped with one of 165 horses 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.600
 force 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.000
 all include as standard 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.620
 skyactiv technology and top models 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.300
 they also include a system of 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.300
 recovery of braking energy 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.420
 the Japanese have been especially 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.070
 productive with the new model and have 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.170
 the same distance between the axes of the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.790
 previous version but now it has also 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.100
 raised its height a centimeter and a half 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.210
 more what will surely be grateful 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.580
 by the highest passengers 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.460
 the prices at least in the market 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.870
 European will continue as until now 17 thousand 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.870
 euros for the most basic version 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:58.030
