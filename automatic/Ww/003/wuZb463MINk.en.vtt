hard to believe in such a journey until

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.820 
hard to believe in such a journey until
you<00:02:54.730> see<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.090> pilots<00:02:55.570> harnessing<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.380> energy

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
you see the pilots harnessing the energy

you see the pilots harnessing the energy
in<00:02:56.980> our<00:02:57.070> atmosphere

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
in our atmosphere

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.310 
in our atmosphere
it's<00:02:58.690> just<00:02:58.870> already<00:02:59.739> dozens<00:03:00.280> right<00:03:00.550> above<00:03:00.760> us

it's just already dozens right above us

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.170 
it's just already dozens right above us
but<00:03:02.320> there<00:03:02.500> wasn't<00:03:02.650> much<00:03:02.860> time<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.550> wonder<00:03:03.940> or

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
but there wasn't much time to wonder or

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.540 
but there wasn't much time to wonder or
worry<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:05.050> had<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.890> get<00:03:06.010> ready<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.340> launch

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550
