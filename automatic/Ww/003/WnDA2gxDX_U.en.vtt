thick<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:36.880> has<00:04:37.000> got<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.180> good<00:04:37.450> flavor<00:04:39.510> so<00:04:40.510> try

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
thick this has got a good flavor so try

thick this has got a good flavor so try
this<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:41.380> might<00:04:41.560> still<00:04:41.710> see<00:04:41.890> supersymmetry

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
this you might still see supersymmetry

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.970 
this you might still see supersymmetry

yourself<00:04:49.720> get<00:04:50.650> some<00:04:50.830> parsley<00:04:51.220> maybe<00:04:52.120> even

yourself get some parsley maybe even

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.320 
yourself get some parsley maybe even

some cilantro blend that up maybe even a
