00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.650 

this<00:00:09.860> little<00:00:10.160> device<00:00:10.280> is<00:00:10.760> a<00:00:10.910> laser<00:00:11.360> cavity

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
this little device is a laser cavity

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.890 
this little device is a laser cavity
detector<00:00:12.969> now<00:00:13.969> there<00:00:14.120> are<00:00:14.210> basically<00:00:14.570> three

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
detector now there are basically three

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.650 
detector now there are basically three
kinds<00:00:15.230> of<00:00:15.290> cavities<00:00:16.090> there's<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.270> plots<00:00:17.510> and

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
kinds of cavities there's the plots and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.630 
kinds of cavities there's the plots and
cavities<00:00:18.110> and<00:00:18.890> those<00:00:19.100> are<00:00:19.280> the<00:00:19.340> ones<00:00:19.520> that

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
cavities and those are the ones that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.570 
cavities and those are the ones that
occur<00:00:20.000> between<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:20.810> teeth<00:00:21.110> and<00:00:21.430> usually<00:00:22.430> they

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
occur between the teeth and usually they

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.570 
occur between the teeth and usually they
show<00:00:22.820> up<00:00:23.029> on<00:00:23.210> your<00:00:23.360> dental<00:00:23.600> x-rays

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
show up on your dental x-rays

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.080 
show up on your dental x-rays
second<00:00:26.240> there's<00:00:26.680> recession<00:00:27.680> cavities<00:00:28.160> and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
second there's recession cavities and

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.940 
second there's recession cavities and
those<00:00:29.390> are<00:00:29.540> caries<00:00:30.020> that<00:00:30.200> show<00:00:30.380> up<00:00:30.530> on<00:00:30.770> the

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
those are caries that show up on the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.170 
those are caries that show up on the
sucker<00:00:31.490> root<00:00:31.820> portion<00:00:32.300> of<00:00:32.419> your<00:00:32.599> teeth<00:00:34.180> when

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
sucker root portion of your teeth when

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.180 
sucker root portion of your teeth when
the<00:00:35.390> gums<00:00:35.629> have<00:00:35.809> receded<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:36.590> usually<00:00:36.980> those

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
the gums have receded and usually those

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.310 
the gums have receded and usually those
who<00:00:37.399> can<00:00:37.579> see<00:00:37.760> visually<00:00:38.329> when<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.050> look<00:00:39.170> in

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
who can see visually when you look in

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.439 
who can see visually when you look in
the<00:00:39.379> mouth<00:00:39.670> but<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.789> third<00:00:40.969> kind<00:00:41.179> are

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
the mouth but the third kind are

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.950 
the mouth but the third kind are
difficult<00:00:41.929> to<00:00:42.620> detect<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.190> these<00:00:43.370> are

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
difficult to detect and these are

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.509 
difficult to detect and these are
cavities<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.199> grooves<00:00:45.589> and<00:00:45.920> fissures<00:00:46.309> of

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
cavities in the grooves and fissures of

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.329 
cavities in the grooves and fissures of
your<00:00:46.670> back<00:00:46.909> teeth<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.569> so<00:00:48.559> what<00:00:48.800> happens<00:00:49.190> in

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
your back teeth and so what happens in

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.020 
your back teeth and so what happens in
those<00:00:49.460> back<00:00:49.699> teeth<00:00:49.909> is<00:00:50.179> the<00:00:51.399> enamel<00:00:52.399> forms

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
those back teeth is the enamel forms

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.500 
those back teeth is the enamel forms
over<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:53.600> teeth<00:00:53.809> towards<00:00:54.679> the<00:00:54.800> center<00:00:55.159> and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
over the teeth towards the center and

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.500 
over the teeth towards the center and
often<00:00:56.800> it<00:00:57.800> doesn't<00:00:58.159> form<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.879> bridge<00:00:59.239> all<00:00:59.479> the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
often it doesn't form a bridge all the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.569 
often it doesn't form a bridge all the
way<00:00:59.659> across<00:00:59.989> in<00:01:00.319> the<00:01:00.530> pits<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:01.039> grooves<00:01:01.309> of

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
way across in the pits and grooves of

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.189 
way across in the pits and grooves of
the<00:01:01.609> teeth<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.120> you<00:01:02.179> have<00:01:02.329> little<00:01:02.600> defects<00:01:02.989> in

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
the teeth so you have little defects in

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.580 
the teeth so you have little defects in
there<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:04.309> those<00:01:04.489> defects<00:01:04.909> can<00:01:05.150> decay<00:01:05.590> the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
there and those defects can decay the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.620 
there and those defects can decay the
problem<00:01:06.979> is<00:01:07.130> they're<00:01:07.850> usually<00:01:08.030> just<00:01:08.210> pinpoint

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
problem is they're usually just pinpoint

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.660 
problem is they're usually just pinpoint
and<00:01:09.170> they're<00:01:09.770> very<00:01:09.890> difficult<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.960> determine

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
and they're very difficult to determine

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.070 
and they're very difficult to determine
whether<00:01:13.670> they<00:01:13.880> go<00:01:14.060> through<00:01:14.360> into<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.720> inside

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
whether they go through into the inside

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.540 
whether they go through into the inside
of<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.260> tooth<00:01:15.470> or<00:01:15.740> not<00:01:15.950> or<00:01:16.100> whether<00:01:16.250> they're

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
of the tooth or not or whether they're

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.050 
of the tooth or not or whether they're
just<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:17.210> little<00:01:18.580> cavitation<00:01:19.580> in<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.850> enamel

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
just a little cavitation in the enamel

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.180 
just a little cavitation in the enamel
well<00:01:20.870> this<00:01:21.310> device<00:01:22.310> here<00:01:22.940> uses<00:01:23.660> a<00:01:23.690> laser<00:01:24.190> to

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
well this device here uses a laser to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.040 
well this device here uses a laser to
actually<00:01:25.610> measure<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.090> density<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
actually measure the density of the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.200 
actually measure the density of the
little<00:01:27.290> pinpoint<00:01:27.740> areas<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.280> tooth<00:01:28.550> and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
little pinpoint areas of the tooth and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.130 
little pinpoint areas of the tooth and
will<00:01:30.520> tell<00:01:31.520> whether<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.210> actually<00:01:32.390> perforates

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
will tell whether it actually perforates

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.770 
will tell whether it actually perforates
into<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.590> softer<00:01:34.010> inside<00:01:34.160> tooth<00:01:34.610> or<00:01:34.790> not<00:01:34.970> and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
into the softer inside tooth or not and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.290 
into the softer inside tooth or not and
if<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.050> does<00:01:37.450> then<00:01:38.450> these<00:01:38.810> areas<00:01:39.230> can<00:01:39.440> be

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
if it does then these areas can be

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.600 
if it does then these areas can be
cleaned<00:01:41.300> out<00:01:41.420> using<00:01:41.870> a<00:01:41.960> micro<00:01:42.320> technology<00:01:42.610> and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
cleaned out using a micro technology and

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.490 
cleaned out using a micro technology and
with<00:01:44.240> with<00:01:45.110> very<00:01:45.410> small<00:01:46.810> tiny<00:01:47.810> fillings

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
with with very small tiny fillings

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.390 
with with very small tiny fillings
this<00:01:48.740> can<00:01:48.950> be<00:01:49.070> filled<00:01:49.340> in<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.250> the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
this can be filled in and so the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.380 
this can be filled in and so the
advantage<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.480> that<00:01:54.580> because<00:01:55.580> this

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
advantage of this is that because this

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.630 
advantage of this is that because this
doesn't<00:01:56.840> involve<00:01:57.170> any<00:01:57.470> of<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.830> really<00:01:58.340> strong

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
doesn't involve any of the really strong

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.149 
doesn't involve any of the really strong
part<00:01:59.000> accustomed<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.720> tooth

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
part accustomed the tooth

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.489 
part accustomed the tooth
as<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:01.119> strength<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.710> tooth

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
as the strength of the of the tooth

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.679 
as the strength of the of the tooth
it<00:02:05.499> doesn't<00:02:05.920> involve<00:02:06.850> these<00:02:07.060> at<00:02:07.240> all<00:02:07.420> because

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
it doesn't involve these at all because

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.440 
it doesn't involve these at all because
but<00:02:08.140> if<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.379> leave<00:02:08.560> these<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.269> don't

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
but if you leave these and you don't

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.720 
but if you leave these and you don't
realize<00:02:10.629> that<00:02:10.780> there's<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.590> perforation<00:02:12.220> there

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
realize that there's a perforation there

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.850 
realize that there's a perforation there
they<00:02:12.940> will<00:02:13.120> all<00:02:13.269> join<00:02:13.540> together<00:02:13.860> undermine

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
they will all join together undermine

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.820 
they will all join together undermine
the<00:02:15.720> strength<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.019> enamel<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.769> it

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
the strength of the enamel here and it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.500 
the strength of the enamel here and it
will<00:02:17.890> cave<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.400> eventually<00:02:18.970> you'll<00:02:19.180> wind<00:02:19.390> up

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
will cave in eventually you'll wind up

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.339 
will cave in eventually you'll wind up
with<00:02:19.750> something<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.019> this

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
with something like this and so this

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.820 
with something like this and so this
whole<00:02:23.530> inside<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> tooth<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.489> filled<00:02:25.060> and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
whole inside of the tooth is filled and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.830 
whole inside of the tooth is filled and
because<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.430> lack<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.790> strength<00:02:28.629> here

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
because of a lack of strength here

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.210 
because of a lack of strength here
there's<00:02:29.140> cracks<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.799> tooth

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
there's cracks in the tooth

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.930 
there's cracks in the tooth
this<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.670> eventually<00:02:31.090> gonna<00:02:32.519> run<00:02:33.519> into<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
this is eventually gonna run into the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.360 
this is eventually gonna run into the
crown<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.310> thing<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.910> about<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
crown and so the thing I like about the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.890 
crown and so the thing I like about the
this<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.819> be<00:02:39.970> detector<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.540> being<00:02:40.720> able<00:02:40.780> to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
this can be detector it being able to

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.690 
this can be detector it being able to
find<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.230> fillings<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:41.860> small<00:02:44.489> they<00:02:45.489> can

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
find the fillings of this small they can

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.240 
find the fillings of this small they can
be<00:02:45.970> easily<00:02:46.480> filled<00:02:46.989> this<00:02:47.290> tooth<00:02:47.590> will

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
be easily filled this tooth will

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.550 
be easily filled this tooth will
maintain<00:02:48.459> its<00:02:48.879> print<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.660> likely<00:02:50.260> will

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
maintain its print and it likely will

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.170 
maintain its print and it likely will
never<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.040> have<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.310> crown<00:02:51.640> or<00:02:51.819> any<00:02:51.970> kind

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
never have to have a crown or any kind

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.430 
never have to have a crown or any kind
of<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:54.340> kind<00:02:54.549> of<00:02:54.609> major<00:02:54.760> work<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.299> so<00:02:55.629> it's<00:02:56.319> a

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
of that kind of major work on so it's a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.800 
of that kind of major work on so it's a
win-win<00:02:56.799> situation<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.269> good<00:02:58.450> service

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
win-win situation it's a good service

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.470 
win-win situation it's a good service
for<00:02:58.840> my<00:02:59.109> patients<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.840> that's<00:03:01.840> why<00:03:02.079> I<00:03:02.109> have<00:03:02.319> it
