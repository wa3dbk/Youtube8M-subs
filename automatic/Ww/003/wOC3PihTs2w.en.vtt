00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.340 
called a Lions detector and as you guys
can<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> right-hand<00:00:15.480> corner<00:00:16.049> there

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
can see on the right-hand corner there

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.660 
can see on the right-hand corner there
or<00:00:16.590> not<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> right<00:00:17.010> hand<00:00:17.190> corner<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
or not the right hand corner but the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.090 
or not the right hand corner but the
right<00:00:17.789> hand<00:00:17.940> side<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.350> detector

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
right hand side there is the detector

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.950 
right hand side there is the detector
now<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> detector<00:00:21.420> does<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
now what the detector does is it

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.500 
now what the detector does is it
basically<00:00:22.050> helps<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.980> find<00:00:23.820> resources

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
basically helps you find resources

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.939 
basically helps you find resources
throughout<00:00:24.960> your<00:00:25.109> Minecraft<00:00:25.529> world<00:00:25.680> and

makes it a lot easier as you guys can
see<00:00:28.080> when<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.590> go<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.859> certain<00:00:29.369> block<00:00:30.269> are

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
see when you go on certain block are

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.540 
see when you go on certain block are
certain<00:00:31.019> Heights<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.679> actually<00:00:31.980> changes<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
certain Heights it actually changes the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.940 
certain Heights it actually changes the
landscape<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.510> detector<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.140> actually

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
landscape on the detector and actually

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
landscape on the detector and actually
shows<00:00:35.280> different<00:00:35.850> kinds<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.210> materials

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
shows different kinds of materials

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.240 
shows different kinds of materials
underground<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> st.<00:00:38.100> not

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
underground or on the st. not

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.500 
underground or on the st. not
underground<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> same<00:00:39.180> level<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
underground but on the same level that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.400 
underground but on the same level that
you<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.950> example<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.960> guys<00:00:43.050> see

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
you are so for example is you guys see

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.229 
you are so for example is you guys see
on<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> level<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.129> am<00:00:44.280> currently<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.640> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
on the level that I am currently on you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.910 
on the level that I am currently on you
guys<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> red<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.620> move<00:00:46.829> over

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
guys can see the red so if I move over

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.080 
guys can see the red so if I move over
here<00:00:48.230> just<00:00:49.230> over<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.370> should<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:50.820> able

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
here just over here and I should be able

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.590 
here just over here and I should be able
to<00:00:51.360> find<00:00:51.750> coal<00:00:52.260> which<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.100> red<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.030> red

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to find coal which is what red is red

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.450 
to find coal which is what red is red
blocks<00:00:55.020> equals<00:00:55.500> coal<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.039> there<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.309> go

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
blocks equals coal and there you go

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.250 
blocks equals coal and there you go
there's<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> coal<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> makes<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> really

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there's the coal so it makes it really

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.380 
there's the coal so it makes it really
easy<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.649> find<00:00:58.829> certain<00:00:59.190> resources<00:00:59.489> coal<00:01:00.239> is

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
easy to find certain resources coal is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.009 
easy to find certain resources coal is
red<00:01:01.010> dymond<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> think<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:03.030> triangle<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
red dymond is I think a triangle and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.570 
red dymond is I think a triangle and
iron<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.450> white<00:01:06.450> square<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.369> gold<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
iron is a white square and gold is a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.770 
iron is a white square and gold is a
yellow<00:01:08.820> square<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.510> actually

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
yellow square but you can actually

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.690 
yellow square but you can actually
change<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.380> through<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> options<00:01:11.220> which<00:01:11.610> are

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
change it through the options which are

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.969 
change it through the options which are
show<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.150> now<00:01:12.330> by<00:01:12.570> pressing<00:01:12.990> B<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
show you get right now by pressing B you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.460 
show you get right now by pressing B you
can<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.220> customize<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:15.540> indicator<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
can actually customize your indicator so

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
can actually customize your indicator so
for<00:01:16.680> example<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.490> want<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> change<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
for example if you want to change the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.940 
for example if you want to change the
size<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> indicator<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.530> make<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
size of the indicator you can make it a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.530 
size of the indicator you can make it a
hundred<00:01:20.130> sent<00:01:20.369> bigger<00:01:20.549> which<00:01:20.939> makes<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
hundred sent bigger which makes it this

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.660 
hundred sent bigger which makes it this
big<00:01:21.750> which<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.229> my<00:01:22.350> opinion<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.740> prefer<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
big which in my opinion I prefer this

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.030 
big which in my opinion I prefer this
large<00:01:24.030> since<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.540> makes<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.810> lot<00:01:24.990> easier<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.590> see

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
large since it makes a lot easier to see

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.020 
large since it makes a lot easier to see
the<00:01:26.400> different<00:01:26.640> pixels<00:01:27.180> uh<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.710> a

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
the different pixels uh you can a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.789 
the different pixels uh you can a
distance<00:01:30.030> filter<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.170> turn<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.590> off

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
distance filter you can turn it off

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.670 
distance filter you can turn it off
whenever<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> want<00:01:32.460> instead<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.850> having<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
whenever you want instead of having to

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.280 
whenever you want instead of having to
basically<00:01:34.680> turn<00:01:35.130> off<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> mod<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:36.290> detector

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
basically turn off the mod on detector

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
basically turn off the mod on detector
position<00:01:37.860> detect<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.490> view<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.030> detective

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
position detect your view and detective

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
all that good stuff and you can actually

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.270 
all that good stuff and you can actually
set<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.820> materials<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.600> be<00:01:48.979> shown<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
set the materials to be shown as a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.730 
set the materials to be shown as a
certain<00:01:50.820> block<00:01:51.329> or<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> certain<00:01:52.079> color<00:01:52.409> block

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.460 
certain block or a certain color block
so<00:01:53.340> that's<00:01:53.490> pretty<00:01:53.670> cool<00:01:53.960> alright<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.350> I'm

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
so that's pretty cool alright so now I'm

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.990 
so that's pretty cool alright so now I'm
actually<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.890> go<00:01:55.920> mining<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:56.880> bit

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
actually going to go mining a little bit

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.270 
actually going to go mining a little bit
show<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> guys<00:01:57.360> how<00:01:57.420> well<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.290> detector

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
show you guys how well this detector

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
show you guys how well this detector
actually<00:01:59.790> works<00:02:00.030> when<00:02:00.329> mining<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.930> finding

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
actually works when mining and finding

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.980 
actually works when mining and finding
resources<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.549> oh<00:02:02.850> yeah<00:02:03.299> one<00:02:03.540> more<00:02:03.570> thing<00:02:03.719> you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
resources so oh yeah one more thing you

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.230 
resources so oh yeah one more thing you
can<00:02:04.110> actually<00:02:04.259> change<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.890> zoom<00:02:05.250> sighs<00:02:05.549> so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
can actually change the zoom sighs so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.229 
can actually change the zoom sighs so
soom<00:02:06.840> level<00:02:07.140> four<00:02:07.680> times<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.879> go<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
soom level four times here you go and

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.720 
soom level four times here you go and
zoom<00:02:09.869> level<00:02:10.259> 1<00:02:10.470> times<00:02:10.709> which<00:02:10.920> actually<00:02:11.099> causes

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
zoom level 1 times which actually causes

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460 
zoom level 1 times which actually causes
a<00:02:11.970> bit<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.540> lag<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.200> summer

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
a bit of lag for summer

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
a bit of lag for summer
in<00:02:13.620> which<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.830> don't<00:02:14.010> really<00:02:14.190> understand<00:02:14.640> but

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
in which I don't really understand but

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.730 
in which I don't really understand but
I'm<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.630> gonna<00:02:15.780> keep<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.230> two<00:02:16.470> times

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
I'm just gonna keep it on two times

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.940 
I'm just gonna keep it on two times
right<00:02:17.010> now<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.550> let's<00:02:18.270> just<00:02:18.660> let's<00:02:19.230> fly<00:02:19.590> over

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
right now so let's just let's fly over

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.830 
right now so let's just let's fly over
here<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> little<00:02:20.280> bit<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.940> did<00:02:21.540> record

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
here a little bit because I did record

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.940 
here a little bit because I did record
before<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> was<00:02:22.380> having<00:02:22.470> big<00:02:22.710> trouble

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
before and I was having big trouble

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.190 
before and I was having big trouble
finding<00:02:23.190> diamond<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:24.150> let's<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.660> over<00:02:24.840> here

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
finding diamond but let's go over here

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.430 
finding diamond but let's go over here
maybe<00:02:25.500> go<00:02:25.590> find<00:02:25.860> some<00:02:25.980> diamond<00:02:26.400> instead<00:02:27.440> okay

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
maybe go find some diamond instead okay

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.240 
maybe go find some diamond instead okay
so<00:02:28.580> basically<00:02:29.580> let's<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.330> dig<00:02:30.570> down<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.250> as

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
so basically let's just dig down and as

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.950 
so basically let's just dig down and as
you<00:02:32.370> guys<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.640> see<00:02:32.700> there's<00:02:33.030> some<00:02:33.090> red<00:02:33.480> right

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
you guys can see there's some red right

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.380 
you guys can see there's some red right
on<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.230> level<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.740> should<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.970> go<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> couple

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
on this level so should if I go a couple

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.320 
on this level so should if I go a couple
blocks<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:37.050> way<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:38.550> couple<00:02:38.760> blocks<00:02:39.060> this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
blocks this way and a couple blocks this

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.910 
blocks this way and a couple blocks this
way<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.540> should<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.780> able<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.960> find<00:02:40.170> coal<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
way I should be able to find coal and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.220 
way I should be able to find coal and
there<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.310> coal<00:02:41.790> right<00:02:42.120> there<00:02:42.510> as<00:02:42.750> guests

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
there is the coal right there as guests

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.320 
there is the coal right there as guests
to<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.800> very<00:02:44.100> accurate<00:02:44.400> down<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
to see it is very accurate down to the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.020 
to see it is very accurate down to the
last<00:02:46.140> block<00:02:46.530> which<00:02:47.010> i<00:02:47.160> think<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.490> pretty<00:02:47.910> cool

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
last block which i think is pretty cool

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.620 
last block which i think is pretty cool
so<00:02:48.900> let's<00:02:49.140> dig<00:02:49.410> down<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.709> little<00:02:49.980> bit<00:02:50.100> further

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
so let's dig down a little bit further

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.790 
so let's dig down a little bit further
hopefully<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.720> guys<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.410> did<00:02:52.680> bring

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
hopefully you guys can see I did bring

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.040 
hopefully you guys can see I did bring
some<00:02:53.040> torches<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:54.480> case<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.780> gets<00:02:54.870> too

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
some torches just in case it gets too

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.020 
some torches just in case it gets too
dark<00:02:55.080> for<00:02:55.350> your<00:02:55.620> viewing<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.550> let's<00:02:56.730> go<00:02:56.850> down

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
dark for your viewing but let's go down

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.270 
dark for your viewing but let's go down
a<00:02:57.060> little<00:02:57.300> deeper<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.870> there<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.620> more<00:02:58.890> coal<00:02:59.250> I

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
a little deeper and there is more coal I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.730 
a little deeper and there is more coal I
would<00:02:59.610> like<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.910> find<00:03:00.120> some<00:03:00.360> diamond<00:03:00.900> cuz

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
would like to find some diamond cuz

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.740 
would like to find some diamond cuz
dymond<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.580> just<00:03:02.850> want<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.060> show<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.360> off<00:03:03.450> and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
dymond I just want to show it off and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.390 
dymond I just want to show it off and
diamonds<00:03:04.050> really<00:03:04.320> rare<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.980> might<00:03:05.100> be<00:03:05.130> kind

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
diamonds really rare so it might be kind

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.070 
diamonds really rare so it might be kind
of<00:03:05.430> hard<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.640> find<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.240> video<00:03:06.570> hopefully

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
of hard to find in this video hopefully

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.420 
of hard to find in this video hopefully
I<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.350> show<00:03:07.530> an<00:03:07.620> example<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.160> guys<00:03:08.280> see

I can show an example is you guys see

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.580 
I can show an example is you guys see
those<00:03:08.580> white<00:03:09.240> blocks<00:03:09.720> those<00:03:09.990> are<00:03:10.110> actually<00:03:10.560> a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
those white blocks those are actually a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.510 
those white blocks those are actually a
coal<00:03:11.550> I'm<00:03:11.820> not<00:03:12.060> cool<00:03:12.330> sorry<00:03:12.720> iron<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:14.010> let's<00:03:14.250> go

go over there and find that iron okay so
this<00:03:25.380> right<00:03:25.680> here<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.730> keeping<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.150> at

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
this right here I like keeping it at

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.720 
this right here I like keeping it at
this<00:03:27.570> exact<00:03:28.320> soom<00:03:28.650> size<00:03:28.920> because<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.519> really

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
this exact soom size because it really

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.490 
this exact soom size because it really
makes<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.000> easier<00:03:30.239> for<00:03:30.390> me<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.480> see<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.019> there

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
makes it easier for me to see and there

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.370 
makes it easier for me to see and there
you<00:03:31.560> go<00:03:31.650> there's<00:03:31.950> your<00:03:32.959> there's<00:03:33.959> your<00:03:34.140> iron

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
you go there's your there's your iron

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.190 
you go there's your there's your iron
now<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:35.519> let's<00:03:36.239> just<00:03:36.510> double-check<00:03:36.840> them

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
now I think let's just double-check them

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.490 
now I think let's just double-check them
plus<00:03:37.410> f3<00:03:37.620> all<00:03:38.580> right<00:03:38.880> why<00:03:39.090> 54<00:03:39.750> there<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.080> go<00:03:40.230> so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
plus f3 all right why 54 there you go so

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.009 
plus f3 all right why 54 there you go so
the<00:03:40.950> most<00:03:41.100> common<00:03:41.190> level<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.180> find<00:03:42.480> diamond<00:03:42.930> i

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
the most common level to find diamond i

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.130 
the most common level to find diamond i
do<00:03:43.080> believe<00:03:43.320> is<00:03:43.590> 11<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.820> let's<00:03:45.090> check<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.570> and

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
do believe is 11 so let's check that and

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.470 
do believe is 11 so let's check that and
go<00:03:46.799> down<00:03:46.980> all<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.310> way<00:03:47.400> down<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.760> level<00:03:47.910> 11

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
go down all the way down to a level 11

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.390 
go down all the way down to a level 11
so<00:03:48.600> i<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.810> find<00:03:49.049> some<00:03:49.200> diamond<00:03:49.620> sorry<00:03:50.250> about

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
so i can find some diamond sorry about

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.860 
so i can find some diamond sorry about
guys<00:03:50.549> i<00:03:50.760> know<00:03:50.820> it's<00:03:51.030> really<00:03:51.180> dark<00:03:51.540> i'm<00:03:51.750> going

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
think about how like slow would be

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.380 
think about how like slow would be
mining<00:04:52.980> with<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.100> pickaxe<00:04:53.370> so<00:04:54.000> let's<00:04:54.180> go<00:04:54.360> over
