00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.560 
they haven't got that nice little neck
in<00:05:12.280> their<00:05:12.460> tail<00:05:12.670> but<00:05:12.820> that's<00:05:12.970> a<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.740> sea<00:05:14.740> trout<00:05:14.980> I

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
in their tail but that's a a sea trout I

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.760 
in their tail but that's a a sea trout I
would<00:05:16.570> say<00:05:16.810> probably<00:05:18.060> three<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.210> half

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
would say probably three and a half

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.030 
would say probably three and a half
three<00:05:20.770> half<00:05:20.950> pounds<00:05:22.260> not<00:05:23.260> fresh<00:05:23.560> off<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.860> tie

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
three half pounds not fresh off the tie

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.440 
three half pounds not fresh off the tie
but<00:05:24.280> not<00:05:24.960> not<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.170> old<00:05:26.350> either<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:27.450> that

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
but not not that old either and that

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.020 
but not not that old either and that
hook<00:05:28.630> wasn't<00:05:29.020> coming<00:05:29.320> out<00:05:29.440> but<00:05:29.910> that's<00:05:30.910> just

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
hook wasn't coming out but that's just

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.490 
hook wasn't coming out but that's just
start<00:05:31.890> salmon<00:05:32.890> next<00:05:33.130> time<00:05:33.340> round<00:05:34.410> and<00:05:35.410> the

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
start salmon next time round and the

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:54.610 
start salmon next time round and the
fish<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:36.330> think<00:05:37.330> wanted<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.690> go

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.680
