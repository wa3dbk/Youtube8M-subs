00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 r everyone and it is the bear is 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.190
 second chair train 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.589
 so that's how I wanted to say the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.120
 last left funk configuration the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.429
 delirium is the small configuration 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.040
 favorite if ever I was so 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.049
 I never won the lottery 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.660
 while not abusing stuff either 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.420
 so I present it to you immediately tech 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.029
 here we are at the level of the map 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.820
 mother her older sister but 6 and 2 87 power 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.080
 maxxx empower max simply because 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 that this is one of the motherboards that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.180
 allows to have the best zerg the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.920
 king feasible on the chip 87 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.620
 there are others who do a little bit 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.629
 stuff like kind with kikoolol 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.329
 finally this is the small box 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.420
 deported and her thing this one she is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.820
 very very very good is all that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.829
 where is it needed it's nickel we can 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.899
 take everything tensions everywhere finally 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.800
 in short they really great for the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.539
 reclocking the proc 'good because finally 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.010
 on 17 because good way for them 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.420
 games it was you use nothing I think 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.689
 that someone this game that the written gers 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.119
 6-3 all the others I can not stand 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.920
 hyper trading so that's enough 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.130
 on 10.5 if you play there we would go 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.790
 out of ten is therefore the most 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.659
 stronger and so there is this 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.409
 case version at 310 euros and it would stay 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.900
 not very long at 3 gig 5 I think 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.400
 the g skill low on enough giga or more 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.549
 it does not help much even though we have 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.820
 pété de thunes will stop anything by 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.950
 against maximum frequency 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.780
 finally one of the maximum frequencies that 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.490
 I could find I believe finally 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.370
 maximum frequency overstocked motherboard 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.750
 1800 megahertz see there that's when 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.840
 even immediately very very expensive ram 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.280
 what about at these prices 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.300
 the little config 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.450
 good there you just have the ram ok 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.520
 a little test lead gx780 you go to me 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.810
 say yes to 7 181 countries that came out 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.479

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.600
 cornered to his stock the time I get you 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.369

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.630

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.640
