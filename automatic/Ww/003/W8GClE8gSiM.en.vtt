00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
well so something along the lines couple

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
well so something along the lines couple
yes<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.870> when<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.170> doing<00:00:40.410> this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

yes of that and when you're doing this
typically<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.760> dogs<00:00:41.969> gonna<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> way

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
typically your dogs gonna have a way

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.060 
typically your dogs gonna have a way
that<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.379> goes<00:00:43.469> better<00:00:43.739> than<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that one way this goes better than the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
that one way this goes better than the
other<00:00:44.219> dogs<00:00:44.940> actually<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.750> really

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
other dogs actually can really

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.510 
other dogs actually can really
right-handed<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.739> left-handed<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.340> same

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
right-handed and left-handed the same

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.119 
right-handed and left-handed the same
thing<00:00:47.930> somewhat<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.649> there<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> right

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
thing somewhat so like there are a right

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.380 
thing somewhat so like there are a right
side<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.520> left<00:00:50.730> side<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.120> basically

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
side of your left side it's basically

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.450 
side of your left side it's basically
going<00:00:51.809> right<00:00:52.110> might<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.440> easier<00:00:52.710> we're<00:00:53.250> going

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
going right might be easier we're going

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
going right might be easier we're going
left<00:00:53.610> might<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:53.940> easier<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.570> one<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:55.079> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
left might be easier so one one way you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
left might be easier so one one way you
might<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.620> work<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:55.920> bit<00:00:56.100> harder

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
might have to work a little bit harder

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160 
might have to work a little bit harder
on<00:00:56.449> but<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> beginning<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.989> just

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
on but so in the beginning you just

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.360
