00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.970
 but 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.960
 here 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.210
 We look interested together on 4 like 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.940
 all a lot of time as always a little here 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.720
 turned out the first time right for one and a half for 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.880
 two seasons 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.280
 so glad to look over 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.530
 the final match I portable quartz came 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.869
 say give a lot of emotion a lot of cry 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.790
 good regression dough but actually 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.470
 We would not be long planned 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.540
 it seems to miss such an event 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.210
 Especially due to the fact that we ourselves 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.380
 the final over already feel this spirit and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.380
 we will prepare in parallel 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.300
 Today I am the first break came we want 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.520
 know it looks cool yes I don't know 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.200
 until the end of all the rules and do not understand how 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.610
 so you can skate 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.610
 gave me a lot of love here 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.330
 asked the coach and coach cancel for 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.370
 This training but said so 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.140
 surely everyone walked like they say 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.970
 training was canceled on account of not quite 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.760
 believe according to plan was a two weekend 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:14.890
 first and then everything was done in the morning 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:17.290
 that i think it was so more a joke 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.690
 that hockey players are fighting I will find it is not at all 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.580
 bad in the first place is like a fan 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.890
 Secondly, this means that the players 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.470
 experience a big rush of adrenaline and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.570
 they are charged to fight in a cube with us 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.610
 there were fights during volleyball 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.739
 match and since everyone wanted to win 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.300
 now at the professional level 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.300
 you do n't need 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.030
 the ultimate as a viewer want spectacular 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.590
 hockey but also as an athlete 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.819
 I understand that the result is still more important 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.430
 the first place here is more important 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.340
 Well, 200 is nice for the audience. 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.659
 naturally the most important thing for 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.939
 result and because when you 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.430
 you win will talk well 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:05.689
 when you lose and grants are beautiful 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.810
 ugly is not interesting to anyone but 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.639
 Well done came out you reached the final now we 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.620
 hope to be champions know that 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.220
 blame it all favor the weakling on the very 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.530
 business 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.510
 team finals up teams and odds 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.609
 so I think that if they win 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.470
 everyone will forget in two or three years at all 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.540
 nobody risk what kind of hockey they played 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.030
 so let's wish good luck i think 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.480
 that doesn't matter in beautifully ugly chief 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.480
 victory is all 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.390
