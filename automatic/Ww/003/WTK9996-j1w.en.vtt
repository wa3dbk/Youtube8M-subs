we must visit the nine stones which were
easy<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.920> find<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.609> were<00:00:59.760> by<00:00:59.940> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
easy to find as they were by the

easy to find as they were by the
roadside<00:01:00.350> but<00:01:01.350> then<00:01:01.500> heading<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> Exeter

finding<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> stone<00:01:03.090> circles<00:01:03.510> got<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> bit

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
finding the stone circles got a bit

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.039 
finding the stone circles got a bit
harder<00:01:04.290> some<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> rules<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.640> tiny

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
harder some of the rules are just tiny

harder some of the rules are just tiny

well that way luckily for those who do
they<00:01:18.229> don't<00:01:18.470> want<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:18.680> take<00:01:18.830> their<00:01:19.040> chances

they don't want to take their chances
there<00:01:20.900> are<00:01:20.930> all<00:01:21.140> times<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:22.610> is<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.790> score<00:01:23.090> of

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
there are all times this is a score of

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.149 
there are all times this is a score of
the<00:01:23.270> stone<00:01:23.479> circle<00:01:23.720> which<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:24.500> know<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.830> from<00:01:24.979> a

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
the stone circle which I know of from a

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.120 
the stone circle which I know of from a
year<00:01:25.400> at<00:01:25.640> Exeter<00:01:26.240> University<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:27.619> due<00:01:28.100> to

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
year at Exeter University so due to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.330 
year at Exeter University so due to
previous<00:01:28.460> visits<00:01:29.090> easy<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.690> find<00:01:30.040> but<00:01:31.040> having

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
previous visits easy to find but having

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.490 
previous visits easy to find but having
a<00:01:31.430> tight<00:01:31.640> schedule<00:01:31.970> with<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:32.960> many<00:01:33.080> things<00:01:33.410> to

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
a tight schedule with so many things to

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.630 
a tight schedule with so many things to
see<00:01:33.770> means<00:01:34.340> I'm<00:01:34.490> falling<00:01:35.000> behind<00:01:35.119> timewise

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
see means I'm falling behind timewise

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.130 
see means I'm falling behind timewise
and<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.790> other<00:01:37.909> reason<00:01:38.000> for<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.479> bit<00:01:38.960> of<00:01:38.990> a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
and the other reason for a bit of a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.719 
and the other reason for a bit of a
delay<00:01:39.409> is<00:01:39.470> that<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:40.009> get<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.369> some<00:01:40.550> of<00:01:40.580> these

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
delay is that to get to some of these

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.640 
delay is that to get to some of these
stone<00:01:41.119> circles<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:41.869> really<00:01:42.080> have<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.380> go<00:01:42.530> on

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
stone circles you really have to go on

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.969 
stone circles you really have to go on
roads<00:01:42.950> like<00:01:43.100> this<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.300> what<00:01:44.800> some<00:01:45.800> of<00:01:45.830> these

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
roads like this so what some of these

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.910 
roads like this so what some of these
sorcerers<00:01:46.490> are<00:01:46.790> easy<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.479> get<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:47.869> GPS<00:01:48.740> would

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
sorcerers are easy to get to GPS would

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.499 
sorcerers are easy to get to GPS would
never<00:01:49.100> lie<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.280> me<00:01:49.610> almost<00:01:50.539> there

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
never lie to me almost there

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.889 
never lie to me almost there
unfortunately<00:01:54.520> I'll<00:01:55.520> find<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.030> but<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.479> do<00:01:56.600> find

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
unfortunately I'll find it but I do find

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.540 
unfortunately I'll find it but I do find
what<00:01:57.140> looks<00:01:57.289> like<00:01:57.380> an<00:01:57.619> ancient<00:01:57.740> burial<00:01:58.100> site

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
what looks like an ancient burial site

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.760 
what looks like an ancient burial site
so<00:01:58.970> better<00:01:59.450> than<00:01:59.690> nothing<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.380> next<00:02:00.649> own

right down would not be easy trying to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.699

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
part of the regular maintenance so we

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.820 
part of the regular maintenance so we
tested<00:05:28.570> the<00:05:28.630> motorcycle<00:05:29.259> found<00:05:29.530> out<00:05:29.680> that

tested the motorcycle found out that

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.520 
tested the motorcycle found out that
internet<00:05:30.220> coordinates<00:05:30.729> are<00:05:31.180> unreliable<00:05:31.690> so

internet coordinates are unreliable so
let's<00:05:32.710> see<00:05:32.860> how<00:05:32.889> we<00:05:33.130> get<00:05:33.490> on

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
let's see how we get on

was<00:05:39.370> still<00:05:39.550> quite<00:05:39.699> upset<00:05:40.090> because<00:05:40.419> my

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
was still quite upset because my

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.870 
was still quite upset because my
motorcycle<00:05:41.259> broke<00:05:41.409> down<00:05:41.680> and<00:05:41.919> I<00:05:42.490> ran<00:05:42.699> out<00:05:42.849> of

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
motorcycle broke down and I ran out of

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.909 
motorcycle broke down and I ran out of
time<00:05:43.210> and<00:05:43.419> so<00:05:43.990> I<00:05:44.050> could<00:05:44.259> not<00:05:44.409> make<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.800> the

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
time and so I could not make it to the

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.969 
time and so I could not make it to the
stone<00:05:45.130> circle<00:05:45.370> near<00:05:45.729> porthmadog<00:05:46.770> but<00:05:47.770> maybe

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
stone circle near porthmadog but maybe

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.890 
stone circle near porthmadog but maybe
that<00:05:48.280> is<00:05:48.400> a<00:05:48.430> target<00:05:48.880> destination<00:05:49.030> for<00:05:49.599> another

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
that is a target destination for another

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.169 
that is a target destination for another
journey
