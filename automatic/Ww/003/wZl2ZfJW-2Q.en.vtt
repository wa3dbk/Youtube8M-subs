far away from your gaming setup if you

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.960 
far away from your gaming setup if you

do gain like on the couch or something

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.360 
do gain like on the couch or something
like<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.299> so<00:03:18.750> these<00:03:19.560> are<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.739> chords<00:03:20.190> it

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
like that so these are the chords it

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.089 
like that so these are the chords it
comes<00:03:20.549> with<00:03:20.699> a<00:03:20.760> 2<00:03:21.299> point<00:03:21.510> 0<00:03:21.659> USB<00:03:22.349> so<00:03:22.919> that's

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
comes with a 2 point 0 USB so that's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790

automatically<00:03:48.449> for<00:03:48.659> me<00:03:48.750> but<00:03:49.409> there's<00:03:49.680> three

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
automatically for me but there's three

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.420

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.469 
settings there's a bass boost there's a
accurate<00:03:53.430> i<00:03:53.549> think<00:03:53.729> it's<00:03:53.819> called<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.180> cute

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
accurate i think it's called a cute

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.879 
accurate i think it's called a cute
actor<00:03:54.750> something<00:03:55.019> like<00:03:55.109> that<00:03:55.259> so<00:03:55.739> there's

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
actor something like that so there's

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:56.960 
actor something like that so there's
three<00:03:56.040> different<00:03:56.189> settings<00:03:56.759> there's

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
three different settings there's

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.309 
three different settings there's
different<00:03:57.299> settings<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.659> can<00:03:57.720> try<00:03:57.989> out<00:03:58.019> which

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
different settings you can try out which

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.110 
different settings you can try out which
I<00:03:58.439> channel<00:03:58.739> three<00:03:58.919> of<00:03:58.979> them<00:03:59.099> I<00:03:59.280> enjoyed<00:03:59.819> the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
I channel three of them I enjoyed the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.110 
I channel three of them I enjoyed the
one<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.569> was<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.019> most<00:04:01.049> accurate<00:04:01.470> um

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
one that was the most accurate um

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.819 
one that was the most accurate um
because<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.509> helped<00:04:03.900> me<00:04:03.959> for<00:04:04.139> black<00:04:04.290> ops<00:04:04.470> 2<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
because it helped me for black ops 2 the

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.949 
because it helped me for black ops 2 the
most<00:04:05.009> but<00:04:05.310> yeah<00:04:05.489> so<00:04:05.699> this<00:04:05.849> is<00:04:05.909> the<00:04:06.329> whole<00:04:06.509> thing

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
most but yeah so this is the whole thing

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.659 
most but yeah so this is the whole thing
of<00:04:07.259> GG<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.620> know<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:07.919> looks<00:04:08.069> like<00:04:08.189> a<00:04:08.220> tangled

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
of GG I know it looks like a tangled

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.490 
of GG I know it looks like a tangled
mess<00:04:08.729> but<00:04:09.180> really<00:04:09.540> once<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.780> have<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.079> all<00:04:10.199> set

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
mess but really once you have it all set

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.800 
mess but really once you have it all set
up<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.829> kind<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.159> makes<00:04:11.310> sense<00:04:11.609> how<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.449> all<00:04:12.569> is

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
so that is awesome so you can connect it

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.319 
so that is awesome so you can connect it
