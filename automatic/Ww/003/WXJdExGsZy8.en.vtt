00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
this goal zero has some cool features

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
this goal zero has some cool features
about<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.280> right

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
about it what I really like is right

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.270 
about it what I really like is right
here<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.000> produces<00:00:54.570> 350<00:00:55.559> watts<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> can

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
here this produces 350 watts but you can

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.880 
here this produces 350 watts but you can
daisy<00:00:56.520> chain<00:00:56.670> four<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.390> these<00:00:57.510> together<00:00:58.020> as<00:00:58.260> if

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
daisy chain four of these together as if

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.110 
daisy chain four of these together as if
you<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.370> find<00:00:59.579> out<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.820> need<00:00:59.940> more

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
you see if you find out you need more

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.090 
you see if you find out you need more
power<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.690> which<00:01:01.320> would<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> total<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
power and which would be a total of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.729 
power and which would be a total of
fourteen<00:01:02.550> hundred<00:01:02.820> watts<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.379> if<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.530> spin

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
fourteen hundred watts and if you spin

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.929 
fourteen hundred watts and if you spin
this<00:01:04.830> thing<00:01:04.890> around<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.850> it

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this thing around you can see that it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
this thing around you can see that it
has<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.150> kinds<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> ports<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> built-in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
has all kinds of ports has a built-in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.880 
has all kinds of ports has a built-in
inverter<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.600> plug<00:01:10.080> any<00:01:10.350> 110

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
inverter and you can plug any 110

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.429 
inverter and you can plug any 110
standard<00:01:11.430> two<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.210> three<00:01:12.420> prong<00:01:12.630> plug<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.260> here

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
standard two or three prong plug in here

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.770 
standard two or three prong plug in here
and<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.040> anything<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:14.549> 350<00:01:15.270> watts<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.630> less

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and so anything that's 350 watts or less

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359 
and so anything that's 350 watts or less
you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.049> power<00:01:16.259> whether<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.040> computer

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you can power whether that's a computer

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.590 
you can power whether that's a computer
a<00:01:17.670> TV<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:19.380> super<00:01:19.830> small<00:01:20.150> dishwasher<00:01:21.150> anything

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
a TV a super small dishwasher anything

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
a TV a super small dishwasher anything
anything<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.350> 350<00:01:23.070> Watts<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
anything that's 350 Watts and if you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.310 
anything that's 350 Watts and if you
find<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.150> again<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.869> said<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
find out like again like I said if you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.020 
find out like again like I said if you
need<00:01:25.470> more<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.130> daisy<00:01:26.460> chain<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.850> four

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
need more you can daisy chain the four

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.940 
need more you can daisy chain the four
together<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.890> kit<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.549> two<00:01:29.909> 30<00:01:30.299> watt

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
together in this kit I have two 30 watt

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.920 
together in this kit I have two 30 watt
Boulder<00:01:31.950> 30<00:01:32.280> panels<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.030> these<00:01:33.329> produce<00:01:33.720> 30

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
Boulder 30 panels and these produce 30

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.649 
Boulder 30 panels and these produce 30
watts<00:01:34.170> each<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.710> how<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> works<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.390> one

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
watts each and how it works is this one

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.740 
watts each and how it works is this one
is<00:01:37.070> collecting<00:01:38.070> Sun<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:39.119> daisy<00:01:39.360> chain<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
is collecting Sun and you daisy chain it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.450 
is collecting Sun and you daisy chain it
to<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.040> two<00:01:41.220> more

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
to this one then you can have two more

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.580 
to this one then you can have two more
total<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> four<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.450> 120<00:01:43.140> watts<00:01:43.290> power

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
total of four which is 120 watts power

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.109 
total of four which is 120 watts power
and<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:43.829> once<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.939> plugs

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and at once and then this just plugs

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
and at once and then this just plugs
straight<00:01:45.540> into<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.740> battery<00:01:47.009> itself<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
straight into the battery itself and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
straight into the battery itself and

anything small for an extended amount of

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.680 
anything small for an extended amount of
time<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.799> good<00:02:17.010> backup

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
time so this is a really good backup

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.640 
time so this is a really good backup
solution<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:18.930> also<00:02:19.049> really<00:02:19.409> good

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
solution but it's also really good
