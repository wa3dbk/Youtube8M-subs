well I've carved out a pretty solid

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.990 
well I've carved out a pretty solid
square<00:00:33.329> joint<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:34.160> one<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> half<00:00:35.430> inch

weld up to a bar heading across all the
way<00:00:44.969> over<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> where<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> back<00:00:46.710> tire<00:00:47.010> would

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
way over the where the back tire would

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 
way over the where the back tire would
be<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> be

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
be this right here is just going to be

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.310 
be this right here is just going to be
the<00:00:50.340> center<00:00:50.550> support<00:00:51.149> wait<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> give

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the center support wait just to give

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.430 
the center support wait just to give
some<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.739> rigidity<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.050> what's<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.289> on

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
some more rigidity and what's going on

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.740 
some more rigidity and what's going on
it's<00:00:55.739> obviously<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> get<00:00:56.610> chopped<00:00:56.940> by

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it's obviously going to get chopped by

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's obviously going to get chopped by
the<00:00:57.809> bar<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.649> across<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.850> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the bar going across here it's going to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.139 
the bar going across here it's going to
come<00:01:00.480> across<00:01:00.629> shop<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.920> guy<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:03.000> you

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
get another another cable set up

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.569 
get another another cable set up
somewhere<00:02:23.879> around<00:02:24.090> here<00:02:25.400> something<00:02:26.400> like

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
somewhere around here something like

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.550 
somewhere around here something like
that<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.790> for<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.420> throttle<00:02:27.840> purposes<00:02:28.379> I

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
that just for the throttle purposes I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.490 
that just for the throttle purposes I
think<00:02:28.799> it<00:02:28.920> would<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.069> weird<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.609> have<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.500> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
think it would be weird to have to to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.660 
think it would be weird to have to to
cable<00:02:32.040> setups<00:02:32.519> or<00:02:33.739> yeah<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:35.040> might<00:02:35.219> be<00:02:35.400> funny

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
cable setups or yeah it might be funny

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.670 
cable setups or yeah it might be funny
like<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:36.120> one<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.540> top<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.049> paint<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.439> red<00:02:37.620> or

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
like I do one on top and paint it red or

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.890 
like I do one on top and paint it red or
something<00:02:38.310> like<00:02:38.519> this<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.269> plastic

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
something like this just like plastic

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.959 
something like this just like plastic
paint<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.319> then<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.920> other<00:02:40.950> one<00:02:41.099> just<00:02:41.250> silver

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
paint and then the other one just silver

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.879 
paint and then the other one just silver
whatever<00:02:42.959> hopefully<00:02:43.439> I'll<00:02:43.560> be<00:02:43.590> able<00:02:43.769> to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
identify which ones throttle and which

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.349

ones break but you get the idea you guys

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.240 
ones break but you get the idea you guys

this thing you notice I've got a lot of
bare<00:04:30.950> metal<00:04:31.280> I'm<00:04:31.430> prepping<00:04:31.670> everything<00:04:31.940> for

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
bare metal I'm prepping everything for

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.820 
bare metal I'm prepping everything for
welding<00:04:32.780> purposes<00:04:33.970> I'm<00:04:34.970> thinking<00:04:35.240> about<00:04:35.830> just

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
welding purposes I'm thinking about just

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.770 
welding purposes I'm thinking about just
a<00:04:36.950> flat<00:04:37.160> plate<00:04:37.430> just<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.970> flat<00:04:38.180> plate<00:04:38.420> that<00:04:38.630> goes

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
a flat plate just a flat plate that goes

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.020 
a flat plate just a flat plate that goes
from<00:04:39.140> you<00:04:39.530> know<00:04:39.650> just<00:04:40.070> a<00:04:40.190> rectangle<00:04:40.730> that<00:04:40.850> just

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
from you know just a rectangle that just

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.790 
from you know just a rectangle that just
goes<00:04:41.210> over<00:04:41.450> all<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:41.840> stuff<00:04:42.110> right<00:04:42.350> here<00:04:42.380> and

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
goes over all this stuff right here and

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.090 
goes over all this stuff right here and
then<00:04:43.460> just<00:04:43.700> welding<00:04:44.150> it<00:04:44.300> some<00:04:44.950> welding<00:04:45.950> in

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
then just welding it some welding in

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.610 
then just welding it some welding in
place<00:04:46.430> making<00:04:47.360> sure<00:04:47.480> everything<00:04:48.140> is<00:04:48.230> square

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
place making sure everything is square

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.950 
place making sure everything is square
and<00:04:48.650> flat<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.430> so<00:04:49.580> forth<00:04:49.880> like<00:04:49.940> that<00:04:50.120> oh<00:04:50.600> it's

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
and flat and so forth like that oh it's

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.950 
and flat and so forth like that oh it's
a<00:04:51.050> war<00:04:51.260> wound<00:04:51.410> right<00:04:51.830> there<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.420> you<00:04:53.420> know

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
a war wound right there and you know

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.240 
a war wound right there and you know
then<00:04:54.560> just<00:04:55.780> checking<00:04:56.780> you<00:04:57.110> know<00:04:57.230> gap<00:04:57.590> in<00:04:57.920> space

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
then just checking you know gap in space

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.220 
then just checking you know gap in space
and<00:04:58.550> whatnot<00:04:58.820> and<00:04:59.060> then<00:04:59.540> just<00:04:59.720> welding<00:05:00.140> the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
and whatnot and then just welding the

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.650 
and whatnot and then just welding the
snot<00:05:00.470> out<00:05:00.680> of<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:00.950> in<00:05:01.100> place<00:05:01.370> keep<00:05:02.330> some

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
snot out of that in place keep some

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.020 
snot out of that in place keep some
rigidity<00:05:03.500> going<00:05:03.830> because<00:05:04.370> just<00:05:04.640> for<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:04.850> hell

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
rigidity going because just for the hell

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.030 
rigidity going because just for the hell
of<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.270> I'm<00:05:05.480> just<00:05:06.110> like<00:05:06.290> stepping<00:05:06.620> on<00:05:06.890> this

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
of it I'm just like stepping on this

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.280 
of it I'm just like stepping on this
thing<00:05:07.280> right<00:05:07.460> here<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.970> I'm<00:05:08.750> just<00:05:08.930> seeing<00:05:09.170> a

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
thing right here and I'm just seeing a

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.530 
thing right here and I'm just seeing a
 ton<00:05:10.280> of<00:05:10.340> flex<00:05:10.700> I'm<00:05:11.000> obviously<00:05:11.180> not

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
 ton of flex I'm obviously not

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.480 
 ton of flex I'm obviously not
putting<00:05:11.960> my<00:05:12.050> full<00:05:12.290> weight<00:05:12.320> on<00:05:12.530> there<00:05:12.890> but<00:05:13.370> I'm

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
putting my full weight on there but I'm

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.340 
putting my full weight on there but I'm
just<00:05:13.700> like<00:05:13.940> that's<00:05:14.570> as<00:05:14.750> much<00:05:14.900> as<00:05:14.960> I<00:05:15.140> want<00:05:15.320> to

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
just like that's as much as I want to

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.620 
just like that's as much as I want to
test<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:15.710> out<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.430> it's<00:05:16.850> very<00:05:17.120> obvious<00:05:17.600> that

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630

like that so yeah it's going to be heavy

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.530 
like that so yeah it's going to be heavy
heavy<00:05:54.770> bicycle<00:05:55.400> coming<00:05:55.790> down<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:56.060> road<00:05:56.270> and

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
pedals how to deal with the pedal

pedals how to deal with the pedal
situation<00:06:03.560> that's<00:06:04.430> that<00:06:05.300> start<00:06:05.630> in<00:06:05.720> line

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
situation that's that start in line

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.630 
situation that's that start in line
