boring

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
boring

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.430 
boring
maybe<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:58.450> because<00:02:58.600> I'd<00:02:58.900> come<00:02:59.110> straight

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
maybe it's because I'd come straight

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.320 
maybe it's because I'd come straight

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
from Rayman legends at the time but just

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.750 
from Rayman legends at the time but just
something<00:03:02.049> about<00:03:02.140> this<00:03:02.530> seemed<00:03:02.860> really<00:03:03.310> slow

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
something about this seemed really slow

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.030 
something about this seemed really slow
and<00:03:04.090> lacking<00:03:04.570> energy<00:03:04.750> right<00:03:05.230> really<00:03:05.680> couldn't

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
and lacking energy right really couldn't

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.949 
and lacking energy right really couldn't
you<00:03:06.100> have<00:03:06.250> done<00:03:06.430> better<00:03:06.670> than<00:03:07.030> one<00:03:07.330> static

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
you have done better than one static

the level could play out in a completely
different<00:04:07.400> way<00:04:07.760> for<00:04:08.090> example<00:04:08.150> because<00:04:09.050> I'm

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
different way for example because I'm

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.229 
different way for example because I'm

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
there's so many of them but instead they

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.550 
there's so many of them but instead they
turned<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.330> into<00:04:29.389> something<00:04:29.780> really<00:04:30.320> creative

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
turned it into something really creative

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.010 
turned it into something really creative
it's<00:04:31.130> great<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.460> see<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.610> game<00:04:31.850> in<00:04:32.030> 2013<00:04:32.389> that

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
it's great to see a game in 2013 that

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.170 
it's great to see a game in 2013 that
really<00:04:33.380> has<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:33.889> much<00:04:34.190> fun<00:04:34.430> with<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:34.790> medium

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.700 
really has this much fun with the medium
I<00:04:35.330> mean<00:04:35.510> look<00:04:35.660> at<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:36.020> what<00:04:36.410> Broadway

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
I mean look at that what Broadway

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.740 
I mean look at that what Broadway
production<00:04:37.520> would<00:04:37.639> be<00:04:37.820> able<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:38.120> achieve<00:04:38.330> that

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
production would be able to achieve that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.620 
production would be able to achieve that
it's<00:04:39.050> so<00:04:39.350> wacky<00:04:39.760> creative<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:40.940> fun<00:04:41.270> it's

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
it's so wacky creative and fun it's

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.840 
it's so wacky creative and fun it's
honestly<00:04:42.050> like<00:04:42.290> a<00:04:42.320> stage<00:04:42.680> play<00:04:43.040> directed<00:04:43.639> by

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
honestly like a stage play directed by

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.270 
honestly like a stage play directed by
Hayao<00:04:44.240> Miyazaki<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.560> is<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.860> best<00:04:46.070> way<00:04:46.250> I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
Hayao Miyazaki that is the best way I

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.740 
Hayao Miyazaki that is the best way I
can<00:04:46.400> put<00:04:46.550> this<00:04:46.910> game<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.389> if<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:47.540> doesn't

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
can put this game and if that doesn't

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.530 
can put this game and if that doesn't
sound<00:04:48.020> awesome<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.710> then<00:04:48.950> stop<00:04:49.940> watching

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
seem all too likely which is a shame I

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.390
