00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
not be happening in any school a lot of

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.870 
not be happening in any school a lot of
people<00:02:26.740> consider<00:02:27.010> as<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> dangerous<00:02:27.640> school

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
people consider as a dangerous school

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.370 
people consider as a dangerous school
but<00:02:28.060> they're<00:02:28.210> not<00:02:28.450> here<00:02:28.690> every<00:02:28.870> day<00:02:29.140> they

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
but they're not here every day they

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.710 
but they're not here every day they
haven't<00:02:29.709> seen<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.580> progress<00:02:31.150> we<00:02:31.270> have<00:02:31.600> made

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
haven't seen the progress we have made

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.690 
haven't seen the progress we have made
over<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.260> years<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.310> don't<00:02:33.550> really

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
over the years so I don't really

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.890 
over the years so I don't really
consider<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.180> one<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.510> most<00:02:34.690> dangerous

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
consider as one of the most dangerous

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.230 
consider as one of the most dangerous
schools<00:02:35.380> but<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.620> considered<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.670> we<00:02:36.820> need

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
schools but I considered that we need

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.910 
schools but I considered that we need
more<00:02:37.420> work<00:02:37.600> like<00:02:38.080> any<00:02:38.200> other<00:02:38.320> school<00:02:38.620> there's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
more work like any other school there's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.060 
more work like any other school there's
always<00:02:39.070> work<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:39.520> improvement
