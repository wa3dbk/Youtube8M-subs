00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.210 

alright<00:00:00.539> let's<00:00:00.750> say<00:00:00.900> we<00:00:01.050> want<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.410> plot<00:00:01.890> some

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
alright let's say we want to plot some

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.710 
alright let's say we want to plot some
3d<00:00:02.909> points<00:00:03.980> using<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.190> graph<00:00:05.759> er<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.450> comes

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
3d points using the graph er that comes

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.490 
3d points using the graph er that comes
with<00:00:07.040> Macintosh<00:00:08.150> so<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.540> start<00:00:09.780> Grapher<00:00:10.290> and

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
with Macintosh so you start Grapher and

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.870 
with Macintosh so you start Grapher and
then<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.679> get<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.980> little<00:00:11.280> window<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.849> you

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
then you get this little window so you

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.820 
then you get this little window so you
can<00:00:12.000> either<00:00:12.150> plot<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.620> two-dimensional<00:00:13.620> graph

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
can either plot a two-dimensional graph

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010 
can either plot a two-dimensional graph
or<00:00:14.099> three-dimensional<00:00:14.790> graph<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.750> choose

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
or three-dimensional graph so choose

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.450 
or three-dimensional graph so choose
three<00:00:16.260> differential<00:00:16.619> graph<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.250> I'm<00:00:17.310> just

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
three differential graph and I'm just

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.380 
three differential graph and I'm just
going<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.609> leave<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.029> default<00:00:20.150> alright<00:00:21.150> so

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
going to leave it on default alright so

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.490 
going to leave it on default alright so
it<00:00:22.970> opens<00:00:23.970> up<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.480> new<00:00:26.599> graph<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.019> got<00:00:28.260> your

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
it opens up a new graph and you got your

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.209 
it opens up a new graph and you got your
three<00:00:28.920> axes<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:31.219> three-dimensional

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
three axes for three-dimensional

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
three axes for three-dimensional
coordinate<00:00:32.640> system<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.149> got<00:00:33.239> x-axis<00:00:34.020> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
coordinate system you got x-axis a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.650 
coordinate system you got x-axis a
y-axis<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.950> are<00:00:35.280> sort<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.000> horizontal

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
y-axis that are sort of the horizontal

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.560 
y-axis that are sort of the horizontal
ones<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> level<00:00:38.850> plane<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
ones or like on a level plane and the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.100 
ones or like on a level plane and the
vertical<00:00:39.930> axis<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.770> z<00:00:40.800> axis<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.840> if<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.930> want

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
vertical axis the z axis so if you want

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.100 
vertical axis the z axis so if you want
to<00:00:43.170> plot<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> single<00:00:44.010> point<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.989> up

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
to plot a single point you can go up

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.799 
to plot a single point you can go up
here<00:00:46.140> into<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> equation<00:00:47.160> bar<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:48.329> delete

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
here into the equation bar just delete

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.170 
here into the equation bar just delete
off<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.410> Z<00:00:50.039> equals<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.820> we're<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
off the Z equals because we're going to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.760 
off the Z equals because we're going to
put<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.449> an<00:00:51.570> equation<00:00:51.870> we're<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:52.620> in

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
put in an equation we're going to put in

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.819 
put in an equation we're going to put in
a<00:00:52.949> single<00:00:53.850> point<00:00:54.120> come<00:00:55.020> over<00:00:55.289> here<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.680> this

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
a single point come over here to this

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.630 
a single point come over here to this
chooser<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.750> far<00:00:57.960> right<00:00:58.199> side<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.039> choose

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
chooser on the far right side and choose

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.660 
chooser on the far right side and choose
one<00:00:59.940> of<00:00:59.969> these<00:01:00.239> three<00:01:01.140> by<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.410> matrices<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
one of these three by one matrices it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.950 
one of these three by one matrices it
has<00:01:02.850> XY<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> Z<00:01:04.280> okay<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:06.270> put<00:01:06.570> an<00:01:06.659> equal

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
has XY and Z okay and then put an equal

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.020 
has XY and Z okay and then put an equal
sign<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:09.110> then<00:01:10.110> another<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> those<00:01:11.280> three

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
sign and then another one of those three

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.050 
sign and then another one of those three
by<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.689> three<00:01:12.930> by<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.290> matrices<00:01:13.970> okay<00:01:14.970> so

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
by or three by one matrices okay so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.330 
by or three by one matrices okay so
you've<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.630> coordinates<00:01:16.439> X<00:01:16.619> Y<00:01:16.799> Z<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
you've got your coordinates X Y Z and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.969 
you've got your coordinates X Y Z and
then<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> second<00:01:18.299> Matrix<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:19.259> simply<00:01:19.740> put

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
then in the second Matrix you simply put

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.120 
then in the second Matrix you simply put
in<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.460> values<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.689> want<00:01:21.990> let's<00:01:22.890> sort

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
in the values that you want let's sort

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.950 
in the values that you want let's sort
of<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.310> inside<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> matrix<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> delete<00:01:24.930> out

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
of get inside the matrix and delete out

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.609 
of get inside the matrix and delete out
X<00:01:26.960> they<00:01:27.960> put<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:29.960> get<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.320> again

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
X they put in one get in there again

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
X they put in one get in there again
delete<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.159> y<00:01:32.570> put<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.750> three<00:01:35.180> there<00:01:36.180> again

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
delete out y put in three there again

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.950 
delete out y put in three there again
delete<00:01:37.700> Z<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.060> put<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:41.369> return<00:01:41.960> and

delete Z and put in to a to return and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.289 
delete Z and put in to a to return and
it<00:01:43.049> plus<00:01:43.290> my<00:01:43.530> point<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> there's<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.390> point<00:01:45.950> and

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
it plus my point so there's my point and

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.080 
it plus my point so there's my point and
you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.570> click<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.530> axes<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.729> rotate

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you can click on the axes and rotate

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.420 
you can click on the axes and rotate
them<00:01:51.210> around<00:01:51.799> look<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:52.979> them<00:01:53.100> from<00:01:53.250> different

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
them around look at them from different

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.620 
them around look at them from different
directions<00:01:53.869> etc<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.390> change<00:01:57.390> some<00:01:57.600> things

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
directions etc so to change some things

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.770 
directions etc so to change some things
to<00:01:57.930> make<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.110> maybe<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.649> easier<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> see

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
to make it maybe a little easier to see

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.690 
to make it maybe a little easier to see
you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.100> format<00:02:02.909> menu<00:02:03.180> and

you can go up to the format menu and
choose<00:02:05.700> layout<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:08.420> you'll<00:02:09.420> get<00:02:09.690> background

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
choose layout and you'll get background

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.800 
choose layout and you'll get background
lighting<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.250> miscellaneous

generally with a Vista leader in the
background<00:02:15.540> black<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.990> pretty<00:02:16.410> good<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:17.340> you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
background black is pretty good if you

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.210 
background black is pretty good if you
go<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> lighting<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.440> kind<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.800> pull

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
go to lighting I kind of like to pull

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.340 
go to lighting I kind of like to pull
down<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.640> go<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.910> color<00:02:21.360> contrast<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.260> it

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
down on this go to color contrast and it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.590 
down on this go to color contrast and it
gives<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.460> three<00:02:24.120> colors<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
gives you the three colors of the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.560 
gives you the three colors of the
rainbow<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.710> makes<00:02:25.980> things<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.580> little<00:02:27.360> more

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
rainbow so it makes things a little more

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.330 
rainbow so it makes things a little more
colorful<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:30.320> then<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.590> could<00:02:31.770> go<00:02:31.890> back<00:02:32.070> to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
colorful and then I could go back to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.630 
colorful and then I could go back to
format<00:02:32.760> again<00:02:33.320> choose<00:02:34.320> axes<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.040> frame<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
format again choose axes and frame and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.550 
format again choose axes and frame and
then<00:02:36.630> if<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.840> turn<00:02:37.020> on<00:02:37.080> frame<00:02:39.650> then<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:41.280> puts<00:02:41.610> a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
then if you turn on frame then it puts a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.930 
then if you turn on frame then it puts a
the<00:02:43.560> whole<00:02:43.740> coordinate<00:02:44.280> system<00:02:44.580> inside<00:02:44.880> of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the whole coordinate system inside of

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.610 
the whole coordinate system inside of
cube<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.570> when<00:02:45.750> you're<00:02:45.870> first<00:02:46.050> working<00:02:46.170> with

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
cube so when you're first working with

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.560 
cube so when you're first working with
three-dimensional<00:02:47.400> points<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.330> little

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
three-dimensional points it's a little

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.840 
three-dimensional points it's a little
easier<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.900> kind<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.200> orient<00:02:49.590> yourself<00:02:50.070> if<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
easier to kind of orient yourself if you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.770 
easier to kind of orient yourself if you
got<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.270> within<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.500> frame<00:02:53.420> all<00:02:54.420> right<00:02:54.600> now

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
got this within the frame all right now

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.720 
got this within the frame all right now
sometimes<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.440> might<00:02:55.590> want<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.920> plot<00:02:56.160> several

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
sometimes you might want to plot several

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.660 
sometimes you might want to plot several
points<00:02:56.940> at<00:02:57.209> once<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:57.980> which<00:02:58.980> case<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.370> can<00:02:59.459> go

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
points at once in which case you can go

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.300 
points at once in which case you can go
up<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.850> equation<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.880> make<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> choice<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:04.310> new

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
up to equation and make a choice of new

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.949 
up to equation and make a choice of new
point<00:03:05.850> set<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:08.970> get<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:09.810> you

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
point set and you get this and then you

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.910 
point set and you get this and then you
can<00:03:10.230> edit<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:11.070> points<00:03:11.489> click<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.150> edit<00:03:12.450> points

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
can edit the points click on edit points

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.810 
can edit the points click on edit points
so<00:03:14.090> here<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.480> plotting<00:03:16.050> four<00:03:16.290> points

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
so here this is plotting four points

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.020 
so here this is plotting four points
here's<00:03:17.820> my<00:03:18.090> XY<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.260> z<00:03:19.530> coordinates<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.670> column

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
here's my XY and z coordinates in column

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.360 
here's my XY and z coordinates in column
zero<00:03:21.360> or<00:03:21.750> columns<00:03:22.560> one<00:03:22.739> two<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.190> three<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:25.370> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
zero or columns one two and three so the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.850 
zero or columns one two and three so the
way<00:03:26.489> this<00:03:26.610> is<00:03:26.670> going<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.000> work<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.450> if<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.290> just

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
way this is going to work is if I just

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.330 
way this is going to work is if I just
do<00:03:29.070> okay<00:03:29.580> it<00:03:30.330> not<00:03:31.049> only<00:03:31.080> plots<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.739> points<00:03:32.190> but

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
do okay it not only plots the points but

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.229 
do okay it not only plots the points but
it<00:03:32.549> puts<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.120> line<00:03:33.360> in<00:03:33.660> between<00:03:33.690> them<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:35.239> you

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
it puts a line in between them so you

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.229 
it puts a line in between them so you
can<00:03:36.750> do<00:03:36.900> figures<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.430> go<00:03:38.610> back<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.940> edit

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
can do figures so I go back to edit

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.460 
can do figures so I go back to edit
points<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:41.299> I'm<00:03:42.299> just<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> click<00:03:43.260> this

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
points and I'm just going to click this

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.069 
points and I'm just going to click this
bottom<00:03:43.890> row<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:45.840> do<00:03:46.160> delete<00:03:47.840> get<00:03:48.840> rid<00:03:48.989> of

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
bottom row and just do delete get rid of

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.460 
bottom row and just do delete get rid of
that<00:03:49.260> one<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.650> then<00:03:50.780> I'd<00:03:51.780> say<00:03:52.049> I'm<00:03:52.200> going<00:03:52.380> to

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
that one and then I'd say I'm going to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.830 
that one and then I'd say I'm going to
double<00:03:53.340> click<00:03:53.489> on<00:03:53.700> one<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:53.940> those<00:03:54.090> numbers<00:03:54.570> and

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
double click on one of those numbers and

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.259 
double click on one of those numbers and
I<00:03:55.110> can<00:03:55.320> change<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.250> make<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.519> zero<00:03:57.000> zero

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
I can change it so make that zero zero

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.420 
I can change it so make that zero zero
zero<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:57.690> there's<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.019> origin<00:03:58.500> I'll<00:03:59.250> leave

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
zero so there's the origin I'll leave

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.490 
zero so there's the origin I'll leave
this<00:03:59.579> one<00:03:59.730> at<00:03:59.850> 1<00:04:00.030> 1<00:04:00.209> 2<00:04:00.420> leave<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:00.989> one<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.200> two

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
this one at 1 1 2 leave this one a two

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.430 
this one at 1 1 2 leave this one a two
zero<00:04:01.799> three<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.459> then<00:04:03.209> I'm<00:04:03.570> going<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.840> add

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
zero three and then I'm going to add

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.229 
zero three and then I'm going to add
another<00:04:04.950> one<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:05.670> I'm<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:05.820> going<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.060> click

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
another one so I'm just going to click

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.610 
another one so I'm just going to click
this<00:04:06.360> row<00:04:06.600> at<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.720> bottom<00:04:06.780> double<00:04:07.440> click

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
this row at the bottom double click

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.500 
this row at the bottom double click
where<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.860> x<00:04:08.040> coordinate<00:04:08.489> is<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.940> I'm<00:04:09.390> going

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
where the x coordinate is and I'm going

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.670 
where the x coordinate is and I'm going
to<00:04:09.570> put<00:04:09.720> back<00:04:09.870> in<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.200> origin<00:04:11.060> for<00:04:12.060> this<00:04:12.239> point

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
to put back in the origin for this point

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.560 
to put back in the origin for this point
so<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:14.130> automatically<00:04:14.640> put<00:04:14.880> in<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.090> other<00:04:15.329> two

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
so it automatically put in the other two

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.729 
so it automatically put in the other two
zeros<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.680> what<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.549> does<00:04:17.850> is<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.780> draws<00:04:19.290> from

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
zeros so what that does is it draws from

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.520 
zeros so what that does is it draws from
the<00:04:19.890> first<00:04:20.130> point<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.000> second<00:04:21.539> point<00:04:21.570> to

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
the first point to the second point to

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.050 
the first point to the second point to
the<00:04:22.650> third<00:04:22.890> point<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.400> then<00:04:23.580> back<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
the third point and then back to the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.570 
the third point and then back to the
first<00:04:24.270> point<00:04:24.599> so<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.140> get<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.410> closed<00:04:25.770> figure

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
first point so I get a closed figure

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.719 
first point so I get a closed figure
so<00:04:26.849> now<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.090> have<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.419> triangle<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.650> one<00:04:29.039> vertex

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
so now I have a triangle with one vertex

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.219 
so now I have a triangle with one vertex
at<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:29.970> origin<00:04:31.729> and<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:33.270> other<00:04:33.539> two<00:04:33.750> vertex

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
at the origin and the other two vertex

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.820 
at the origin and the other two vertex
is<00:04:34.409> up<00:04:34.650> in<00:04:35.009> three-dimensional<00:04:35.970> space<00:04:36.830> another

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
is up in three-dimensional space another

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.950 
is up in three-dimensional space another
thing<00:04:38.069> that<00:04:38.220> can<00:04:38.370> be<00:04:38.430> nice<00:04:38.879> here<00:04:39.360> when<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.810> get

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960
