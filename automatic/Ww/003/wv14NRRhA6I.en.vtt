00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.670
 Unfortunately, christoph has his own this morning 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.650
 vote lost so I take over 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.900
 today's episode and that with this 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.639
 topic of artificial intelligence in many 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.559
 Films and books are often called ks 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.510
 overpowering computer programs 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.439
 represented the whole of humanity 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.390
 want to wipe out 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.010
 but how real are these scenarios 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.640
 really and how can we counter that 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.350
 protect 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.279
 the answer is now available at clixoom 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.279
 science fiction 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.430
 Who of you ever a 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.710
 computer program has written itself 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.960
 you know you have to say the computer precisely 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.760
 what happens in which order 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.350
 one should only do it at the same time 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.760
 a little mistake then that is 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.420
 program often not capable at all 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.860
 start 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.900
 so how do you bring such a 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.420
 to think of the program independently 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.129
 to evolve or even 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.930
 to solve tasks of which one even 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.780
 has no idea how to solve them 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.850
 in 1956, the electro 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.070
 engineer us series the task 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.900
 to program this computer so 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.000
 he would beat him in the checkers 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.220
 One thing came to accomplish this 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.869
 brilliant idea he dropped the computer 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.270
 Play against yourself thousands of times 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.610
 As a result , the machine gained experience 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.860
 which has been saved in the form of rules 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.630
 and it worked six years already 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.490
 later the computer could do the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.540
 national champion of connecticut im 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.579
 defeat checkers 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.220
 the machine was a huge success and 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.960
 At that time a sensation it was the first one 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.420
 familiar form of a self-learning 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.460
 Processes made by humans 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.560
 but where do we stand today when it comes to 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.600
 artificial intelligence goes this 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.219
 Japanese supercomputer was in front of three 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.319
 years the fastest computer on the 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.060
 world in a collaboration between 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.609
 German and Japanese researchers 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.740
 one simulated with over 1000 millions 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.060
 calculations per seconds 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.999
 human brain 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.950
 Well, you simulated a one 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.719
 human brain and for this one 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.450
 second activity had the 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.819
 supercomputer for 40 minutes 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.219
 the brain is incredibly complex 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.689
 however, that does not mean that 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.490
 computer could not be the same as 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.520
 we also interact with the so-called 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.440
 Deep learning can be algorithms symbols 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.230
 and understand concepts 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.910
 In 2012, Google let one such 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.340
 algorithm to tens of thousands of 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.780
 youtube videos going on in the end could be the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.510
 computer with an accuracy of 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.970
 after all, 70 percent cats and humans 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.190
 without him ever knowing anything about 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.660
 cats or people was brought in 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.310
 the algorithm learned completely 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.590
 independently from the youtube videos 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.870
 google uses this algorithm today 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.670
 to be able to find similar pictures in the net 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.020
 but we humans are always, of course 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.840
 even better in understanding and above all 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.000
 in the interpretation of images or well 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.250
 this benchmark test for image recognition 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.840
 algorithms shows that the best 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.670
 software that already exists today 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.350
 twice as good at recognizing 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.870
 street signs is as one 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.670
 average german car driver 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.500
 the ibm computer watson beats the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.360
 two best jeopardy players in the world 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.220
 im rapper 's and is almost 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.650
 invincible in the pokervariante texas 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.270
 not only does he hold'em to almost 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.950
 each quiz independently 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.050
 he also understands what the answer 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.760
 quizmaster has just asked them and 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.560
 answers in grammatically correct 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.870
 set and even witty at times 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.480
 even learning computers can do that 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.320
 already today see read answers and 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.000
 to learn 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.530
 for many people is so difficult 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.420
 to imagine that your own work 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.810
 Once replaced by a machine 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.430
 should 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.900
 my work is far too complex 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.070
 for a computer we can do that 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.780
 because they can ever do it 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.910
 but according to a study are in the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.440
 Most countries over 80 percent of 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.900
 jobs called service 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.540
 jobs whose main job is it 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.280
 to read and to see so 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.630
 exactly what computer is now for a short time 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.090
 always better control 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.130
 the biggest danger of oneself 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.680
 So, the learning computer goes out is the 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.060
 the great unemployment and that are 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.650
 not only the jobs for the none 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.840
 academic education is needed 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.850
 even doctors and lawyers need to be in 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.769
 really watch forward one 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.050
 precedent from thousands of cases 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.280
 Find or make a diagnosis 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.140
 all symptoms of the patient 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.850
 considered that could be computer 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.830
 soon to do much more efficiently 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.690
 as intelligent people with a university 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.820
 conclusion and in contrast to 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.410
 Industrial revolution will be around 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.090
 be a lot harder for this 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.519
 people an alternative workplace 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.930
 to find self-learning algorithms 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.060
 spread in all areas of the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.970
 society out without new jobs 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.350
 to accomplish 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.530
 that will be one of the biggest political 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.090
 Problems of the next 50 years be the end 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.200
 Mask is often used with the comic heroine 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.850
 compared 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.860
 He is founder of companies like 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.410
 spacex about that we here at pixum 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.950
 More frequently paypal and tesla report 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.300
 motors 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.800
 and he is a pioneer in the field 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.110
 the promising and 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.760
 far-reaching projects according to all masc 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.990
 Artificial intelligence is one 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.640
 more dangerous invention for the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.830
 Humanity as the atomic bomb 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.570
 He invests in many companies 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.760
 to deal with the topic one 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.130
 eye on the industry to throw according to el 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.440
 mÃ¡s artificial intelligence as long as no 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.340
 problem as long as you are careful and with 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.050
 says goes on 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.270
 but it only needs a small state 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.430
 with evil intentions or a mighty one 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.180
 organization for fatal damage 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.800
 to wreak 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.470
 programs are always self-contained 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.390
 rewrite and reproduce 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.370
 can the internet and everything with it 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.050
 is connected but also control 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.700
 Without evil intentions can be a software 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.110
 mistake or a thoughtless part of one 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.030
 such artificial intelligence 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.800
 run devastatingly out of control 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.900
 admittedly that sounds all here now 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.669
 very much after science and fiction film yet 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.620
 an open letter of the future of life 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.390
 institute warned now just before 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.160
 one must have the positive possibilities 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.900
 explore these programs 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.430
 but at the same time the potential 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.740
 to control danger behind it 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.780
 The open letter was not even made 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.070
 has published two weeks but 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.150
 already from thousands of 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.610
 scientists and researchers 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.020
 have received signatures all 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.840
 great respect for the possible 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.310
 Impact of artificial intelligence 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.320
 is among the signatures give 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.490
 Himself also stephen hawking himself 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.710
 through a smart computer 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.610
 All masc is able to communicate as well 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.650
 at the same time have over it 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.080
 spoken and the development team of 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.940
 ibm that programs the computer watson 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.560
 has driven those of these 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.750
 algorithms goes out is the so-called 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.460
 snowball the more the program 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.130
 Knowing faster is new 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.510
 Things are at an exponential pace 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.460
 the machine more intelligent than one 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.479
 human and a programmed rule 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.620
 could be from the program itself 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.590
 be rewritten 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.570
 or otherwise interpreted as eg 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.060
 prevents a machine the 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.020
 people harm is inflicted 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.350
 maybe by preventing that from happening 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.490
 human being is born at all 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.290
 it is hard to say what such a thing 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.090
 Machine thinks and how to 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.800
 but humanity will be in the end 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.870
 would be the machines and intellectually so 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.640
 Think about how we are doing right now 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.350
 are and our fate would be mine 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.170
 depend as well as the fate of monkeys 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.980
 or dogs at the moment depends on us 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.050
 are just as superior to us 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.580
 probably aliens in case that 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.870
 we'll meet extraterrestrial ones 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.410
 are already being prepared 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.030
 met 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.280
 more about this exciting topic easy 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.410
 Aliens preparing for this video 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.030
 the first contact all info and still

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.220
 they discussed using to our advantage 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.300
