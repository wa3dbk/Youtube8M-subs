 service is buggy when you click download 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.569
 image then text which is written 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.519

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.560
 let's see what happened now see 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.940
 little text has changed here so here 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.830
 so he looks here he looks now 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.890
 a little bit different but in principle it 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.459
 tolerant here if you want everything 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.290
