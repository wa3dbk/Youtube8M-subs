00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
smouldering on the corner of the front

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.850 
smouldering on the corner of the front
of<00:00:25.599> the<00:00:25.660> corner<00:00:25.930> of<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.050> building<00:00:26.410> here<00:00:26.619> and

of the corner of the building here and

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.580 
of the corner of the building here and
decided<00:00:27.670> without<00:00:27.790> any<00:00:28.150> extra<00:00:28.390> crews<00:00:28.689> here<00:00:28.960> we

decided without any extra crews here we

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.500 
decided without any extra crews here we
would<00:00:29.800> first<00:00:30.220> see<00:00:30.460> open<00:00:30.850> that<00:00:30.970> up<00:00:31.150> and<00:00:31.270> see<00:00:31.420> if

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
would first see open that up and see if

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.880 
would first see open that up and see if
that<00:00:31.689> was<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.900> extent<00:00:32.080> of<00:00:32.320> where<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.650> fire

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
that was the extent of where the fire

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.070 
that was the extent of where the fire
was<00:00:32.920> so<00:00:33.850> we're<00:00:34.030> opening<00:00:34.390> up<00:00:34.540> with<00:00:34.720> a<00:00:34.780> hose<00:00:34.930> line

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
was so we're opening up with a hose line

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.020 
was so we're opening up with a hose line
knocking<00:00:35.650> it<00:00:35.739> down<00:00:35.769> once<00:00:36.610> we<00:00:36.670> got<00:00:36.820> that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
knocking it down once we got that

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.640 
knocking it down once we got that
accomplished<00:00:37.629> we<00:00:37.780> thought<00:00:37.989> we'd<00:00:38.140> go<00:00:38.260> inside

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.100 
accomplished we thought we'd go inside
and<00:00:38.890> check<00:00:39.010> out<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:39.400> interior<00:00:39.750> we're<00:00:40.750> getting

we<00:01:24.720> figured<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.530> had<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.830> small<00:01:26.130> fire

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
we figured was we just had a small fire

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.640 
we figured was we just had a small fire
possibly<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.630> said<00:01:27.900> flames<00:01:28.200> coming<00:01:28.619> from

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
possibly they said flames coming from

possibly they said flames coming from
the<00:01:28.800> roof<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.310> expected<00:01:29.850> maybe<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.390> exhaust

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960

system in restaurants like this

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.280 
system in restaurants like this
occasionally<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.509> built<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.050> grease

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
occasionally get built up with grease

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.530

but we didn't see anything other than a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.910 
but we didn't see anything other than a
little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.930> light<00:01:37.080> smoke<00:01:37.380> probably<00:01:37.770> from

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
little bit of light smoke probably from

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.969

that they're still teaming up and so no

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.200 
that they're still teaming up and so no
we<00:01:41.159> didn't<00:01:41.340> expect<00:01:41.580> an<00:01:41.790> explosion

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210
