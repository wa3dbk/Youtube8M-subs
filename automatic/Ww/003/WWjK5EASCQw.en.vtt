I'd like to talk to you about the circle
or<00:00:12.160> the<00:00:12.190> cycle<00:00:12.700> of<00:00:12.880> fifths<00:00:13.290> now<00:00:14.290> the<00:00:14.980> cycle<00:00:15.340> of

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
or the cycle of fifths now the cycle of

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.550 
or the cycle of fifths now the cycle of
fifths<00:00:15.730> is<00:00:16.059> all<00:00:16.269> twelve<00:00:16.779> notes<00:00:16.900> in<00:00:17.439> the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
fifths is all twelve notes in the

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.679 
fifths is all twelve notes in the
chromatic<00:00:17.739> scale<00:00:24.149> so<00:00:25.149> there<00:00:25.300> we<00:00:25.419> have<00:00:25.569> the

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
chromatic scale so there we have the

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.109 
chromatic scale so there we have the
chromatic<00:00:26.140> scale<00:00:26.169> and<00:00:26.739> they're<00:00:27.369> arranged<00:00:27.939> in

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
chromatic scale and they're arranged in

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.970 
chromatic scale and they're arranged in
fifths<00:00:28.869> separated<00:00:29.589> by<00:00:29.710> fifths<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:32.439> up<00:00:32.649> or

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
fifths separated by fifths going up or

what is it what does it do for me well
two<00:00:59.300> things<00:00:59.650> as<00:01:00.650> we<00:01:00.890> go<00:01:00.920> up<00:01:01.810> we<00:01:02.810> can<00:01:02.930> think<00:01:03.050> of

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
two things as we go up we can think of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.810 
two things as we go up we can think of
each<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:03.470> those<00:01:03.560> notes<00:01:03.890> as<00:01:04.100> representing<00:01:04.699> a

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
each of those notes as representing a

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
key now in each key if we have the key

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.000 
key now in each key if we have the key
of<00:01:07.670> C<00:01:08.180> it's<00:01:09.020> based<00:01:09.350> on<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.680> C<00:01:09.980> major<00:01:10.250> scale

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
of C it's based on the C major scale

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.040 
of C it's based on the C major scale
it's<00:01:13.010> all<00:01:13.280> white<00:01:13.580> keys<00:01:13.940> there's<00:01:14.300> no<00:01:14.480> sharps<00:01:14.930> or

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
it's all white keys there's no sharps or

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.820 
it's all white keys there's no sharps or
no<00:01:15.470> flats<00:01:15.910> now<00:01:16.910> if<00:01:17.030> we<00:01:17.150> go<00:01:17.300> up<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.570> fifth<00:01:17.900> which

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
no flats now if we go up a fifth which

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.500 
no flats now if we go up a fifth which
is<00:01:19.040> just<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.460> right<00:01:19.550> on<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.000> circle<00:01:20.240> of

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
is just to the right on the circle of

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.219 
is just to the right on the circle of
fifths<00:01:20.720> we<00:01:21.020> get<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.620> G<00:01:22.060> now<00:01:23.060> in<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.360> key<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.750> G

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
fifths we get the G now in the key of G

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.370 
fifths we get the G now in the key of G
there<00:01:25.220> is<00:01:25.250> one<00:01:25.640> black<00:01:25.880> note<00:01:26.270> let's<00:01:26.720> play<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.140> G

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
there is one black note let's play the G

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.040 
there is one black note let's play the G
scale

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.810 

so<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.170> f<00:01:35.320> is<00:01:35.560> raised<00:01:35.890> so<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:36.310> call<00:01:36.490> that<00:01:36.520> an

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
so the f is raised so we call that an

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.660 
so the f is raised so we call that an
f-sharp<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.600> in<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.110> key<00:01:38.350> of<00:01:38.380> G<00:01:38.920> there<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.430> one

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
f-sharp so in the key of G there is one

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.380 
f-sharp so in the key of G there is one
sharp<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:41.170> on<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.560> piece<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.130> music<00:01:42.430> that<00:01:43.330> will

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
sharp now on a piece of music that will

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.240 
sharp now on a piece of music that will
be<00:01:43.450> indicated<00:01:43.690> on<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.530> staff<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.130> that's

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
be indicated on the staff and that's

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.600 
be indicated on the staff and that's
called<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.820> key<00:01:46.180> signature<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:48.370> key

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
called a key signature so the key

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.370 
called a key signature so the key
signature<00:01:48.850> for<00:01:49.120> C<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:49.990> there's<00:01:50.230> no

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
signature for C is that there's no

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.630 
signature for C is that there's no
sharps<00:01:50.770> no<00:01:50.860> flats

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
sharps no flats

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.420 
sharps no flats
so<00:01:52.450> let's<00:01:52.720> first<00:01:53.020> go<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.650> right<00:01:53.950> on<00:01:54.220> the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
so let's first go to the right on the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.100 
so let's first go to the right on the
circle<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.940> fifths<00:01:55.150> and<00:01:55.510> will<00:01:55.600> go<00:01:55.750> up<00:01:55.900> by

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
circle of fifths and will go up by

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.250 
circle of fifths and will go up by
fifths<00:01:56.560> from<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.860> C<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:58.240> get<00:01:58.390> G<00:01:58.780> now<00:01:59.200> we

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
fifths from the C we get G now we

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.610 
fifths from the C we get G now we
already<00:01:59.470> saw<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.130> G<00:02:00.730> has<00:02:00.910> one<00:02:01.900> sharp<00:02:02.260> in<00:02:02.500> it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
already saw that G has one sharp in it

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.570 
already saw that G has one sharp in it
which<00:02:02.980> is<00:02:03.340> f<00:02:03.640> sharp<00:02:04.410> now<00:02:05.410> if<00:02:05.650> we<00:02:05.800> go<00:02:05.950> up<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.250> fifth

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
which is f sharp now if we go up a fifth

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.169 
which is f sharp now if we go up a fifth
from<00:02:06.910> that<00:02:07.210> we<00:02:07.450> get<00:02:07.600> D<00:02:08.460> now<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:09.520> D<00:02:09.760> major<00:02:09.970> scale

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
from that we get D now the D major scale

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.170 
from that we get D now the D major scale
has<00:02:11.170> what<00:02:11.580> well<00:02:12.580> let's<00:02:12.760> play<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:14.760> there's<00:02:15.760> an<00:02:16.030> F

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
has what well let's play it there's an F

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.510 
has what well let's play it there's an F
sharp<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:18.000> C<00:02:19.000> sharp<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:21.520> then<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.030> D<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.650> two

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
sharp a C sharp and then the D so two

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.230 
sharp a C sharp and then the D so two
sharps<00:02:24.970> are<00:02:25.210> found<00:02:26.200> in<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:27.040> key<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.820> C<00:02:28.090> we

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
sharps are found in that key so in C we

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.330

c-sharp has seven sharps now that's

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.900 
c-sharp has seven sharps now that's

going to the right on the circle of
fifths<00:04:01.060> now<00:04:01.270> if<00:04:01.390> we<00:04:01.510> go<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.930> left<00:04:02.140> we<00:04:02.440> start

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
fifths now if we go to the left we start

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.080 
fifths now if we go to the left we start
at<00:04:02.800> C<00:04:03.040> again<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.720> go<00:04:04.720> down<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.960> perfect<00:04:05.530> fifth

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
at C again we go down a perfect fifth

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.300 
at C again we go down a perfect fifth
what<00:04:07.660> do<00:04:07.720> we<00:04:07.750> get<00:04:07.959> we<00:04:08.140> get<00:04:08.260> F<00:04:08.560> now<00:04:08.920> let's<00:04:09.069> play

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
what do we get we get F now let's play

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.540 
what do we get we get F now let's play
the<00:04:09.489> F<00:04:09.640> major<00:04:10.000> scale

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.830 

you

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.860 

so<00:04:17.380> in<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.709> F<00:04:17.859> major<00:04:18.190> scale<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:19.209> fourth<00:04:19.570> note

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
so in the F major scale the fourth note

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.710 
so in the F major scale the fourth note
is<00:04:20.109> lowered<00:04:20.620> so<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.340> B<00:04:21.579> is<00:04:21.820> not<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.090> B<00:04:22.360> it's<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.690> B

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
is lowered so the B is not a B it's a B

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.340 
is lowered so the B is not a B it's a B
flat<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:24.280> we<00:04:24.639> see<00:04:24.910> that<00:04:25.180> well<00:04:25.720> let's<00:04:25.900> go<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.110> C

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
flat so we see that well let's go to C

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.440 
flat so we see that well let's go to C
again<00:04:26.500> C<00:04:26.889> no<00:04:27.160> sharps<00:04:27.550> no<00:04:27.610> flats<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:28.300> key

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
again C no sharps no flats the key

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.210 
again C no sharps no flats the key
signature<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:29.200> F<00:04:29.770> we<00:04:30.490> have<00:04:30.610> one<00:04:30.850> flat<00:04:31.770> well<00:04:32.770> if

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
signature in F we have one flat well if

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.060 
signature in F we have one flat well if
we<00:04:33.430> think<00:04:33.460> about<00:04:33.820> what<00:04:34.630> happened<00:04:35.110> going<00:04:35.530> this

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
we think about what happened going this

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.920 
we think about what happened going this
way<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.730> keyboard<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.419> looking<00:04:37.720> at<00:04:37.810> all

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
way up the keyboard and looking at all

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.240 
way up the keyboard and looking at all
the<00:04:38.050> sharps<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.580> if<00:04:39.940> we've<00:04:40.570> gone<00:04:40.780> down<00:04:41.020> 1/5<00:04:41.680> for

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
the sharps so if we've gone down 1/5 for

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.870 
the sharps so if we've gone down 1/5 for
F<00:04:42.430> if<00:04:42.730> we<00:04:42.850> go<00:04:43.000> down<00:04:43.150> another<00:04:43.450> 5th<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.110> b-flat<00:04:44.880> so

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
F if we go down another 5th to b-flat so

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.940 
F if we go down another 5th to b-flat so
f<00:04:46.060> had<00:04:46.270> one<00:04:46.510> flat<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.139> B<00:04:47.290> flat<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.590> going<00:04:47.889> to

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
f had one flat so B flat is going to

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.300 
f had one flat so B flat is going to
have<00:04:48.130> you've<00:04:48.910> got<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:49.270> two<00:04:49.900> flats<00:04:50.169> so<00:04:50.680> B<00:04:51.280> flat

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
have you've got it two flats so B flat

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:59.100 
have you've got it two flats so B flat
and<00:04:52.320> E<00:04:53.320> flat

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.000 

now<00:05:00.110> if<00:05:00.350> we<00:05:00.470> go<00:05:00.590> down<00:05:00.740> another<00:05:01.040> fifth<00:05:01.430> we<00:05:02.240> get<00:05:02.510> E

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
now if we go down another fifth we get E

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.570 
now if we go down another fifth we get E
flat<00:05:04.010> so<00:05:04.340> in<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.550> key<00:05:04.790> of<00:05:04.910> E<00:05:05.120> flat<00:05:05.360> there<00:05:05.750> is

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
flat so in the key of E flat there is

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.400 
flat so in the key of E flat there is
three<00:05:07.580> flats<00:05:07.850> now<00:05:08.660> if<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:08.870> look<00:05:09.050> at<00:05:09.200> how<00:05:09.350> the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
three flats now if you look at how the

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.960 
three flats now if you look at how the
notes<00:05:09.710> are<00:05:09.890> arranged<00:05:10.280> in<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.490> circle<00:05:10.850> of

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
notes are arranged in that circle of

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.910 
notes are arranged in that circle of
fifths<00:05:11.210> that<00:05:11.420> same<00:05:11.660> pattern<00:05:12.170> we<00:05:12.350> saw<00:05:12.650> for<00:05:12.890> the

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
fifths that same pattern we saw for the

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.760 
fifths that same pattern we saw for the
sharps<00:05:13.460> which<00:05:13.730> was<00:05:13.970> telling<00:05:14.390> you<00:05:14.540> what<00:05:14.990> notes

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
sharps which was telling you what notes

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.550 
sharps which was telling you what notes
were<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:16.100> be<00:05:16.220> sharp<00:05:16.580> going<00:05:16.970> up<00:05:17.210> you<00:05:18.080> can<00:05:18.290> find

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
were to be sharp going up you can find

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.370 
were to be sharp going up you can find
that<00:05:18.740> same<00:05:18.800> pattern<00:05:19.610> for<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:19.940> flat<00:05:20.380> going

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
that same pattern for the flat going

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.590 
that same pattern for the flat going
back<00:05:21.560> down<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:22.040> other<00:05:22.070> way<00:05:22.820> so<00:05:23.180> as<00:05:23.300> we<00:05:23.420> keep

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
back down the other way so as we keep

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.340 
back down the other way so as we keep
going<00:05:23.810> down

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
going down

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.990 
going down
a<00:05:25.410> flat<00:05:26.340> has<00:05:26.880> four<00:05:27.180> flats<00:05:27.950> D<00:05:28.950> flat<00:05:29.310> has<00:05:29.580> five

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
a flat has four flats D flat has five

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.830 
a flat has four flats D flat has five
flats<00:05:31.160> G<00:05:32.160> flat<00:05:32.490> has<00:05:33.120> six<00:05:33.870> flats<00:05:34.170> and<00:05:34.530> C<00:05:35.520> flat

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
flats G flat has six flats and C flat

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.730 
flats G flat has six flats and C flat
which<00:05:36.840> looks<00:05:37.080> like<00:05:37.170> me<00:05:37.500> has<00:05:38.240> seven<00:05:39.240> flats<00:05:39.740> so

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
which looks like me has seven flats so

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.320 
which looks like me has seven flats so
hopefully<00:05:41.100> that<00:05:41.250> gives<00:05:41.280> you<00:05:41.520> an<00:05:41.670> idea<00:05:42.000> of<00:05:42.060> what

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
hopefully that gives you an idea of what

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.140 
hopefully that gives you an idea of what
the<00:05:42.480> circle<00:05:42.840> of<00:05:42.960> fifths<00:05:43.230> is<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.800> if<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.940> look

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
the circle of fifths is and if you look

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.450 
the circle of fifths is and if you look
at<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:45.540> it<00:05:45.720> can<00:05:45.930> help<00:05:46.500> you<00:05:46.680> identify<00:05:46.830> in<00:05:47.400> a

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
at it it can help you identify in a

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.060 
at it it can help you identify in a
nutshell<00:05:47.700> key<00:05:48.660> signatures<00:05:49.320> what<00:05:49.650> key<00:05:49.890> you're

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
nutshell key signatures what key you're

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.190 
nutshell key signatures what key you're
playing<00:05:50.370> in<00:05:50.610> so<00:05:50.850> if<00:05:51.000> somebody<00:05:51.360> says<00:05:51.660> to<00:05:51.960> you

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
playing in so if somebody says to you

how that works you can snap to it

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.970 
how that works you can snap to it
quickly<00:06:09.900> if<00:06:10.110> somebody<00:06:10.380> says<00:06:10.560> hey<00:06:10.590> we're<00:06:10.860> going

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
quickly if somebody says hey we're going

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.280 
quickly if somebody says hey we're going
to<00:06:11.010> play<00:06:11.130> an<00:06:11.220> E<00:06:11.400> flat<00:06:11.610> you<00:06:12.300> know<00:06:12.510> three<00:06:13.020> flats

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
to play an E flat you know three flats

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.380 
to play an E flat you know three flats
or<00:06:13.590> we're<00:06:14.010> going<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.190> play<00:06:14.340> an<00:06:14.430> F<00:06:14.610> sharp<00:06:14.640> in<00:06:15.180> the

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
or we're going to play an F sharp in the

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.900 
or we're going to play an F sharp in the
key<00:06:15.470> that's<00:06:16.470> six<00:06:16.830> sharp<00:06:17.130> notes<00:06:17.400> in<00:06:17.610> there<00:06:17.760> but

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
key that's six sharp notes in there but

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.640 
key that's six sharp notes in there but
then<00:06:18.120> you<00:06:18.330> understand<00:06:19.020> it<00:06:19.170> so<00:06:19.350> there<00:06:19.500> you<00:06:19.620> have

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
then you understand it so there you have

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:28.730 
then you understand it so there you have
the<00:06:20.160> circle<00:06:20.970> of<00:06:21.060> fifths

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.800 

you
