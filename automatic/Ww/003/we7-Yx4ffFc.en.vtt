00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.540
 in this video we continue in the 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.220
 following strategy 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.320
 finding out the meaning of 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.000
 difficult words with the part 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.590
 reading skills it is intended that 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.150
 you fully understand the text 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.860
 so that you are able to answer the question 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.300
 reply 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.279
 some difficult words can do this 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.620
 There are a number of ways 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.690
 is expected to come 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.220
 first you can even ask how 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.290
 belt is needed to understand the text 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.030
 you can first read body and leave 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.100
 also becomes more difficult such as compassion 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.850
 works that I need anyway for 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.850
 complete text 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.390
 if you have difficult words 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.920
 first look at surrounding 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.190
 villages sense 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.110
 this becomes context you can look at or much 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.470
 this one 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.470
 d 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.750
 you can see if you have the word god behind it 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.790
 to make 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.489
 go ahead or compare with her 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.350
 with a sign that you can already join 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.950
 every use but in the knowledge and he 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.950
 total 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.680
 if you could really sense something behind 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.180
 you can also be caught one 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.250
 please note the rules that apply 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.780
 for becoming 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.430
 always look for the good 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.870
 compositions are not always in luck 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:38.490
 times that the word edgar laughed 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.550
 it can prevent you from meaning 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.980
 no then must be visible from meanings 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.600
 search further 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.650
 watch a dictionary maybe always 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.330
 Stellar and the above 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.980
 methods can provide parents make 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.980
 you effectively work 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.729
