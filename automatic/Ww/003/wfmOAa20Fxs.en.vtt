00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.680
 hi friends how are you is because this one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.600
 He came better and welcome to a new 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.180
 minecraft in which I bring you this 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 wonderful way called bein mainer and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.280
 How do you feel if I come in I'm sure 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.230
 that they loved fifa if you can give it a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.430
 thumb up to see if it's true that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.320
 we can continue doing this kind of 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.120
 septic intro just can not start 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.360
 with the mod is a mod that really 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.830
 it works but too much to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.090
 those who are miners that I believe that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.310
 everyone must determine if they play 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.899
 minecraft I can not imagine then it is 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.710
 a very super useful and right now we are going to 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.720
 start 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.200
 ok what we have to do is first 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.390
 apply in the chats the 20 mainer 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.700
 put him exactly 20 like I did 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.130
 I put the body lean as you can see here you 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.340
 several options come out you get the mode the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.580
 blog list the turn list block limit radio 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.960
 super tic and save config and help then 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.500
 the first thing that we go to us is to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.080
 to explain all this what 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.400
 to understand the beginning is to give health 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.760
 20 our 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.200
 mainer we put health in this way 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.020
 it will come out to us that it does anything 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.410
 that is, the ready pad adds or removes 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.850
 Well weiner mod blocks right now 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.800
 they will understand that more or less the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.060
 mod should imagine what it does is that 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.130
 breaks is one of the blocks that are 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.930
 stuck so to speak one of those from 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.700
 diamond and all diamond falls 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.590
 at the same time instead of mining one 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.200
 for one I especially love with the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.690
 coal because we all know that because the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.429
 Beads that are made of coal are 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.780
 too many too much coal always 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.150
 So then it is very stressful 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.560
 undermine everything and then this works 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.790
 too much then the first thing that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.890
 we have to do to set it up 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.410
 as I am to put bein mined just with 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.860
 Mode mode mode and we put it 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.930
 snacks that's going to mean I know it's 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.090
 activated 20 in the in mode 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.210
 duck then say that if 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.180
 we look at a normal block 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.860
 so nothing happens ok it's normal mine but 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.960
 if we crouch as we do 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.210
 we set up now all of them are going to fall 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.160
 the blocks with us and this say or 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.160
 rabat in we can save the duration of the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.110
 peak that can not be saved 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.700
 unfortunately it is as if we had 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.050
 looked at all the blocks that is to say 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.040
 all fall but it is as if we had 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.480
 it undermined because the peak is spent is spent 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.550
 just as you should spend yourselves 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.220
 understand then well look at me 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.840
 agacho really takes time and again like 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.510
 you can see if we put three of mainer 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.670
 mode is going to give us several options that is 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.430
 the one of saber that means to deactivate the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.750
 self he is nick and he is not nick he is not 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.000
 nick would mean it's when you're 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.270
 stopped is when it is thus stopped 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.070
 so if we put him bein mainer 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.690
 mainer mode is not even like it says now 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.330
 says it 's activated when you're not 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.580
 ok then crouch and then right now 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.740
 dominates with new this crouched so is 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.300
 simple and if I bend down 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.460
 not going to happen and will do everything 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.690
 as normal then it is very 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.069
 well because you can configure it to your 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.780
 so we can not disable revisable 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.099
 and now called to work from any 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.120
 way or a hundred because I do not get that 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.569
 it was deactivated 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.849
 in facebook mode to points that suppose 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.280
 which is deactivated and you're already activated 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.230
 as you can see, and it is very 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.670
 epic, let's really be as you can see 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.750
 we can also change the radius is 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.310
 say the radio 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.459
 Well, you can look at these blocks 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.930
 so if we put weiner radius there 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.840
 gives us the option that we have since 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.489
 minus one or one such as up to 1000 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.959
 then if we are going to put the maximum 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.760
 radio what radios thousand is now says 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.040
 that is configured so you can 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.829
 mine a thousand blocks then in this way in 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.269
 vein form then all the peak 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.479
 let's really turn it off payne 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.820
 mainer mode and we put him here I think 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.590
 that the bending down mode is the most comfortable 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.930
 not because if you can look at the two 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.220
 ways to your liking you can look normal and 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.440
 what you do not want you to bend over and mine 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.630
 all then the whole set of blocks 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.729
 then this option is very effective 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.039
 here for example we have gold there 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.960
 master normal water are not enough we 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.240
 we duck and now we look at all then 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.190
 can 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.870
 if it's something that I was waiting for in 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.460
 for a long time the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.639
 ease for example or holy god 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.099
 they saw all that coal is too much 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.720
 many times in caves or too much 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.400
 carbonite much ferrer to dominate everything 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.229
 then there are times that I do not even 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.229
 the coal is born from as much as it is but 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.210
 look, look at all the blocks 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.410
 what method of getting to live or of sant 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.270
 be beautiful for example here we have 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.460
 diamond as well as well or more 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.400
 all German tim then yes yes 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.190
 basically this is the weiner mode 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.849
 as its name says the miner of the 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.380
 veins and I think it would be then 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.780
 does not have anything else really that the only thing 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.789
 what it brings and it is very useful, I hope that 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:29.130
 you really liked then if you 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.130
 liked it and she shanghai no please 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.779
 you know that if you loved it, you can 

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:35.279
 leave your thumb up and then leave 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:37.499
 comments on what they want them to 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:40.169
 so bring in a video next that 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:41.939
 I can get up then as they 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.139
 I leave in the description the mod so that 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.429
 you install me since it is very simple 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.349
 install it sell it or put in the 

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:49.619
 mods folder and it is already does not have great 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:52.439
 complication and with nothing more to say 

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:55.559
 friends I say goodbye see you until the 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:58.939
 next people and people do not see no 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:58.939
 can go from here without killing a bee
