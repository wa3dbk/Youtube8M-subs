both sides so I knew it wasn't like an

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.949 
both sides so I knew it wasn't like an
injury<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.820> was<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.180> fatigue<00:02:18.630> this

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
injury it was just like fatigue this

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.199 
injury it was just like fatigue this
really<00:02:19.260> whenever<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.370> over<00:02:20.640> train<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.030> feel

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
really whenever you over train you feel

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.720 
really whenever you over train you feel
this<00:02:21.330> really<00:02:21.660> deep<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:22.739> not<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.670> a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
this really deep it's not it's like a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.690 
this really deep it's not it's like a
deep<00:02:24.000> soreness<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.920> different<00:02:26.190> from<00:02:26.550> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
deep soreness it's different from a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.340 
deep soreness it's different from a
regular<00:02:26.730> source<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> really<00:02:28.050> deep

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
regular source like a really deep

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.890 
regular source like a really deep
soreness<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.430> you'll<00:02:29.880> know<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.270> whenever

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
soreness and you you'll know it whenever

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.199 
soreness and you you'll know it whenever
you<00:02:31.050> hit<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.380> it's<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.370> could<00:02:32.580> still<00:02:32.820> train

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
you hit it it's like I could still train

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.960 
you hit it it's like I could still train
but<00:02:33.480> really<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.590> hurt<00:02:34.920> not<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.489> an<00:02:35.610> injury

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
but really it hurt not like an injury

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.080 
but really it hurt not like an injury
hurt<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.709> it's<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:38.010> just<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.489> lot<00:02:38.610> different

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
hurt but it's just just a lot different

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.440 
hurt but it's just just a lot different
so<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.860> my<00:02:41.190> suggestion<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.940> if<00:02:42.000> you're<00:02:42.360> gonna

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
so so my suggestion is if you're gonna

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.680 
so so my suggestion is if you're gonna
hit<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> body<00:02:43.200> part<00:02:43.410> twice<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.739> week<00:02:44.480> don't<00:02:45.480> go

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
hit a body part twice a week don't go

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.810 
hit a body part twice a week don't go
all<00:02:45.930> out<00:02:46.100> especially<00:02:47.100> with<00:02:47.430> your<00:02:47.610> bigger

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
all out especially with your bigger

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.890 
all out especially with your bigger
muscle<00:02:48.209> groups<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.720> know<00:02:48.750> chest<00:02:49.200> back<00:02:49.590> legs

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
muscle groups you know chest back legs

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.259 
muscle groups you know chest back legs
shoulders<00:02:51.900> might<00:02:52.290> be<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:52.980> mix<00:02:53.250> but<00:02:53.640> as

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
shoulders might be in that mix but as

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.670 
shoulders might be in that mix but as
far<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:54.510> like<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> smaller<00:02:55.140> muscle<00:02:55.650> groups

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
far as like the smaller muscle groups

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.960 
far as like the smaller muscle groups
biceps<00:02:56.459> triceps<00:02:57.440> your<00:02:58.440> abs<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.579> know<00:02:59.700> stuff

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
biceps triceps your abs you know stuff

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.330 
biceps triceps your abs you know stuff
like<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.150> your<00:03:00.450> traps<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.739> can<00:03:01.920> kind<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.190> get

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
like that your traps you can kind of get

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.860 
like that your traps you can kind of get
away<00:03:02.549> with<00:03:02.760> hitting<00:03:03.000> those<00:03:03.209> hard<00:03:03.510> twice<00:03:03.810> a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
away with hitting those hard twice a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.410 
away with hitting those hard twice a
week<00:03:04.140> because<00:03:04.380> smaller<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.340> muscle<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
week because smaller the muscle the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.840 
week because smaller the muscle the
quicker<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.079> gonna<00:03:07.200> recover<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.730> was

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
quicker it's gonna recover so that was

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.910 
quicker it's gonna recover so that was
my<00:03:08.880> mistake<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.510> made<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.959> hope<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.410> guys<00:03:10.560> don't

another<00:03:25.019> quick<00:03:25.230> thing<00:03:25.910> sign<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.090> overtraining

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
another quick thing sign of overtraining

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.460 
another quick thing sign of overtraining
is<00:03:27.900> if<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:29.370> if<00:03:29.820> your<00:03:30.510> lips<00:03:30.780> start<00:03:30.989> going<00:03:31.290> down

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
is if you if your lips start going down

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.120 
is if you if your lips start going down
maybe<00:03:31.860> you're<00:03:32.070> getting<00:03:32.280> less<00:03:32.459> reps<00:03:32.790> or<00:03:34.130> you're

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
maybe you're getting less reps or you're

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.340 
maybe you're getting less reps or you're
not<00:03:35.250> increasing<00:03:35.910> your<00:03:36.120> weight<00:03:36.390> something

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
not increasing your weight something

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.039 
not increasing your weight something
like<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.500> or<00:03:37.980> your<00:03:38.670> your<00:03:39.480> weight<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.959> have

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
like that or your your weight you have

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.300 
like that or your your weight you have
to<00:03:40.140> decrease<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.560> weight<00:03:40.829> something<00:03:41.220> like

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
to decrease the weight something like

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.250 
to decrease the weight something like
that<00:03:41.489> you're<00:03:41.670> not<00:03:41.730> making<00:03:42.060> progress<00:03:42.239> that's<00:03:43.140> a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
that you're not making progress that's a

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.160 
that you're not making progress that's a
sign<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.470> overtraining<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.840> be<00:03:45.840> aware<00:03:46.110> of

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
sign of overtraining so be aware of

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.099 
sign of overtraining so be aware of
those<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.209> don't<00:03:48.450> fall<00:03:48.690> into<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.959> same

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
those so you don't fall into the same

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.740 
those so you don't fall into the same
hole<00:03:49.320> i<00:03:49.350> did<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.889> actually<00:03:50.570> whatever<00:03:51.570> i<00:03:51.660> did

hole i did and actually whatever i did

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.750 
hole i did and actually whatever i did
over<00:03:51.989> train<00:03:52.350> my<00:03:52.560> hips<00:03:52.829> were<00:03:52.980> hurting<00:03:53.340> I

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
over train my hips were hurting I

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.350 
over train my hips were hurting I
took<00:03:54.470> all<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:56.099> next<00:03:56.400> week<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.700> only<00:03:56.849> went<00:03:57.060> one
