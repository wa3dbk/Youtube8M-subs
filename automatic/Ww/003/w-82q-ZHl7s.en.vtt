00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 soft 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.470
 1 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.129
 the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 no 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.130
 it's still ashtrays 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.870
 today is the second part of 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.370
 this mini series of videos and we're going 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.660
 talk about hairstyle which I will give you 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.730
 a little bit my tips and advice 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.290
 to have impeccable hair the 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.690
 your wedding day but also a 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.650
 tutorial of this hairstyle I'm 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.970
 wearing now 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.309
 so that's it but that's it 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.230
 interested in continuing to watch so 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.879
 let's go for this classic bun and 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.730
 timeless bride so I started 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.590
 firstly with curly g 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.270
 firstly vaporize my roots from 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.340
 dry shampoo that will help give a 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.750
 texture it's also something that I 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.000
 actually recommend for the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.130
 maintaining more I always recommend 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.380
 to wash her hair the day before and not the 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.059
 same day of your wedding to be sure 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.739
 to not have hair too blurry and 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.449
 that slips too much and suddenly the bun 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.399
 will hold a lot better this way 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.899
 so I do well penetrated back in the 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.060
 dry shampoo not to have a mark 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.100
 and then I'm going to curl or wavy 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.720
 rather my hair with a curling iron 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.520
 you can very well wind them up the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.290
 watch in curlers or rollerblades 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.640
 as you wish I had decided to 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.200
 do my with a curling iron but 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.700
 it's like you want and it does 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.110
 to have wavy hair will give 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.729
 once again a maintenance and the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.920
 hair flexibility when one would 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.990
 putting it in the bob I 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.670
 will show how I put this jewel 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.140
 which is absolutely beautiful is a 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.360
 Hair jewel in fact it's brand 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.240
 in paris and it's an accessory 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.130
 absolutely fantastic for a bride 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.630
 or a bridesmaid it arises 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.830
 very easily actually you have some 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.020
 little tips in place and you do 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.060
 to get into some sort of icon actually 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.799
 is it parting you 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.210
 so can you place your lock of 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.490
 hair inside the biggest 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.060
 party make your match go 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.430
 hair and then simply do 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.259
 slide the little plastic end 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.479
 after having pained your hair for 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.280
 do not make noeux and in fact you are here 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.880
 drag the little end into 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 plastic 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.360
 he's going to get around the wick of 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.160
 your hair like this and it's like 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.390
 of course I pretend that on hair 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.620
 thick you can shoot as long as you 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.060
 want it will not move absolutely 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.160
 believe me so I did the same thing 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.079
 on the other side and then I'm going 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.060
 put some hairspray to get a little 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.130
 more volume of textures and also 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.890
 fixation I will take both sides 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.950
 of my hair and I will then set 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.390
 all that with a fork spool not 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.099
 need psy bobepine you need 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.370
 than a single coil if it is well 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.440
 setting and so I pass it in the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.550
 little two rolls actually that I 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.050
 did we say and then I will 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.239
 take the rest of my hair I'm going 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.310
 wrap them around my hand I'm going 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.750
 well attached but points inside 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.880
 this little roll that I'm trying to 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.160
 do with my hair and then I 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.560
 will fix it with coils so I 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.959
 always starts with a flat coil 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.150
 on both sides and then I'm going 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.700
 take spools fork to be 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.980
 sure to secure the sides of the rollers 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.019
 and make the roll rather of the group 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.340
 '' the one I am creating and 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.010

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.220
