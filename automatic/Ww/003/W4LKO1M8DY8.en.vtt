out a little stretching the legs what
we're<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.999> we're<00:00:47.999> going<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.110 
we're going to do is we're going to
increase<00:00:48.870> our<00:00:49.019> core<00:00:49.289> temperature<00:00:49.559> and

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
increase our core temperature and

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.819 
increase our core temperature and
oxygenate<00:00:51.120> our<00:00:51.149> body<00:00:51.539> we're<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> do

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
oxygenate our body we're going to do

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.549 
oxygenate our body we're going to do
this<00:00:53.179> by<00:00:54.179> simply<00:00:54.239> walking<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.350> little

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
this by simply walking for a little

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.829 
this by simply walking for a little
while<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.129> then<00:00:56.850> we're<00:00:56.999> to<00:00:57.089> go<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> light

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
while and then we're to go into a light

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.290 
while and then we're to go into a light
jog<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.589> light<00:00:58.829> jog<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.940> what's<00:01:00.210> going

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
jog now that light jog is what's going

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.669 
jog now that light jog is what's going
to<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.510> increase<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:01.199> core<00:01:01.440> temperature

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
to really increase the core temperature

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.960 
to really increase the core temperature
and<00:01:02.719> oxygenate<00:01:03.719> our<00:01:03.929> muscles<00:01:04.610> prepare<00:01:05.610> us<00:01:05.790> for

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and oxygenate our muscles prepare us for

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.180 
and oxygenate our muscles prepare us for
an<00:01:06.180> interval<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:07.380> happens<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.010> core

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
an interval what happens when your core

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.560 
an interval what happens when your core
temperature<00:01:08.490> increases<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.300> that<00:01:09.450> your

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
temperature increases is that your

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.410 
temperature increases is that your
muscles<00:01:09.750> become<00:01:10.290> more<00:01:10.560> elastic<00:01:10.970> less<00:01:11.970> likely

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
muscles become more elastic less likely

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.440 
muscles become more elastic less likely
to<00:01:13.220> result<00:01:14.220> an<00:01:14.400> injury<00:01:16.700> okay<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.940> walked<00:01:18.210> for

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
to result an injury okay so I walked for

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.580 
to result an injury okay so I walked for
about<00:01:18.510> a<00:01:18.659> minute<00:01:18.930> now<00:01:19.050> I'm<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.410> going<00:01:19.530> to

about a minute now I'm just going to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.080 
about a minute now I'm just going to
bump<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.980> treadmill<00:01:20.370> up<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> about<00:01:20.820> five

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
bump the treadmill up to about five

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.780 
bump the treadmill up to about five
miles<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:21.570> hour<00:01:21.690> and<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:22.800> on<00:01:22.920> your<00:01:23.340> cardio

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
miles an hour and then on your cardio

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.660 
miles an hour and then on your cardio
program<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:25.560> should<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.860> warm-up<00:01:26.370> part

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
program you should have a warm-up part

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.030 
program you should have a warm-up part
right

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
right

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.690 
right
that's<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.910> heart<00:01:29.150> rate<00:01:29.300> you<00:01:29.510> want<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.780> target

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
that's the heart rate you want to target

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.180 
that's the heart rate you want to target
so<00:01:31.700> mines<00:01:33.040> 127<00:01:35.200> I'm<00:01:36.200> just<00:01:36.380> going<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.620> jog<00:01:36.830> for

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
me it's 12 miles an hour so what I'm

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.910 
me it's 12 miles an hour so what I'm
going<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.360> do

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.100 

is<00:02:47.130> I'm<00:02:47.280> going<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> pump<00:02:47.850> speed<00:02:48.270> up<00:02:48.420> 12<00:02:48.900> miles

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
is I'm going to pump speed up 12 miles

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.170 
is I'm going to pump speed up 12 miles
an<00:02:49.320> hour

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:34.870 

okay<00:02:56.870> with<00:02:57.019> 12<00:02:57.230> miles<00:02:57.439> hour<00:02:57.650> 30<00:02:57.920> seconds

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.900 

that's<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:37.570> bring<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.720> treble<00:03:39.110> down<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:40.670> three

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
that's it bring the treble down to three

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.990 
that's it bring the treble down to three
miles<00:03:41.060> an<00:03:41.300> hour<00:03:41.420> again<00:03:42.070> hop<00:03:43.070> on<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:45.670> walk<00:03:46.670> for

miles an hour again hop on and walk for
three<00:03:47.210> minutes<00:03:49.570> my<00:03:50.570> heart<00:03:50.810> rates<00:03:50.990> really<00:03:51.200> high

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
three minutes my heart rates really high

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.670 
three minutes my heart rates really high
right<00:03:51.710> now<00:03:52.150> have<00:03:53.150> access<00:03:54.070> my<00:03:55.070> atp-cp<00:03:55.940> system

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
nauseous in the stomach that's good just

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.970 
nauseous in the stomach that's good just
for<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.550> little<00:04:19.670> while<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.440> have<00:04:21.440> three<00:04:21.800> minutes

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
for a little while I have three minutes

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:33.309 
for a little while I have three minutes
to<00:04:22.250> recover<00:04:23.860> my<00:04:24.860> heart<00:04:25.130> rate<00:04:25.250> right<00:04:25.400> now

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.709 

is<00:04:33.740> 1/60<00:04:35.050> that's<00:04:36.050> right<00:04:36.229> around<00:04:36.379> my<00:04:36.619> target

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:37.719 
is 1/60 that's right around my target

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.409 
is 1/60 that's right around my target
and<00:04:38.719> that's<00:04:38.930> all<00:04:39.110> I<00:04:39.139> need<00:04:39.379> to<00:04:39.409> do<00:04:40.119> so<00:04:41.119> I'm<00:04:41.270> going

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
and that's all I need to do so I'm going

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.179 
and that's all I need to do so I'm going
to<00:04:41.449> I'm<00:04:41.719> going<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:41.990> walk<00:04:42.169> for<00:04:42.469> three<00:04:42.710> minutes

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.369 

when<00:04:46.189> that<00:04:46.309> three<00:04:46.580> minutes<00:04:46.729> is<00:04:46.999> up<00:04:47.110> I'm<00:04:48.110> going

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
when that three minutes is up I'm going

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.279 
when that three minutes is up I'm going
to<00:04:48.439> spread<00:04:48.740> again<00:04:49.039> for<00:04:49.999> 30<00:04:50.270> seconds<00:04:50.809> that's<00:04:51.050> it

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
to spread again for 30 seconds that's it

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.439 
to spread again for 30 seconds that's it
and<00:04:51.889> then<00:04:52.490> I'm<00:04:52.580> going<00:04:52.669> to<00:04:52.759> walk<00:04:52.939> for<00:04:53.240> three

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
and then I'm going to walk for three

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.469 
and then I'm going to walk for three
minutes<00:04:53.629> I'm<00:04:54.529> gonna<00:04:54.710> do<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:54.889> five<00:04:55.129> times<00:04:55.479> and

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
minutes I'm gonna do that five times and

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.649 
minutes I'm gonna do that five times and
I'm<00:04:56.839> simply<00:04:57.259> going<00:04:57.379> to<00:04:57.439> cool<00:04:57.710> down<00:04:57.919> at<00:04:58.659> five

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
I'm simply going to cool down at five

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.149 
I'm simply going to cool down at five
and<00:05:00.020> three<00:05:00.349> miles<00:05:00.559> an<00:05:00.740> hour

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.459 
for five minutes total time thirty
minutes<00:05:06.430> now<00:05:07.430> you<00:05:07.490> can<00:05:07.759> buy<00:05:07.909> this<00:05:08.289> with<00:05:09.289> your

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
minutes now you can buy this with your

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.359 
minutes now you can buy this with your
off<00:05:09.649> days<00:05:10.029> on<00:05:11.029> your<00:05:11.300> off<00:05:11.449> days<00:05:11.800> it's<00:05:12.800> just<00:05:13.159> this

off days on your off days it's just this
for<00:05:13.699> 60<00:05:14.089> minutes<00:05:14.499> find<00:05:15.499> that<00:05:15.680> target<00:05:16.159> heart

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:16.369 
for 60 minutes find that target heart

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:18.760 
for 60 minutes find that target heart
rate<00:05:16.749> maybe<00:05:17.749> you<00:05:17.930> have<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.229> use<00:05:18.319> a<00:05:18.349> little<00:05:18.680> bit

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
rate maybe you have to use a little bit

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.149 
rate maybe you have to use a little bit
of<00:05:18.860> incline<00:05:19.659> try<00:05:20.659> to<00:05:20.719> use<00:05:20.959> incline<00:05:21.589> to<00:05:21.949> bring

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
of incline try to use incline to bring

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.790 
of incline try to use incline to bring
your<00:05:22.279> heart<00:05:22.399> rate<00:05:22.580> up<00:05:22.610> not<00:05:23.599> speed<00:05:24.050> keep<00:05:24.649> the

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
your heart rate up not speed keep the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.889 
your heart rate up not speed keep the
speed<00:05:25.009> at<00:05:25.129> three<00:05:25.309> miles<00:05:25.490> an<00:05:25.639> hour<00:05:25.899> increase

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:26.899 
speed at three miles an hour increase

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:29.469 
speed at three miles an hour increase
the<00:05:27.110> incline<00:05:27.439> now<00:05:27.949> you<00:05:28.069> will<00:05:28.189> find<00:05:28.399> as<00:05:28.729> time

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
the incline now you will find as time

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.989 
the incline now you will find as time
progresses<00:05:29.930> on<00:05:30.529> your<00:05:30.649> program<00:05:31.069> it's<00:05:31.729> going<00:05:31.939> to

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:31.999 
progresses on your program it's going to

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:33.879 
progresses on your program it's going to
be<00:05:32.119> harder<00:05:32.569> to<00:05:32.599> reach<00:05:32.869> those<00:05:33.080> target<00:05:33.559> values

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
be harder to reach those target values

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.559 
be harder to reach those target values
so<00:05:34.639> you're<00:05:34.789> going<00:05:34.909> to<00:05:34.969> have<00:05:35.119> to<00:05:35.240> use<00:05:35.389> more

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
so you're going to have to use more

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.779 
so you're going to have to use more
incline<00:05:35.930> but<00:05:36.709> that's<00:05:36.919> the<00:05:37.129> good<00:05:37.279> news<00:05:37.339> that

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
incline but that's the good news that

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.759 
incline but that's the good news that
means<00:05:38.659> your<00:05:38.839> body<00:05:38.870> is<00:05:39.139> adapting<00:05:39.589> to<00:05:39.680> the

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:39.769 
means your body is adapting to the

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:43.389 
means your body is adapting to the
program<00:05:40.389> you're<00:05:41.389> learning<00:05:41.930> how<00:05:42.139> to<00:05:42.399> use

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:43.399 
program you're learning how to use

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:47.379 
program you're learning how to use
oxygen<00:05:43.759> properly<00:05:45.459> and<00:05:46.459> you're<00:05:46.999> that<00:05:47.209> much

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
oxygen properly and you're that much

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.839 
oxygen properly and you're that much
closer<00:05:47.689> to<00:05:48.050> being<00:05:48.620> a<00:05:48.680> fat-burning<00:05:48.860> machine

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.260 

alright<00:05:52.849> so<00:05:53.029> I<00:05:53.059> would<00:05:53.300> do<00:05:53.419> four<00:05:53.629> more<00:05:53.659> of<00:05:54.019> these
