00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
easiest really there's no market for it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.510 
easiest really there's no market for it
is<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.650> don't<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> think<00:01:14.400> they

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
is there I don't know what I think they

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
is there I don't know what I think they
must<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.000> done<00:01:15.210> at<00:01:15.390> least<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.049> must

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
must have done at least is they must

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.660 
must have done at least is they must
have<00:01:16.350> practiced<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> actual<00:01:17.850> Air<00:01:18.090> Tech

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
have practiced on the actual Air Tech

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
have practiced on the actual Air Tech
models<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.180> Air<00:01:21.750> Tech

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
models because you know Air Tech

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.510 
models because you know Air Tech
Challenge<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.740> relatively<00:01:23.189> cheap

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
Challenge to is are relatively cheap

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.880 
Challenge to is are relatively cheap
compared<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.540> two<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:25.650> they

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
compared to a you two so I think they

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.520 
compared to a you two so I think they
must<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.130> practiced<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.259> then<00:01:28.259> moments

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
must have practiced on that then moments

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190 
must have practiced on that then moments
later<00:01:28.799> another<00:01:29.490> image<00:01:29.970> surfaced<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.780> it's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
later another image surfaced and it's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.039 
later another image surfaced and it's
this<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.000> 750<00:01:33.840> boost

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.920 
this one right here of the 750 boost
with<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> Air<00:01:35.100> Jordan<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:36.060> outsole

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
with the Air Jordan one outsole

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.350 
with the Air Jordan one outsole
I<00:01:36.960> think<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.530> 750<00:01:38.159> boost<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> easy<00:01:38.939> 12

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
I think the 750 boost with the easy 12

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.810 
I think the 750 boost with the easy 12
Sol<00:01:39.570> looks<00:01:40.170> pretty<00:01:40.560> good<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.040> Air<00:01:41.189> Jordan<00:01:41.220> one

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
Sol looks pretty good the Air Jordan one

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
Sol looks pretty good the Air Jordan one
outsole<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> 750<00:01:43.200> boost<00:01:43.320> however<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.890> think

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
outsole on the 750 boost however I think

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.880 
outsole on the 750 boost however I think
it<00:01:44.490> really<00:01:44.820> makes<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:46.110> UGG<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it really makes it look like an UGG I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.160 
it really makes it look like an UGG I
know<00:01:47.369> people<00:01:47.610> were<00:01:47.790> comparing<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.750> 750

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
boost with Oggs when they came out just

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.069 
boost with Oggs when they came out just
because<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.119> shape<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> strap<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
because of the shape in the strap and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
you can't forget that he did switch to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.459 
you can't forget that he did switch to
the<00:02:02.579> boost<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.000> easy<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.259> this

image popped up and it's the image of
the<00:02:06.360> easy<00:02:06.509> two<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> 750<00:02:08.250> boost<00:02:08.429> outsole

I<00:02:10.360> can't<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.990> can't<00:02:11.320> mess<00:02:11.500> with<00:02:11.530> that<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:14.760> think

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
I can't I can't mess with that I think

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.280 
I can't I can't mess with that I think
it's<00:02:16.030> mainly<00:02:16.150> because<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.630> Alper<00:02:16.900> has<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.050> lot

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
it's mainly because the Alper has a lot

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.690 
it's mainly because the Alper has a lot
of<00:02:17.380> things<00:02:17.560> going<00:02:17.770> on<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.400> strap
