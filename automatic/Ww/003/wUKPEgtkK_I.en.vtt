00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
outside wall very similar but then I

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.699 
outside wall very similar but then I
think<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.119> 34<00:01:35.659> Carl<00:01:35.899> had<00:01:36.109> a<00:01:36.140> little<00:01:36.500> bit<00:01:36.679> of

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
think the 34 Carl had a little bit of

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:42.999 
think the 34 Carl had a little bit of

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
effect on this car too that was a hard

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.069 
effect on this car too that was a hard

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
in Jamie Mac too because his back wheels

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.059 
in Jamie Mac too because his back wheels
popped<00:01:47.569> up<00:01:47.780> off<00:01:47.989> the<00:01:48.140> ground<00:01:48.289> he<00:01:48.409> hit<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:48.709> hard
