and<00:00:00.120> then<00:00:00.240> most<00:00:00.480> are<00:00:00.719> not<00:00:01.290> neat<00:00:02.040> tidy<00:00:02.669> places

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
and then most are not neat tidy places

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.490 
and then most are not neat tidy places
okay<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.859> that's<00:00:05.100> completely<00:00:05.819> deliberate

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
okay and that's completely deliberate

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.080 
okay and that's completely deliberate
because<00:00:07.500> basically<00:00:08.010> every<00:00:08.580> bit<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.760> neatness

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
because basically every bit of neatness

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.600 
because basically every bit of neatness
and<00:00:09.210> tightness<00:00:09.690> costs<00:00:10.050> energy<00:00:10.280> and<00:00:11.280> and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
and tightness costs energy and and

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.450 
and tightness costs energy and and
reduces<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> efficiency<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.870> your<00:00:12.990> system

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
reduces the efficiency of your system

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.920 
reduces the efficiency of your system
and<00:00:16.460> you<00:00:17.460> know<00:00:17.580> my<00:00:17.940> philosophy<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.420> true<00:00:18.600> to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
and you know my philosophy is true to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080 
and you know my philosophy is true to
reduce<00:00:19.529> neatness<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.130> Titans<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> minimum

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
reduce neatness and Titans to a minimum

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.290 
reduce neatness and Titans to a minimum
you<00:00:21.630> know<00:00:21.750> because<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.230> just<00:00:22.260> costs<00:00:22.830> energy

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
you know because it just costs energy

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.670 
you know because it just costs energy
one<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.689> bit<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.900> neatness<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.380> timeliness

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
one one bit of neatness and timeliness

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.910 
one one bit of neatness and timeliness
that<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> do<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.609> cut<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.750> grass<00:00:27.900> paths<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that I do do is cut the grass paths you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.880 
that I do do is cut the grass paths you
know<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.689> that<00:00:30.689> makes<00:00:30.900> access<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.560> lot

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
know because that makes access a lot

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.930 
know because that makes access a lot
easy<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.219> don't<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.489> you're<00:00:32.730> wandering

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
easy you don't have you're wandering

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.030 
easy you don't have you're wandering
around<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.480> wet<00:00:33.870> grass<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.530> long<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:34.920> you

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
around in wet grass as that long as you

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.459 
around in wet grass as that long as you
can<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> bit<00:00:35.610> miserable<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> mean<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
can get a bit miserable so I mean that

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.840 
can get a bit miserable so I mean that
you<00:00:37.680> know<00:00:37.770> that's<00:00:37.950> something<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.430> am<00:00:38.520> prepared

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
you know that's something I am prepared

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.670 
you know that's something I am prepared
to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.239> course<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:41.360> in<00:00:42.360> terms<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.780> leaders

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and Titans in other places what you know

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.529 
and Titans in other places what you know
see<00:00:46.350> art<00:00:46.500> behind<00:00:47.989> there's<00:00:48.989> not<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> lot<00:00:50.539> doesn't

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.740 
mean to say we don't weave we do read
you<00:00:53.610> know<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> weed<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.570> don't

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you know you have to weed if you don't

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.119 
you know you have to weed if you don't
weed<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.140> will<00:00:55.260> become<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> forest<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
weed this will become a forest of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.590 
weed this will become a forest of
probably<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> strings<00:00:57.180> mostly<00:00:59.149> you<00:01:00.149> know<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
probably a strings mostly you know so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.330 
probably a strings mostly you know so
there's<00:01:01.109> no<00:01:01.230> such<00:01:01.410> thing<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> knowing<00:01:02.100> job

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
there's no such thing as a knowing job

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.889 
there's no such thing as a knowing job
not<00:01:03.000> true<00:01:03.210> you'll<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.480> end<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
not true you'll just end up with a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.730 
not true you'll just end up with a
woodland<00:01:05.240> but<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.720> when<00:01:06.930> goats<00:01:07.439> on

own place necessarily plants want to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
own place necessarily plants want to
wander<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.640> absolutely<00:01:15.090> fine<00:01:15.360> most<00:01:15.720> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
wander that's absolutely fine most of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.570 
wander that's absolutely fine most of
the<00:01:15.960> time<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:18.799> you<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.920> that's<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:20.280> one

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the time and you know that's that's one

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.060 
the time and you know that's that's one
way<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.960> know<00:01:22.080> horticulture<00:01:22.770> based<00:01:22.950> on

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
way that you know horticulture based on

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.030 
way that you know horticulture based on
annuals<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.640> very<00:01:24.000> inefficient<00:01:24.830> it's<00:01:25.830> because

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
annuals is very inefficient it's because

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
annuals is very inefficient it's because
it<00:01:26.159> takes<00:01:26.340> an<00:01:26.430> awful<00:01:26.610> lot<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> energy<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it takes an awful lot of energy to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.510 
it takes an awful lot of energy to
produce<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:28.710> you're<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:29.189> getting<00:01:29.280> out

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
produce what you're you're getting out

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.090 
produce what you're you're getting out
so<00:01:29.759> when<00:01:30.509> you're<00:01:30.630> looking<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.960> yields<00:01:31.470> you

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so when you're looking at yields you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.240 
so when you're looking at yields you
know<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:33.090> enough<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.229> say<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
know it is not enough just to say you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.580 
know it is not enough just to say you
know<00:01:35.340> look<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> field<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.270> whatever<00:01:36.930> field

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
know look at a field of whatever field

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
know look at a field of whatever field

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.889 
of onions or field of wheat and say look
it's<00:01:40.229> fantastic<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.100> getting<00:01:41.729> n<00:01:41.970> tons<00:01:42.479> per

actually<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.590> meaningless<00:01:46.979> unless<00:01:47.340> you

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
actually is meaningless unless you

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.870 
actually is meaningless unless you
relate<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.170> energy<00:01:49.560> you've<00:01:49.710> put<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.159> to

relate it to the energy you've put in to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.340 
relate it to the energy you've put in to
grow<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:54.960> conventional

the energy put in to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.770 
the energy put in to
crop<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.550> energy<00:02:14.940> value<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.450> crop<00:02:15.630> you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
crop so the energy value of the crop you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.190 
crop so the energy value of the crop you
get<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:16.110> it's<00:02:16.980> pretty<00:02:17.790> poor<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.720> know<00:02:18.750> and

get out it's pretty poor you know and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.000 
get out it's pretty poor you know and

Henry's life down here this it's a

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.660 
Henry's life down here this it's a
fantastic<00:02:43.410> perennial<00:02:43.880> spinach<00:02:44.880> crops<00:02:46.550> but<00:02:47.550> if

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
fantastic perennial spinach crops but if

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.520 
fantastic perennial spinach crops but if
you<00:02:47.790> relate<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.120> if<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.840> measure<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.350> yield

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
you relate that if you measure the yield

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.300 
you relate that if you measure the yield
of<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:51.650> compare<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.890> know<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
of that and compare it you know with the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.280 
of that and compare it you know with the
yield<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.760> an<00:02:53.970> annual<00:02:54.480> crop<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.840> spinach<00:02:55.140> that

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
yield of an annual crop of spinach that

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.199 
yield of an annual crop of spinach that
you've<00:02:55.440> grown<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:56.370> measuring<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.820> yields

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
you've grown just measuring the yields

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.449 
you've grown just measuring the yields
probably<00:02:57.780> spinach<00:02:58.050> will<00:02:58.200> come<00:02:58.350> out<00:02:58.500> top<00:02:58.709> in

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
probably spinach will come out top in

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.130 
probably spinach will come out top in
that<00:02:59.940> year<00:03:00.239> but<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.750> course<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.019> is

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
that year but of course this is

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.900 
that year but of course this is
perennial<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.739> yields<00:03:02.190> year<00:03:02.459> after<00:03:02.730> year

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
perennial so yields year after year

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.240 
perennial so yields year after year
after<00:03:03.060> year<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:05.130> know

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
after year so you have to you know

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.340 
after year so you have to you know
change<00:03:06.060> your<00:03:06.120> calculation<00:03:06.750> for<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:06.930> and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
change your calculation for that and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.009 
change your calculation for that and
also<00:03:07.800> this<00:03:08.459> takes<00:03:08.760> almost<00:03:08.910> no<00:03:09.180> work<00:03:09.510> once<00:03:09.840> it's

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
also this takes almost no work once it's

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.479 
also this takes almost no work once it's
planted<00:03:10.200> whereas<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.890> spinach

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
planted whereas the spinach

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.250 
planted whereas the spinach
you've<00:03:12.030> got<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.330> sow<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.660> you've<00:03:12.870> got<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.080> weed

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
you've got to sow it you've got to weed

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.030 
you've got to sow it you've got to weed
it<00:03:13.940> spin<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:14.970> out<00:03:15.150> as<00:03:15.480> long<00:03:15.660> as<00:03:15.810> are<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.739> you

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
it spin it out as long as are so you

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.640 
it spin it out as long as are so you
know<00:03:17.570> it's<00:03:18.570> not<00:03:18.780> enough<00:03:19.049> just<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.350> look<00:03:19.410> at

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
know it's not enough just to look at

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.509 
know it's not enough just to look at
sheer<00:03:19.860> sheer<00:03:20.400> output<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.500> course<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:23.310> is

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
sheer sheer output and of course this is

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.920 
sheer sheer output and of course this is
growing<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.000> combination<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.630> lots<00:03:24.840> of

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
growing in combination with lots of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.590 
growing in combination with lots of
other<00:03:25.079> plant<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:26.060> there<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.150> often<00:03:27.420> there's

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
other plant so there is often there's

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.270 
other plant so there is often there's
more<00:03:28.079> than<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:28.350> thing<00:03:28.590> sharing<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.100> same

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
more than one thing sharing the same

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.970 
more than one thing sharing the same
space<00:03:29.489> more<00:03:30.480> than<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:30.750> crop<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.620> know<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:31.920> you

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
space more than one crop you know so you

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.130 
space more than one crop you know so you
have<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.250> count<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.640> yields<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:33.780> space

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
have to count the yields in that space

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.590 
have to count the yields in that space
rather<00:03:34.590> than<00:03:34.890> just<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.910> yield<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.480> it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
rather than just the yield of it

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.030 
all very well but can agroforestry feed
the<00:03:58.050> world<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.410> know<00:03:58.500> that's<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.770> typical

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
the world you know that's a typical

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.460 
the world you know that's a typical
question<00:03:59.190> people<00:03:59.730> throw<00:03:59.970> at<00:04:00.060> me<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:01.290> my

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
question people throw at me and my

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.220 
question people throw at me and my
answer<00:04:01.739> is<00:04:02.480> my<00:04:03.480> arteries<00:04:03.840> that's<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.080> wrong

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
answer is my arteries that's the wrong

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.090 
answer is my arteries that's the wrong
question

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
question

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.670 
question
you<00:04:05.790> know<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.390> question<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.840> what<00:04:07.560> is

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
you know the question is what is

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.710 
you know the question is what is
sustainable<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.430> therefore<00:04:09.390> what<00:04:09.569> is<00:04:09.690> a

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
sustainable and therefore what is a

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.050 
sustainable and therefore what is a
sustainable<00:04:10.140> world<00:04:10.410> population<00:04:11.069> which<00:04:11.940> is

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
sustainable world population which is

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.949 
sustainable world population which is
probably<00:04:12.300> a<00:04:12.390> lot<00:04:12.510> less<00:04:12.690> than<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.019> now<00:04:14.959> how

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
probably a lot less than it is now how

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.870 
probably a lot less than it is now how
much<00:04:16.109> would<00:04:16.290> pay<00:04:16.799> because<00:04:17.160> it's<00:04:17.310> an<00:04:17.400> efficient

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
much would pay because it's an efficient

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.219 
much would pay because it's an efficient
to<00:04:18.030> grow<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.450> multiples<00:04:18.840> really<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.200> harvest

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
to grow the multiples really to harvest

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.659 
to grow the multiples really to harvest
yeah<00:04:22.229> well<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.560> know<00:04:22.680> most<00:04:22.860> forest<00:04:23.280> gardens

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
yeah well you know most forest gardens

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.460 
yeah well you know most forest gardens
are<00:04:23.970> not<00:04:24.210> commercial<00:04:24.690> most<00:04:25.020> most<00:04:25.380> people

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
are not commercial most most people

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.960 
are not commercial most most people
growing<00:04:25.830> forest<00:04:26.130> gardens<00:04:26.400> are<00:04:26.490> growing<00:04:26.700> food

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
growing forest gardens are growing food

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.460 
growing forest gardens are growing food
or<00:04:27.240> other<00:04:27.300> things<00:04:27.690> for<00:04:27.870> themselves<00:04:28.020> or<00:04:28.440> their

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
or other things for themselves or their

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.200 
or other things for themselves or their
families<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.520> know<00:04:29.550> there<00:04:29.760> are<00:04:29.880> one<00:04:30.060> or<00:04:30.090> two

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
families you know there are one or two

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.330 
families you know there are one or two
people<00:04:30.930> starting<00:04:31.500> commercial<00:04:32.070> forest

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
people starting commercial forest

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.100 
people starting commercial forest
gardens<00:04:32.610> in<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:32.790> country<00:04:33.120> now<00:04:33.270> but<00:04:33.780> they<00:04:33.900> you

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
gardens in this country now but they you

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.570 
gardens in this country now but they you
know<00:04:34.139> they're<00:04:34.380> amending<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.950> system<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.460> make

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
know they're amending the system to make

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.800 
know they're amending the system to make
it<00:04:35.610> more<00:04:35.850> efficient<00:04:36.240> for<00:04:36.300> harvesting

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
it more efficient for harvesting

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.480 
it more efficient for harvesting
certainly<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.800> know<00:04:37.889> you've<00:04:38.040> obviously<00:04:38.190> got

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
certainly you know you've obviously got

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.520 
certainly you know you've obviously got
to<00:04:38.550> take<00:04:38.729> that<00:04:38.820> into<00:04:38.880> account<00:04:39.350> but<00:04:40.350> that

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
to take that into account but that

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.159 
to take that into account but that
that's<00:04:40.860> less<00:04:41.760> common<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.479> know<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:42.870> you<00:04:43.110> look

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
that's less common you know and you look

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.719 
that's less common you know and you look
at<00:04:43.350> forest<00:04:43.680> gardens<00:04:44.040> throughout<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.550> world

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
at forest gardens throughout the world

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.400 
at forest gardens throughout the world
you<00:04:45.000> know<00:04:45.419> there's<00:04:45.539> very<00:04:45.660> very<00:04:45.930> common

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
you know there's very very common

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.870 
you know there's very very common
particularly<00:04:47.220> in<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.460> tropics<00:04:47.789> and

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
particularly in the tropics and

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.420 
particularly in the tropics and
subtropics<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.630> there<00:04:49.289> it's<00:04:49.650> mainly<00:04:50.039> people

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
subtropics and there it's mainly people

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.760 
subtropics and there it's mainly people
growing<00:04:50.850> food<00:04:51.360> for<00:04:51.390> their<00:04:51.690> household<00:04:52.200> you

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
growing food for their household you

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.409 
growing food for their household you
know<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:53.039> they're<00:04:53.340> not<00:04:53.550> they<00:04:53.880> might<00:04:54.030> get<00:04:54.210> one

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
know it's they're not they might get one

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.670 
know it's they're not they might get one
or<00:04:54.510> two<00:04:54.539> they<00:04:55.050> have<00:04:55.140> a<00:04:55.169> bumper<00:04:55.470> crop<00:04:55.590> of

or two they have a bumper crop of

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.170 
or two they have a bumper crop of
something<00:04:56.039> they'll<00:04:56.220> sell<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.550> as<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.729> bonus<00:04:57.060> you

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
something they'll sell it as a bonus you

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.850 
something they'll sell it as a bonus you
know<00:04:57.270> but<00:04:57.690> there's<00:04:57.840> that's<00:04:58.110> not<00:04:58.350> usually<00:04:58.770> the

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
know but there's that's not usually the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.770 
know but there's that's not usually the
primarily<00:04:59.340> primary<00:04:59.910> function<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.660> know

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
primarily primary function you know

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.100 
primarily primary function you know
they're<00:05:01.020> forest<00:05:01.320> garden<00:05:02.570> okay<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.080> the

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
they're forest garden okay so the the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.900 
they're forest garden okay so the the
shrub<00:05:04.710> we've<00:05:04.860> just<00:05:05.010> come<00:05:05.130> under<00:05:05.370> which<00:05:05.729> is

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
shrub we've just come under which is

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.170 
shrub we've just come under which is
just<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.960> few<00:05:07.200> days<00:05:07.229> past<00:05:08.130> peak<00:05:08.610> flowering

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
just a few days past peak flowering

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.820 
just a few days past peak flowering
they're<00:05:09.570> just<00:05:09.810> starting<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.200> brown<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.560> little

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
they're just starting to brown a little

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.980 
they're just starting to brown a little
and<00:05:11.070> fall<00:05:11.250> off<00:05:11.430> of<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.820> bracts<00:05:12.300> unfortunately

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
and fall off of the bracts unfortunately

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.900 
and fall off of the bracts unfortunately
but<00:05:13.140> still<00:05:13.410> pretty<00:05:13.530> impressive<00:05:13.919> is<00:05:14.280> them

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
but still pretty impressive is them

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.460 
but still pretty impressive is them
Chinese<00:05:15.270> dogwood

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
Chinese dogwood

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.700 
Chinese dogwood
so<00:05:16.740> that's<00:05:16.890> corner<00:05:17.250> scusa<00:05:17.669> Clementis<00:05:18.710> which

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
so that's corner scusa Clementis which

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.400 
so that's corner scusa Clementis which
is<00:05:19.890> you<00:05:20.669> sometimes<00:05:21.120> see<00:05:21.330> it<00:05:21.419> in<00:05:21.600> ornamental

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
is you sometimes see it in ornamental

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.180 
is you sometimes see it in ornamental
gardens<00:05:22.770> for<00:05:23.280> this<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:24.390> flowering<00:05:25.190> but

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
gardens for this the flowering but

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.130 
gardens for this the flowering but
following<00:05:26.550> this<00:05:26.700> yeah<00:05:27.120> you<00:05:27.419> of<00:05:27.510> course<00:05:27.690> get<00:05:27.960> a

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
following this yeah you of course get a

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.340 
following this yeah you of course get a
whole<00:05:28.350> tree<00:05:28.740> covered<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.280> fruit<00:05:30.200> what<00:05:31.200> will

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
whole tree covered and fruit what will

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.540 
whole tree covered and fruit what will
become<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.650> fruit<00:05:31.919> you<00:05:32.010> can<00:05:32.160> see<00:05:32.340> in<00:05:32.460> the

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
become the fruit you can see in the

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.830 
become the fruit you can see in the
middle<00:05:32.789> of<00:05:32.880> each<00:05:33.000> before<00:05:33.690> bracts<00:05:34.500> there<00:05:34.740> and

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
middle of each before bracts there and

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.610 
middle of each before bracts there and
they<00:05:36.840> turn<00:05:37.080> into<00:05:38.330> nobley<00:05:39.330> well<00:05:40.110> kind<00:05:40.380> of<00:05:40.410> like

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
they turn into nobley well kind of like

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.240 
they turn into nobley well kind of like
she<00:05:40.950> shaped<00:05:41.479> fruits<00:05:42.479> about<00:05:43.260> 25<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:44.039> 30

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
she shaped fruits about 25 to 30
