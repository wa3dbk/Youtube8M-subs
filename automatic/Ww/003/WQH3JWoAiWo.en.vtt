00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.370
 let's make a dough to make 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.759
 croquettes if you do not want to lose any 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.759
 of my videos subscribe to the channel 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.759
 we start 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.820
 and the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.100
 they are 25 grams of butter 4 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.770
 spoonfuls of flour a little nut 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.990
 moscada a little bit of salt and milk 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.960
 half the first thing we will do is put 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.600
 a pan over a high heat we throw the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.559
 butter we will leave it to us 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.920
 melt let's lower the fire to fire 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.920
 medium 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.680
 because we already have the hot pan 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.680
 we take the flour 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.090
 and we fry them we turn them around 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.210
 so that we get cold a little bit 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.570
 and now we are adding milk 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.570
 to little 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.890
 let's lower the fire to the minimum 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.780
 everything and milk we do not have a measure 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.760
 Exactly the milk is the one that goes 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.470
 admitting the mass as you will see the 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.100
 absorbing and we are throwing a little 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.270
 little we will move strongly to not 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.539
 we get lumps 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.740
 we're going to take a tad more we're going to 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.740
 take a little salt 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.980
 and we're going to grate a little nut 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.980
 moscada that is doing very well 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.400
 At this point we already have the mass of 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.290
 croquettes ready when you see that it 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.970
 the pan is clean 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.840
 is that we already have the mass at its point 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.899
 so we turn off 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.630
 and it is ready the more soft 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.369
 leave the dough as you see better then go out 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.679
 Croquettes cost a little more than 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.200
 mess but they come out much richer then 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.080
 we already have our delicious mass ready 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.090
 of croquettes if you liked hand 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.940
 up if you've loved adding it 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.620
 I hope you liked it and 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.379
