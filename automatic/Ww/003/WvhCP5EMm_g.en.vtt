00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
you can see we're now up to where we

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.810 
you can see we're now up to where we
approximately<00:01:53.470> want<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.740> be<00:01:53.830> for<00:01:54.040> grade<00:01:54.310> so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
approximately want to be for grade so

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.150 
approximately want to be for grade so
we'll<00:01:54.970> have<00:01:55.150> two<00:01:55.840> two<00:01:56.110> possibly<00:01:56.500> three<00:01:56.590> steps

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
we'll have two two possibly three steps

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.020 
we'll have two two possibly three steps
down<00:01:57.430> from<00:01:57.880> our<00:01:58.180> patio<00:01:59.170> area<00:01:59.560> here<00:01:59.860> or<00:02:00.580> our

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
down from our patio area here or our

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.960 
down from our patio area here or our
back<00:02:01.240> step<00:02:01.630> down<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.740> our<00:02:03.220> patio<00:02:03.640> which<00:02:03.820> will

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
back step down to our patio which will

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.690 
back step down to our patio which will
be<00:02:04.060> right<00:02:04.210> in<00:02:04.270> here<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:06.160> only<00:02:06.369> thing<00:02:06.550> we

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
be right in here and the only thing we

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.040 
be right in here and the only thing we
have<00:02:06.820> left<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:07.090> do<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.210> actually<00:02:07.479> just<00:02:07.630> level

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
have left to do is actually just level

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.900 
have left to do is actually just level
this<00:02:08.110> area<00:02:08.410> out<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.770> our<00:02:08.800> yard<00:02:09.310> kind<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.640> slopes

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
this area out so our yard kind of slopes

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.030 
this area out so our yard kind of slopes
back<00:02:10.119> off<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:10.570> we've<00:02:10.720> already<00:02:10.869> got<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.890> can

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
back off but we've already got you can

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.440 
back off but we've already got you can
see<00:02:12.190> we're<00:02:12.340> using<00:02:12.489> three<00:02:12.820> different<00:02:13.000> types<00:02:13.330> of

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
see we're using three different types of

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.830 
see we're using three different types of
sand

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
sand

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.190 
sand
we've<00:02:14.590> got<00:02:14.770> river<00:02:15.130> sand<00:02:15.430> underneath<00:02:16.080> way<00:02:17.080> at

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
we've got river sand underneath way at

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.770 
we've got river sand underneath way at
the<00:02:17.260> back<00:02:17.410> there<00:02:17.739> there<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.940> now<00:02:19.150> we're<00:02:19.330> cut

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
the back there there and now we're cut

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.449 
the back there there and now we're cut
we're<00:02:19.989> covering<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.530> with<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.890> good<00:02:21.130> thick

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
we're covering that with a good thick

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.180 
we're covering that with a good thick
layer<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.730> sea<00:02:22.209> shell<00:02:22.450> sand<00:02:23.010> which<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.160> a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
layer of sea shell sand which is a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.690 
layer of sea shell sand which is a
natural<00:02:24.610> product<00:02:24.820> drains<00:02:25.180> really<00:02:25.540> well<00:02:25.690> and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
natural product drains really well and

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.949 
natural product drains really well and
drains<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.790> lot<00:02:27.820> better<00:02:28.120> than<00:02:28.269> river<00:02:28.450> sand<00:02:28.750> does

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
drains a lot better than river sand does

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.280 
drains a lot better than river sand does
and<00:02:29.340> here<00:02:30.340> where<00:02:30.519> we're<00:02:30.610> gonna<00:02:30.670> put<00:02:30.970> patio<00:02:31.750> we

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
and here where we're gonna put patio we

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.590 
and here where we're gonna put patio we
have<00:02:32.640> recycled<00:02:33.640> sin<00:02:33.820> that's<00:02:34.180> what's<00:02:34.330> coming

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
have recycled sin that's what's coming

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.070 
have recycled sin that's what's coming
in

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
in

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.649 
in

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.449 

reason<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:41.319> use<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.860> because<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.250> packs

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
reason we use that is because it packs

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.199 
reason we use that is because it packs
down<00:02:42.730> really<00:02:42.790> well<00:02:43.120> so

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
down really well so
