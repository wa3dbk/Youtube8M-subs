over<00:00:11.400> there<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.200> I<00:00:13.490> don't<00:00:14.490> know<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.700> pretty

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
over there and I don't know it's pretty

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.019 
over there and I don't know it's pretty
easy<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.240> walk<00:00:15.509> over<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:16.039> we<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.250> as<00:00:17.460> giant

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
easy to walk over here we have as giant

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.540 
easy to walk over here we have as giant
antenna<00:00:18.560> so<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.650> probably<00:00:19.680> see<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.369> for

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
antenna so you probably see this for

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.529 
antenna so you probably see this for
miles<00:00:20.820> or<00:00:21.740> blow<00:00:22.740> 2<00:00:22.800> chunks<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.400> don't<00:00:23.730> know<00:00:23.820> it's

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
miles or blow 2 chunks I don't know it's

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.209 
miles or blow 2 chunks I don't know it's
like<00:00:24.890> pretty<00:00:25.890> damn<00:00:26.160> tall<00:00:28.609> ok<00:00:29.609> anyway<00:00:31.040> this<00:00:32.040> is

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
like pretty damn tall ok anyway this is

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.209 
like pretty damn tall ok anyway this is
the<00:00:32.369> entrance<00:00:33.380> but<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.559> entire<00:00:34.770> map<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the entrance but the entire map is

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.910 
the entrance but the entire map is
pretty<00:00:35.460> much<00:00:35.579> underground<00:00:36.230> it's<00:00:37.230> basically
