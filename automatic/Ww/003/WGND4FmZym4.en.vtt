00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
then hopefully we will we will we will

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.770 
then hopefully we will we will we will
get<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.069> fan<00:02:35.280> base<00:02:35.459> together<00:02:35.609> and<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.689> able

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
get that fan base together and be able

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.929 
get that fan base together and be able
to<00:02:36.900> be<00:02:37.709> able<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.430> create<00:02:38.579> something

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
to be able to you know create something

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.759 
to be able to you know create something
that<00:02:39.180> has<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.900> potential<00:02:40.170> for<00:02:40.319> eSports<00:02:40.680> I

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
that has the potential for eSports I

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.920 
that has the potential for eSports I
mean<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.980> think<00:02:41.010> total<00:02:41.400> war<00:02:41.519> battles<00:02:41.930> already

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
mean I think total war battles already

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.259 
mean I think total war battles already
do<00:02:43.470> have<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.220> potential<00:02:44.670> because

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
do have that have that potential because

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.149 
do have that have that potential because
they<00:02:45.510> look<00:02:45.810> spectacular<00:02:46.079> they're<00:02:46.980> really

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
they look spectacular they're really

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.490 
they look spectacular they're really
skill-based<00:02:47.760> they're<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.569> great<00:02:48.780> spectacle<00:02:49.079> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
skill-based they're a great spectacle to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.589 
skill-based they're a great spectacle to
watch<00:02:49.739> as<00:02:50.010> well<00:02:50.220> as<00:02:50.370> great<00:02:50.819> fun<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.120> play<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:51.569> I

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
watch as well as great fun to play so I

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.080 
watch as well as great fun to play so I
think<00:02:51.750> there's<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.079> lot<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.230> potential<00:02:52.560> area<00:02:53.090> so

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
think there's a lot of potential area so

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.879 
think there's a lot of potential area so
it<00:02:54.209> was<00:02:54.359> just<00:02:54.540> released<00:02:54.840> our<00:02:55.019> U<00:02:55.170> cubed<00:02:55.530> plans

we want to make sure that because you've
got<00:04:57.720> different<00:04:57.870> roles<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.530> you're

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
got different roles that you're

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.470 
got different roles that you're
performing<00:04:58.980> in<00:04:59.340> battle<00:04:59.970> that<00:05:00.180> we<00:05:00.270> need<00:05:00.390> to

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
performing in battle that we need to

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.410 
performing in battle that we need to
make<00:05:00.630> sure<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:00.960> army<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.470> ten<00:05:01.740> people

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
make sure that the army of ten people

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.670

that<00:05:03.420> there's<00:05:03.570> a<00:05:03.630> well<00:05:03.840> balanced<00:05:04.260> mix<00:05:04.500> of

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
that there's a well balanced mix of

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.760 
that there's a well balanced mix of
different<00:05:04.770> roles<00:05:05.130> that<00:05:05.790> skill<00:05:06.120> levels

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
different roles that skill levels

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.110 
different roles that skill levels
between<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.040> armies<00:05:08.340> are<00:05:08.490> really<00:05:08.670> balanced

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
between the armies are really balanced

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.670 
between the armies are really balanced
so<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.600> matchmaking<00:05:09.990> is<00:05:10.140> really<00:05:10.320> important

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
so the matchmaking is really important

to<00:05:20.460> help<00:05:20.640> make<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:20.910> balance<00:05:21.180> in<00:05:21.330> grey<00:05:21.570> but<00:05:22.200> the

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
to help make the balance in grey but the

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.930
