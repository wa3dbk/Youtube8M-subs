right here it would have been kind of

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.110 
right here it would have been kind of
like<00:03:56.019> this<00:03:56.379> for<00:03:56.739> my<00:03:57.489> hair<00:03:57.699> because<00:03:57.940> I'm

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.190 
this unit was shipped very fast it did
not<00:05:00.500> come<00:05:00.680> by<00:05:00.830> UPS<00:05:01.010> off<00:05:01.670> it<00:05:01.910> came<00:05:02.150> by<00:05:02.420> the<00:05:02.840> mill

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
not come by UPS off it came by the mill

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.030 
not come by UPS off it came by the mill
so<00:05:03.830> that's<00:05:04.070> probably<00:05:04.400> why<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:06.320> shipping<00:05:06.920> and

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
so that's probably why the shipping and

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.890 
so that's probably why the shipping and
everything<00:05:07.160> was<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.640> little<00:05:08.030> bit<00:05:08.150> tab<00:05:08.420> cheaper

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
everything was a little bit tab cheaper

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.340 
everything was a little bit tab cheaper
