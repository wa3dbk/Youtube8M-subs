00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.980
 this little town south of the vienne 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.080
 is known throughout France this is 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.750
 not thanks to a culinary specialty or 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.650
 to a historical monument but rather to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.820
 a cooperative 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.960
 this year she is celebrating 80 spring 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.949
 it seems to me that at the time it must be 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.320
 something very innovative I think 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.500
 the purpose of the pastoral alliance 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.349
 This was to provide the breeders of the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 materials at the best price eight breeders 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.280
 to reproduce in montmorillon the southern model 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.390
 they quickly realized that this practice 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.820
 was not without disease problem 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.739
 surveillance then fence these pioneers 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 decided to create a union 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.230
 professional this is how the alliance 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.670
 Pastoral was born in 1933 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.860
 today the cooperative counts 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.270

 60 years and pastoral for us 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.950

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.270
