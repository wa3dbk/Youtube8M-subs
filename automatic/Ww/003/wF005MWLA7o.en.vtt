of<00:00:50.579> Planets<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.420> too<00:00:51.600> familiar<00:00:51.780> with

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
of Planets I'm not too familiar with

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.290 
of Planets I'm not too familiar with
Star<00:00:52.350> Trek<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.250> gotta<00:00:53.579> assume<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
Star Trek but I gotta assume that it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.939 
Star Trek but I gotta assume that it
probably<00:00:54.510> corresponds<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> story<00:00:55.649> or

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
probably corresponds with a story or

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
probably corresponds with a story or
basically<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> ongoing<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.449> Laura<00:00:57.899> stuff

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
basically the ongoing is Laura stuff

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560 
basically the ongoing is Laura stuff
like<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.320> between<00:00:59.160> Star<00:00:59.579> Trek<00:00:59.789> but<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.180> can't

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570

let's go ahead skip the dialogue over
here<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.810> I'll<00:03:12.810> select<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.170> second<00:03:13.530> skill

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
here and I'll select the second skill

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.280 
here and I'll select the second skill
this<00:03:14.190> will<00:03:14.340> probably<00:03:14.490> wipe<00:03:14.760> them<00:03:14.940> all<00:03:15.090> out<00:03:15.290> yep

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
this will probably wipe them all out yep

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.110 
this will probably wipe them all out yep
just<00:03:16.500> like<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.739> assumed<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.220> gonna<00:03:17.670> wipe<00:03:17.940> them

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
just like I assumed it's gonna wipe them

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.520 
just like I assumed it's gonna wipe them
all<00:03:18.270> out<00:03:18.300> except<00:03:18.720> for<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> big<00:03:19.110> ship<00:03:19.290> over

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
all out except for the big ship over

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.350 
all out except for the big ship over
there<00:03:19.770> let's<00:03:20.430> let's<00:03:20.640> go<00:03:20.760> ahead<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.120> continue

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
there let's let's go ahead and continue

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.500 
there let's let's go ahead and continue
the<00:03:21.720> dialogue<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:23.000> he's<00:03:24.000> probably<00:03:24.180> make<00:03:24.450> an

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
the dialogue and he's probably make an

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.970 
the dialogue and he's probably make an
attack<00:03:24.750> oh<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.140> guess<00:03:25.380> he<00:03:25.500> didn't<00:03:25.709> even<00:03:25.770> make<00:03:25.920> a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
attack oh I guess he didn't even make a

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.530 
attack oh I guess he didn't even make a
tag<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.400> guess<00:03:26.520> we<00:03:26.640> won<00:03:26.790> our<00:03:26.820> fight<00:03:27.120> all<00:03:27.330> right

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
tag and guess we won our fight all right

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.360 
tag and guess we won our fight all right
not<00:03:27.780> too<00:03:27.810> big<00:03:28.080> of<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.260> deal<00:03:28.410> wasn't<00:03:29.100> too

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
not too big of a deal wasn't too

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.430 
not too big of a deal wasn't too
difficult<00:03:29.610> overall<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.540> fairly<00:03:30.780> simple<00:03:31.230> but

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
difficult overall is fairly simple but

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.400 
difficult overall is fairly simple but
now<00:03:31.650> we<00:03:31.709> are<00:03:31.860> back<00:03:32.070> into<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.580> galaxy<00:03:33.120> um

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
now we are back into like the galaxy um

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.449 
now we are back into like the galaxy um
selection<00:03:34.410> over<00:03:34.590> here<00:03:34.800> or<00:03:34.950> kind<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.220> like<00:03:35.430> a

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
selection over here or kind of like a

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.390 
selection over here or kind of like a
maybe<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.660> world<00:03:36.900> map<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.440> seems<00:03:37.800> like<00:03:38.070> but

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
maybe the world map it seems like but

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.100 
maybe the world map it seems like but
I'm<00:03:38.610> gotta<00:03:39.000> go<00:03:39.090> ahead<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.420> skip<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.690> dialogue

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
I'm gotta go ahead and skip to dialogue

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.500 
I'm gotta go ahead and skip to dialogue
and<00:03:40.459> let's<00:03:41.459> go<00:03:41.580> ahead<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.790> check<00:03:42.030> out<00:03:42.209> what<00:03:42.239> uh

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
and let's go ahead and check out what uh

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.420 
and let's go ahead and check out what uh
what<00:03:43.410> else<00:03:43.590> we<00:03:43.739> can<00:03:43.860> do<00:03:43.980> other<00:03:44.130> than<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
what else we can do other than the

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.770 
what else we can do other than the
combat<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:44.970> same<00:03:45.120> things<00:03:45.300> could<00:03:45.480> be<00:03:45.510> kind

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
combat so the same things could be kind

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.020 
combat so the same things could be kind
of<00:03:45.810> like<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.080> like<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> base<00:03:47.070> builder<00:03:47.550> or<00:03:47.730> like

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
of like a like a base builder or like

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.699 
of like a like a base builder or like
you<00:03:48.180> know<00:03:48.209> kind<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.570> like<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.780> maybe<00:03:49.110> galaxy

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
you know kind of like a maybe galaxy

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.199 
you know kind of like a maybe galaxy
captures<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.280> stuff<00:03:50.400> like<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.580> kind<00:03:51.180> of

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
captures and stuff like that kind of

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.930 
captures and stuff like that kind of
like<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.450> Civil<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:52.310> civilization<00:03:53.310> games<00:03:53.550> if

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
like the Civil a civilization games if

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.110 
like the Civil a civilization games if
you<00:03:54.420> guys<00:03:54.570> know<00:03:54.870> those<00:03:55.110> are<00:03:55.470> basically<00:03:56.400> you

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
you guys know those are basically you

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.240 
you guys know those are basically you
kind<00:03:57.239> of<00:03:57.360> conquer<00:03:57.570> areas<00:03:58.170> that's<00:03:58.769> kind<00:03:59.100> of

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
kind of conquer areas that's kind of

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.460 
kind of conquer areas that's kind of
maybe<00:03:59.580> what<00:04:00.000> I'm<00:04:00.120> looking<00:04:00.480> like<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:01.320> game's

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
maybe what I'm looking like the game's

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.560 
maybe what I'm looking like the game's
gonna<00:04:01.739> be<00:04:01.800> aiming<00:04:02.670> toward<00:04:02.940> let's<00:04:03.209> go<00:04:03.330> ahead

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
gonna be aiming toward let's go ahead

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.210 
gonna be aiming toward let's go ahead
and<00:04:03.720> explore<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.140> galaxy<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:04.890> told<00:04:05.100> us

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
and explore this galaxy like it told us

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.520 
and explore this galaxy like it told us
to<00:04:05.459> we're<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.269> go<00:04:06.390> ahead<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.810> engage<00:04:07.170> this

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
to we're to go ahead and engage this

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.810 
to we're to go ahead and engage this
time<00:04:07.709> it's<00:04:07.890> loading<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.280> little<00:04:08.519> bit<00:04:08.610> quicker

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
time it's loading a little bit quicker

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.400 
time it's loading a little bit quicker
than<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.150> was<00:04:09.269> last<00:04:09.300> time<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:09.870> that's<00:04:10.019> too<00:04:10.230> good

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
than it was last time so that's too good

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.479 
than it was last time so that's too good
we<00:04:10.560> don't<00:04:10.709> wait<00:04:10.890> too<00:04:10.980> long<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.250> loading

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
we don't wait too long in the loading

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.520 
we don't wait too long in the loading
screen<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:12.060> here<00:04:12.959> we<00:04:13.080> are<00:04:13.200> we're<00:04:13.380> just

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
screen and here we are we're just

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.440 
screen and here we are we're just
engaging<00:04:13.860> right<00:04:14.220> into<00:04:14.459> another<00:04:14.489> battle<00:04:15.269> right

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
engaging right into another battle right

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.310 
engaging right into another battle right
off<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.690> bat<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.260> not<00:04:16.799> too<00:04:16.980> bad<00:04:17.220> um<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:19.049> seems

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
off the bat so not too bad um so seems

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.159 
off the bat so not too bad um so seems
like<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.560> game<00:04:19.710> is<00:04:19.890> going<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.130> kind<00:04:20.460> of<00:04:20.609> a

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
like the game is going to be kind of a

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.930 
like the game is going to be kind of a
continuation<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.260> fighting<00:04:23.039> galaxies<00:04:23.520> all<00:04:23.789> we

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
continuation of fighting galaxies all we

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.040 
continuation of fighting galaxies all we
collected<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.419> ship<00:04:24.720> to

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
collected that ship to

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.180 
collected that ship to
so<00:04:25.169> that's<00:04:25.289> pretty<00:04:25.409> cool<00:04:25.500> we<00:04:25.800> defeated<00:04:26.099> the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
so that's pretty cool we defeated the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.309 
so that's pretty cool we defeated the
ship<00:04:26.430> we<00:04:26.550> collected<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.090> so<00:04:27.599> maybe<00:04:27.720> we<00:04:27.960> can<00:04:28.050> add

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
ship we collected it so maybe we can add

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:29.990 
ship we collected it so maybe we can add
it<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.650> switch<00:04:28.889> it<00:04:28.919> out<00:04:29.129> in<00:04:29.370> our<00:04:29.490> arsenal

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
it and switch it out in our arsenal

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.270 
it and switch it out in our arsenal
later<00:04:30.750> on<00:04:31.020> which<00:04:31.349> is<00:04:31.500> pretty<00:04:31.650> interesting<00:04:31.949> it

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
later on which is pretty interesting it

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.879 
later on which is pretty interesting it
seems<00:04:32.310> but<00:04:32.940> we<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:33.389> defeated<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.139> area<00:04:34.620> and

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
seems but we just defeated this area and

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.189 
seems but we just defeated this area and
we<00:04:35.669> can<00:04:35.789> go<00:04:35.879> ahead<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.120> enter<00:04:36.389> if<00:04:36.720> we<00:04:36.840> want<00:04:37.080> to

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
we can go ahead and enter if we want to

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.920 
we can go ahead and enter if we want to
but<00:04:37.650> if<00:04:37.860> we<00:04:38.400> don't<00:04:38.639> we<00:04:39.000> can<00:04:39.270> see<00:04:39.509> that<00:04:39.720> out

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
but if we don't we can see that out

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.390 
but if we don't we can see that out
there's<00:04:40.139> the<00:04:40.289> dotted<00:04:40.560> line<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:40.770> there's<00:04:41.310> a

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
there's the dotted line and there's a

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.180 
there's the dotted line and there's a
bunch<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.699> different<00:04:42.150> on<00:04:42.560> galaxies<00:04:43.560> or<00:04:43.680> areas

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
bunch of different on galaxies or areas

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.820 
bunch of different on galaxies or areas
we<00:04:44.370> can<00:04:44.490> kind<00:04:44.729> of<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:46.020> know<00:04:46.050> discover<00:04:46.620> later

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
we can kind of you know discover later

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.350 
we can kind of you know discover later
on<00:04:47.069> if<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.340> look<00:04:47.430> at<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.550> mini-map<00:04:47.879> over<00:04:48.150> here

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
on if you look at the mini-map over here

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.149 
on if you look at the mini-map over here
this<00:04:48.509> ?<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.289> I'm<00:04:49.379> sure<00:04:49.710> we're<00:04:49.889> going<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.039> be

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
this ? so I'm sure we're going to be

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.580 
this ? so I'm sure we're going to be
able<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.490> lead<00:04:50.669> our<00:04:50.699> way<00:04:50.970> over<00:04:51.449> there<00:04:52.319> pretty

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
able to lead our way over there pretty

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.839 
able to lead our way over there pretty
soon<00:04:52.710> as<00:04:53.159> you<00:04:53.280> can<00:04:53.370> see<00:04:53.430> they're<00:04:53.580> kind<00:04:53.789> of

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
soon as you can see they're kind of

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.360 
soon as you can see they're kind of
grayed<00:04:54.210> out<00:04:54.240> over<00:04:54.810> here<00:04:55.139> so<00:04:55.830> while<00:04:56.009> we<00:04:56.129> can't

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
grayed out over here so while we can't

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.450 
grayed out over here so while we can't
get<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.699> them<00:04:56.849> yet<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:57.979> overall<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.190> game

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
get to them yet but overall the game

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.040 
get to them yet but overall the game
seems<00:04:59.789> really<00:05:00.300> simple<00:05:00.539> and<00:05:00.810> straightforward

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
seems really simple and straightforward

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.770 
seems really simple and straightforward
it's<00:05:02.009> kind<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.490> like<00:05:02.550> running<00:05:02.849> dungeons<00:05:03.240> and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
it's kind of like running dungeons and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.809 
it's kind of like running dungeons and
like<00:05:03.960> other<00:05:04.169> browser<00:05:04.440> based<00:05:04.650> on<00:05:04.800> more<00:05:05.069> pgs<00:05:05.490> but

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
like other browser based on more pgs but

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.209 
like other browser based on more pgs but
this<00:05:05.969> is<00:05:06.120> basically<00:05:06.379> kind<00:05:07.379> of<00:05:07.530> jumping<00:05:07.919> from

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219 
this is basically kind of jumping from

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.770 
this is basically kind of jumping from
one<00:05:08.729> galaxy<00:05:09.180> or<00:05:09.780> one<00:05:10.650> battleship<00:05:10.979> area<00:05:11.780> battle

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
one galaxy or one battleship area battle

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.480 
one galaxy or one battleship area battle
to<00:05:12.810> another<00:05:13.349> kind<00:05:13.710> of<00:05:13.830> conquering<00:05:14.250> them

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
to another kind of conquering them

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.490 
to another kind of conquering them
taking<00:05:14.879> them<00:05:14.969> over<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.539> I'm<00:05:15.629> sure<00:05:15.840> she<00:05:16.289> fights

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
taking them over and I'm sure she fights

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.080 
taking them over and I'm sure she fights
get<00:05:16.680> too<00:05:16.800> difficult<00:05:17.219> I'm<00:05:17.370> assume<00:05:17.789> you<00:05:17.940> could

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
get too difficult I'm assume you could

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.420 
get too difficult I'm assume you could
probably<00:05:18.300> go<00:05:18.539> back<00:05:18.830> re-enter<00:05:19.830> them<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.190> you

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
probably go back re-enter them and you

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.689 
probably go back re-enter them and you
know<00:05:20.550> grind<00:05:20.849> out<00:05:21.030> some<00:05:22.129> some<00:05:23.129> fights<00:05:23.580> and

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
know grind out some some fights and
