00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
the godly sword of Zeus I think it's the

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.450 
the godly sword of Zeus I think it's the
best<00:00:33.260> one<00:00:33.470> a<00:00:33.710> lot<00:00:33.920> of<00:00:33.980> people<00:00:34.190> say<00:00:34.310> it's

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.640 
best one a lot of people say it's
overpowered<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.360> it<00:00:36.140> might<00:00:36.440> well<00:00:36.590> be

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
overpowered and it might well be

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.590 
overpowered and it might well be
especially<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.460> match<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.820> Champions<00:00:38.300> but<00:00:38.480> it's

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
especially a match of Champions but it's

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.760

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
here but I think overall I just prefer

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.490

of arrows so now we're going to be

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.069 
of arrows so now we're going to be
looking<00:03:08.069> at<00:03:08.159> Poseidon<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.849> I<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.750> godly

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
looking at Poseidon and I like the godly

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.140 
looking at Poseidon and I like the godly
sword<00:03:10.379> of<00:03:10.500> Poseidon<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.280> actually<00:03:11.760> used<00:03:12.060> the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
sword of Poseidon I actually used the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.819 
sword of Poseidon I actually used the
godly<00:03:12.420> war<00:03:12.629> arm<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.959> Poseidon<00:03:13.409> which<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.620> think

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
godly war arm of Poseidon which I think

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.500 
godly war arm of Poseidon which I think
is<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.010> best-looking<00:03:14.340> godly<00:03:15.000> armor<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.359> them

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
is the best-looking godly armor of them

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.539 
is the best-looking godly armor of them
all<00:03:15.659> they<00:03:16.139> actually<00:03:16.470> adds<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.859> huge<00:03:17.190> huge

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
all they actually adds a huge huge

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.550 
all they actually adds a huge huge
amount<00:03:17.879> of<00:03:18.000> Elemental<00:03:18.540> resistance<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.379> for

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
amount of Elemental resistance and for

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.259 
amount of Elemental resistance and for
each<00:03:19.709> piece<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.310> I've<00:03:20.430> definitely<00:03:20.639> recommend

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
each piece so I've definitely recommend

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.210 
each piece so I've definitely recommend
that<00:03:21.419> I<00:03:21.629> like<00:03:22.109> to<00:03:22.199> use<00:03:22.319> Poseidon's<00:03:22.769> crest<00:03:23.069> from

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
that I like to use Poseidon's crest from

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.920 
that I like to use Poseidon's crest from
my<00:03:23.310> magic<00:03:23.489> just<00:03:23.910> because<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.569> helps<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.900> to

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
my magic just because it helps you to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.170 
my magic just because it helps you to
carry<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.319> combos<00:03:25.889> and<00:03:26.099> it's<00:03:26.250> only<00:03:26.370> 50<00:03:26.760> points

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
carry on combos and it's only 50 points

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.449 
carry on combos and it's only 50 points
I<00:03:27.359> like<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.959> use<00:03:28.139> the<00:03:28.500> cloak<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.919> Boreas

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
I like to use the cloak of Boreas

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.069 
I like to use the cloak of Boreas
because<00:03:29.819> again<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.299> really<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:30.750> bubbles

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
because again I really like the bubbles

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.449 
because again I really like the bubbles
I<00:03:31.199> find<00:03:31.410> them<00:03:31.530> easy<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.099> guard<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
I find them easy just the guard on the

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.150 
I find them easy just the guard on the
attack<00:03:32.730> whilst<00:03:33.030> not<00:03:33.239> dying<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.650> also<00:03:34.829> like

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
attack whilst not dying and I also like

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.860 
attack whilst not dying and I also like
to<00:03:35.280> use<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.579> relic<00:03:35.879> of<00:03:36.000> regeneration<00:03:36.540> and

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
to use the relic of regeneration and

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.960 
to use the relic of regeneration and
that's<00:03:37.049> probably<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:37.349> most<00:03:37.470> important<00:03:37.919> one

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
that's probably the most important one

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.159 
that's probably the most important one
because<00:03:38.970> every<00:03:39.239> time<00:03:39.419> you<00:03:39.540> get<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.720> few<00:03:39.930> grabs

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
because every time you get a few grabs

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.539 
because every time you get a few grabs
you're<00:03:40.410> gonna<00:03:40.500> get<00:03:40.739> beside<00:03:41.129> and<00:03:41.280> suppressed

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
you're gonna get beside and suppressed

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.430 
you're gonna get beside and suppressed
magic<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.540> it's<00:03:42.690> really<00:03:42.989> really<00:03:43.260> useful

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
magic and it's really really useful

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.990 
magic and it's really really useful
especially<00:03:43.949> when<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.459> change<00:03:44.730> stuff

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
especially when you change stuff

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.240 
especially when you change stuff
together<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.569> actually<00:03:46.379> also<00:03:46.650> really<00:03:46.919> like<00:03:47.160> the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
together I actually also really like the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.949 
together I actually also really like the
godly<00:03:47.549> spirit<00:03:47.940> Poseidon<00:03:48.389> I<00:03:48.449> don't<00:03:48.629> really<00:03:48.780> use

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
godly spirit Poseidon I don't really use

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.240 
godly spirit Poseidon I don't really use
Spears<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.440> often<00:03:49.739> but<00:03:49.859> this<00:03:49.949> one<00:03:50.099> is

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
Spears that often but this one is

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.189 
Spears that often but this one is
actually<00:03:50.340> really<00:03:50.849> really<00:03:50.940> good<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.989> looks

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
actually really really good and it looks

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.409 
actually really really good and it looks
awesome<00:03:52.440> as<00:03:52.769> well<00:03:52.919> so<00:03:53.280> if<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:53.699> like<00:03:53.879> Spears<00:03:54.209> I

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
awesome as well so if you like Spears I

00:03:54.419 --> 00:04:03.020
