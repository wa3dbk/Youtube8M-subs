00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
Advanta comparisions no problem but it's

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.020 
Advanta comparisions no problem but it's
just<00:01:07.920> easier<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.369> play<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.549> translator

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
a actual Famicom copy because I'm a huge

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.070

fan<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> game<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.970> kid<00:01:15.270> Dracula<00:01:15.900> is

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
fan of the game now kid Dracula is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.920 
fan of the game now kid Dracula is
actually<00:01:16.770> related<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.060> Castlevania

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
actually related to the Castlevania

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.539 
actually related to the Castlevania
series<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.380> Japan<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.860> shares<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> same<00:01:20.490> name

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
series in Japan it shares the same name

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.050 
series in Japan it shares the same name
which<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.150> believe<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.600> even<00:01:22.020> Castle<00:01:22.439> Dracula

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
which I believe is even Castle Dracula

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.190 
which I believe is even Castle Dracula
special<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.810> actually<00:01:25.049> hit

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
special I think it is for actually hit

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.390 
special I think it is for actually hit
ragga<00:01:25.470> though<00:01:25.740> over<00:01:25.979> there

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
ragga though over there

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
ragga though over there
so<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.090> regulation<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> Castlevania

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
so it's regulation in the Castlevania

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.590 
so it's regulation in the Castlevania
series<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.250> small<00:01:29.610> obviously<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
series is small obviously it's a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.870 
series is small obviously it's a
spin-off<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.310> some<00:01:32.549> parts

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
spin-off but there there are some parts

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
spin-off but there there are some parts
in<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.360> you're<00:01:33.509> cast<00:01:33.689> meeting

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
in there that if you're cast meeting

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.390 
in there that if you're cast meeting
your<00:01:34.079> fan<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> makes<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.189> laugh

cool and then of course you've got the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.840 
cool and then of course you've got the
Castlevania<00:02:51.220> elements<00:02:51.580> where<00:02:51.730> you're

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
Castlevania elements where you're

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.400

fighting monsters and stuff like that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.009 
fighting monsters and stuff like that
they'll<00:02:53.620> Castlevania<00:02:54.220> probably<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.019> last

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
they'll Castlevania probably the last

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.040 
they'll Castlevania probably the last
thing<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.560> would<00:02:56.800> compare<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.160> just<00:02:57.370> because<00:02:58.050> it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
thing I would compare to just because it

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.440 
thing I would compare to just because it
really<00:02:59.320> relates<00:02:59.860> more<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.250> Mario<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.180> Mega

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
really relates more to Mario and Mega

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.910 
really relates more to Mario and Mega
Man<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:02.260> all<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.560> all<00:03:02.680> they're<00:03:02.890> all

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
Man but all in all they're all

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.790 
Man but all in all they're all
platformers<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:04.450> get<00:03:04.660> one<00:03:04.810> happy<00:03:05.019> but

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
platformers so you get one happy but

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.250 
platformers so you get one happy but
overall<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.489> gameplay<00:03:07.150> wise<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.450> very<00:03:07.720> funny

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
overall a gameplay wise it's very funny

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.960 
overall a gameplay wise it's very funny
and<00:03:08.410> obviously<00:03:08.920> if<00:03:09.130> you're<00:03:09.280> combining<00:03:09.459> all

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
and obviously if you're combining all

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.280 
and obviously if you're combining all
three<00:03:10.269> of<00:03:10.390> those<00:03:10.480> means<00:03:10.780> you're<00:03:11.019> probably

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
three of those means you're probably

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.540 
three of those means you're probably
going<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.560> have<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.739> really<00:03:11.980> good<00:03:12.190> experience

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
going to have a really good experience

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.100 
going to have a really good experience
and<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:12.940> is<00:03:13.090> fun<00:03:13.390> though<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.840> can<00:03:13.989> be

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
and it is fun though it can be

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.140 
and it is fun though it can be
frustrated<00:03:14.709> with<00:03:14.830> some<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.190> jumps<00:03:15.489> you

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
frustrated with some of the jumps you

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.640 
frustrated with some of the jumps you
thought<00:03:16.480> for<00:03:16.660> sure<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:17.050> read<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.380> end<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.590> a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
thought for sure you read the end to a

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.590 
thought for sure you read the end to a
platform<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.340> jump<00:03:18.670> them<00:03:18.850> all<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.390> death

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
platform and you jump them all to death

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.750 
platform and you jump them all to death
and<00:03:19.959> great<00:03:20.769> but<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.280> one<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.489> those<00:03:21.580> things

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
and great but it's one of those things

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
come back to it play it again I guess

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.060 
come back to it play it again I guess
we'll<00:03:25.900> just<00:03:25.930> kind<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.350> start<00:03:26.560> through<00:03:26.860> the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
we'll just kind of start through the

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.170 
we'll just kind of start through the
whole<00:03:27.880> portion<00:03:28.450> of<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:29.459> again<00:03:30.459> there's<00:03:31.090> a

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
whole portion of it is again there's a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.310 
whole portion of it is again there's a
portion<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.840> know<00:03:31.959> when<00:03:32.050> you<00:03:32.110> hit<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
portion for you know when you hit the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.080 
portion for you know when you hit the
jump<00:03:32.560> button<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.130> just<00:03:33.340> didn't<00:03:33.640> jump<00:03:33.820> for

sharps to shot it just doesn't shoot off

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.870 
sharps to shot it just doesn't shoot off
it's<00:03:38.500> comparable<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.040> Mega<00:03:39.250> Man<00:03:39.459> which<00:03:39.670> Mega

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
it's comparable to Mega Man which Mega

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.640 
it's comparable to Mega Man which Mega
Man<00:03:40.060> for<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.510> most<00:03:40.660> part<00:03:40.959> has<00:03:41.170> very<00:03:41.560> very

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
Man for the most part has very very

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.340 
Man for the most part has very very
solid<00:03:42.100> controls<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:43.630> always<00:03:43.780> debatable

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
solid controls and it's always debatable
