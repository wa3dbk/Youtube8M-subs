00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 challenge we do not play with the most 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.679
 slow of the game as written in the title 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.690

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.460
 while they are winger years one of 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.859
 defenders running at 34 was a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.600
 goalkeeper running at 33 on ronaldinho 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.230

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.670
 in the last video it's okay 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.010
 still feasible it's showing that they the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.050
 cabbage frankly I'm confident at the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.699
 ronaldinho who will not respect the delirium 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.989

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.760
 delirium oh there there oh there I'm doing 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.199
 too much I do too much but that's it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.250
 problem I do too much green way and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.180
 sakhir the passing of legs by 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.720
 against do not heat up too much you 're going to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.570

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.790
 blanco blanco good 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.220
 blanco who got screwed up here 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.240
 he is 45 years old he must be left when 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.760
 even tranquil with his problems of 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.200
 back yeah well played this holiday I think 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.640
 interception da costa white that we're going 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.050
 give your chance blanquerie the little 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.150
 strikes and the goal toual blanco which marks 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.200
 here to finish in addition if it is well 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.580
 do it to his real head 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.830
 I'll tell you the talent does not have 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.730
 Age is the talent that's prerogative 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.310
 forty three years we can still 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.380
 do nice things to a football in 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.490
 blanco oulala blanco he has no 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.820
 change it makes it fall all 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.930
 world blanco long shoot olala 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.430
 blanco there is fault there against the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.720
 fault to a good man fault it helps 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.370
 for blanco it reminds me more 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.750
 my college years that when I 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.460
 put ex type by all that we go 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 remove white short actually remove 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.740
 blanco for this free kick because 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.310
 white that he is well coiffed you the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.090
 serve or damage not to big shots 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.290
 of free kicks in this team I the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 did not even know 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.170
 oulala ricky lambert ricky lambert who 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.550
 find his youth have a plan like 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.630
 a lot he crunches neighborhood so yes I 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.750
 believe too much neighborhood actually needs that 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.940
 I stop playing it here it is 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.090
 blanco and luis blanco 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.950
 on the other hand I said do not throw 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.820
 trust I must not 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.310
 take the trouble we can not that 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.250
 I learn to pay attention always 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.780
 he will go straight ahead that is worth the coy 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.980
 with on the catch up it's really 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.970

 players have listened to it's it's 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.350

 little bit flat ok yeah that's not the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.230

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.540
 against I do not break your mouth like 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.740

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.560
 rasch or lula is penalty 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.240
 but I do not know if you have 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.040
 seen the direccte injured blanco actually 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.630
 hideout where he hurt himself the guy 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.400
 him as soon as you touch the toe 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.110

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.520
 to 95 from penalty kick blanco to 93,2 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.440
 normatively does remove blanco when 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.600
 even we had removed blanco and we're going 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.710
 shoot a penalty at the key words that's at 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.710
