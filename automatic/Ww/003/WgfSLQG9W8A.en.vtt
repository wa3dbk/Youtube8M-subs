with<00:00:28.590> attempting<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.130> technique<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
with attempting this technique I

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.240 
with attempting this technique I
understand<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:31.980> different

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
understand that we all have different

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.010 
understand that we all have different
sized<00:00:32.610> hands<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.300> may<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.510> easier<00:00:33.600> for

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
sized hands so this may be easier for

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.810 
sized hands so this may be easier for
you<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.739> some<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.070> rather<00:00:35.250> than<00:00:35.370> others

you for some of you rather than others
and<00:00:35.969> there<00:00:36.960> might<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.140> some<00:00:37.410> other<00:00:37.469> methods

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and there might be some other methods

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.290 
and there might be some other methods
that<00:00:38.070> work<00:00:38.250> better<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:39.120> that's

that work better for you you know that's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.940 
that work better for you you know that's

small thumbs you know the megan fox
thumbs<00:00:46.879> when<00:00:47.879> i<00:00:47.910> initially<00:00:48.180> unwrapped<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
thumbs when i initially unwrapped the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.959 
thumbs when i initially unwrapped the
knife<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> packaging<00:00:50.160> i<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.550> concerned

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
knife from the packaging i was concerned

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
knife from the packaging i was concerned
that<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.270> spring<00:00:51.539> assist<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:52.020> broken

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that the spring assist was broken

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.630 
that the spring assist was broken
because<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.829> knife<00:00:52.980> wouldn't<00:00:53.309> lock<00:00:53.430> up

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
because the knife wouldn't lock up

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.939 
because the knife wouldn't lock up
completely<00:00:54.059> during<00:00:54.329> deployment<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
completely during deployment and it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.319 
completely during deployment and it
turns<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.520> was<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> lot<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.879> grease<00:00:57.149> in

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
turns out there was a lot of grease in

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.910 
turns out there was a lot of grease in
the<00:00:57.420> mechanism<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:58.530> locking<00:00:58.739> up

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the mechanism and that was locking up

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.889 
the mechanism and that was locking up
the<00:00:58.980> blade<00:00:59.280> i<00:00:59.489> went<00:01:00.359> ahead<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> cleaned<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the blade i went ahead and cleaned it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:01.939 
the blade i went ahead and cleaned it
off<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.289> degreaser<00:01:01.920> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
off with a little degreaser and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.560 
off with a little degreaser and
reapplied<00:01:02.520> some<00:01:02.789> less<00:01:02.969> viscous<00:01:03.210> gun

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
reapplied some less viscous gun

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.939 
reapplied some less viscous gun
lubricant<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.470> seems<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.769> working

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949

fine now anyway here's basic right

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.050 
fine now anyway here's basic right

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
fine and you can see how how narrow that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.940 
fine and you can see how how narrow that

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.190 
automatically return the blade to the
open<00:01:41.430> locked<00:01:41.579> position<00:01:42.060> while<00:01:43.020> referencing

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
open locked position while referencing

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.840 
open locked position while referencing
my<00:01:43.649> index<00:01:43.979> finger<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.310> still<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> back<00:01:44.820> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
my index finger is still on the back of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.690 
my index finger is still on the back of
the<00:01:45.030> blade<00:01:45.180> I'll<00:01:45.720> rotate<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.590> blade<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the blade I'll rotate the blade so that

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.850 
the blade I'll rotate the blade so that
my<00:01:47.970> fingers<00:01:48.360> are<00:01:48.630> no<00:01:48.810> longer<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.619> path<00:01:49.829> of

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
my fingers are no longer in the path of

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.520 
my fingers are no longer in the path of
the<00:01:50.579> blade<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.540> higher<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.290> grip

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the blade and also higher on the grip

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.120 
the blade and also higher on the grip
and<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.570> very<00:01:54.780> important<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> prevent

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and this is very important to prevent

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.649 
and this is very important to prevent
injury<00:01:56.490> such<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.729> cutting<00:01:57.060> yourself<00:01:57.240> while

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
injury such as cutting yourself while

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.319 
injury such as cutting yourself while
closing<00:01:58.040> so<00:01:59.040> at<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.280> point<00:01:59.490> I'll<00:01:59.729> utilize<00:02:00.149> my

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
closing so at this point I'll utilize my

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.260 
closing so at this point I'll utilize my
index<00:02:00.630> finger<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.350> continue<00:02:01.740> closing<00:02:02.189> until<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
index finger to continue closing until I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.209 
index finger to continue closing until I
meet<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> resistance<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.649> spring<00:02:04.920> assist

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
meet the resistance of the spring assist

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.940 
meet the resistance of the spring assist
mechanism<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.140> then<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.380> point<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.770> can

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
mechanism and then at this point I can

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.529 
mechanism and then at this point I can
go<00:02:08.069> ahead<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.310> use<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.700> thumb<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.090> complete

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
go ahead and use my thumb and complete

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
go ahead and use my thumb and complete
the<00:02:09.660> motion<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:10.679> fingers<00:02:11.250> are<00:02:11.370> still<00:02:11.580> out

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the motion as my fingers are still out

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.920 
the motion as my fingers are still out
of<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> way

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
of the way

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.610 
of the way
and<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.379> pretty<00:02:13.590> much<00:02:13.739> simple<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.620> you

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and it's pretty much simple as that you

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.309 
and it's pretty much simple as that you
can<00:02:16.799> go<00:02:16.920> ahead<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.750> know<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:19.049> try<00:02:19.260> it

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
can go ahead and you know you can try it

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.920 
can go ahead and you know you can try it
and<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.909> know<00:02:21.000> here<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.299> is<00:02:21.390> again<00:02:21.420> with<00:02:21.900> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and you know here it is again with a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.580 
and you know here it is again with a
little<00:02:22.730> there<00:02:24.079> you<00:02:25.079> know<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.319> little<00:02:25.469> bit

little there you know with a little bit

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.140 
little there you know with a little bit
of<00:02:25.650> practice<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:26.189> becomes<00:02:26.489> very<00:02:26.670> easy<00:02:26.790> and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
of practice this becomes very easy and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.059 
of practice this becomes very easy and
very<00:02:27.209> natural<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.530> becomes<00:02:28.680> second

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
very natural and it becomes second

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.970 
very natural and it becomes second
nature<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.379> know<00:02:31.469> you're<00:02:31.680> worried<00:02:31.920> about
