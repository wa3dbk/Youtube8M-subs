the auto industry analyst laurent fix on
how<00:00:17.480> this<00:00:17.689> plays<00:00:17.960> out<00:00:18.199> for<00:00:18.470> automakers<00:00:19.369> here

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
how this plays out for automakers here

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.609 
how this plays out for automakers here
in<00:00:19.759> the<00:00:19.849> US<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:20.269> this<00:00:20.419> I<00:00:20.570> guess<00:00:20.810> lauren<00:00:21.529> is

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
in the US so this I guess lauren is

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.839 
in the US so this I guess lauren is
bigger<00:00:21.859> than<00:00:22.189> Toyota<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:22.970> Honda<00:00:23.089> Nissan<00:00:23.480> huh

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
bigger than Toyota and Honda Nissan huh

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.559 
bigger than Toyota and Honda Nissan huh
right<00:00:25.849> well<00:00:25.999> this<00:00:26.089> whole<00:00:26.239> thing<00:00:26.419> is<00:00:26.539> a

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:26.569 
right well this whole thing is a

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.479 
right well this whole thing is a
terrible<00:00:26.989> situation<00:00:27.650> but<00:00:27.679> you<00:00:28.249> know<00:00:28.339> it's

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
terrible situation but you know it's

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.700 
terrible situation but you know it's
interesting<00:00:28.609> that<00:00:29.390> they<00:00:30.140> shut<00:00:30.380> down<00:00:30.409> their

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
interesting that they shut down their

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.350 
interesting that they shut down their
plants<00:00:31.039> and<00:00:31.099> obviously<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:31.730> is<00:00:31.789> because<00:00:32.239> of

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
plants and obviously this is because of

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.060 
plants and obviously this is because of
the<00:00:32.450> people<00:00:32.630> but<00:00:33.380> there<00:00:33.590> were<00:00:33.710> some<00:00:33.950> people

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
the people but there were some people

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.410 
the people but there were some people
that<00:00:34.220> were<00:00:34.340> injured<00:00:34.610> of<00:00:34.880> one<00:00:35.000> of<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.120> Honda

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
that were injured of one of the Honda

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.240 
that were injured of one of the Honda
plants<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:35.899> then<00:00:36.019> this<00:00:36.230> is<00:00:36.410> very<00:00:36.590> serious<00:00:36.859> and

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
plants and then this is very serious and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.250 
plants and then this is very serious and
it<00:00:37.519> will<00:00:37.820> make<00:00:38.030> a<00:00:38.059> small<00:00:38.449> impact<00:00:38.870> I<00:00:39.079> don't

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
it will make a small impact I don't

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.840 
it will make a small impact I don't
think<00:00:39.410> it's<00:00:39.500> gonna<00:00:39.620> be<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:40.100> don't<00:00:40.399> really<00:00:40.760> don't

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
think it's gonna be I don't really don't

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.250 
think it's gonna be I don't really don't
think<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.120> gonna<00:00:41.210> be<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.329> huge<00:00:41.600> impact<00:00:41.960> on<00:00:42.170> the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
think it's gonna be a huge impact on the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.049 
think it's gonna be a huge impact on the
US<00:00:42.469> auto<00:00:42.620> industry<00:00:42.739> all<00:00:43.579> right<00:00:43.760> now<00:00:43.879> what

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
US auto industry all right now what

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.630 
US auto industry all right now what
little<00:00:44.300> trading<00:00:44.600> there<00:00:44.899> was<00:00:45.199> I<00:00:45.800> think<00:00:46.309> this

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
little trading there was I think this

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.250 
little trading there was I think this
the<00:00:46.940> whole<00:00:47.090> thing<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.690> markets<00:00:48.109> had

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
the whole thing that the markets had

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.860 
the whole thing that the markets had
only<00:00:48.410> 15<00:00:48.829> minutes<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.370> trade<00:00:49.670> on<00:00:49.820> it<00:00:49.850> but<00:00:50.510> the

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
only 15 minutes to trade on it but the

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.380 
only 15 minutes to trade on it but the
Japanese<00:00:51.410> stocks<00:00:51.679> that<00:00:51.949> trade<00:00:52.010> abroad<00:00:52.579> were

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
Japanese stocks that trade abroad were

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.360 
Japanese stocks that trade abroad were
hit<00:00:53.690> on<00:00:53.870> this<00:00:54.079> including<00:00:54.589> Toyota<00:00:55.070> on<00:00:55.249> the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
hit on this including Toyota on the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.430 
hit on this including Toyota on the
belief<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:56.030> is<00:00:56.269> gonna<00:00:56.839> have<00:00:57.079> some

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
belief that this is gonna have some

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.380 
belief that this is gonna have some
long-term<00:00:57.859> oomph<00:00:58.399> to<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:58.820> what<00:00:58.969> do<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.089> think

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
long-term oomph to it what do you think

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.649 
long-term oomph to it what do you think
I<00:01:00.339> think<00:01:01.339> that<00:01:01.550> it's<00:01:01.789> probably<00:01:01.940> about<00:01:02.089> five<00:01:02.480> to

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
I think that it's probably about five to

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.240 
I think that it's probably about five to
ten<00:01:02.899> days<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.260> you're<00:01:03.409> gonna<00:01:03.499> see<00:01:03.769> that

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
ten days and you're gonna see that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.259 
ten days and you're gonna see that
they're<00:01:04.430> gonna<00:01:04.550> be<00:01:04.730> back<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:05.089> producing

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
they're gonna be back to producing

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.450 
they're gonna be back to producing
because<00:01:05.720> in<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.110> northern<00:01:06.470> area<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:06.950> Japan

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
because in the northern area of Japan

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.860 
because in the northern area of Japan
where<00:01:07.730> they<00:01:07.850> do<00:01:07.910> produce<00:01:08.390> they<00:01:08.600> don't<00:01:08.750> produce

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
where they do produce they don't produce

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.390 
where they do produce they don't produce
that<00:01:09.050> many<00:01:09.260> cars<00:01:09.560> there<00:01:09.710> may<00:01:09.860> be<00:01:09.890> some<00:01:10.190> sub

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
that many cars there may be some sub

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.610 
that many cars there may be some sub
components<00:01:11.030> there<00:01:11.480> might<00:01:11.690> even<00:01:11.870> for<00:01:12.110> effect

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
components there might even for effect

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.260 
components there might even for effect
production<00:01:13.100> here<00:01:13.310> in<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.460> US<00:01:13.790> because<00:01:14.180> there

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
production here in the US because there

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.510 
production here in the US because there

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
are plants here in the US if they don't

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.190 
are plants here in the US if they don't
have<00:01:16.640> driveline<00:01:17.060> components<00:01:17.090> then<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.990> course

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
have driveline components then of course

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.990 
have driveline components then of course
then<00:01:18.380> certain<00:01:18.650> cars<00:01:18.890> won't<00:01:19.160> be<00:01:19.280> manufactured

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
then certain cars won't be manufactured

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.600 
then certain cars won't be manufactured
but<00:01:20.450> there<00:01:20.570> is<00:01:20.690> stuff<00:01:20.900> in<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.140> pipeline<00:01:21.610> but

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
but there is stuff in the pipeline but

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.340 
but there is stuff in the pipeline but
consumers<00:01:23.270> as<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.420> whole<00:01:23.660> if<00:01:23.870> they<00:01:23.990> go<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
consumers as a whole if they go to the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.690 
consumers as a whole if they go to the
lot<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.530> they<00:01:24.830> can't<00:01:25.070> find<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.370> car<00:01:25.550> they

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
lot and they can't find the car they

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.830 
lot and they can't find the car they
want<00:01:25.940> they're<00:01:26.270> gonna<00:01:26.360> look<00:01:26.510> at<00:01:26.660> something

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
want they're gonna look at something

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.480 
want they're gonna look at something
comparable<00:01:27.290> which<00:01:27.560> could<00:01:27.770> be<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.920> Kia<00:01:28.250> or<00:01:28.460> a

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
comparable which could be a Kia or a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.780 
comparable which could be a Kia or a
Hyundai<00:01:28.910> or<00:01:29.440> hopefully<00:01:30.440> it'd<00:01:30.950> be<00:01:31.160> a<00:01:31.190> u.s.<00:01:31.520> car

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
Hyundai or hopefully it'd be a u.s. car

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
Japanese car you want there's a delight

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.860 
Japanese car you want there's a delight
getting<00:01:37.760> it<00:01:37.880> because<00:01:38.000> of<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:38.570> you're<00:01:38.840> just

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
getting it because of this you're just

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.980 
getting it because of this you're just
gonna<00:01:39.200> look<00:01:39.380> elsewhere<00:01:40.690> well<00:01:41.690> if<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:41.810> need<00:01:41.960> a

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
gonna look elsewhere well if you need a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.930 
gonna look elsewhere well if you need a
car<00:01:42.230> and<00:01:42.410> your<00:01:42.500> leases<00:01:42.860> do<00:01:43.010> you<00:01:43.220> might<00:01:43.460> I<00:01:43.700> mean

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
car and your leases do you might I mean

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.640 
car and your leases do you might I mean
if<00:01:44.270> you're<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:44.540> loyalist<00:01:45.020> but<00:01:45.260> there's<00:01:45.410> so<00:01:45.560> many

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
if you're a loyalist but there's so many

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.170 
if you're a loyalist but there's so many
people<00:01:45.980> that<00:01:46.040> are<00:01:46.130> loyal<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.490> certain<00:01:46.640> brands

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
people that are loyal to certain brands

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.000 
people that are loyal to certain brands
they'll<00:01:47.660> wait<00:01:47.930> if<00:01:48.170> they're<00:01:48.380> they'll<00:01:48.680> find<00:01:48.890> a

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
they'll wait if they're they'll find a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.200 
they'll wait if they're they'll find a
certified<00:01:49.400> pre-owned<00:01:49.760> they'll<00:01:49.970> find

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
certified pre-owned they'll find

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.570 
certified pre-owned they'll find
something<00:01:50.510> so<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.170> mean<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.710> may<00:01:51.980> affect<00:01:52.400> them

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
something so I mean it may affect them

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.460 
something so I mean it may affect them
that<00:01:52.880> subcomponents<00:01:53.720> in<00:01:53.780> some<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.140> parts

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
that subcomponents in some of the parts

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.070 
that subcomponents in some of the parts
but<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.890> really<00:01:55.310> don't<00:01:55.400> think<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:56.120> is<00:01:56.330> to

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
but I really don't think that this is to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.390 
but I really don't think that this is to
speculate<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.680> it's<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:58.010> a<00:01:58.040> huge

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
speculate that it's going to be a huge

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.420 
speculate that it's going to be a huge
impact<00:01:58.910> on<00:01:59.380> the<00:02:00.380> industry<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:00.980> the<00:02:01.040> Japanese

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
impact on the industry and the Japanese

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.220 
impact on the industry and the Japanese
cars<00:02:01.700> sold<00:02:02.000> here<00:02:02.210> in<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.360> US<00:02:02.600> or<00:02:02.720> worldwide

cars sold here in the US or worldwide

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.450

for<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.560> matter<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:03.860> will<00:02:03.980> make<00:02:04.220> an<00:02:04.370> impact

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
for that matter it will make an impact

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.670 
for that matter it will make an impact
on<00:02:04.790> components<00:02:05.450> maybe<00:02:06.020> parts<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.620> you're
