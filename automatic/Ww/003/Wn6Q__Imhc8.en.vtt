favorite of the greed generally but his
details<00:02:45.450> are<00:02:45.660> just<00:02:45.780> fantastic<00:02:46.250> it's<00:02:47.250> too<00:02:47.370> bad

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
details are just fantastic it's too bad

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.160 
details are just fantastic it's too bad
some<00:02:47.850> people<00:02:47.880> think<00:02:48.299> that<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:48.690> bad

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
some people think that this is just bad

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.910 
some people think that this is just bad
form<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.700> anyway<00:02:51.260> articulation<00:02:52.260> wise<00:02:52.380> he

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
form so anyway articulation wise he

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.670 
form so anyway articulation wise he
still<00:02:53.100> got<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.250> nice<00:02:53.459> 360<00:02:54.030> ball<00:02:54.180> joint<00:02:54.450> here<00:02:54.680> on

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
still got a nice 360 ball joint here on

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.380 
still got a nice 360 ball joint here on
his<00:02:55.799> arm<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.400> slightly<00:02:56.670> hindered<00:02:57.060> by<00:02:57.209> his

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
his arm it is slightly hindered by his

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.880 
his arm it is slightly hindered by his
shoulder<00:02:57.690> pads<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:58.230> they<00:02:58.349> do<00:02:58.410> move<00:02:58.739> up

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
shoulder pads here but they do move up

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.550 
shoulder pads here but they do move up
and<00:02:59.040> down<00:02:59.190> but<00:02:59.910> if<00:03:00.000> there's<00:03:00.209> no<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:01.260> mean

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
and down but if there's no like I mean

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.809 
and down but if there's no like I mean
like<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:01.830> just<00:03:01.980> not<00:03:02.280> as<00:03:02.400> great<00:03:02.580> as<00:03:02.700> other

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
like it's just not as great as other

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.100 
like it's just not as great as other
ones<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.630> amount<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.900> bulk

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
ones just because of the amount of bulk

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.199 
ones just because of the amount of bulk
he<00:03:04.769> does<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.190> double<00:03:05.310> elbow<00:03:05.670> joint<00:03:05.940> but<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
he does have a double elbow joint but it

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.940 
he does have a double elbow joint but it
is<00:03:06.330> hindered<00:03:06.660> by<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.810> design<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.319> him<00:03:07.739> in

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
is hindered by the design of him in

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.550 
is hindered by the design of him in
general<00:03:08.700> oh<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.989> then<00:03:10.080> he's<00:03:10.200> got<00:03:10.349> the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
general oh and then he's got the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.470 
general oh and then he's got the
swiveling<00:03:10.980> action<00:03:11.099> here<00:03:11.459> on<00:03:11.580> his<00:03:11.760> waist<00:03:12.180> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
swiveling action here on his waist and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.170 
swiveling action here on his waist and
then<00:03:12.959> probably<00:03:13.230> join<00:03:13.980> up<00:03:14.130> here<00:03:14.370> but<00:03:14.640> because

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
then probably join up here but because

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.670 
then probably join up here but because
this<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.540> all<00:03:15.660> one<00:03:15.780> solid<00:03:16.109> piece<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.470> can't

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
this is all one solid piece you can't

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.710 
this is all one solid piece you can't
get<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.890> movement<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.489> because<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.180> this

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
get the movement and because of this

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.870 
get the movement and because of this
piece<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.859> then<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.340> piece<00:03:20.609> you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
piece here and then like this piece you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.630 
piece here and then like this piece you
don't<00:03:21.120> get<00:03:21.209> as<00:03:21.329> much<00:03:21.450> movement<00:03:21.630> here<00:03:22.489> 360<00:03:23.489> ball

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
don't get as much movement here 360 ball

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.190 
don't get as much movement here 360 ball
joint<00:03:23.850> here<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.090> his<00:03:24.209> leg<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.810> swiveling

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
joint here on his leg and the swiveling

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.259 
joint here on his leg and the swiveling
like<00:03:25.380> usual<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.400> double<00:03:26.640> knee<00:03:26.790> joint<00:03:27.060> but

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
like usual and a double knee joint but

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.390 
like usual and a double knee joint but
it's<00:03:27.390> all<00:03:27.510> hindered<00:03:27.900> by<00:03:28.079> these<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.680> mean<00:03:29.100> like<00:03:29.280> I

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
it's all hindered by these I mean like I

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.190 
it's all hindered by these I mean like I
said<00:03:29.430> like<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:29.880> these<00:03:30.060> they<00:03:30.359> can<00:03:30.720> move<00:03:30.989> out

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
said like with these they can move out

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.340 
said like with these they can move out
but<00:03:31.829> they<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.069> don't<00:03:32.720> allow<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:34.109> quite<00:03:34.260> as

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
but they just don't allow for quite as

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.259 
but they just don't allow for quite as
much<00:03:34.500> movement<00:03:34.650> as<00:03:34.829> other<00:03:35.010> figures<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.670> then

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
much movement as other figures and then

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.370 
much movement as other figures and then
of<00:03:36.359> course<00:03:36.420> you've<00:03:36.660> got<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.810> nice<00:03:36.959> ball<00:03:37.200> joint

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
of course you've got a nice ball joint

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.800 
of course you've got a nice ball joint
on<00:03:37.410> his<00:03:37.620> leg<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.549> toe<00:03:38.760> action<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.450> oh<00:03:39.690> and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
on his leg and the toe action so oh and

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.750 
on his leg and the toe action so oh and
then<00:03:40.049> his<00:03:40.170> foot<00:03:40.560> snaps<00:03:40.829> off<00:03:41.010> that's<00:03:41.190> great<00:03:41.430> um

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
then his foot snaps off that's great um

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.180 
then his foot snaps off that's great um
like<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.810> stills<00:03:43.109> articulated<00:03:43.739> other<00:03:43.920> Figge

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
like it stills articulated other Figge

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.610 
like it stills articulated other Figge
Art<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.519> just<00:03:44.700> because<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.090> his<00:03:45.239> design<00:03:45.660> he's<00:03:46.590> a

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
Art is just because of his design he's a

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.559 
Art is just because of his design he's a
lot<00:03:46.859> more<00:03:46.889> hindered<00:03:47.430> which<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.970> can't<00:03:48.420> really

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
lot more hindered which I can't really

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.849 
lot more hindered which I can't really
fault<00:03:48.810> them<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.109> not<00:03:49.200> as<00:03:49.319> if<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.530> wanted<00:03:49.769> to

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
fault them it's not as if I wanted to

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.920 
fault them it's not as if I wanted to
get<00:03:50.010> him<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.220> some<00:03:50.400> crazy<00:03:50.760> kung<00:03:51.150> fu<00:03:51.299> poses<00:03:51.810> or

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
get him in some crazy kung fu poses or

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.349 
get him in some crazy kung fu poses or
anything<00:03:52.109> like<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.410> anyway<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.040> it's<00:03:54.030> fine<00:03:54.329> I

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
anything like that anyway so it's fine I

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.729 
anything like that anyway so it's fine I
mean<00:03:54.510> it's<00:03:54.780> not<00:03:54.870> really<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.139> knock<00:03:55.319> against<00:03:55.620> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
mean it's not really a knock against the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.680 
mean it's not really a knock against the
figure<00:03:56.069> on<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.910> being<00:03:57.090> said<00:03:57.299> with<00:03:57.450> his

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
figure on that being said with his

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.680 
figure on that being said with his
joints<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.730> then<00:03:59.819> none<00:04:00.209> of<00:04:00.239> them<00:04:00.389> are<00:04:00.510> really

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
joints and then none of them are really

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.120 
joints and then none of them are really
loose<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.139> mean<00:04:01.290> they're<00:04:01.410> not<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:01.739> super

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
loose I mean they're not like super

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.340 
loose I mean they're not like super
tight<00:04:02.310> figure<00:04:02.639> joints<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:03.750> none<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:03.989> them<00:04:04.170> are

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
tight figure joints but none of them are

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.800 
tight figure joints but none of them are
loose<00:04:04.560> problems<00:04:05.519> like<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.700> had<00:04:06.000> with<00:04:06.180> gazzarri

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
loose problems like I had with gazzarri

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.530 
loose problems like I had with gazzarri
and<00:04:08.329> Eva<00:04:09.329> so<00:04:09.750> that's<00:04:09.930> got<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.380> plus<00:04:11.329> overall<00:04:12.329> I

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
and Eva so that's got the plus overall I

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.680 
and Eva so that's got the plus overall I
really<00:04:12.989> like<00:04:13.230> this<00:04:13.500> figure<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:14.540> really<00:04:15.540> love

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
really like this figure I really love

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.020 
really like this figure I really love
the<00:04:15.840> Greek<00:04:15.989> designs<00:04:16.320> in<00:04:16.500> general<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.100> gambles

was always one of my favorites and they

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.050 
was always one of my favorites and they
just<00:04:19.590> did<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.769> really<00:04:19.950> great<00:04:20.159> job<00:04:20.250> on<00:04:20.640> this<00:04:20.849> like

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
just did a really great job on this like

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
just did a really great job on this like
his<00:04:21.690> articulation<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.349> kind<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.650> hindered

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
his articulation is kind of hindered

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.149 
his articulation is kind of hindered
I<00:04:23.110> hear<00:04:23.409> you<00:04:23.560> actually<00:04:23.770> can't<00:04:23.919> use<00:04:24.039> that

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
I hear you actually can't use that

I hear you actually can't use that
Thomas<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.520> stage<00:04:24.669> properly<00:04:25.150> but<00:04:25.330> he's<00:04:25.780> a

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
Thomas you stage properly but he's a

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.869 
Thomas you stage properly but he's a
really<00:04:26.229> fantastic<00:04:26.560> looking<00:04:27.370> figure<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:27.699> mean

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:27.879 
really fantastic looking figure I mean

really fantastic looking figure I mean
the<00:04:28.000> sculpt<00:04:28.509> and<00:04:28.689> the<00:04:29.199> details<00:04:29.620> on<00:04:29.830> him<00:04:29.979> are

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099

just great so he's just a really nice
looking<00:04:33.280> figures<00:04:33.669> it's<00:04:34.270> almost<00:04:34.449> as<00:04:34.659> if<00:04:34.689> he

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
looking figures it's almost as if he

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.270 
looking figures it's almost as if he
should<00:04:35.139> have<00:04:35.259> been<00:04:35.379> a<00:04:35.439> figure<00:04:35.770> at<00:04:35.860> zero<00:04:36.129> but

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
should have been a figure at zero but

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.619 
should have been a figure at zero but
I'm<00:04:36.370> glad<00:04:36.490> he's<00:04:36.699> articulated<00:04:37.270> so<00:04:37.389> you<00:04:37.449> can<00:04:37.569> at

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
I'm glad he's articulated so you can at

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.260 
I'm glad he's articulated so you can at
least<00:04:37.689> get<00:04:37.930> some<00:04:37.960> poses<00:04:38.469> out<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.770> them<00:04:38.889> so<00:04:39.729> if

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
least get some poses out of them so if

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.450 
least get some poses out of them so if
you're<00:04:40.479> a<00:04:40.509> fan<00:04:40.750> of<00:04:40.780> Oz<00:04:41.050> or<00:04:41.469> a<00:04:41.500> camel<00:04:41.949> in<00:04:42.039> general

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460

I<00:04:42.639> can<00:04:43.180> recommend<00:04:43.449> this<00:04:43.689> figure<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.139> you<00:04:44.229> can

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
I can recommend this figure if you can

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.839 
I can recommend this figure if you can
find<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.650> at<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.830> decent<00:04:45.009> price<00:04:45.310> it's<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.610> very

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
find it at a decent price it's a very

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.209 
find it at a decent price it's a very
very<00:04:46.210> nice<00:04:47.199> looking<00:04:47.259> figure<00:04:47.800> they<00:04:48.039> did<00:04:48.189> a

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
very nice looking figure they did a

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.689 
very nice looking figure they did a
pretty<00:04:48.639> damn<00:04:48.909> good<00:04:48.939> job<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:49.479> this<00:04:49.599> one<00:04:49.780> I<00:04:49.810> think
