hi guys today I'm going to show you my
super<00:00:03.750> hopper<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:05.060> the<00:00:06.060> function<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.870> should

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
super hopper is the function that should

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.810 
super hopper is the function that should
be<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.940> survival<00:00:08.940> minecraft<00:00:10.400> here<00:00:11.400> I'm<00:00:11.550> gonna

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
be in survival minecraft here I'm gonna

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.509 
be in survival minecraft here I'm gonna
use<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> sorter<00:00:13.170> let's<00:00:13.920> see<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.340> in

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
use it in the sorter let's see it in

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.160 
use it in the sorter let's see it in
action<00:00:17.300> I'm<00:00:18.300> gonna<00:00:18.750> put<00:00:19.080> cobble<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.830> dirt<00:00:21.170> all

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
action I'm gonna put cobble and dirt all

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.070 
action I'm gonna put cobble and dirt all
messed<00:00:22.680> around<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:24.300> think<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
messed around I really think this is a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.700 
messed around I really think this is a
great<00:00:25.470> idea<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:26.970> anyone<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.810> guys<00:00:28.230> use

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
great idea so if anyone of you guys use

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.370 
great idea so if anyone of you guys use
this<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.250> an<00:00:29.400> invention<00:00:29.849> please<00:00:30.630> tell<00:00:30.960> me<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.349> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
this in an invention please tell me so I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.370 
this in an invention please tell me so I
can<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> link<00:00:32.130> now<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.420> machine<00:00:34.140> will

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
can have a link now the machine will

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.160 
can have a link now the machine will
sort<00:00:34.890> these<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:36.059> flow<00:00:36.390> down<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
sort these out they flow down to the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.889 
sort these out they flow down to the
super<00:00:37.620> hop<00:00:38.960> watch<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.290> hopper<00:00:41.450> each<00:00:42.450> time

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
super hop watch the hopper each time

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
super hop watch the hopper each time
that<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> Machine<00:00:43.829> sorts<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> block<00:00:44.879> it

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
that the Machine sorts the block it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.799 
that the Machine sorts the block it
rotates<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.500> hopper<00:00:49.070> light<00:00:50.070> also<00:00:50.460> flash<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
rotates a hopper light also flash to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:00.030 
rotates a hopper light also flash to
show<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.110> what<00:00:52.469> type<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.800> block<00:00:53.280> gifts

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.420 

sorted<00:01:01.040> out<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:06.229> let's<00:01:06.560> have<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.770> look<00:01:07.070> at<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
sorted out so let's have a look at the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.899 
sorted out so let's have a look at the
steps<00:01:07.810> blocks<00:01:08.810> go<00:01:09.140> down<00:01:11.979> these<00:01:12.979> two<00:01:13.310> droppers

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
steps blocks go down these two droppers

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:22.980 
steps blocks go down these two droppers
act<00:01:14.600> as<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:14.990> vowel<00:01:16.390> this<00:01:17.390> controls<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.050> flow

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.480 

this<00:01:23.990> comparator<00:01:24.800> behind<00:01:25.600> uses<00:01:26.600> some<00:01:27.020> tricks

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
this comparator behind uses some tricks

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.450 
this comparator behind uses some tricks
to<00:01:28.490> understand<00:01:29.060> type<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.810> block<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:31.160> then

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
to understand type of block and then

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.359 
to understand type of block and then
control<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.000> super<00:01:32.600> hopper<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:33.680> turn<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.220> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
control the super hopper to turn to the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.270 
control the super hopper to turn to the
right<00:01:34.580> direction<00:01:34.910> so<00:01:35.570> let's<00:01:36.500> build<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:37.009> simple

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
right direction so let's build a simple

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.840 
right direction so let's build a simple
version<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:38.630> switch<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.380> switch<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.130> it

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
version you switch the switch and it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.600 
version you switch the switch and it
changes<00:01:41.420> direction<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:42.860> is<00:01:43.070> something<00:01:43.580> that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
changes direction this is something that

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.040 
changes direction this is something that
everybody<00:01:44.330> needs<00:01:45.460> free<00:01:46.460> blocks<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.240> to

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
everybody needs free blocks and to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.310 
everybody needs free blocks and to
