especially when it's in waterproof I'm

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
especially when it's in waterproof I'm
the<00:00:44.430> normal<00:00:44.549> one<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.119> easy<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.570> take<00:00:45.750> off<00:00:45.900> but

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.649 
the normal one it's easy to take off but
the<00:00:46.170> waterproof<00:00:46.619> ones<00:00:46.830> are<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.909> hard<00:00:48.360> it's

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
the waterproof ones are so hard it's

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.079

just like it just stays on and like and

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.719 
just like it just stays on and like and
it's<00:00:51.869> not<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> good<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.409> of<00:00:52.920> water<00:00:53.460> proof

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
it's not the good kind of water proof

don't have a lot of smudges well that's
what<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.500> find<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.490> use<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> base

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
what I find so you use this as a base

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.940 
what I find so you use this as a base
and<00:01:51.900> then<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.680> go<00:01:52.950> over<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.650> and<00:01:55.650> not

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and then you go over with this and not

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.280 
and then you go over with this and not
only<00:01:56.159> helps<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.820> clumping<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.080> also

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
only helps with the clumping but it also

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
only helps with the clumping but it also
helps<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.830> saying<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.760> whole<00:01:59.970> entire

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
helps with saying on the whole entire

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.050 
helps with saying on the whole entire
day<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.400> i'm<00:02:02.490> using<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.940> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
day and this one that i'm using is the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.370 
day and this one that i'm using is the
one<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.270> i<00:02:03.360> was<00:02:03.479> talking<00:02:03.600> about<00:02:03.870> that<00:02:04.110> i<00:02:04.170> got

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
one that i was talking about that i got

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.590 
one that i was talking about that i got
in<00:02:04.560> my<00:02:04.650> hull<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.580> magnum<00:02:06.180> volume

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
in my hull it's the magnum volume

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.979 
in my hull it's the magnum volume
Express<00:02:06.930> waterproof<00:02:07.619> mascara<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.750> as<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
Express waterproof mascara and as you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.949 
Express waterproof mascara and as you
can<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.979> does<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.760> lengthen<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
can see it does really lengthen the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.750 
can see it does really lengthen the
lashes<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:14.150> also<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.239> bottom<00:02:15.540> lashes<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:17.459> I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
lashes and also the bottom lashes and I

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.759 
lashes and also the bottom lashes and I
find<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.390> really<00:02:18.690> works<00:02:19.019> well<00:02:19.140> as<00:02:19.469> well

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
find that it really works well as well

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.010 
find that it really works well as well
because

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.860 

even<00:02:26.020> after<00:02:26.230> several<00:02:26.920> layers<00:02:30.420> sorry<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.660> was

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
even after several layers sorry that was

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.620 
even after several layers sorry that was
kind<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.080> scary<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.470> dozen<00:02:33.370> clump<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.970> it's

kind of scary a dozen clump and it's
just<00:02:34.840> lengthens<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.500> lengthens<00:02:36.010> without

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
just lengthens and lengthens without

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.190 
just lengthens and lengthens without
clumping<00:02:36.760> yeah<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.270> i<00:02:37.360> love<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.750> brush<00:02:37.930> it's

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
clumping yeah and i love the brush it's

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.510 
clumping yeah and i love the brush it's
really<00:02:38.380> cute<00:02:38.740> it's<00:02:39.010> got<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.280> kind<00:02:39.490> of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
really cute it's got this kind of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.750 
really cute it's got this kind of
curviness<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:41.560> think<00:02:42.370> these<00:02:42.490> work

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
curviness to it I think these work

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.400 
curviness to it I think these work
really<00:02:42.790> well<00:02:43.120> together<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.930> best<00:02:44.170> part

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
really well together and the best part

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.670 
really well together and the best part
of<00:02:44.560> all<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:45.010> because<00:02:46.200> when<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.320> use<00:02:47.530> this

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
of all is that because when you use this

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.920 
of all is that because when you use this
as<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> base<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.460> actually<00:02:49.030> becomes<00:02:49.330> easier<00:02:49.810> to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
as a base it actually becomes easier to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.020 
as a base it actually becomes easier to
remove<00:02:50.200> later<00:02:50.920> on<00:02:51.190> in<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.580> day<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.910> it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
remove later on in the day and it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.120 
remove later on in the day and it
doesn't<00:02:52.330> smudge<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.900> basically<00:02:53.320> through

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
doesn't smudge so basically through

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.540 
doesn't smudge so basically through
biggest<00:02:54.580> things<00:02:55.320> big<00:02:56.320> big<00:02:56.680> good<00:02:56.950> points<00:02:57.400> are

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
biggest things big big good points are

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.190 
biggest things big big good points are
is<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:57.910> I'm<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.960> not<00:02:59.590> only<00:03:00.870> helps<00:03:01.870> with

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
is that I'm it it not only helps with

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.770 
is that I'm it it not only helps with
the<00:03:02.230> smudging<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.940> also<00:03:04.090> helps<00:03:04.690> with

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
the smudging and it also helps with

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.860 
the smudging and it also helps with
taking<00:03:05.260> off<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.560> mascara<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.480> as<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.660> base

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
taking off the mascara so this as a base

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.510 
taking off the mascara so this as a base
