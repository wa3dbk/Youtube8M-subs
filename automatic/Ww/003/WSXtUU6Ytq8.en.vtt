but<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.119> all<00:02:00.240> honestly<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.689> think<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:01.079> need<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
but in all honestly I think they need to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.889 
but in all honestly I think they need to
start<00:02:01.649> looking<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:03.299> actual<00:02:03.450> connection

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
start looking at the actual connection

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
start looking at the actual connection
issues<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> actual<00:02:04.920> game<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:06.000> actual

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
issues the actual game the actual

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.999 
issues the actual game the actual
balancing<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> game<00:02:07.170> before<00:02:07.469> they<00:02:07.770> start

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
balancing of the game before they start

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.770 
balancing of the game before they start
adding<00:02:08.129> more<00:02:08.399> prestigious

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780

now from my opinion IC think world at

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.610 
now from my opinion IC think world at
war<00:04:22.030> is<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.240> best<00:04:22.419> quality<00:04:22.870> that's<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.440> one<00:04:23.590> I

war is the best quality that's the one I
most<00:04:23.889> enjoyed<00:04:24.780> but<00:04:25.780> also<00:04:26.020> i'd<00:04:26.380> say<00:04:26.620> call<00:04:26.889> of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010

most enjoyed but also i'd say call of
duty<00:04:27.190> 4<00:04:27.270> than<00:04:28.270> just<00:04:28.450> how<00:04:28.570> balanced<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.230> was<00:04:29.380> it

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500
