 and I'm going to introduce you to Galician veronica 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.480
 a great Andalusian competitor who 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.820
 technical reasons right now is in 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.189

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.960
 very well animated with your pass to the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.399
 late no longer class not very much the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.950
 truth is I did not know what was going to happen 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.870
 because here this is a surprise but 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.610
 when they told me I'm going to the final 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.620
 Well, I'm getting on the walls 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.330
 do not go up yet it ends 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.370
 compete and then we climb those where 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.660
 we need it and we celebrate it but of 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.510
 moment you have to enjoy the final 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.910
 try of course a top 3 and if you 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.170
 you wear the top one of the championship 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.540
 Well, I'm not going to say anything to you 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.490
 we will do then it would be wonderful 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.710
 I go up to give everything as 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.340
 I always do what has to happen 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.540
 You will go through some other non but never 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.700
 it rains to taste of all this is a 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.619
 very subjective sport we face 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.509
 a panel of judges and verdicts to the 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.280
 judges do not always like the public and 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.689
 even the competitors but we 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.020
 we are sure that you will be on top 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.820

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.539
 people related to our 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.679
 Mundillo you how I found out that 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.959
 has been doing the American adventure 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.280
 explain not a little bit how the 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.590
 adventure 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.210
 I got the professional card this 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.540
 It's my third competition as 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.580
 professional 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.580
 the truth that has been an experience 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.230
 unforgettable unbelievable the previous two 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.730
 that I have been able to travel and continue 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.369
 knowing a little bit of the world out there 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.020
 I have competed in dallas championships 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.290
 dallas and I have also competed in 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.180
 finland and now third you will make the 4th 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.550
 I still do not know where you 're going but I'm sure 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.980
 will be and within a little bit safe and with 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.920
 you're looking forward to a lot 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.110
 long season without competition and the truth 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.750
 that then I have taken with a desire 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.970
 tremendous so I'll be back and by far 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.709
 more encourage much more energy and to follow 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.900
 being there because I like it I love it 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.250
 is the best thing sure that yes I know that 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.950
 every time you climb climbs with a 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.320
 puntito better looking looking for you what 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.470
 asked by the judges working on behalf of 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.880
 of that and I'm sure that in Spain it's 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.050
 complicated to see you because the subject of 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.030
 for the girls 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.370
 at a professional level in Spain is a bit 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.340
 complicated the least amateur class a 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.440
 little but I do not see you competing in the 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.020
 arnold class here I do not know what I'm going to 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.880
 us because what is clear is that the 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.860
 physical that you think you have in 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.360
 Spain does not fit because you are already a 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.630
 step above all 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.190
 you want or you would not be more interested 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.410
 the American adventure but living there 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.870
 they have not offered you in the possibility of 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.880
 live there yes the truth yes what 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.800
 It happens that for work reasons we do not 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.900
 we can go there in the future 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.910
 maybe who knows what happens now 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.220
 It can not be done but I would like to 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.050
 much to our idea is to go there 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.900
 or if it's not for living it would be a 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.390
 long season to be able to do 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.130
 a man because it's a bit complicated 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.170
 be here at the same time there is more 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.340
 difficult this is what has happened to 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.270
 our friend raúl carrasco who has 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.910
 had to be coming and going 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.620
 for a long time and he is already 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.510
 Posing the possibility of installing 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.360
 as you well say during a season 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.700
 six seven eight months there do a 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.070
 name make yourself known and make come 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.550
 here and be as well known maybe as one 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.970
 of outsiders from the USA area 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.470
 surely this is how it is a lot of advantage 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.260
 in mind that there is one you have to travel 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.000
 ok are you there any call 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.330
 any photo session or any 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.010
 you have everything 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.819
 then you can prepare more at ease 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.799
 do not you 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.219
 it does not require an effort or economic 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.370
 nor physical having to be traveling 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.780
 then it is a huge advantage 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.060
 Hopefully we can go there though 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.440
 be a season and be able to prepare 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.139
 well butt to come with a man 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.930
 well big and miriam sanchez and demonstrate 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.610
 what is worth Spain, thank you very much

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.780
 channel and I hope you like the 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.160
 interview that we have done many 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.009
