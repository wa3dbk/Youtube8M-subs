00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the version Chinese we just because

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.270 
the version Chinese we just because
indian<00:01:07.020> remy<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.290> already<00:01:07.680> processed<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
indian remy is already processed and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.289 
indian remy is already processed and
then<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.520> they're<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.909> process<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
then what they're going to process it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.440 
then what they're going to process it
again<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.020> curl<00:01:10.260> pattern<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.450> over

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
again to get this curl pattern so over

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.060 
again to get this curl pattern so over
processing<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> hair<00:01:13.409> could<00:01:13.590> cause<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
processing the hair could cause it to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.649 
processing the hair could cause it to
tangle<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.700> shed<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.090> things<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.360> so

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
tangle and shed and things like that so

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.480 
tangle and shed and things like that so
that's<00:01:16.080> why<00:01:16.200> i<00:01:16.229> recommend<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.340> do
