00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
let's try it with a passcode on passcode

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.889 
let's try it with a passcode on passcode
lock<00:01:38.430> passcode<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:41.119> 20000<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:44.329> now<00:01:45.329> let's<00:01:45.570> try

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
lock passcode on 20000 and now let's try

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.230 
lock passcode on 20000 and now let's try
it<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.920> we're<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.250> try<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.490> send<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it so we're going to try to send a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
it so we're going to try to send a
message<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.740> will<00:01:49.979> make<00:01:50.130> me

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
message and as you see will make me

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760 
message and as you see will make me
enter<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.640> passcode<00:01:50.850> immediately<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:52.649> of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
enter my passcode immediately some of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
enter my passcode immediately some of
them<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.340> such<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.450> taking<00:01:55.320> a
