to<00:03:45.440> install<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:47.260> we'll<00:03:48.260> take<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.470> quick

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
to install it we'll take a quick

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.280 
to install it we'll take a quick
walkthrough<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.640> entire<00:03:50.090> interface<00:03:50.780> just

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
walkthrough of the entire interface just

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.290 
walkthrough of the entire interface just
to<00:03:51.530> kind<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:51.980> point<00:03:52.280> things<00:03:52.550> out<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.000> that

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
to kind of point things out to you that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.090 
to kind of point things out to you that
you<00:03:53.510> know<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> little<00:03:54.140> bitty<00:03:54.290> pretty<00:03:54.530> icons

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
you know a little bitty pretty icons

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.310 
you know a little bitty pretty icons
that<00:03:55.370> may<00:03:55.790> seem<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.209> be<00:03:56.270> obvious<00:03:56.780> but<00:03:56.959> we<00:03:57.170> just

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
that may seem to be obvious but we just

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.810 
that may seem to be obvious but we just
want<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.500> make<00:03:57.620> sure<00:03:57.680> again<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.490> we're<00:03:58.700> all

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
want to make sure again that we're all

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.430 
want to make sure again that we're all
on<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.030> same<00:03:59.180> page<00:03:59.480> from<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.020> very<00:04:00.200> GetGo

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
on the same page from the very GetGo

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.080 
on the same page from the very GetGo
then<00:04:01.100> we're<00:04:01.220> going<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.370> take<00:04:01.520> a<00:04:01.580> look<00:04:01.790> at<00:04:01.940> the

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
then we're going to take a look at the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.050 
then we're going to take a look at the
setup<00:04:02.630> process<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:03.560> making<00:04:04.250> sure<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.790> all

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
setup process of making sure that all

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.510 
setup process of making sure that all
the<00:04:06.020> T's<00:04:06.590> are<00:04:06.830> crossed<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.370> I's<00:04:07.490> are

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
the T's are crossed and the I's are

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.360 
the T's are crossed and the I's are
dotted<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.360> same<00:04:08.660> way<00:04:08.990> so<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.920> as<00:04:10.100> you're

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
dotted on the same way so that as you're

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.949 
dotted on the same way so that as you're
progressing<00:04:10.610> through<00:04:11.209> this<00:04:11.390> video<00:04:11.630> tutorial

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
progressing through this video tutorial

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.980 
progressing through this video tutorial
you'll<00:04:12.920> know<00:04:13.130> that<00:04:13.160> your<00:04:14.000> system<00:04:14.600> is<00:04:14.720> set<00:04:14.840> up

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
you'll know that your system is set up

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.650 
you'll know that your system is set up
the<00:04:15.080> same<00:04:15.350> as<00:04:15.380> mine<00:04:16.130> now<00:04:16.820> of<00:04:17.120> course<00:04:17.359> there's

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
the same as mine now of course there's

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.409 
the same as mine now of course there's
other<00:04:17.959> ways<00:04:18.200> this<00:04:18.530> can<00:04:18.739> be<00:04:18.830> tackled<00:04:19.459> but<00:04:19.880> you

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
other ways this can be tackled but you

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.150 
other ways this can be tackled but you
know<00:04:20.540> hey<00:04:20.840> it's<00:04:21.049> my<00:04:21.260> video<00:04:21.500> series<00:04:21.770> so<00:04:22.010> we're

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
know hey it's my video series so we're

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.010 
know hey it's my video series so we're
going<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.310> do<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:22.490> this<00:04:22.640> way<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:23.090> once<00:04:23.870> you're

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
going to do it this way and once you're

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.590 
going to do it this way and once you're
more<00:04:24.200> familiar<00:04:24.350> with<00:04:24.800> composer<00:04:25.250> as<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:26.060> program

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
more familiar with composer as a program

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.659 
more familiar with composer as a program
then<00:04:27.140> you'll<00:04:27.470> be<00:04:27.590> able<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.919> set<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.160> up<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.520> meet

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
then you'll be able to set it up to meet

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
we get our programs set up we're going

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.900 
we get our programs set up we're going
to<00:04:32.720> get<00:04:32.900> down<00:04:33.110> on<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.320> nitty-gritty

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
to get down on the nitty-gritty

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.360 
to get down on the nitty-gritty
and<00:04:34.030> start<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.780> work<00:04:35.050> first<00:04:35.830> off<00:04:36.070> we're<00:04:36.280> going

videos in this series really command an

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.350 
videos in this series really command an
entire<00:05:17.860> video<00:05:18.190> series<00:05:18.490> they're<00:05:18.880> all<00:05:19.120> their

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
entire video series they're all their

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.240 
entire video series they're all their
own<00:05:19.540> but<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.350> felt<00:05:20.800> they<00:05:20.950> were<00:05:21.070> worth

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
own but I felt they were worth

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.580 
own but I felt they were worth
mentioning<00:05:21.910> in<00:05:22.120> this<00:05:22.630> particular<00:05:22.960> series

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
mentioning in this particular series

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.860 
mentioning in this particular series
because<00:05:24.040> it's<00:05:24.640> an<00:05:24.790> add-on<00:05:25.030> not<00:05:25.570> so<00:05:25.660> much<00:05:25.750> an

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
because it's an add-on not so much an

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.810 
because it's an add-on not so much an
add-on<00:05:26.080> but<00:05:26.380> it's<00:05:26.530> it's<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.460> feature<00:05:27.670> that

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
add-on but it's it's a feature that

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.470 
add-on but it's it's a feature that
composer<00:05:28.360> has<00:05:28.750> that<00:05:29.020> really<00:05:29.350> I<00:05:30.060> really<00:05:31.060> enjoy

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
composer has that really I really enjoy

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.120 
composer has that really I really enjoy
because<00:05:31.750> it's<00:05:32.140> something<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.530> a<00:05:32.710> lot<00:05:33.100> of

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
because it's something that a lot of

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.330 
because it's something that a lot of
other<00:05:33.490> WYSIWYG<00:05:34.270> editors<00:05:34.660> that<00:05:34.690> cost<00:05:35.410> money<00:05:35.740> do
