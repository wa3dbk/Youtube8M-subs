00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.450
 all right 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.890
 this month 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.630
 in this course of selections and masks 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.240
 for photographers we have done so far 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.009
 a fairly accurate elections 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.829
 automatic tools that we 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.870
 they helped detect the edges but they did not 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.970
 It is always necessary to work with a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.760
 Extreme precision when it comes to making 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.949
 selections indeed when we work 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.829
 in landscape photographs and even 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.360
 between data we can make selections to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.720
 freehand that are perfectly 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.540
 effective this photograph here is the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.840
 same as this you see the difference between 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.210
 the before as well as get out of the camera and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.179
 the after one once treated and is 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.780
 treated here we see it with a lot of 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.850
 adjustment layers that each have their 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.830
 layer mask that are made by hand 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.690
 we are going to see them 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.370
 this this 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.100
 are the different zones that there are in the 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.820
 photograph that we have tried each one 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.780
 by his side but with selections made 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.119
 freehand 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.619
 we go to the original photograph because it is 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.659
 very simple we can take the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.140
 tool tie that is the simplest 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.780
 of all and I'm going now to select 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.190
 this rock that is in the foreground I'm going 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.060
 to try to be as accurate as possible 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.369
 but without distressing me in case I leave 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.520
 little further up a little lower because 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.899
 at the end how are you going to see now does not have 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.899
 too much importance 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.790
 well I made the selection is not bad 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.490
 I'm missing a piece here, I'm going to press 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.010
 the uppercase key and it 's adding that 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.990
 missing trace is already there and in you 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.360
 choices and your ability to 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.400
 make them increase as you do more 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.070
 selections the practice of course is 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.230
 very important and also have a a 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.660
 pencil with a stylus is much more 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.520
 easy to make them with a mouse I already have 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.140
 the selection made now I'm going to come to 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.350
 perfect edge just as we had 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.350
 seen in in the previous election and I'm going to 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.750
 use the mean draft set this 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.150
 you see if you have some borders 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.850
 rather more inaccurate perhaps that of 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.100
 too much I'll leave it like that 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.830
 I'm ok and now I'm going to apply it 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.790
 something I 'm going to apply maybe a layer of 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.930
 of curves 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.829
 the window of the curve comes out here I'll go 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.829
 to increase the contrast 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.780
 I have already highlighted this rock a bit 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.960
 the first term was like that and I've 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.670
 left so it's an one option I'm going to do 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.590
 another selection 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.050
 concretely I'm going to catch this great 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.050
 stone that is on a lower level 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.060
 I'm doing it by free hand 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.180
 I'm avoiding the bushes that are already 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.450
 very dark but darken to the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:24.000
 apply more contrast 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.350
 I also avoid the rock that I have already treated 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.350
 I'm going to get here 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.640
 I already have a large area selected 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.110
 I'm going to perfect edge I'm going to set 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.530
 I'm going to clarify it a bit more 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.530
 still 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.530
 I've done it with less precision 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.030
 maybe visually I control that I 'm not going 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.030
 to put in the lake 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.240
 I leave it there I give it ok it is already and now it 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.260
 I'm going to apply another layer of 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.340
 curve adjustment and I will do the same 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:09.000
 that before applying a s that will increase 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.830
 against this and now I have this area 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.230
 well I could stay all the zones 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.540
 who wants right before I did in the 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.970
 original photograph seven or eight zones 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.979
 but here for the purpose of the tutorial I'm going to 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.770
 try to solve just this other great 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.030
 stone that fits me and I'm going to 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.220
 teach you with it also what is 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.320
 possible to add and subtract selections as well 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.270
 up here that I will be more or 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.190
 less accurate 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:39.410
 but now arrived here 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.300
 and I'll do anything I have an ellipse 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.730
 part of the selection that already 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.440
 had done before the rock below and 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.950
 part of the rock of the first term 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.540
 because because to be coincident 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.580
 totally and others what I'm going to 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.520
 to do is subtract the selections that already 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.550
 I had done see you I have the selection 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.410
 on the screen of the area that is not yet 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.330
 we have become a layer mask ni 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.670
 in layer or nothing is just a 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.710
 selection I will see from the palette of 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.560
 channels and in the channel palette I see 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.350
 that I have here a channel that is a channel 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.360
 provisional if I go for example to 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.600
 background has already disappeared but if I'm 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.430
 in curves 2 which is one of the 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.170
 selections that he had made out the 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.360
 channel corresponding to the mask 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.900
 layer you see what this nice one is like 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.910
 here is here the channel and the mask 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.800
 of layers are exactly the same one 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.290
 black and white image of the selection 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.210
 that we did at the time because now 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.890
 with the tool the selected area 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.890
 I give the key 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.749
 it turns me the tool the fao me 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:46.749
 indicates that it is in subtract mode it goes out there 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:49.899
 this in the icon you see him put a loop 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:53.110
 less then now with this selected 

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:55.719
 I'm going to click on this icon and 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.869
 I have immediately subtracted all the 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:00.939
 selection corresponding to the rock of 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:02.529
 down now I'm going to do the same with the 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.479
 rock of the first term I'm going to 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:07.419
 subtract what I have left from selecting 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.939
 the rock above I put here in the 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.519
 layer corresponding to the rock of 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:15.159
 first I see that here I have been 

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:17.559
 produced a provisional channel that 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:19.419
 corresponds to the layer mask of the 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:21.849
 rock the foreground and I do the same 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:27.039
 hit the alt key the cursor will 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:30.399
 convert in term - I come here pulse e 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:33.610
 immediately the space is subtracted 

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:37.300
 corresponding to the rock below now 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.920
 I'm going to come here and create another layer 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.470
 of curve adjustment 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.930
 it is already having the form 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.930
 corresponding to what we have left 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.660
 it heals us 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.030
 so good is it 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.620
 and I would continue retouching because important 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.960
 is that you see that the selections are 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.730
 they can also do freehand and that 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.650
 thanks to the tools of 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.100
 edge refinement we can 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.240
 get transitions of some 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.640
 selections to others be it 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.500
 subtle enough to not 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.990
 it is noticeable and on the other hand we have also 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.270
 seen that it is possible to subtract but also 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.130
 it would be possible to add selections 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.960
 selections that we have converted into 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.960
 layer and channel masks
