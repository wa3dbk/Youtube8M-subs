your<00:00:26.490> first<00:00:26.730> strip<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:28.140> Center<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.560> I

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
your first strip and you Center it I

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.359 
your first strip and you Center it I
attach<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> center<00:00:31.369> and

attach it just right in the center and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.510 
attach it just right in the center and
then<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> pull<00:00:32.880> up<00:00:33.030> both<00:00:33.600> sides<00:00:33.930> across<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.710> tap

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
then I pull up both sides across and tap

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
then I pull up both sides across and tap
it<00:00:35.700> down<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.450> Pat<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.110> tap<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.559> I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it down you want to Pat it or tap it I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.970 
it down you want to Pat it or tap it I
use<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.360> front<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> my<00:00:39.480> index<00:00:39.899> finger<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
use the front of my index finger you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.619 
use the front of my index finger you
don't<00:00:41.040> want<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.370> rub<00:00:41.579> especially<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.329> black

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
don't want to rub especially with black

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.130 
don't want to rub especially with black
because<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.469> could<00:00:44.360> smear<00:00:45.360> or<00:00:45.600> tear<00:00:45.930> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
because you could smear or tear it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.130 
because you could smear or tear it
something<00:00:47.070> else<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.390> keep<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.660> mind<00:00:48.840> when

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
something else that to keep in mind when

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.750 
something else that to keep in mind when
you<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.440> using<00:00:49.829> designer<00:00:50.280> prints<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.610> ice

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you are using designer prints on ice

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
you are using designer prints on ice
cream<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.100> immediately<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.309> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
cream is that is to immediately when you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.850 
cream is that is to immediately when you
apply<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> designer<00:00:54.390> print<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.930> has<00:00:55.170> frozen

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
apply the designer print it has frozen

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.930 
apply the designer print it has frozen
so<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.370> try<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:57.770> Pat<00:00:58.770> down<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> large<00:00:59.609> bubble

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
so if you try to Pat down a large bubble

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
so if you try to Pat down a large bubble
or<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> try<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.930> remove<00:01:01.289> two<00:01:01.649> straight

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
or if you try to remove two straight

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.000 
or if you try to remove two straight
mint<00:01:02.300> it's<00:01:03.300> likely<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.589> may<00:01:04.680> crack

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
mint it's likely that it may crack

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.820 
mint it's likely that it may crack
because<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.970> frozen<00:01:06.530> for<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.560> next

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because it will be frozen for the next

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.789 
because it will be frozen for the next
strip<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.729> saw<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.240> took<00:01:09.840> off<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.290> second

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
strip as you saw I took off the second

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
strip as you saw I took off the second
strip<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.450> I'm

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
strip and what I like to do and I'm

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.310 
strip and what I like to do and I'm
left-handed

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
left-handed

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.810 
left-handed
so<00:01:13.470> you'll<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.130> doing<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> opposite

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so you'll be doing this in the opposite

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.550 
so you'll be doing this in the opposite
direction<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.390> sort<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.900> fold<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
direction I sort of fold it up just a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.760 
direction I sort of fold it up just a
little<00:01:16.590> bit<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.060> gather<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.650> my

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
little bit and I gather it with my

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
little bit and I gather it with my
fingers<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.250> leave<00:01:20.759> about<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> third<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.990> an<00:01:22.110> inch

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
fingers I leave about a third of an inch

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.969 
fingers I leave about a third of an inch
gap<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:24.780> line<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> edges<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
gap and I line up the edges so that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.980 
gap and I line up the edges so that
they're<00:01:26.250> straight<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> then

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
they're straight as you can see and then

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.630 
they're straight as you can see and then
I<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.350> pull<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.250> strip<00:01:29.790> around<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:31.460> tap<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
I just pull that strip around and tap it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.760 
I just pull that strip around and tap it
down<00:01:32.820> anchor<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.840> tap<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.470> all<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> way

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
down anchor it and tap it all the way

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.429 
down anchor it and tap it all the way
around<00:01:34.890> real<00:01:35.850> lightly<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:39.439> complete

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
around real lightly and then complete

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
around real lightly and then complete
the<00:01:40.470> cake<00:01:40.799> with<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.070> last<00:01:41.400> strip<00:01:41.729> depending

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the cake with the last strip depending

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.859 
the cake with the last strip depending
on<00:01:42.680> whether<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:44.159> store<00:01:44.490> uses<00:01:44.939> pre-made

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
on whether your store uses pre-made

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.780 
on whether your store uses pre-made
blanks<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.680> makes<00:01:46.890> their<00:01:47.130> own<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.549> may<00:01:47.729> be

blanks or makes their own you may be

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.210 
blanks or makes their own you may be
leaving<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.420> half<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.320> inch<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.710> third<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.130> an

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
leaving a half an inch to a third of an

leaving a half an inch to a third of an
inch<00:01:50.689> between<00:01:51.689> each<00:01:52.079> strip<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.700> will<00:01:53.909> be

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
inch between each strip so that will be

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.850 
inch between each strip so that will be
something<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
something that

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.030 
something that
we<00:01:55.150> determine<00:01:56.150> at<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:57.110> floor<00:01:57.380> level<00:01:57.680> so

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
we determine at this floor level so

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.610 
we determine at this floor level so
there<00:01:58.910> you've<00:01:59.240> got<00:01:59.270> your<00:01:59.480> designer<00:02:00.140> prints<00:02:00.440> on

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
there you've got your designer prints on

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.940 
there you've got your designer prints on
next<00:02:01.430> thing<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:02.120> do<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.870> apply<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.680> bottom

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
next thing to do is to apply the bottom

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.070 
next thing to do is to apply the bottom
border<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.600> for<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.690> I'm<00:02:05.810> going<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:05.960> be

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
border and for that I'm going to be

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.920 
border and for that I'm going to be
using<00:02:06.230> the<00:02:06.470> black<00:02:06.620> icing<00:02:06.860> in<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.190> 22<00:02:07.840> what<00:02:08.840> I'm

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
using the black icing in the 22 what I'm

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.560 
using the black icing in the 22 what I'm
going<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.140> be<00:02:09.259> doing<00:02:09.500> today<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.580> border<00:02:11.330> that

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
going to be doing today is a border that

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.250 
going to be doing today is a border that
I<00:02:11.600> call<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.290> coil<00:02:12.680> border<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.960> if<00:02:14.960> I<00:02:15.140> were

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
I call it a coil border and if I were

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.320 
I call it a coil border and if I were
right-handed<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.100> would<00:02:16.220> call<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.550> an<00:02:16.670> e<00:02:16.940> border

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
right-handed I would call it an e border

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.570 
right-handed I would call it an e border
because<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.320> basically<00:02:18.770> would<00:02:18.980> be<00:02:19.070> making<00:02:19.370> a

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
because I basically would be making a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.170 
because I basically would be making a
after<00:02:19.910> ee<00:02:20.120> after<00:02:20.510> II<00:02:20.540> after<00:02:20.930> e<00:02:21.550> like<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:22.880> but

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
after ee after II after e like so but

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.960 
after ee after II after e like so but
because<00:02:23.450> I'm<00:02:23.600> not<00:02:24.820> right-handed<00:02:25.820> I'm

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
because I'm not right-handed I'm

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.700 
because I'm not right-handed I'm
left-handed<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.630> ends<00:02:26.780> up<00:02:26.870> being<00:02:27.050> just<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.290> coil

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
left-handed it ends up being just a coil

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.410 
left-handed it ends up being just a coil
and<00:02:27.800> all<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.220> need<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.520> do<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.240> have<00:02:29.330> to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
and all you need to do you just have to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.330 
and all you need to do you just have to
be<00:02:29.510> careful<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.870> do<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.350> maintain<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.920> steady

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
be careful to do to maintain a steady

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.880 
be careful to do to maintain a steady
pressure<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:32.030> steady<00:02:32.540> constant<00:02:33.110> pressure<00:02:33.290> so

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
pressure a steady constant pressure so

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.060 
pressure a steady constant pressure so
all<00:02:34.100> you're<00:02:34.280> having<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.670> do<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.930> make<00:02:36.830> these

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
all you're having to do is make these

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.160 
all you're having to do is make these
ease<00:02:38.440> without<00:02:39.440> having<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.950> worry<00:02:40.130> about

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
ease without having to worry about

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.270 
ease without having to worry about
stopping<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.320> starting<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.830> stopping<00:02:43.010> and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
stopping and starting and stopping and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.340 
stopping and starting and stopping and
starting<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:43.760> squeezing<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.330> releasing<00:02:44.900> as

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
starting and squeezing and releasing as

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.670 
starting and squeezing and releasing as
you<00:02:45.530> slowly<00:02:45.770> move<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.220> turntable<00:02:46.760> around<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
you slowly move the turntable around the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.260 
you slowly move the turntable around the
nice<00:02:48.860> thing<00:02:49.100> about<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.490> is<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.790> sort<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.030> has

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
nice thing about this is it sort of has

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
nice thing about this is it sort of has
a<00:02:50.570> look<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:51.709> your<00:02:51.890> standard<00:02:52.400> star<00:02:53.120> or<00:02:54.080> your

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
a look of your standard star or your

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.520 
a look of your standard star or your
standard<00:02:54.860> shell<00:02:55.850> border<00:02:56.030> but<00:02:57.020> you<00:02:57.200> don't<00:02:57.380> have

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
standard shell border but you don't have

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.040 
standard shell border but you don't have
to<00:02:57.680> think<00:02:57.800> about<00:02:57.950> as<00:02:58.220> much<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.790> just<00:02:59.750> have<00:02:59.900> to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
to think about as much I just have to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.960 
to think about as much I just have to
squeeze<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.680> when<00:03:04.070> you're<00:03:04.190> done<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.640> you've

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
squeeze and when you're done and you've

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.130 
squeeze and when you're done and you've
reached<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.890> beginning<00:03:07.489> of<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.060> border<00:03:08.360> stop

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
reached the beginning of the border stop

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.979 
reached the beginning of the border stop
squeezing<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.980> then<00:03:10.220> pull<00:03:10.519> away<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.780> you

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
squeezing and then pull away so that you

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.449 
squeezing and then pull away so that you
don't<00:03:12.230> get<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.440> point<00:03:12.769> but<00:03:13.040> if<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:13.190> do<00:03:13.310> get<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
don't get a point but if you do get a

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.880 
don't get a point but if you do get a
point<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:14.420> can<00:03:14.570> just<00:03:14.750> tap<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.110> down<00:03:15.260> what<00:03:15.800> I'm

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
point you can just tap it down what I'm

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.550 
point you can just tap it down what I'm
going<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.070> do<00:03:16.220> next<00:03:16.400> is<00:03:16.760> fill<00:03:17.060> these<00:03:17.269> gaps<00:03:17.560> with

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
going to do next is fill these gaps with

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.150 
going to do next is fill these gaps with
the<00:03:18.920> white<00:03:19.280> icing<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.660> 22<00:03:21.110> star<00:03:21.380> tip<00:03:21.650> I'm

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
the white icing and the 22 star tip I'm

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.520 
the white icing and the 22 star tip I'm
going<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.430> do<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.670> same<00:03:24.220> coil<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:27.050> fill<00:03:27.350> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
going to do the same coil and fill the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.880 
going to do the same coil and fill the
gaps<00:03:27.739> between<00:03:28.040> each<00:03:28.400> strip

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.080 

and<00:03:32.890> as<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.069> can<00:03:33.220> see<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.400> got<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> little<00:03:33.879> bit

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
and as you can see I got a little bit

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.059 
and as you can see I got a little bit
about<00:03:34.299> points<00:03:34.720> there<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.349> can<00:03:35.620> just<00:03:35.769> knock

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
about points there so I can just knock

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.690 
about points there so I can just knock
it<00:03:36.099> down<00:03:36.250> I'm<00:03:37.209> going<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.390> do<00:03:37.599> that<00:03:37.840> same<00:03:38.700> coil

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
it down I'm going to do that same coil

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.850 
it down I'm going to do that same coil
border<00:03:40.150> on<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.480> top<00:03:43.080> so<00:03:44.080> what<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.319> want<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.620> do

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
border on the top so what you want to do

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.800 
border on the top so what you want to do
is<00:03:46.709> oil<00:03:47.709> coil<00:03:48.069> coil<00:03:48.400> all<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.360> way<00:03:49.480> around

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
is oil coil coil all the way around

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.970 
is oil coil coil all the way around
the<00:03:52.350> trick<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.650> any<00:03:52.980> border<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.930> consistency

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
the trick to any border is consistency

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.530 
the trick to any border is consistency
so<00:03:55.980> whether<00:03:57.950> you're<00:03:58.950> able<00:03:59.310> to

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
so whether you're able to

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.990 
so whether you're able to
single-handedly<00:04:00.540> squeeze<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.770> use<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
single-handedly squeeze and use the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.470 
single-handedly squeeze and use the
other<00:04:03.090> hand<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:04.160> turn<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.310> turntable<00:04:05.550> or<00:04:06.209> if

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
other hand to turn the turntable or if

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.940 
other hand to turn the turntable or if
you<00:04:06.569> need<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.720> stop<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:07.410> use<00:04:07.530> both<00:04:07.709> hands<00:04:08.340> to

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
you need to stop and use both hands to

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.670 
you need to stop and use both hands to
guide<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:12.420> tip<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:13.200> just<00:04:13.230> want<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.530> make<00:04:13.650> sure

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
guide the tip you just want to make sure

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.620 
guide the tip you just want to make sure
that<00:04:13.950> your<00:04:14.069> spacing<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:15.030> even<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:20.630> your

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
that your spacing is even and your

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.300 
that your spacing is even and your
pressure<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:22.079> even<00:04:24.770> all<00:04:25.770> right

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
pressure is even all right
