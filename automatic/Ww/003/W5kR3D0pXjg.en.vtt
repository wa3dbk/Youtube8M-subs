00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.219
 Look there, it's well explained and I'm selling 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.649
 more and know that you take a look 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.539
 There you go and get that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.030
 You're in a hurry. 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 location that I actually spent 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.539
 This video that is recorded I am 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.820
 commenting on it because really 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.220
 I did not get what I wanted in 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.740
 reality that this video was meant to be a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.150
 kind of a search for a skeleton 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.340
 that has on the bottom of the sea 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.299
 the skeleton of a blue whale that has 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.310
 here at gta 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.110
 I've seen some videos from October 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.240
 and doing so I wanted to find 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 show you but I can not 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.170
 I really got lost here on the bottom of the sea 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 for this video it was really cool 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.420
 that we have an idea of ​​what the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.340
 gt sea ​​immensity so lost the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.970
 that's how much the secrets keep this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.020
 sea 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.090
 so you do not see where I am 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.040
 I searched hard for this whale did not 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.540
 I managed to find but I found two 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.090
 very interesting things that I do not even 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.460
 I knew that there was then the tip and 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.189
 if you have the patience to explore 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.180
 gta seas is really cool really 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.560
 I was surprised 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.110
 I found two things that I did not imagine 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.430
 I would have and I found the first 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 attack early on 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.560
 and I think you identify it as 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.490
 say the skeleton of a ship that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.950
 sank 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.869
 although having a wheel here is I found 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.240
 that a ship you will also give more to the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.360
 front is probably a ship that 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.060
 sank the plane I'm not sure but it's 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.620
 One thing I've already decided to think illegal 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.110
 what is this one must get inside 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.269
 You investigate everything I do in 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.730
 I'll have a lot on the subject maybe 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.459
 some secret a chest something inside 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.170
 of some of these boats but anyway it is 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.510
 This was a ship I found and now 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.040
 I'm going to give a dianta a look at the video 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.440
 because I searched a lot for this whale 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.360
 start it now, I'll let it 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.090
 I quickly searched for you. 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.379
 the whale could not find it anymore 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.090
 Here I promise to you that for more 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.269
 What I thought was the best, I'll do it. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.090
 a video for you but anyway you're not 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.319
 seeing there it will be a long time I 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.000
 I put the camera fast do not delay 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.829
 and looking for the whale and not 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.900
 I managed to find in the end I find another 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.290
 something that I found very interesting 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.730
 it's about gta videos already i would like 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.220
 to tell you if you have 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.250
 liking gta liking this 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.709
 Back to gta5, you leave us 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.450
 comments there please if you are 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.670
 liking let your like too 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.230
 people realize if you are liking the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.170
 content then not liking videos of 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.730
 gta5 discuss the episode and will have five 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.650
 also in case you have not seen go 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.329
 be in the description take a look that 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.709
 if you wanted 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.290
 We may be doing here a 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.370
 campaign is the way gta campaign is 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.669
 bringing there 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.889
 in each episode a sum will be a 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.090
 campaign mode mission then you 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.769
 believe in the comments 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.450
 You really want to be a little 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.430
 workable is a little hard to do 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.359
 but if you want I'll do it with 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.180
 assurance 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.680
 anyway it's coming in the part that I 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.720
 I discover something else like you 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.690
 saw I rode all over this region here 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.430
 map is then the tip for you if 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.199
 Do you want to come to this region that 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.760
 that I mark at the beginning of the video you 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.709
 will probably find that ship 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.389
 maybe if you are lucky you will 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.040
 find whale because I have almost 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.169
 I'm sure she's only here. 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.519
 I did not find it, and probably you too. 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.379
 You will find this other thing that I will 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.239
 find and after that make this curve 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.340
 that I will not keep secret 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.290
 also because they are going to see is an airplane 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.389
 exactly there is an airplane here that 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.989
 sank I do not know if he has a 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.000
 story 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.190
 if there is anything there, you can already see 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.720
 deep in the background then that 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.370
 wheel of the beginning of the video begins to do 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.380
 some sense to have been of this 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.729
 airplane is a very large plane 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.710
 I do not know if there is any history of 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.289
 as the plane crashed but I do not know if you have 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.909
 some history related to this but it is 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.450
 Another thing with a very 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.130
 want 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.350
 You can see from the plane that a 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.330
 the water by the wheel there 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.190
 It gives to give a entradinha inside 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.750
 I'm going to come in but it's pretty difficult to 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.670
 swimming seems like it has a current 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.050
 Do not accept, I'll hit the wall. 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.520
 You 'll see all the time. 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.050
 but at last there is not much for you 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.860
 see but it's interesting you find a 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.440
 thing like that 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.320
 on the bottom of the sea of ​​gta that in the other gt 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.460
 to be a well know thing there and plunged 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.830
 it had nothing to do with having a 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.840
 goldfish and in this one there is a lot 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.800
 There's a lot of interesting things there in the 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.060
 seabed 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.040
 finally the video is staying here 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.830
 I hope you have really liked me. 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.180
 I do not have the chimney half bruninho even 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.920
 of not having found the whale but 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.240
 finding the plane and the boat there 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.740
 probably a boat 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.600
 Anyway, I hope you liked it. 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.790
 You liked it. I liked it.
