00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
port which is available on the nexus 4

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.669 
port which is available on the nexus 4
phone<00:00:12.299> so<00:00:13.299> this<00:00:13.480> is<00:00:13.629> a<00:00:13.660> new<00:00:14.110> kind<00:00:14.320> of<00:00:14.379> port

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
phone so this is a new kind of port

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.400 
phone so this is a new kind of port
which<00:00:14.980> is<00:00:15.309> the<00:00:15.519> same<00:00:15.730> same<00:00:16.390> size<00:00:16.630> as<00:00:16.960> a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.040 
which is the same same size as a
microUSB<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.820> yet<00:00:21.820> cost<00:00:22.060> about<00:00:22.269> I<00:00:22.600> think<00:00:22.810> has

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
microUSB and yet cost about I think has

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.880 
microUSB and yet cost about I think has
about<00:00:23.230> 25<00:00:23.650> pounds<00:00:23.949> so<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.900> got<00:00:26.019> HDMI<00:00:26.410> plug

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
about 25 pounds so it's got HDMI plug

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.720 
about 25 pounds so it's got HDMI plug
they're<00:00:27.449> allowing<00:00:28.449> you<00:00:28.599> to<00:00:28.660> plug<00:00:28.840> into<00:00:28.960> a<00:00:29.050> TV

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
can plug it in a micro USB charger

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330 
can plug it in a micro USB charger
because<00:00:38.050> it<00:00:38.200> can<00:00:38.440> take<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.770> lot<00:00:38.980> of<00:00:39.010> battery

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.780 

now<00:03:21.239> I've<00:03:21.540> tried<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.989> use<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.790> Bluetooth

devices<00:05:44.980> I<00:05:45.780> think<00:05:46.780> it's<00:05:46.900> worth<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.230> it's

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
devices I think it's worth it it's

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:54.330 
devices I think it's worth it it's
relatively<00:05:48.790> relatively<00:05:49.750> cheap<00:05:51.960> for<00:05:53.340> 25

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
relatively relatively cheap for 25

pounds
yeah<00:05:55.690> it's<00:05:56.290> not<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.470> cheapest<00:05:56.890> thing<00:05:57.070> but<00:05:57.340> I

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
yeah it's not the cheapest thing but I

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.850 
yeah it's not the cheapest thing but I
think<00:05:58.060> it's<00:05:58.330> worth<00:05:58.480> it<00:05:58.660> for<00:05:58.900> for<00:05:59.500> what<00:05:59.650> it<00:05:59.740> can

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
think it's worth it for for what it can
