00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.979
 Breakfast was a continental as a small but 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.869
 door closing system is the same as 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:10.110
 to the client on the blog asked the question 

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:11.459
 main course 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.709
 the sport club he is with 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.839
 difficulty because he dropped one side of 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.060
 opening of the stove by doors or by a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 side of the wife to do a cleaning and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.590
 He can not stand, I'm trying. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.330
 explaining with words is difficult then 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.619
 remained a little common yesterday to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.420
 show them more or less but have 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.070
 to be done is I do not know if the stove is 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 same as his but the almost 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.150
 all are equal the item that hinge 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.340
 small lower intense hail 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.530
 bigger and up here I can and here 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.140
 on top of the fact that we will be here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 on a pulley trying to give 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.260
 sure and it will not work 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.750
 so here under a hinge 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.300
 smaller and here is a larger hinge and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.930
 inside the pressure bike then here's the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.330
 pulley to pulley who is in the place that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.400
 is running is working and the 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:04.400
 smaller hinge underneath the larger belly 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 up and the ball here inside a ball 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:15.030
 under the arm in the larger area and has a 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.789
 neighbor and in the smallest is this is how it is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.840
 Almost 80 pectin you will turn there 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:25.109
 inside to lock on the other side of the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.490
 same way I do this with you 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:32.130
 make it very clear be small 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.319
 so here with the two pieces 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.810
 the smaller the greater the number of 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:41.759
 no difficulty to take away my 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.280
 daughter hold here I'll take it with them 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.469
 I only do not do anything because 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.899
 the pieces are locked to the format 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.939
 door does not go out because it is 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.799
 this one holding on to the pressure of the bike 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.389
 violent pressure here 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.969
 then put me back in place if 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:02.270
 have escaped out here is only approximate 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.969
 leaves the stove this way so it is 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.520
 made it so impresses with force 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.990
 down love to access and there you fit 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.290
 so that a dog again 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.180
 the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.159
 there're the next wave and fits part of 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.349
 up looks only the opposition has struck had 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.780
 The lid of my hand is not going to force. 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.829
 none in the box to enter with 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.040
 bottom 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.930
 It's cool, I just press down. 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.230
 do not stay your spring 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.739
 thus open the maximum 90 degrees for 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:42.819
 there does not have to strain and back in 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:48.709
 came from the other side in the same way here 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:53.989
 open in the draw with the Flemish 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.569
 is not a secret is here O back 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.510
 to learn the greater chance of 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.019
 otherwise you will not get much 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.019
 difficult
