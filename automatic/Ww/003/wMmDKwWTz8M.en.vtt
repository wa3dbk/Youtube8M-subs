00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hello and welcome here 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.049
 joint gamer and punctual today 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.540
 I've got mythen thursday again 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.750
 a myth slash easter egg for 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.320
 you and it is today about the ufo 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.840
 which allegedly overthrown here in gta 5 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.220
 and has set 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.740
 and yes I looked for it in this one 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.970
 ocean here so should be about where 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 I find that shown 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.340
 and then see if there really 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.539
 Yes, it is already up there 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.439
 I can see that a bit already 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.850
 a bit closer 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.610
 yes yes it is and that is the ufo 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.440
 what the alien which one of the beginning 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.820
 person can see where you then stop 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.219
 underneath the bridge goes and then stop 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.969
 since it is usually located that is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.200
 apparently come here so so 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.500
 after san andreas I say practically 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.960
 that it is different now 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.910
 and yes I think of the makers to themselves 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.829
 actually made them relatively cool that they 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.629
 so installed a cool Wieseck here 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.630
 because such an ufo is already something 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.479
 Understanding is always as small as that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.619
 tip in case you own the times 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.119
 probably wanted to watch what 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.060
 the case is determined you have to son 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.350
 that a certain property buy the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.090
 I might finish number 1 in the end 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.070
 will 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.409
 So you get the submarine because the u 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.270
 boat is the ultimate as you yes 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.770
 So if you have the submarine in there 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 is and then automatically exits the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.890
 had diving suit's not an extra 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.729
 buy or so so was with me 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.119
 at least and that's probably true 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.650
 one more time so that we have the ufo 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.960
 noticed is you can not include 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.479
 You see, like when he's one 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.890
 invisible wall is here 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.350
 You can swim as you want 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.920
 is not there next habs tried there 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.079
 There then up high so there under it 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.390
 I also have to swim something 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.619
 always and it did not work out because of me 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.600
 first wanted to see if you maybe 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.770
 but somehow the ufo comes in 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 of course would have been pretty cool 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.860
 but unfortunately this is not the case 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.350
 but in itself it is still good 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.380
 and so you do that now 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.399
 also can explore for yourself and so 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.170
 Now just wanted to show it 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.790
 really exists and that you 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.840
 that was even possible to try or 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.430
 so here you can own a bit 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 swimming around maybe he discovers 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.270
 something else and you can me 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.560
 then below the comments 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.410
 write in or so yes so it is 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.550
 is right here so well with 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.430
 point because I set up wrong but 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.090
 nevertheless, about a bit well then 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.090
 Until next time
