00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 and 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.390
 more less than or equal to just such 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.980
 words can describe our 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.560
 today's gaming review 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.510
 audio headset headphones are large and 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.340
 small expensive and cheap which 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.470
 choose not to lose and in what 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.250
 will be more comfortable and most importantly 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.230
 reliably play conditionally headphones can 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.960
 divide into two categories liners 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.370
 which are also called droplets and 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.370
 full-size headphones i.e. large 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.659
 the most significant difference in them is 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.699
 diaphragm diameter i.e. source 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.550
 sound is considered that the larger the diaphragm 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.589
 the better and better the sound will be 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.080
 but the bigger will be themselves 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.670
 Headphones for gamers 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.530
 very very important but also 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.960
 An important factor is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.580
 sound quality by and large cannot be 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.340
 unequivocally say that small 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.659
 headphones are bad and big are good 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.520
 Firstly, each species has its own 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.140
 advantages and disadvantages for your 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.700
 use case besides 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.650
 expensive liners may sound 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.020
 Much better than cheap 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.360
 full-size headphones therefore in any 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.510
 comparison is important to keep in mind the price 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.730
 categories but true connoisseurs 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.860
 comfortable game that is professionals 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.020

 one of the leaders of contra gold strike scenes 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.720
 important matches are used immediately by two 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.550
 headphone 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.160
 do they do it to get 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.350
 best isolation from extraneous sounds 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.390
 first they wear the so -called 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.370
 liners well and then full size 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.650
 headphones are the main source of sound 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.140
 players are small inserts and 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.620
 communication takes place through the full-size 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.620
 headsets 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.770

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.830
 this still holds you in the game. 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.760
 so you can play as much 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.760
 as long as you want 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.790
 having played and tested two kinds 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.380
 headphone can not tell which exactly 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.390
 are the best not with confidence 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.860
 claim that liners have 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.110
 indisputable advantage over 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.360
 full-size headsets and even 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.460
 all kinds of packaging bags and cases

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.180
 more powerful headphones but with 100 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.280
 Percentage confidence can be said 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.080
 Only one thing is that if in an important match you 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.690
 you will use two options at once 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.550
 headphone you will be the maximum 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.720
