00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.780 
this video is like an edgy early summer
look<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.040> don't<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.340> anybody<00:01:53.640> can

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
look because I don't think anybody can

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.249 
look because I don't think anybody can
have<00:01:54.030> too<00:01:54.180> much<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.509> chance<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.869> me<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
have too much of a chance at me for that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.990 
have too much of a chance at me for that
I<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:55.799> that's<00:01:55.979> pretty<00:01:56.250> much<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:56.850> this

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
I think that's pretty much what this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.420 
I think that's pretty much what this
outfit<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.979> mean<00:01:59.159> though<00:01:59.280> it's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
outfit is and so it I mean though it's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.030 
outfit is and so it I mean though it's
awkward<00:01:59.939> room<00:02:00.420> where<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:01.890> any

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
awkward room where I don't have any

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.490 
awkward room where I don't have any
space<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.939> I'm<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.570> awkwardly<00:02:04.020> stand<00:02:04.380> on
