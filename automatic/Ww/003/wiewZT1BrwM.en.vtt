00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello this video is an experiment 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.790
 and I can not tell you yet 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.550
 this experiment ends that we will 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.349
 Immediately see how you all know I eat 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.570
 personally vegetarian and vegan again 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.279
 I eat certain things very much 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.560
 controlled and in measure we have ourselves 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.710
 invited to guests today and me 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.449
 would like to cook on board pay and what 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.769
 I did not think of two men guests 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.150
 live strictly vegan 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
 Of course it is not 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.109
 problem if you can eat what he likes 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.820
 but I have never cooked because of me 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.079
 just wanted to make you salad and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
 in the stables it should be something 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.950
 be special if you do not visit 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.329
 come and that's why I try 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.910
 Today on a recipe what I found 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.250
 vegan goulash in 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.750
 peanut sauce if the whole thing works like 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.460
 I imagine this is this one 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.200
 cook video if not it is one 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.730
 I think I have a funny experiment 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 Everyone laughs, I'm very curious 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.320
 I bought salad for safety's sake 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.219
 just in case is advised but sends 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.260
 I want to see that here 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.940
 So I would say we work 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.070
 Okay before I give you the now 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.489
 ingredients say a little disclaimer 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.780
 I hope for six people 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.670
 although we are actually four and the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.979
 that would tend to eat 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.810
 just what I always fear tennis 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.520
 and probably will 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.759
 has to stand because I had enough 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.110
 So sunday with us we need for ours 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.000
 2tb recipe a can corn a big one 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.720
 zucchini has taken the biggest I have 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.729
 could find 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.470
 Carrots I have six pieces here 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.780
 in common because we were quite small 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.970
 one and a half thousand soja fleet mine 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.470
 I got from alnatura from the dm 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.979
 100 milliliters of soy milk four tablespoons 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.049
 vegetable oil pepper salt paprika curry 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.790
 garlic and if you can too 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.270
 season with chilli but I know about myself 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.920
 and I also know of two times 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.590
 that they do not like to eat hot 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.719
 the factory for us and come to 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.250
 another six tablespoons soy sauce then 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.750
 I had a little while shopping 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.939
 problem and indeed you need brühl 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.100
 for this recipe and I have 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.619
 actually no instance of oil found where 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.520
 not on it can be traces of ai 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.860
 contain 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.110
 so my question is where do I get 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.789
 please brother yes the vegan is there 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.590
 Vegan brothers tend to be something like that 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.989
 not if you really shit here 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.580
 But maybe we can 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.959
 Write for my next vegan 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.519
 Experiment I have now quite simple 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.989
 good housing taken that small 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.819
 snipped and cooked and one 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.319
 you will become a little bit and the liquid 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.090
 used to be tasted earlier 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.920
 in fact very very delicious 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.450
 therefore, I think that maybe more 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.150
 a plus is that i do not have a installer 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.250
 or we have to start with that 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.750
 soy flakes a bit instruct 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.220
 and that's where we put the best in 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.200
 a pot for a peel, depending on 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.910
 how soy pox you have after the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.680
 how many people cook and then 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.299
 you move the whole with broth and indeed 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.099
 so that actually all roja flat 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.660
 covered by the pulp so that the 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.129
 soy flakes accept the taste 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.110
 We should be five to ten 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.280
 Let it soak for about minutes 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.230
 I just have the time for that 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.880
 used to start with the sauce 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.090
 she will need it for the sauce 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.329
 Down 150 since nothing is supposed to happen 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.670
 six tablespoons soy sauce 200 billionaire 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.100
 homemade broth three 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.230
 to four tablespoons airbus mother and 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.639
 Spice everything together beautifully and that 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.200
 is not that easy with the atmos 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.910
 butter actually long does it take to get 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.180
 actually paste into the sauce 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.829
 but I have done my best and 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.420
 I would say a third of the frank 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.670
 spilled and then still my part 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.000
 rescheduled because I was just me 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.650
 too ambitious when stirring just when 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.359
 we can do that you can get the broth 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.790
 drain and the soya flakes in one 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.439
 fry the pan with a bit of oil if 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.060
 she then a little bit big 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.709
 You can put in a bigger pot 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.139
 be replenished and then comes easy 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.590
 only the vegetables and the sauce 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.670
 which we brought to and then it works 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.590
 still appeal 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.379
 just by the way that smells like this 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.510
 point the faßberger the whole cook then 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.730
 just so long until the vegetable is cooked 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.720
 and that was schooling to the whole 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.370
 Of course you can do one 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.900
 Saturation side dish is like pasta 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.939
 potatoes or rice i have now 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.430
 decided because I thought so 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.769
 Maybe it fits in well and that 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.859
 here is my final result i feel that 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.169
 series handlebar and it is absolutely 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.930
 after goulash flat really strong 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.489
 almost her hefty goulash says so 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.129
 iris strong because the iren also such a 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.489
 make great dark sauce and try 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.720
 I'm this and I'm very very very 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.220
 curious how it tastes good 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.690
 I have a different taste for today 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.310
 eat if not then there is one 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.669
 great great delicious salad 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.050
 I am very excited not so good you 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.520
 with friends one speaks not prevent 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.550
 that I'm coming to a close 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.349
 okay the whole tastes nutty one 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.970
 tastes the peanut out but minimal 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.560
 I thought and very much 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.520
 it actually tastes more intense 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.530
 just come across a hefty lula 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.380
 a little bit sad and 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.610
 just very very very spicy and 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.669
 in fact, I did not expect that 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.820
 is so delicious is your live bands come 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.659
 Guests actually come but only when 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.659
 I go to the coffers 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.729
 okay for the host i now have too 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.229

 try it out even if you do not 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.270
 vegan I 've had fun for 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.669
 to join my little experiment 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.639
