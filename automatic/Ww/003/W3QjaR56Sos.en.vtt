00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.940
 Welcome to another issue of 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.010
 As already announced, mori is cooking today 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.860
 the whole of the kitchen of my parents 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 with a very special mates my 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.630
 Father I hope all your wishes were 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.460
 met and maybe we easily 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.590
 I can fulfill you, too 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.090
 a long-awaited wish yes we 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.619
 we just had the best of luck 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.539
 By the way, my parents are very happy 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.980
 happy now I can reveal such 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.300
 They have a water bubbler from me 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.590
 while he gets a bit slow 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.880
 older then they do not need the more 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.530
 hauling whole water crates 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.550
 that's how you easily recognize 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.440
 if I'm good in gÃ¼tersloh 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.390
 I have many old friends 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.219
 met again but no worries 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.329
 I will also do some next day 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.920
 so stream it a bit too 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.360
 what have you of me, if you already have 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.190
 talk about well arrived 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 Interestingly, I was also tuesday 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.809
 in the steakhouse with old friends and got 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.910
 me as a delicious and fittingly 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.649
 rocco orders the interesting one 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.210
 but when I ordered the whole thing 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.180
 but at the waitress I was I would have 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.770
 like 350 grams our korea fried 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.449
 We are not over at the steak house 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.010
 At the indoor the waitress looks at me 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.200
 So with wide eyes and asks yes 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.700
 the entrecote yes then fried 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.610
 fried properly that would probably see then 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 I do not nee nee not fried 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.900
 bloody upbeat you english you have to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.350
 Although saying on the map really stood 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.909
 just bloody medium and good by times 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.560
 Seriously, this is not just any 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.030
 indians where I then go but 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.729
 the steak and there should be a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.619
 definitely know what 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.420
 means or means English resp 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.930
 bloody that's just the same 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.340
 but fair enough the meat was at the end 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.600
 really delicious so that's the chef 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.130
 You have to do very well 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.560
 anyway separated track in my 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540
 The chef or waiter is always on 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.770
 big difference and maybe that was 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.920
 The waitress is just one 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 But Assistant anyway that's almost 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.659
 So mediamarkt level if you have something 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 do not work white in a steakhouse 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.189
 they do not do anything else than tags 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.500
 i like my abi all day long and yes 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.180
 when we had dinner together, there were six 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 Man were we definitely had one 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.680
 old friend told me that he was fine 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.170
 Dad is just thinking I'm just 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.330
 I was the only one at the table neither 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.120
 married is still father 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.620
 just wow okay my very old one 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.840
 Circle of friends is currently either in the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.580
 housebuilding and get children or marry 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.320
 he and I stand there and do youtube 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.000
 videos for some reason seems 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.710
 anyway, if you are in one 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.370
 metropolis , the whole lives somehow 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.370
 a bit delayed 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.480
 yes and my mother is mine anyway 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.310
 already in the ears that she necessarily 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.690
 but I would like to have grandchildren 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.790
 it will always be me anyway 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.560
 already what maxime has done as well 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.940
 it can go and until then you can 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.920
 you are just happy there is more 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.230
 streams from me I have a right 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.400
 strong computers would have it with it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.660
 I can stream from here as well 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.490
 my parents have good internet 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.110
 luckily what i did that time 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.820
 have set up league of legends and 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.560
 Starcraft 2 is already installed 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.270
 that is basically after the holidays 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.800
 it will start directly 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.720
 maybe with my best buddy 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.459
 it's much longer 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.740
 as I am passionate league of 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.080
 legends player is currently in believe 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.980
 gold or maybe we'll do a doku 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.870
 but we have to do that 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.940
 Finally I have to try it out 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.070
 also first and foremost holidays and both 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.390

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.310

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.610
 if that is not quite so professional 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.380
 Looks like you're always in the office 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.480
 The kitchen is not that big 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.310
 as well as for work bit 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.720
 chaotic whole but I believe we 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.480
 still get it all right 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.790
 advent advent the kitchen burns like that 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.560
 my father sauce no nonsense that must be so 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.150
 should that be it again with mom 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.430

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.340
 unfamiliar surroundings for the Christmas party 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.140

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.930
