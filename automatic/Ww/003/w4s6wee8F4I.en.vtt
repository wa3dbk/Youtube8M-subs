00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello everyone today in my kitchen 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:10.139
 we will make Adygei curd cheese 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.080
 This is a classic recipe for 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.009
 making cheese we need 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.330
 milk 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.240
 whole milk is desirable 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.119
 I have homemade milk you are homemade 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.359
 can see even on top of sour cream 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.730
 cream pla you also need you 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.210
 serum serum we will be for 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.280
 oxidize your milk in order to 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 stiffened but the serum for this 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.750
 the recipe is taken three days ie 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 buy whey 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.260
 or do you already have from the previous one 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.039
 cooking with cheese and you should 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.070
 keep warm for at least three days from 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.800
 three to ten days that is what is left 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.329
 shuffle katy less you will need it 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.090
 the faster your milk will curdle also 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.510
 we need salt 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.320
 because I will salt our cheese and y 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.180
 here is such a little bucket in which 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.100
 holes I will lay out there our son 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.340
 some spoon with holes needed 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.850
 also to catch already coiled 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 milk to begin to tell technology 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.170
 then move on we must warm our 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.420
 bring milk to almost boil 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.850
 it should not boil why it is not 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.659
 must boil because otherwise your son 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.350
 will be similar to tarpaulin boots too 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.259
 so very tough and then 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.409
 gradually pour in serum 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.680
 gas and habits this is case individually 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.600
 it all depends on how sour 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.700
 your serum we pour in little by little 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.300
 we interfere a little and look to milk 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 our beginnings 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.410
 coagulate when milk started 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 curl means serum 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.180
 enough 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.200
 then when separated in our milk 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.330
 whey and curd we leave under 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.340
 shut off and insert more 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:26.110
 literally 10 minutes and pour our 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.530
 son of his own and leave to stand in 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.440
 cold place is very important what 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.960
 qualities you take milk from me 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.530
 let's say that you see straight oil 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.380
 swims on top in milk I had 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.530
 Cases when I bought permissible kefir 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.280
 to make baby cottage cheese out of it and 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.480
 he didn't even roll up on my stove 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.090
 the ace of spades just boiled so from 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.080
 milk quality depends very, very 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.820
 a lot of milk should heat up to such 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:08.260
 degree so that you can drop there 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:13.020
 finger to burn my finger in my case 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:17.020
 already enough i take the serum and 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:22.750
 I'm not starting to introduce little by little 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:25.150
 it pours in and the milk does not curdle 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.790
 you need a couple of seconds instantly 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:35.860
 wait to understand pour in yet 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:40.709
 or enough here I already have 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:43.420
 such flakes are visible a little more will 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.239
 milk as you know it should 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:52.470
 to separate into serum 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:55.540
 that is, exactly the same is taken of such 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:01.000
 green shade that's how we we 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:04.660
 initially took a look but how are you 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.150
 would you see the milk is still white? 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.470
 there is not your nous until the end therefore 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.470
 it needs more time we stop 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.239
 this process is when the milk we have something 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:22.240
 full face 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:26.080
 and building serum is transparent here 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.919
 notice the process is nearing 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:37.180
 the end of that serum I have already starts 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:39.390
 fade even literally a minute and we will 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.390
 take out 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:48.900
 here are our watchmen 6 clots not 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.169
 overturn them in a colander 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.169
 perhaps all 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:09.500
 your cheese I'm on top of a little salt 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.500
 how do you see such a plastic mass 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.970
 the serum should eventually all the whole drain and 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.570
 so here I have such a small piece 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.570
 cheese turned out I leave him in 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.570
 a cold place for at least 6 hours 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:31.620
 principle it can be used and 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:35.580
 you left a serum that you can 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.830
 leave that is part of this serum in 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.490
 dark place that she again 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:45.240
 recorded for the next time so i don't 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:51.180
 endured happened about four hours 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:55.100
 and here is our cheese ready, he still a little 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:59.160
 soft but basically delicious 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.810
 taste most awesome awesome if you 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.840
 cook this 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:07.169
 Sec for something naturally you can 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.780
 more salt it is salt is 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.810
 so here is a natural preservative in 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:16.320
 you so much cheese and cheese about it 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:20.300
 stored longer my case I did 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.200
 very little juiciness and because 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.750
