00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
alright so the goal here is to get to a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.899 
alright so the goal here is to get to a
hundred<00:01:21.420> thousand<00:01:22.369> right<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.640> got<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> get

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
hundred thousand right we got to get

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.080 
hundred thousand right we got to get
200,000<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.630> that's<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.729> what<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.820> think

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090

if<00:05:01.820> this<00:05:01.940> 5000<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:02.840> going<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.050> give<00:05:03.170> us<00:05:03.200> a<00:05:03.440> Milan

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
if this 5000 is going to give us a Milan

both<00:05:03.860> guns<00:05:04.130> so<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.700> can<00:05:05.150> do<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:05.750> then<00:05:05.900> just

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
both guns so I can do that and then just

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.330 
both guns so I can do that and then just
hit<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.500> ending<00:05:07.900> at<00:05:08.900> next<00:05:09.500> round<00:05:09.740> okay<00:05:10.280> so

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
hit the ending at next round okay so

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.120 
hit the ending at next round okay so
let's<00:05:10.580> do<00:05:10.730> that<00:05:11.050> so<00:05:12.050> we<00:05:12.170> have<00:05:12.260> 82<00:05:12.560> rounds<00:05:13.040> in

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
let's do that so we have 82 rounds in

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.680 
let's do that so we have 82 rounds in
their<00:05:13.250> type<00:05:13.400> 100<00:05:13.910> I'm<00:05:14.120> just<00:05:14.450> kind<00:05:14.600> of<00:05:14.630> curious

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
their type 100 I'm just kind of curious

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.510 
their type 100 I'm just kind of curious
if<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.200> would<00:05:15.320> give<00:05:15.470> us<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.770> Mille<00:05:15.950> for<00:05:16.130> both<00:05:16.340> our

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
if it would give us a Mille for both our

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.860 
if it would give us a Mille for both our
weapons<00:05:16.850> so<00:05:17.030> I'm<00:05:17.090> definitely<00:05:17.450> going<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.780> make

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
weapons so I'm definitely going to make

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.940 
weapons so I'm definitely going to make
sure<00:05:17.990> I'm<00:05:18.080> holding<00:05:18.170> on<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.530> Reaper<00:05:18.770> when<00:05:18.920> I

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
sure I'm holding on to the Reaper when I

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.790 
sure I'm holding on to the Reaper when I
buy<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.720> okay<00:05:20.720> so<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:21.050> fills<00:05:21.260> up<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.440> Reaper

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
buy it okay so it fills up the Reaper

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.620 
buy it okay so it fills up the Reaper
and<00:05:21.920> it<00:05:22.190> doesn't<00:05:22.550> for<00:05:22.730> the<00:05:22.790> type<00:05:22.940> 100<00:05:23.390> all

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
and it doesn't for the type 100 all

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.780 
and it doesn't for the type 100 all
right<00:05:23.810> good<00:05:24.260> to<00:05:24.410> know<00:05:24.970> good<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.030> know<00:05:27.670> so<00:05:28.670> it's

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
right good to know good to know so it's

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.640 
right good to know good to know so it's
basically<00:05:28.970> it<00:05:29.540> be<00:05:29.690> cheaper<00:05:29.930> like<00:05:30.380> if<00:05:30.500> i

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
basically it be cheaper like if i

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.320 
basically it be cheaper like if i
upgrade<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:31.160> type<00:05:31.340> 100<00:05:31.790> it<00:05:31.910> would<00:05:32.030> be<00:05:32.150> cheaper

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
upgrade the type 100 it would be cheaper

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.390 
upgrade the type 100 it would be cheaper
to<00:05:32.510> buy<00:05:32.690> ammo<00:05:32.900> off<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.260> wall<00:05:33.440> than<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.220> buy<00:05:34.340> it

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
to buy ammo off the wall than to buy it

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.550 
to buy ammo off the wall than to buy it
off<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:34.820> thing<00:05:35.020> all<00:05:36.020> right<00:05:36.140> let's<00:05:36.410> do

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
off of that thing all right let's do

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.700 
off of that thing all right let's do
this<00:05:36.940> we'll<00:05:37.940> get<00:05:38.030> enough<00:05:38.180> points<00:05:38.390> to<00:05:38.810> get<00:05:39.620> to

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
this we'll get enough points to get to

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.620 
this we'll get enough points to get to
the<00:05:39.830> ending<00:05:40.130> I'm<00:05:41.000> going<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.240> throw<00:05:41.420> a<00:05:41.450> monkey

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
the ending I'm going to throw a monkey

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.510 
the ending I'm going to throw a monkey
Oh<00:05:41.840> wants<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.140> get<00:05:42.260> 200,000<00:05:43.070> I<00:05:43.160> throw<00:05:43.340> a<00:05:43.370> monkey

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
out and then run to the ending and

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.810 
out and then run to the ending and
hopefully<00:05:46.370> it<00:05:46.880> ends<00:05:47.030> around<00:05:47.180> if<00:05:47.420> it<00:05:47.540> doesn't

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
hopefully it ends around if it doesn't
