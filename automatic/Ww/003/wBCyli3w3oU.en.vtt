 I found a very cute cutie and the color 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.850
 also very beautiful also these two 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.079
 500 elastics for hair they come 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.649
 together 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.969
 and look, it's just like this I was sorry 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:02.300
 it looks very cute 603 pencils 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:07.650
 so only they are shadows in pen 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:11.430
 find it's three beautiful colors 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.259
 I got this blue here 03 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.180
 It's what I 'm wearing in my eye. 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.340
 they say the recent website says 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.460
 You can use eyeliner. 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.979
 just that I spent as eyeliner and okay 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 I thought the pigmentation was not like that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.240
 for eyeliner is not so cool I passed 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.950
 above him 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.850
 this shadow of essence that is very 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.409
 similar here to 0 than to 11 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:46.049
 Then it was cool to disappear who likes 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.720
 to wear a thinner eyeliner 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.130
 cool only he does not need to spend another 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.090
 Shadow and cool 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.619
 now on the whole eyelid I also found 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.659
 interesting, it's cool, just like 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.049
 eyeliner that this thing is me that a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.579
 The strongest thing understood there for me not 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.849
 rolled it's color it has a bit of 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.200
 scintillation is not here there 102 is a 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:16.310
 more classic color 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.430
 I think it's beautiful to be able to use only her 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.030
 eyelid also as eyeliner I think 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.540
 not because very clear and this is the 01 that 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.340
 is a classic color also illuminating 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.890
 Beautiful people Beautiful people Beautiful people are beautiful 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.260
 for a gold is very practical for 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.090
 apply on the lash line because I 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.700
 I really like to apply the shadow on 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.000
 line of eyelashes that I think when 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.970
 I pass the black rice, but it's mine. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.790
 black pencil and I have this feeling the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.209
 blush is like 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.160
 he has these scintillating lists here only 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.739
 that sparkling list when you 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.340
 use it, it comes out and then it only stays 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:08.870
 the color is the same color as the middle here 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:12.280
 Seeing it is very soft rosy but has 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.280
 a very nice pigmentation 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:23.329
 Now you can see a little better. 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.600
 here I look like a little clown but 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.650
 I'm very light there and I can not see 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.590
 right 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.489
 This translucent powder that came from 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.880
 be used on any skin type then 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.840
 black white brunettes whites all 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:46.329
 world can use and it is a compact powder 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.489
 tablets are a cutie they are like this 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.530
 bisnaguinha looks like a gloss but he's a 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.349
 long lasting lipstick 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.760
 so what I'm using is this one from here 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.299
 02 it comes with an applicator so 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.150
 gloss and hence it has a very nice color to 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.160
 People look and are a little bit stronger. 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.410
 What are you seeing because of no 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.400
 It gives me a lot of pleasure, it 's just me. 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.480
 on the lips 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.959
 I felt it drying out in the middle 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.820
 even a bit boring but then soon 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.270
 happened when c co 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.430
 I went there and passed a free bal 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.490
 calmed down and is now climbing 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.560
 normal just when it's time for me 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.710
 I found it a bit cooler than this 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.770
 tite it does not come off easily from the lips 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:48.979
 so look I'll say anything 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:52.460
 O O O does not leave nothing comes out here not 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:55.550
 and that's kind of cool. 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.280
 What you put in the bag is going to come out 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.990
 a party for a party that will drink and 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.550
 eat kiss 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.620
 So you can use this kind of 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:14.030
 of button 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:17.199
 This is rosel tael 01 02 and now with 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:21.970

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:26.060
 I'll start with the one that's 01 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.490
 it is this very beautiful here I 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.680
 I needed two layers for a good 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:38.990
 coverage is just what you are 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:40.669
 seeing the 02 is a gray and he has some 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.680
 I do not know if you go 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:47.570
 get to see him very discreet 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.389
 I found this gray very chic people 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.199
 very chic is even more chic than 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:58.699
 This is the only one from here that I also found 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:07.729
 very chic is a more common color is the 0 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:08.690
 3 and 1 red little pro wine too much 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.340
 beautiful 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:15.229
 And that 04 is a little salmon right there. 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:21.669
 seeming lighter but he 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:24.530
 he's darker people he's not that 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:29.330
