00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
and actually do some of these

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.560 
and actually do some of these
collections<00:02:44.340> instead<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.850> trying<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.390> just

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
collections instead of trying to just

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.480 
collections instead of trying to just
save<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.320> basically<00:02:46.950> call<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> game

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
save going and basically call the game

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.860 
save going and basically call the game
over<00:02:47.790> once<00:02:48.000> they<00:02:48.090> get<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.300> clutch<00:02:48.480> dunka

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
over once they get this clutch dunka

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.150 
over once they get this clutch dunka
this<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.140> kind<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.500> last<00:02:49.620> collection<00:02:49.920> i

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
this is kind of the last collection i

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.240 
this is kind of the last collection i
believe<00:02:50.460> so<00:02:51.710> hopefully<00:02:52.710> they<00:02:52.830> do<00:02:52.920> something

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
believe so hopefully they do something

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.500 
believe so hopefully they do something
else<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.520> next<00:02:53.580> couple<00:02:53.910> weeks<00:02:54.150> because<00:02:54.300> it's

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
else the next couple weeks because it's

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.720 
else the next couple weeks because it's
gonna<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> boring<00:02:55.440> basically<00:02:56.220> month<00:02:56.550> if

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
gonna be a boring basically month if

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.370 
gonna be a boring basically month if
they<00:02:56.820> decide<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.660> focus<00:02:57.810> on<00:02:57.960> NCAA
