cable which you can't use you don't have

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.559 
cable which you can't use you don't have
to<00:02:40.579> if<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.790> don't<00:02:40.849> want<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.269> can<00:02:41.390> just

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
to if you don't want to you can just

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.509 
to if you don't want to you can just
plug<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.930> directly<00:02:42.170> into<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.099> computer's

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
plug this directly into the computer's

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.289 
plug this directly into the computer's
USB<00:02:43.760> port<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.560> can<00:02:45.739> use<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.430> cable<00:02:46.819> if

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
USB port but you can use this cable if

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.660 
USB port but you can use this cable if
you<00:02:47.480> want<00:02:47.690> an<00:02:48.440> extension<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.280> basically

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
you want an extension this is basically

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.030 
you want an extension this is basically
a<00:02:49.790> USB<00:02:50.510> extension<00:02:50.599> so<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:51.500> end<00:02:51.739> would<00:02:51.890> get

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
a USB extension so this end would get

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.190 
a USB extension so this end would get
connect<00:02:52.579> it<00:02:52.700> into<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.120> USB<00:02:53.480> port<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:53.989> then

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
connect it into the USB port and then

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.170 
connect it into the USB port and then
this<00:02:54.440> end<00:02:54.680> would<00:02:55.069> get<00:02:55.250> connected<00:02:55.489> into<00:02:56.150> the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
this end would get connected into the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.710 
this end would get connected into the
computer's<00:02:56.870> USB<00:02:57.019> port<00:02:58.329> what<00:02:59.329> else<00:02:59.480> do<00:02:59.599> we<00:02:59.629> have

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
they have a silver option as well let's

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.790 
they have a silver option as well let's
see<00:05:26.010> how<00:05:26.370> this<00:05:26.670> pan<00:05:27.060> can<00:05:27.090> perform<00:05:28.020> all<00:05:30.500> in<00:05:31.500> low

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
see how this pan can perform all in low

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.890 
see how this pan can perform all in low

this is the two gigabyte version but

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.580 
this is the two gigabyte version but
there's<00:07:22.919> also<00:07:23.039> a<00:07:23.400> 4<00:07:24.270> gigabyte<00:07:24.750> version

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 
there's also a 4 gigabyte version
