throughout this exercise to avoid any
strain<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> wrist<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.760> arm<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
strain on the wrist the arm is going to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.590 
strain on the wrist the arm is going to
be<00:00:43.050> straight<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.600> position

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
be straight and we're going to position

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.500 
be straight and we're going to position
it<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:46.050> an<00:00:46.200> angle<00:00:46.410> across<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.399> body<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
it at an angle across the body so that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.610 
it at an angle across the body so that
it<00:00:48.809> starts<00:00:49.200> near<00:00:49.920> your<00:00:50.160> opposite<00:00:50.820> hip<00:00:51.620> now

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
it starts near your opposite hip now

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.510 
it starts near your opposite hip now
before<00:00:53.660> implementing<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.050> movement<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
before implementing the movement the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.660 
before implementing the movement the
first<00:00:56.850> element<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.600> exercise<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.710> pull

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
first element of the exercise is to pull

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
first element of the exercise is to pull
the<00:01:00.030> shoulder<00:01:00.480> blades<00:01:00.510> together<00:01:02.690> retracting

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the shoulder blades together retracting

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.530 
the shoulder blades together retracting
them<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.400> holding<00:01:05.400> them<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.180> position

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
them and holding them in that position

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.940 
them and holding them in that position
that<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.229> call<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> scapular<00:01:08.400> set<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> retract

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that we call a scapular set so retract

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.660 
that we call a scapular set so retract
the<00:01:11.220> shoulder<00:01:11.640> blades<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.420> maintain<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
the shoulder blades and maintain that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.270 
the shoulder blades and maintain that
then<00:01:14.670> we're<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:16.909> abduct<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.330> arm

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
then we're going to abduct the arm

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.210 
then we're going to abduct the arm
against<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> resistance<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> tubing

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
against the resistance of the tubing

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.770 
against the resistance of the tubing
we're<00:01:23.220> only<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.790> move<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> arm<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
we're only going to move the arm to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.910 
we're only going to move the arm to
about<00:01:25.400> 60<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.580> 70<00:01:26.610> degrees<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.470> want<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
about 60 to 70 degrees we do not want to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.380 
about 60 to 70 degrees we do not want to
move<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.280> higher<00:01:29.549> than<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
move it higher than that

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.280 
move it higher than that
and<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.590> want<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> keep<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.369> arm<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:33.060> close<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and we want to keep the arm in close to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.660 
and we want to keep the arm in close to
the<00:01:35.030> abdomen<00:01:36.030> or<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> tummy<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the abdomen or the tummy as we do the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.170 
the abdomen or the tummy as we do the
exercise<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:40.430> lastly<00:01:41.430> we're<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> start

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
exercise and lastly we're going to start

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.420 
exercise and lastly we're going to start
with<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.220> thumb<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.210> position<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.430> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
with the thumb in the position in the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.120 
with the thumb in the position in the
same<00:01:47.640> direction<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.540> tubing<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.799> we

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
same direction as the tubing but as we

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.450 
same direction as the tubing but as we
abduct<00:01:51.079> we're<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.560> rotate<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:54.299> thumb

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
abduct we're going to rotate the thumb

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.120 
abduct we're going to rotate the thumb
to<00:01:56.460> an<00:01:56.670> outward<00:01:57.270> facing<00:01:57.810> position<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
to an outward facing position at the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.510 
to an outward facing position at the
concluding<00:01:59.880> part<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.229> movement

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.779 

I<00:02:07.579> would<00:02:08.420> start<00:02:08.750> with<00:02:09.340> generally<00:02:10.340> ten

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
I would start with generally ten

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.190 
I would start with generally ten
repetitions<00:02:12.129> we<00:02:13.129> will<00:02:13.540> gradually<00:02:14.540> work<00:02:14.959> up

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
repetitions we will gradually work up

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.540 
repetitions we will gradually work up
until<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:15.860> can<00:02:16.069> do<00:02:16.250> 25<00:02:18.129> then<00:02:19.129> we<00:02:19.160> would

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
until we can do 25 then we would

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.180 
until we can do 25 then we would
consider<00:02:20.060> moving<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.840> second<00:02:21.440> set<00:02:21.800> and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
consider moving to a second set and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.940 
consider moving to a second set and
working<00:02:22.640> up<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:23.980> 25<00:02:24.980> more<00:02:25.959> we<00:02:26.959> can<00:02:27.200> adjust<00:02:27.319> the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
working up to 25 more we can adjust the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.690 
working up to 25 more we can adjust the
difficulty<00:02:28.640> factor<00:02:29.450> by<00:02:29.660> how<00:02:29.959> far<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:30.830> pre
