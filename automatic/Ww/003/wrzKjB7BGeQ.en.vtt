far we haven't seen anything that really

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.810 
far we haven't seen anything that really
balances<00:00:33.870> out<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> gameplay<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> make<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.040> at

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
balances out the gameplay to make it at

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.010 
balances out the gameplay to make it at
least<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.270> bit<00:00:36.420> challenging<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
least a little bit challenging for the

player what are you guys doing to
balance<00:00:38.370> out<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.809> well<00:00:39.809> there<00:00:39.930> are

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
balance out out well there are

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.260 
balance out out well there are
countermeasures<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.920> enemy<00:00:41.070> has<00:00:41.370> the

countermeasures that the enemy has the
there's<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> pair<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.590> goggles<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> enemy

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
there's a pair of goggles that the enemy

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.250 
there's a pair of goggles that the enemy
can<00:00:44.399> use<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> players<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.750> careful<00:00:46.170> they

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
can use and the players not careful they

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.750 
can use and the players not careful they
will<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.530> seen<00:00:46.739> even<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.219> they're<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.550> an

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
will get seen even if they're in an

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.000 
will get seen even if they're in an
optical<00:00:48.390> camo<00:00:48.600> also<00:00:49.530> whenever<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> player

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
optical camo also whenever the player

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
optical camo also whenever the player
shoots<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.940> whenever<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:51.270> run<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.750> sprint

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
shoots or whenever they run or sprint

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
shoots or whenever they run or sprint
the<00:00:52.260> break<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.829> optical<00:00:53.160> camo<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the break out of optical camo it is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.639 
the break out of optical camo it is
definitely<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.750> challenge<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> make<00:00:55.350> sure<00:00:55.469> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
definitely a challenge to make sure that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.020 
definitely a challenge to make sure that
that<00:00:55.739> gameplay<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> balanced<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:56.940> do

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that gameplay is balanced but will do

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.520 
that gameplay is balanced but will do
everything<00:00:57.149> possible<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.809> make<00:00:57.899> sure<00:00:58.140> it's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
everything possible to make sure it's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.740 
everything possible to make sure it's
balanced<00:00:59.100> can<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.090> talk<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.570> bit

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
balanced can you talk just a little bit

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
balanced can you talk just a little bit
about<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.109> tech<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.500> they're<00:01:01.649> using<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
about the tech that they're using in the

game yeah we're using our internal

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.440 
game yeah we're using our internal
engine<00:01:04.350> at<00:01:04.530> Ubisoft<00:01:05.070> called<00:01:05.339> Yeti<00:01:05.549> we've<00:01:06.330> had

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
engine at Ubisoft called Yeti we've had

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030 
engine at Ubisoft called Yeti we've had
this<00:01:06.570> technology<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.229> quite<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> while<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
this technology for quite a while so

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
this technology for quite a while so
we're<00:01:08.670> fortunate<00:01:09.000> enough<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:10.229> know

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
developed on that to a point where we

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.160 
developed on that to a point where we
feel<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.360> comfortable<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.080> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
feel really comfortable with it but it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440 
feel really comfortable with it but it
is<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.380> internal<00:01:13.710> engine<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.240> what<00:01:15.240> about

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450

hardware for the military so you know we
use<00:01:31.079> those<00:01:31.229> connections<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:31.979> listen<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> what

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
use those connections we listen to what

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.920 
use those connections we listen to what
they're<00:01:32.640> developing<00:01:33.060> right<00:01:33.240> now<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.479> listen

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
they're developing right now we listen

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
they're developing right now we listen
to<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.170> their<00:01:34.290> opinion<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.770> where<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to what their opinion on where the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
to what their opinion on where the
technology<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.020> makes<00:01:37.200> them

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
technology is going then we makes them

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.230 
technology is going then we makes them
our<00:01:37.439> own

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
our own

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.870 
our own
guesses<00:01:39.079> about<00:01:39.290> where<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.310> technology<00:01:40.490> will

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
guesses about where the technology will

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.480 
guesses about where the technology will
be<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:41.149> 10<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:41.450> 15<00:01:41.570> years<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.619> know<00:01:42.770> everything

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
be in 10 to 15 years you know everything

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.340 
be in 10 to 15 years you know everything
technology-wise<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.479> getting<00:01:44.689> smaller<00:01:44.840> so

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
technology-wise is getting smaller so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.560 
technology-wise is getting smaller so
the<00:01:45.770> optical<00:01:46.159> camo<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.790> one<00:01:47.000> example<00:01:47.149> of<00:01:47.540> that

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
the optical camo is one example of that

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.960 
the optical camo is one example of that
you<00:01:48.049> know<00:01:48.170> nano<00:01:48.740> technology<00:01:49.340> built<00:01:49.610> into<00:01:49.729> the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
you know nano technology built into the

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.730 
you know nano technology built into the
fiber<00:01:50.210> these<00:01:50.450> guys<00:01:50.659> suits<00:01:50.930> allows<00:01:51.439> them<00:01:51.710> to

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
fiber these guys suits allows them to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.460 
fiber these guys suits allows them to
pull<00:01:52.100> off<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.490> optical<00:01:52.909> camera<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:54.140> then

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
pull off the optical camera and then

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.200 
pull off the optical camera and then
everything<00:01:54.920> as<00:01:55.159> far<00:01:55.189> as<00:01:55.399> weapon<00:01:55.729> technology

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
everything as far as weapon technology

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.660 
everything as far as weapon technology
bullet<00:01:56.479> technology<00:01:57.020> again<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.130> somewhat

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
bullet technology again it is somewhat

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.889 
bullet technology again it is somewhat
of<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.789> guess<00:01:58.970> but<00:01:59.149> it<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.360> based<00:01:59.600> in<00:01:59.750> reality

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
of a guess but it is based in reality

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.899 
of a guess but it is based in reality
based<00:02:00.500> off<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.890> contacts<00:02:01.399> that<00:02:01.490> we<00:02:01.549> have<00:02:01.729> with

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
based off the contacts that we have with

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.760 
based off the contacts that we have with
our<00:02:01.939> military<00:02:02.390> organizations<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.679> what

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
our military organizations and what

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.960 
our military organizations and what
about<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.100> vehicles<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.580> game<00:02:04.789> will

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
about the vehicles in the game will

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.060 
about the vehicles in the game will
there<00:02:05.119> be<00:02:05.149> any<00:02:05.330> vehicle<00:02:05.750> sections<00:02:06.140> there<00:02:06.950> will

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
there be any vehicle sections there will

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.460 
there be any vehicle sections there will
be<00:02:07.189> playable<00:02:07.549> non<00:02:08.360> drivable<00:02:08.929> vehicles<00:02:09.319> you

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
be playable non drivable vehicles you

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.140 
be playable non drivable vehicles you
will<00:02:09.590> interact<00:02:09.800> with<00:02:10.130> them<00:02:10.280> there<00:02:11.030> will<00:02:11.120> be

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
will interact with them there will be

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.000 
will interact with them there will be
missions<00:02:11.569> where<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:11.810> have<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.739> some

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
missions where you have to have some

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.259 
missions where you have to have some
sort<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.250> interaction<00:02:13.610> with<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:13.940> can't<00:02:14.150> go

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
sort of interaction with it I can't go

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.520 
sort of interaction with it I can't go
into<00:02:14.299> details<00:02:14.750> about<00:02:14.870> what<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.350> because

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
into details about what it is because

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.620 
into details about what it is because
we're<00:02:15.769> still<00:02:15.830> kind<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.250> developing<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
we're still kind of developing that and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.210 
we're still kind of developing that and
again<00:02:17.900> it's<00:02:18.170> all<00:02:18.260> about<00:02:18.500> balance<00:02:18.709> we<00:02:19.100> don't

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
again it's all about balance we don't

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.280 
again it's all about balance we don't
want<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.400> give<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.580> player<00:02:19.760> too<00:02:20.030> much

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
want to give the player too much

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.390 
want to give the player too much
interaction<00:02:21.290> with<00:02:21.650> vehicles<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.190> makes

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
interaction with vehicles that makes

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.559 
interaction with vehicles that makes
them<00:02:22.549> feel<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:22.819> they're<00:02:22.940> not<00:02:23.090> part<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.390> Ghost

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
them feel like they're not part of Ghost

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.140 
them feel like they're not part of Ghost
Recon<00:02:23.750> anymore<00:02:24.319> so<00:02:24.620> there<00:02:25.519> will<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.730> vehicles

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
Recon anymore so there will be vehicles

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.940 
Recon anymore so there will be vehicles
in<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.510> game<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.140> what<00:02:27.319> level<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.769> player

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
in the game but to what level the player

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.220 
in the game but to what level the player
we<00:02:28.100> interact<00:02:28.430> with<00:02:28.459> them<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.760> still<00:02:28.970> TBD<00:02:29.230> so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
we interact with them is still TBD so

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.190 
we interact with them is still TBD so
the<00:02:30.350> multiplayer<00:02:30.799> first<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:31.670> foremost

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
the multiplayer first and foremost

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.150 
the multiplayer first and foremost
single-player<00:02:33.200> campaign<00:02:33.620> structure<00:02:33.920> will<00:02:34.130> be

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
single-player campaign structure will be

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160 
single-player campaign structure will be
co-opted<00:02:34.580> playable<00:02:35.180> with<00:02:35.330> four<00:02:35.510> players<00:02:35.750> so

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
co-opted playable with four players so

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.150 
co-opted playable with four players so
that's<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.440> biggest<00:02:36.590> thing<00:02:36.769> we're<00:02:36.980> excited

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
that's the biggest thing we're excited

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.949 
that's the biggest thing we're excited
about<00:02:37.459> is<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:38.000> allow<00:02:38.180> three<00:02:38.569> of<00:02:38.690> your<00:02:38.840> friends

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
about is to allow three of your friends

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.770 
about is to allow three of your friends
to<00:02:39.170> play<00:02:39.349> along<00:02:39.590> with<00:02:39.799> you<00:02:39.920> in<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.099> story<00:02:40.370> mode

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
to play along with you in the story mode

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.390 
to play along with you in the story mode
but<00:02:41.780> on<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.989> adversarial<00:02:42.470> side<00:02:42.739> we're<00:02:43.280> going

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
but on the adversarial side we're going

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.580 
but on the adversarial side we're going
to<00:02:43.459> have<00:02:43.579> all<00:02:43.609> the<00:02:43.820> classic<00:02:44.239> ghost<00:02:44.390> recon<00:02:44.660> game

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590

modes we're going to add a few more that

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.750 
modes we're going to add a few more that
we<00:02:47.390> feel<00:02:47.570> are<00:02:47.600> going<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.900> be<00:02:47.989> triple-a<00:02:48.760> because

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
we feel are going to be triple-a because

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.640 
we feel are going to be triple-a because
that<00:02:50.060> really<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.329> where<00:02:50.840> we<00:02:50.989> want<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.200> bring
