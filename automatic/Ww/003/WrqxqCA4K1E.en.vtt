00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
long time like I knew what it meant but

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.859 
long time like I knew what it meant but
I<00:01:53.040> think<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.939> means<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.180> can't<00:01:54.270> die<00:01:54.630> either

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
still I don't know it's still what I

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.359 
still I don't know it's still what I
think<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.780> means<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.930> can't<00:01:58.200> die<00:01:58.350> either<00:01:58.560> but

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
think it means you can't die either but

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.469 
think it means you can't die either but
all<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.030> means<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.299> live

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
all I know is that it means you live
