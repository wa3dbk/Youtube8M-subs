00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.630 
the moment is I think that for young
people<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.450> phrase<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.800> know<00:02:15.920> makes<00:02:16.220> make

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.610 
sense inspires them in some way so I can
relate<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.390> think<00:02:20.750> there's<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.379> point

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620
