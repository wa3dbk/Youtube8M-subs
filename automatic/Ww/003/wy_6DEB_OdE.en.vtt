00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
coming through we have a range of view

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.650 
coming through we have a range of view
finders<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.960> 5<00:00:49.410> inch

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
finders so we have a 5 inch

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.540 
finders so we have a 5 inch
black-and-white<00:00:51.660> viewfinder<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.460> but<00:00:53.460> we

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
black-and-white viewfinder here but we

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.529 
black-and-white viewfinder here but we
also<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.270> 9<00:00:54.570> inch<00:00:54.809> LCD<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.860> well<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> yeah

also have a 9 inch LCD as well so yeah

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.869 
also have a 9 inch LCD as well so yeah
they're<00:00:57.930> interchangeable<00:00:58.230> between<00:00:58.829> our<00:00:59.280> our

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
they're interchangeable between our our

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.760 
they're interchangeable between our our
low<00:01:00.090> end<00:01:00.120> camera<00:01:00.600> heads<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:01.199> well<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> high

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
low end camera heads as well as the high

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.070 
low end camera heads as well as the high
end<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.219> all<00:01:02.370> use<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> same<00:01:02.730> view<00:01:03.660> finders

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
end they all use the same view finders

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.590 
end they all use the same view finders
and<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.890> same<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> remote<00:01:05.610> panels<00:01:06.150> we

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and the same with the remote panels we

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
and the same with the remote panels we
have<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.750> smaller<00:01:07.020> remote<00:01:07.229> panel<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.100> also

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
have a smaller remote panel here we also

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.679 
have a smaller remote panel here we also
can<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> full<00:01:08.939> rate<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> full<00:01:09.510> length

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
can have a full rate a full length

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.580 
can have a full rate a full length
remote<00:01:10.080> panel<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:11.189> joystick<00:01:11.700> or<00:01:11.880> rotary<00:01:12.630> and

remote panel with joystick or rotary and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.940 
remote panel with joystick or rotary and
also<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.700> uses<00:01:15.090> Ethernet

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
also we have one that uses Ethernet

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.620 
also we have one that uses Ethernet
connectivity<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.759> also<00:01:18.150> has<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> touchscreen

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
can buy the head and then you basically

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
can buy the head and then you basically
you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.540> build<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.229> camera<00:01:31.560> system<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you can build up the camera system that

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.289 
you can build up the camera system that
you<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.250> based<00:01:32.579> around<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.000> head<00:01:33.150> that

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
needs I mean this would be the low end

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.469 
needs I mean this would be the low end
one<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.270> entry-level<00:01:40.310> you'll<00:01:41.310> still<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.790> you
