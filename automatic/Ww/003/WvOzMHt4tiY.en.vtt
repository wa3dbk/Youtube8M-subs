just slides into the case okay i take
off<00:02:01.170> eco<00:02:01.560> healed<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.820> slides<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> case

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
off eco healed so it slides in the case

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.090 
off eco healed so it slides in the case
when<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.899> first<00:02:04.170> put<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.590> it'll<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.770> pretty

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
when you first put it on it'll be pretty

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.300 
when you first put it on it'll be pretty
stiff<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.479> doesn't<00:02:09.899> fully<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.860> yet

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
stiff and if it doesn't fully like yet

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.220 
stiff and if it doesn't fully like yet
like<00:02:11.760> directly<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> home<00:02:12.599> button<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.989> had

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
like directly on the home button you had

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.140 
like directly on the home button you had
to<00:02:13.319> hold<00:02:13.560> put<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.030> has

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
to hold put it on like this and it has

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.390 
to hold put it on like this and it has
to<00:02:15.269> slip<00:02:15.510> over<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.840> small<00:02:16.260> little<00:02:16.470> piece<00:02:17.220> I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
to slip over the small little piece I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.300 
to slip over the small little piece I
guess<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.440> back<00:02:19.620> again<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.129> have<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
guess so in the back again you have the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.520 
guess so in the back again you have the
apple<00:02:20.670> logo<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.239> if<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.540> looks<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.900> bit<00:02:22.140> high

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
apple logo and if it looks a bit high

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.000 
apple logo and if it looks a bit high
like<00:02:23.010> mine<00:02:23.330> go<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> top<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.989> move<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.349> down

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
like mine go on the top and move it down

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.940 
like mine go on the top and move it down
just<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.519> bit<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.239> should<00:02:27.390> be<00:02:27.480> perfect<00:02:27.950> okay

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
just a bit and it should be perfect okay

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.430 
just a bit and it should be perfect okay
so<00:02:29.489> here<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.090> case<00:02:30.269> really<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:31.140> nice

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
then here sometimes ipod moves wouldn't

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.509 
then here sometimes ipod moves wouldn't
do<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:12.590> here<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.739> have<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:13.920> covering<00:03:14.459> the
