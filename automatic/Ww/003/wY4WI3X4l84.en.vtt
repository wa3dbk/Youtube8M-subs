the<00:03:15.310> sound<00:03:15.850> different<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.330> we<00:03:16.569> set<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.810> a

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
the sound different so we set it a

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.670 
the sound different so we set it a
little<00:03:16.990> lighter<00:03:17.380> than<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.740> red<00:03:17.920> one<00:03:17.950> right

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.440 

so<00:03:23.160> we<00:03:23.280> got<00:03:23.430> we<00:03:23.670> definitely<00:03:24.030> have<00:03:24.120> more<00:03:24.300> of<00:03:24.360> a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
so we got we definitely have more of a

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.540 
so we got we definitely have more of a
mid-range<00:03:24.750> bomb<00:03:25.110> Pam<00:03:25.380> yeah<00:03:25.680> right<00:03:26.310> now<00:03:26.490> we

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
mid-range bomb Pam yeah right now we

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.640 
mid-range bomb Pam yeah right now we
have<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> highs<00:03:27.209> cut<00:03:27.660> right<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.500> can

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
have a highs cut right you can

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.960 
have a highs cut right you can
definitely<00:03:28.770> hear<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.190> mid-range<00:03:29.400> bump<00:03:29.819> it

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
definitely hear that mid-range bump it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.550 
definitely hear that mid-range bump it
tends<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.240> make<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.480> more<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.930> middle

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
tends to make it more of a middle

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.020 
tends to make it more of a middle
section<00:03:31.860> boost<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.520> almost<00:03:32.730> like<00:03:32.880> you're

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
section boost like almost like you're

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.580 
section boost like almost like you're
boosting<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.420> min<00:03:33.569> on<00:03:33.690> an<00:03:33.780> EQ<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.140> little<00:03:34.380> right

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
boosting the min on an EQ a little right

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.650 
boosting the min on an EQ a little right
which<00:03:34.890> sometimes<00:03:35.550> for<00:03:35.790> solos<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.390> great

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
