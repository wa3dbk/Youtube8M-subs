00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
game probably not the mid-face we saw

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.740

spots that they show every game when
they're<00:05:01.310> behind<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.790> they<00:05:01.940> can<00:05:02.150> come<00:05:02.420> back

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
they're behind that they can come back

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.600 
they're behind that they can come back
that<00:05:02.870> it's<00:05:03.020> still<00:05:03.380> going<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.010> be<00:05:04.100> hard<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.430> take
