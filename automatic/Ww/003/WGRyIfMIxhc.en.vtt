00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.850 
this middle section they're going to be
anchored<00:01:53.390> there<00:01:53.600> they're<00:01:54.290> not<00:01:54.470> going<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.740> then

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
anchored there they're not going to then

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.890 
anchored there they're not going to then
go<00:01:55.070> around<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.460> bracelet<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.120> then<00:01:56.570> we<00:01:56.660> put<00:01:56.870> a

go around the bracelet and then we put a

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.570 
go around the bracelet and then we put a
couple<00:01:57.140> on<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.560> side<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:57.950> bracelet<00:01:58.250> so

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
couple on the side of the bracelet so

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.910 
couple on the side of the bracelet so
they<00:01:58.730> will<00:01:58.940> slide<00:01:59.440> so<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.500> can<00:02:00.620> put<00:02:00.710> them<00:02:00.830> all

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
they will slide so you can put them all

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.250 
they will slide so you can put them all
on<00:02:00.980> the<00:02:01.250> front<00:02:01.490> all<00:02:01.790> on<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.150> outside<00:02:02.260> whatever

together so you're just going to need

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500 
together so you're just going to need
the<00:02:24.920> basic<00:02:25.370> tools<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:26.090> probably

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510

pair of cutters chain nose plier and a
round<00:02:31.520> nose<00:02:31.730> plier<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.480> first<00:02:32.720> let's<00:02:32.990> start<00:02:33.080> by

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
round nose plier so first let's start by

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.600 
round nose plier so first let's start by
making<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.550> little<00:02:34.790> pearl<00:02:35.240> dangles<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.800> I'm

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
making the little pearl dangles so I'm

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.760 
making the little pearl dangles so I'm
going<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.819> put<00:02:38.030> one<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.480> pearls<00:02:38.810> onto<00:02:39.739> a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
going to put one of the pearls onto a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.540 
going to put one of the pearls onto a
head<00:02:40.130> pin<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.550> I'm<00:02:40.940> just<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:42.370> bend<00:02:43.370> my

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
head pin and I'm just going to bend my

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.580 
head pin and I'm just going to bend my
wire<00:02:44.620> grab<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:46.569> make<00:02:47.569> a<00:02:47.600> simple<00:02:48.050> wire<00:02:48.080> loop<00:02:48.410> and

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
wire grab it make a simple wire loop and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.350 
wire grab it make a simple wire loop and
actually<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:48.980> want<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.310> make<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.580> simple<00:02:50.239> wire

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
actually I want to make that simple wire

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.850 
actually I want to make that simple wire
loop<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.720> little<00:02:50.870> bit<00:02:51.080> bigger<00:02:51.350> than<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.680> might

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
loop a little bit bigger than I might

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.229 
loop a little bit bigger than I might
normally<00:02:52.280> because<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.550> want<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.790> attach<00:02:53.000> it

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
normally because I want to attach it

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.580 
normally because I want to attach it
directly<00:02:53.420> on<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:55.070> bangle<00:02:56.440> rotate<00:02:57.440> my

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
directly on to the bangle rotate my

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.800 
directly on to the bangle rotate my
pliers<00:02:59.080> continue<00:03:00.080> pulling<00:03:00.290> that<00:03:00.530> wire<00:03:00.769> around

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
pliers continue pulling that wire around

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.509 
pliers continue pulling that wire around
so<00:03:02.810> I've<00:03:02.870> got<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.080> nice<00:03:03.290> loop<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.870> then<00:03:06.519> snip

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
so I've got a nice loop and then snip

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.240 
so I've got a nice loop and then snip
where<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.269> overlaps<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.860> want<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.100> make

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
where it overlaps and you want to make

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.400 
where it overlaps and you want to make
for<00:03:10.489> this<00:03:10.580> particular<00:03:10.880> kit<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.450> total<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.959> three

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
for this particular kit a total of three

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.070 
for this particular kit a total of three
of<00:03:12.650> these<00:03:13.239> I'm<00:03:14.239> going<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.420> make<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.660> second

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
of these I'm going to make the second

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.400 
of these I'm going to make the second
simple<00:03:15.650> wire<00:03:15.800> loop<00:03:16.750> again<00:03:17.750> making<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.200> little

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
simple wire loop again making a little

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.990 
simple wire loop again making a little
bit<00:03:18.530> bigger<00:03:18.680> than<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:18.980> probably<00:03:19.190> normally

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
bit bigger than I probably normally

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.340 
bit bigger than I probably normally
would<00:03:20.209> just<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.780> make<00:03:20.900> sure<00:03:21.019> it's<00:03:21.170> going<00:03:21.260> to

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
would just to make sure it's going to

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.100 
would just to make sure it's going to
fit<00:03:21.590> around<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:23.690> bangle<00:03:24.110> bracelet<00:03:24.530> wire<00:03:26.110> and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
fit around the bangle bracelet wire and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.199

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
them in the middle just because it does

I'm<00:04:15.829> not<00:04:16.190> going<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.640> attach<00:04:17.150> them<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.870> the

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
I'm not going to attach them to the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.170 
I'm not going to attach them to the
little<00:04:18.919> loops<00:04:19.160> because<00:04:19.609> there's<00:04:19.789> just<00:04:19.880> a

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
little loops because there's just a

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.360 
little loops because there's just a
little<00:04:20.329> bit<00:04:20.450> of<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.630> gap<00:04:20.900> right<00:04:21.169> here<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.680> I

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
little bit of a gap right here and I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.680 
little bit of a gap right here and I
would<00:04:22.520> worry<00:04:22.700> about<00:04:22.760> them<00:04:23.000> falling<00:04:23.210> off<00:04:23.419> now

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
would worry about them falling off now

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.120 
would worry about them falling off now
if<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.020> did<00:04:24.200> want<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.500> attach<00:04:24.770> them<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.039> the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
if you did want to attach them to the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.100 
if you did want to attach them to the
loops<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.580> could<00:04:25.940> just<00:04:26.150> take<00:04:26.360> your<00:04:26.570> chain

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
loops you could just take your chain

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.149 
loops you could just take your chain
nose<00:04:27.260> pliers<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:27.950> just<00:04:28.729> carefully<00:04:29.419> squeeze

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 
nose pliers and just carefully squeeze

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.270 
nose pliers and just carefully squeeze
that<00:04:31.159> shut<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.150> that<00:04:32.180> there's<00:04:32.539> not<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.900> gap

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
that shut so that there's not that gap

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.220 
that shut so that there's not that gap
