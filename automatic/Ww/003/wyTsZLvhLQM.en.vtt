this is really going to work as those
mini<00:01:41.970> vac<00:01:42.119> now<00:01:42.270> coming<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:43.320> coming<00:01:43.680> in

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
mini vac now coming in and now coming in

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.020 
mini vac now coming in and now coming in
then<00:01:43.890> able<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.340> focus<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> lot<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
then able to just focus on a lot of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.730 
then able to just focus on a lot of
these<00:01:45.090> hydrolyses<00:01:45.600> hydrolysed<00:01:46.049> only<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.530> 80

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
these hydrolyses hydrolysed only have 80

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
these hydrolyses hydrolysed only have 80
hit<00:01:46.979> points<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.060> makes<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> much

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
hit points now so that makes it much

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
hit points now so that makes it much
much<00:01:48.899> easier<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.320> those<00:01:49.649> Marauders<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
much easier for those Marauders and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.410 
much easier for those Marauders and
those<00:01:50.490> Marines<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> come<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.360> just

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
those Marines that come in and just

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.490 
those Marines that come in and just
finish<00:01:52.170> them<00:01:52.380> off

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
finish them off

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.160 
finish them off
as<00:01:53.980> what<00:01:54.250> two<00:01:54.460> Marines<00:01:54.910> now<00:01:55.150> have<00:01:55.450> more<00:01:55.720> armor

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
as what two Marines now have more armor

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.070 
as what two Marines now have more armor
