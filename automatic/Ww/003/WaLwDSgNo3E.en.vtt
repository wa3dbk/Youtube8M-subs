easier now now i'm solving the rubik's

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.580 
easier now now i'm solving the rubik's
cube<00:00:13.710> uh<00:00:14.210> and<00:00:15.210> he's<00:00:15.389> gonna<00:00:15.599> probably<00:00:15.960> fail<00:00:16.350> at

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
cube uh and he's gonna probably fail at

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.200 
cube uh and he's gonna probably fail at
cod<00:00:17.930> if<00:00:18.930> you're<00:00:19.140> gonna<00:00:19.230> play<00:00:19.470> cod<00:00:19.890> oh<00:00:20.340> whatever

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210

and we just had sexytime a few minutes
ago<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.939> true<00:00:24.390> story<00:00:25.070> instead<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.099> two

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
ago so true story instead of two

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.550 
ago so true story instead of two
identically<00:00:27.119> looks<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:29.400> um<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.720> actual<00:00:31.260> point

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
identically looks so um the actual point

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.090 
identically looks so um the actual point
