00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.670
 What is the model number? 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.430
 There you know if what I go 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.340

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.520
 mine in the case of rn where I'm going to see this 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.760
 file that his father was already trying to get 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.829
 this one where these files you go 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.170
 use flash tubes that is this 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.170
 program that I 'll leave downloading 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.059
 the inscription here 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.820
 first of all I wanted to show you how it is 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.200
 that is because their site is sometimes 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.060
 half confused 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.780
 for those who do not understand very well or you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 point net and I will leave the registration in a 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.000
 lining 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.000
 Then you will see who download 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.439
 here in the case of windows neither I believe 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.130
 be there you 'll get any 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.439
 these two here is that it is the same 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.520
 only two sites that will host 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.810
 different from what is most legal was 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.369
 download 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.539
 There you will download this one is the flash 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.909
 12 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.170
 then yes you download it's his director 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.240

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.179
 right here says local flash tosi 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.630
 then you will see in this fourth drivers 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:05.950
 I do not know if this is necessary but I did 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.140
 There you go and open the rock annex here. 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.230
 there you choose the model of the device that 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.190
 is never in the case here is the play and inspires 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.900
 play there I'll mark and mark those 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.049
 two last ones here 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.110
 so I have a yard I already have 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:26.139
 I installed it , that's what I did later. 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:32.170
 that which installed the drivers here 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:33.730
 you will see in that folder firmwares this 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.910
 will see that there will not be anything in here 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.430
 I put it here because depending on 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.859
 mine in r 80 case and then I got it 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.650
 I put this file in here. 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.750
 if your flight 800 to r will get this 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.910
 here you will put it inside the folder 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.299
 affirmed the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:03:00.630
 After you 've done this you'll open 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:00.630
 a flash everything ok 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.190

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.900
 have it you click on the flash template radius 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.380

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.150
 placed inside the folder signed the thesis 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.110
 You do not have to move here. 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.110
 click flash 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.110
 There we go and do the following. 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.819
 hold the beck button that the little 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:35.690

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.690
 and will extend the usb cable 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.880
 Then it will appear that it will go 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.830
 complete one will begin to install the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.370
 application so that you have this 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.730
 belly that carries until the end appears 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.580

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.290
 It will take a little bit but it will 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.390
 to function 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.519
 So that's it, people there will be back 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.410

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.610
 in the ginga and close extreme that is a rom 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.799
 best for games 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.169
 I just did not like it because I did not have 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.829
 the tube and I really like video on 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.380
