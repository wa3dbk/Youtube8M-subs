00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
finally it's the Sun in reverse and the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.289 
finally it's the Sun in reverse and the
Sun<00:02:48.389> in<00:02:48.510> reverse<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:50.069> prompt<00:02:50.819> I'm<00:02:50.939> getting

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
Sun in reverse the prompt I'm getting

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.240 
Sun in reverse the prompt I'm getting
for<00:02:51.659> today<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.739> number<00:02:53.069> at<00:02:53.189> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
for today is really the number at the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.020 
for today is really the number at the
top<00:02:53.340> which<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.790> nineteen<00:02:54.500> nineteen<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.799> and

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.849 

what<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.180> sorry<00:03:00.599> I'm<00:03:00.750> stuttering<00:03:01.019> one<00:03:01.650> and

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
what is sorry I'm stuttering one and

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.179 
what is sorry I'm stuttering one and
nine<00:03:01.889> in<00:03:02.459> numerology<00:03:03.150> becomes<00:03:04.019> 10<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.980> then

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
nine in numerology becomes 10 and then

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.649 
nine in numerology becomes 10 and then
10<00:03:05.489> reduces<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.180> 1<00:03:06.389> so<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:09.090> one<00:03:09.329> really

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
10 reduces to 1 so the one really

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.319 
10 reduces to 1 so the one really
represents<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.400> creation<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.090> something

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329

because<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.659> in<00:03:15.810> reverse<00:03:16.199> it<00:03:16.650> means<00:03:17.159> that

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
because it's in reverse it means that

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.319 
because it's in reverse it means that
you<00:03:17.939> don't<00:03:18.239> need<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:19.849> you<00:03:20.849> don't<00:03:21.030> need<00:03:21.180> to
