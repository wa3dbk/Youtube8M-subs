00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.500 
not going for a crazy amount next year
just<00:02:21.520> because<00:02:21.580> i<00:02:21.760> think<00:02:21.970> his<00:02:22.090> card<00:02:22.360> weight

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
just because i think his card weight

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.030 
just because i think his card weight
will<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> little<00:02:22.990> bit<00:02:23.140> higher<00:02:23.350> but<00:02:23.860> he's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
will be a little bit higher but he's

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.530 
will be a little bit higher but he's
definitely<00:02:24.280> going<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.910> player<00:02:25.240> i<00:02:25.270> would

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
definitely going to be a player i would

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.730 
definitely going to be a player i would
like<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.750> try<00:02:25.930> out<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.260> hopefully<00:02:26.440> those

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
like to try out and hopefully those

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.560 
like to try out and hopefully those
stats<00:02:26.980> are<00:02:27.190> correct<00:02:27.580> coming<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.270> at<00:02:28.420> number

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
stats are correct coming in at number

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.690 
stats are correct coming in at number
two<00:02:28.960> now<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.320> was<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.530> tough<00:02:29.800> decision<00:02:29.950> he<00:02:30.580> has

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
two now this was a tough decision he has

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.240 
two now this was a tough decision he has
the<00:02:30.730> same<00:02:31.090> rating<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.690> Falcao<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.710> do<00:02:32.830> rate

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
the same rating as Falcao but I do rate

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.890 
the same rating as Falcao but I do rate
him<00:02:33.430> higher<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.210> robin<00:02:34.660> van<00:02:34.840> persie

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
him higher and that is robin van persie

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.570 
him higher and that is robin van persie
now<00:02:35.740> one<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.010> reason<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.280> rate<00:02:36.460> him<00:02:36.490> higher

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
now one of the reason I rate him higher

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.430 
now one of the reason I rate him higher
as<00:02:36.820> he<00:02:36.940> plays<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.390> Premier<00:02:37.750> League<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.080> in

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
as he plays in the Premier League and in

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.680 
as he plays in the Premier League and in
my<00:02:38.980> opinion<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.640> Premier<00:02:40.150> League<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.480> better

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
my opinion the Premier League is better

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.080 
my opinion the Premier League is better
than<00:02:40.900> la<00:02:41.290> liga<00:02:41.680> or<00:02:41.860> league<00:02:42.130> two<00:02:42.400> or<00:02:42.640> league<00:02:42.880> one

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
than la liga or league two or league one

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.970 
than la liga or league two or league one
will<00:02:43.270> even<00:02:43.300> be<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:43.870> that's<00:02:44.320> why<00:02:44.470> he's<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.740> little

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.700 
will even be so that's why he's a little
bit<00:02:45.070> higher<00:02:45.250> in<00:02:45.490> he<00:02:46.120> scored<00:02:46.480> 39<00:02:46.900> goals<00:02:47.380> in
