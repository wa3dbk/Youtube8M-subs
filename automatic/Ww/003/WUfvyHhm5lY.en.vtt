00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.340
 simulator has conquered the heart of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.139
 various youtuber gamers like by father 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.610
 several other weight names that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.650
 have managed to increase fame even more 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.150
 of this game that obviously unlocked 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 actively playing games 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.800
 that comes with the game category 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.570
 independent of the nerd has several 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.460
 prominent names such as 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.220
 varberg a game you have already several times 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.869
 here by the factor ourselves 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.570
 exactly because it gives an experimentation 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.250
 full gameplay 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.350
 different and original who is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.329
 Usually this usually album almost 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.739
 exclusive in an independent game that the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.870
 large companies usually do not 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.120
 risk to reinvent the gameplay 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.350
 we are played completely weird 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.059
 by blockbusters 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.219
 this risk-free factor is what 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.860
 sometimes we end up being for example 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.960
 facing some genres like fps né 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.789
 the ufrj much more meaning attaches 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.930
 this situation together also 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.390
 exactly because some companies 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.190
 larger ones do not risk 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.260
 to have many people involved in the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.729
 Process is you're messing with a lot 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.320
 money to invest but not here 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.000
 gets to lose completely crazy can 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.080
 to succeed or not and how to game 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.159
 independent is usually more 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.930
 uncompromising 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.360
 we end up seeing some 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.520
 crazy things and more nonsense like that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.439
 arise in this niche and a chance crutch 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.270
 one of the main references Préstimo 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.100
 gameplay is quite a player 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.650
 interesting is that you control all 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.780
 the fingers of the separated hand and the hand itself 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.640
 in it with a height and angle that is the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.070
 your wrist you find him with the mouse 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.229
 What you do is half quotation marks 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.200
 complete control over your surgery he 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.759
 is this game made by the bossa studio and is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.860
 a London company that is made 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.689
 was founded by two Brazilians neco 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.520
 who roberta and henrique who is a couple 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.390
 here from brazil you went there to england 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.369
 huh 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.170
 and there they got the flame pretty 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.270
 Attention with the Simulator 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.950
 and several other young people who also 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.450
 corrected are euros in several 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.579
 very interesting projects 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.350
 it is this creative freedom not 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.750
 only for themes with the main game 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.860
 that is the gameplay is very 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.689
 interesting you see that the market 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.850
 independently has such great intimacy. 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.680
 that this type of innovation is not afraid 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.690
 to risk and often end up being 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.760
 public success and criticism as the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.630
 own John Singleton and it was a great 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.940
 success 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.640

 are much improved since cease 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.630
 very worth to be remembered if you
