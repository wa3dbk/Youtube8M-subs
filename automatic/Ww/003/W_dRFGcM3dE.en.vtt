00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.210
 almost no haircut that is, we remove 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.090
 what now intersects abuts and those 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.060
 which paths all watched need to be 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.239
 very neat whether superfluous it ate light 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.950
 last as event mascara you 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.910
 drew attention to says very 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.510
 brutally cut 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.700
 we will cut but this group does not 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.600
 tolerates scissors so very carefully 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:51.390
 Magnolias form a rock for i who are very 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.000
 neatly you mean here's the second group we 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.460
 we mean to stole pay attention 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.579
 here this spirea cut and here it is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.150
 sperry, I stood density to the little corner and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.180
 we get thin skinny bare 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.240
 so sometimes they want to do 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.720
 up but if the top of the bottom 6 will be 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.210
 shit 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.420
 To this not happened and and now 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.240
 spring landing 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:26.659
 whether they are pruned with shears 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:31.100
 spirea and afraid absolutely no problem then 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.820
 have a favorite forsythia or very often 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.350
 yes 3 UK 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.060
 share 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.310
 and weave 2 and shears her in the fall on 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.630
 spring when it should bloom happens 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.310
 something like this 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.369
 bring down 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.790
 you can meet her when landing is desirable 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.560
 cut it but it must be cut after 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.659
 how is she 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.180
 for god's sake you can even put a ball 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.490
 flowered streamer 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.460
 autumn new large clear example of the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.409
 Blossoms have we cut autumn 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.590
 it blooms on the shoots of the past can 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.830
 if we prune them bloom will 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.280
 but when landing and meanings and in order to 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.890
 the taste was thicker in no shelf 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.840
 something like this form 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.730
 so she gave a strong drop to unhook 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.099
 you need to lay a skeleton now 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.450
 this shrub there is a group of shrubs 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.209
 interesting bubble 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.860
 they are multicolored yellow red 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.720
 green 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.299
 again here in this form when we have it 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.569
 we want to make some voters 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.629
 the ball he grows a high piece from below 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.860
 naked that is has no appearance 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.940
 here from the base begins to grow 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.510
 small victories see if we are now 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.310
 and you shorten who for the fall we already 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.820
 Shrub can be formed 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.360
 create any composition dry again 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.490
 we remove 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.560
 This is from the bubble series. 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.200
 just hum to plant slaughter to stop 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.080
 and he will feel himself in the yard if 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.000
 you have now passed Casper and roughly speaking 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.050
 there for 5 centimeters and he will give land 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.330
 a lot of victory 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.610
 very strong over the summer several times and 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.700
 trim to get a fork 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.250
 as much as possible of such a plan because 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.560
 if you just cut you grow 5 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.820
 higher branches increased in the same note and 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.120
 again he will be no 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.930
 and you need another two or three times in the summer 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.820
 mow again they are from different so 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.040
 which is there gray blooms in spring 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.500
 it should be cut after flowering for 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.140
 Wangutta convicts will flourish those who 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.940
 bloom in summer can be cut in the spring and those 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.459
 that bloom in the spring after flowering 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.410
 can shape any shape perfectly 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:54.980
 plastic plant shorn without 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:04:00.700
 problems all in between I'm hot on her 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:05.150
 you can do one unwillingness shark 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:09.230
 any and this is exactly the culture that 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.540
 the more you cut the better for it 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.470
 react a little bit we are late 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.519
 plan, she has much to dismiss 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.769
 Still, the last haircut is necessary 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.220
 produce year help began to write 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.220
 police 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.820
 two or three haircuts here such a bush you 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.550
 You can get any amount you can 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.070
 make a pillow and you can 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.540
 fantasy 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.020
 the second is one shrub when its 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.230
 lot 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.960
 any curbs without problems smoothly 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.820
 do not give him the power to grow because 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.890
 here is this scheme clearly we gave it 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.009
 shoot and then cut down 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.559
 stays with 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:58.650
 annoy beautiful but once that is here to 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:05:00.630
 preliminary such on the beam 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.970
 everything is aligned if we are there in some kind 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.280
 shrubs becoming intertwined 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.780
 here we just make the outline 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.780
 here from this bush it will turn out 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:18.300
 and here is the moment our roses any our roses i 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:22.139
 I think there are interested in golf that is, well, 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.510
 hard well first of all I draw 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.790
 attention video moisture except beautiful 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.460
 green for anger is thorns 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.500
 it should be removed immediately and as low as possible 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.480
 sometimes it pulls it straight out from under 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.190
 land that is when pruning nuts with 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.919
 let's feed this is not the best 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.230
 painted with a copy taken from Lego thrown 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.540
 normal land from such a plant 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.470
 can be obtained from 2 points of damage 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.790
 a rose I watch that night 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.790
 in the kidney and sawed 1 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.129
 the same the same problem here even 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:58.129
 on the contrary, the zone that you see 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:01.039
 I feel much better than growing up 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:05.449
 gave a number of rose was reborn this period 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:08.569
 promises if dogrose rosehip was allowed to grow 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:11.539
 there is a rule that the parent sound here 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.699
 son son or is there a daughter feeds better 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.039
 so very often jumped to the entrance 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.199
 jason roses misguided can not be given 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:21.159
 develop a dog rose such a case then 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.159
 there is definitely 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.890
 here from this plant turned mouth 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.630
 here the skin seems to be a good heap 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.180
 see for dead can be frozen 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.750
 can any damage mean up 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.360
 living 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:38.030
 once there was a dead twig here because 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.280
 she is a partner 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.980
 cleaned in order to balance to 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.960
 he was about the same size 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.030
 you get like a skeleton, he will give more 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.670
 some years our 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:55.980
 get a rose bush and here's one more for 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.940
 a variety of shrub claims those 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.240
 it blooms on the shoots of last year and 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:05.640
 the better over it the better flowering 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.130
 sometimes though more and more taste of flowers 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.110
 it turns out more size and this 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.449
 paniculata my method is large elongated 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.960
 with average size becomes without 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:16.830
 therefore cut her enough cardinal 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.539
 look 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:23.449
 I leave this is a waste of distraction 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:27.169
 we choose at all 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:27.169
 subtle subject chooses 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:33.699
 to 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.020
 something like that very well he is up to voter 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.100
 the next can grow you leave 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.680
 sciences you must have passed in 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.530
 last year's good killed for those shoots 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.160
 who is there for 35 years they will be together too 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.910
 gives branches 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:56.590
 a month warm listen to their stronger 

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.590
 Now this plant 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.530
 it is normal and flowering burma
