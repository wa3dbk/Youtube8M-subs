note this is a theory in my head and I
am<00:01:12.740> totally<00:01:13.390> against<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:15.110> hope<00:01:15.440> that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
am totally against it and I hope that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.460 
am totally against it and I hope that
King<00:01:15.920> March<00:01:16.130> 3<00:01:16.370> does<00:01:16.610> not<00:01:16.640> end<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.170> or<00:01:18.440> any

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
about to explain now and this theory

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.260 
about to explain now and this theory
makes<00:01:23.720> use<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.110> time<00:01:24.920> travel<00:01:25.430> which<00:01:25.910> you<00:01:26.090> guys

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
makes use of time travel which you guys

the theory and I will give reasons

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.300 
the theory and I will give reasons
afterwards<00:01:35.360> for<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.290> reasons<00:01:36.710> that<00:01:36.830> can<00:01:37.040> work
