we<00:00:06.720> do<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> heart<00:00:07.680> studies<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.189> gorillas

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
we do a heart studies on gorillas

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.709 
we do a heart studies on gorillas
because<00:00:08.820> they<00:00:09.000> are<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.120> lot<00:00:09.269> like<00:00:09.480> people

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
because they are a lot like people

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.080 
because they are a lot like people
physically<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> same<00:00:10.740> thing<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
physically the same thing that is the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.850 
physically the same thing that is the
number<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.420> cause<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.690> death<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.290> humans<00:00:13.679> it's

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
number one cause of death in humans it's

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.740 
number one cause of death in humans it's
the<00:00:13.950> same<00:00:14.190> number<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:15.000> cause<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.269> death<00:00:15.570> in

the same number one cause of death in

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.900 
the same number one cause of death in
gorillas<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.859> benefit<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.490> being

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
gorillas so we have the benefit of being

here<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> zoo<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> help<00:00:34.410> us<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.130> know

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
here at the zoo to help us out you know

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.780 
here at the zoo to help us out you know
first<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.450> attended<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.500> meeting<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> zoo

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
first I attended a meeting at the zoo

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
first I attended a meeting at the zoo
and<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.480> look<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> equipment<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.620> have

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and a look at the equipment they have

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.970 
and a look at the equipment they have
and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:42.149> decided<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.559> quality<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
and I decided that the quality of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400 
and I decided that the quality of
equipment<00:00:44.520> may<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.390> sufficient<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
equipment may not be sufficient to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.790 
equipment may not be sufficient to
perform<00:00:47.600> in-depth<00:00:48.600> study<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> would<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.620> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
perform in-depth study I would like to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.090 
perform in-depth study I would like to
see<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> new<00:00:51.149> machines<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:52.050> can

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
see with the new machines we can

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.580 
see with the new machines we can
evaluate<00:00:53.629> stiffness<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> heart<00:00:55.170> muscle

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
evaluate stiffness of a heart muscle

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.950 
evaluate stiffness of a heart muscle
which<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.039> could<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:56.460> assess<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.480> portable

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
which we could not assess with portable

which we could not assess with portable
ultrasound<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:59.250> only<00:00:59.550> did<00:00:59.730> he<00:00:59.879> supply<00:01:00.270> us

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
ultrasound not only did he supply us

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
ultrasound not only did he supply us
with<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.750> cardiac<00:01:01.500> ultrasound<00:01:01.850> technician

ultrasound machine has protocols that we
could<00:01:28.930> develop<00:01:29.259> for<00:01:29.789> gorillas<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:30.969> so<00:01:31.149> forth

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
could develop for gorillas and so forth

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.749

which<00:01:31.659> mimics<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.469> human<00:01:32.950> heart<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.549> they

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
which mimics the human heart and they

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.539 
which mimics the human heart and they
loaned<00:01:34.060> us<00:01:34.270> one<00:01:34.539> of<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.719> most<00:01:34.929> high-tech

was quite unique experience for me to

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.169 
was quite unique experience for me to
view<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.770> gorilla<00:01:42.069> be<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:42.369> heaven<00:01:42.939> it's

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179

ultrasound<00:01:43.659> performed<00:01:44.409> today<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.460> was<00:01:45.670> very

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
ultrasound performed today it was very

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.240 
ultrasound performed today it was very
overwhelming<00:01:46.420> actually<00:01:46.899> I<00:01:47.079> didn't<00:01:47.860> ever

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
overwhelming actually I didn't ever

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.859 
overwhelming actually I didn't ever
think<00:01:48.369> that<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.880> could<00:01:48.969> be<00:01:49.090> possible<00:01:49.539> for<00:01:49.750> them

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
think that it could be possible for them

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.630 
think that it could be possible for them
to<00:01:49.929> be<00:01:50.110> trained<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.770> just<00:01:50.979> stand<00:01:51.189> against<00:01:51.520> a
