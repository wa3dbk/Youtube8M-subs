00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.110
 welcome to vecchia moda the video of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.850
 today it is aimed at the male audience and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.580
 in particular to the rules that you have to 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.170
 follow when dressing on label 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.640
 in the case of women it is much more 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.770
 simple since you do not have to follow 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.930
 specific rules however the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.250
 men do they have to stick to certain 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.250
 rules almost verbatim 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.290
 ah 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.020
 There are three garments that make up the 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.529
 male tag the morning coat the tuxedo 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.529
 and the frac 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 First of all, the morning coat is the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 clothing that we will use to 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.940

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.950

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.350

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.570
