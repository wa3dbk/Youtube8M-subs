welcome<00:00:05.650> to<00:00:05.860> this<00:00:05.980> lesson<00:00:06.250> on<00:00:06.900> how<00:00:07.900> to<00:00:07.930> round

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
welcome to this lesson on how to round

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.220 
welcome to this lesson on how to round
decimal<00:00:10.150> numbers<00:00:10.450> to<00:00:10.660> the<00:00:10.780> nearest<00:00:11.049> whole

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
decimal numbers to the nearest whole

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.770 
decimal numbers to the nearest whole
number<00:00:11.290> and<00:00:11.770> in<00:00:12.340> this<00:00:12.700> first<00:00:13.000> example<00:00:13.180> I'm

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
number and in this first example I'm

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.710 
number and in this first example I'm
going<00:00:13.959> to<00:00:14.110> round<00:00:14.350> twenty<00:00:15.160> four<00:00:15.400> point<00:00:15.670> five<00:00:15.969> to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
going to round twenty four point five to

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.330 
going to round twenty four point five to
the<00:00:16.750> nearest<00:00:17.110> whole<00:00:17.320> number<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.190> way<00:00:18.280> you

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
the nearest whole number and the way you

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.880 
the nearest whole number and the way you
do<00:00:18.580> it<00:00:18.730> is<00:00:19.090> you<00:00:19.449> need<00:00:20.259> to<00:00:20.289> know<00:00:20.529> which<00:00:20.679> of<00:00:20.740> the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
do it is you need to know which of the

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.380 
do it is you need to know which of the
whole<00:00:21.070> numbers<00:00:21.400> first<00:00:21.429> of<00:00:21.820> all<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.240> they're

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
whole numbers first of all and they're

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.259 
whole numbers first of all and they're
always<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:23.339> numbers<00:00:24.339> that<00:00:24.490> are<00:00:24.609> on<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:24.939> left

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
always the numbers that are on the left

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.109 
always the numbers that are on the left
of<00:00:25.480> this<00:00:25.929> point<00:00:26.230> decimal<00:00:26.830> point<00:00:27.279> and<00:00:27.490> the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
of this point decimal point and the

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.450 
of this point decimal point and the
decimal<00:00:28.330> part<00:00:28.720> of<00:00:28.929> this<00:00:29.080> decimal<00:00:29.980> number<00:00:30.310> or

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
decimal part of this decimal number or

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.110 
decimal part of this decimal number or
the<00:00:31.240> decimal<00:00:31.689> numbers<00:00:32.020> are<00:00:32.520> numbers<00:00:33.520> that<00:00:33.730> are

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
the decimal numbers are numbers that are

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.440 
the decimal numbers are numbers that are
on<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.570> right<00:00:35.020> of<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.770> point<00:00:35.980> so<00:00:36.490> to<00:00:37.270> round

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
on the right of the point so to round

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.940 
on the right of the point so to round
this<00:00:37.660> to<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.870> nearest<00:00:37.960> whole<00:00:38.350> number<00:00:38.410> means

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
this to the nearest whole number means

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.470 
this to the nearest whole number means
I've<00:00:39.160> got<00:00:39.310> to<00:00:39.340> get<00:00:39.520> rid<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.940> point<00:00:40.240> and

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
I've got to get rid of that point and

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.440 
I've got to get rid of that point and
that<00:00:40.930> five<00:00:41.260> after<00:00:42.250> deciding<00:00:42.910> whether<00:00:43.270> to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
that five after deciding whether to

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.390 
that five after deciding whether to
round<00:00:43.660> that<00:00:43.810> four<00:00:44.110> up<00:00:44.380> or<00:00:44.650> keep<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.280> same

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
round that four up or keep it the same

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.790 
round that four up or keep it the same
and<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:46.180> way<00:00:46.300> you<00:00:46.360> decide<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:46.960> is<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:47.620> look

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
and the way you decide that is you look

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.890 
and the way you decide that is you look
at<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.010> next<00:00:48.220> number<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.150> right<00:00:49.180> of<00:00:49.480> that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
at the next number to the right of that

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.770 
at the next number to the right of that
four<00:00:50.290> which<00:00:50.950> is<00:00:50.980> this<00:00:51.310> five<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.970> if<00:00:52.570> this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
four which is this five and if this

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.130 
four which is this five and if this
number<00:00:53.050> is<00:00:53.260> if<00:00:53.740> the<00:00:54.460> number<00:00:54.580> on<00:00:54.910> its<00:00:55.060> right<00:00:55.360> is

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
number is if the number on its right is

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.100 
number is if the number on its right is
a<00:00:56.530> five<00:00:56.920> or<00:00:57.100> more<00:00:57.310> which<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:57.880> is<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.900> means

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
a five or more which it is that means

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.740 
a five or more which it is that means
you<00:00:59.290> round<00:00:59.530> that<00:00:59.650> four<00:00:59.980> up<00:01:00.280> one<00:01:00.730> and<00:01:01.000> really

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
you round that four up one and really

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.970 
you round that four up one and really
what<00:01:01.900> you're<00:01:01.990> doing<00:01:02.050> is<00:01:02.320> you're<00:01:02.470> just<00:01:02.590> adding

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
what you're doing is you're just adding

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.100 
what you're doing is you're just adding
one<00:01:03.220> to<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.730> number<00:01:03.850> twenty-four<00:01:04.570> which

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
one to the number twenty-four which

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.190 
one to the number twenty-four which
would<00:01:05.290> make<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.680> 25<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.750> nearest<00:01:07.869> whole

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
would make it 25 so to the nearest whole

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320 
would make it 25 so to the nearest whole
number<00:01:08.230> twenty-four<00:01:09.130> point<00:01:09.430> five<00:01:09.730> is<00:01:10.150> equal

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
number twenty-four point five is equal

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.100 
number twenty-four point five is equal
to<00:01:10.630> 25<00:01:11.170> in<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.610> second<00:01:13.000> example<00:01:13.150> I'm<00:01:13.750> going<00:01:13.960> to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
to 25 in the second example I'm going to

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.310 
to 25 in the second example I'm going to
use<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.620> same<00:01:14.860> number<00:01:15.430> or<00:01:16.000> nearly<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:16.990> same

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
use the same number or nearly the same

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.620 
use the same number or nearly the same
number<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:17.830> I'm<00:01:17.950> going<00:01:17.980> to<00:01:18.160> do<00:01:18.940> this<00:01:19.360> one

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
number and I'm going to do this one

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.210 
number and I'm going to do this one
because<00:01:19.990> sometimes<00:01:20.380> students<00:01:20.830> think<00:01:20.920> we'll

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
because sometimes students think we'll

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.250 
because sometimes students think we'll
does<00:01:21.400> this<00:01:21.520> nine<00:01:21.790> affect<00:01:22.240> whether<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.900> round

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
does this nine affect whether I round

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.590 
does this nine affect whether I round
that<00:01:23.350> for<00:01:23.800> up<00:01:23.980> or<00:01:24.159> not<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:24.909> I'm<00:01:25.000> still<00:01:25.270> rounding

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
that for up or not so I'm still rounding

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.760 
that for up or not so I'm still rounding
this<00:01:25.720> number<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.200> nearest<00:01:26.409> whole<00:01:26.710> number

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
this number to the nearest whole number

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.610 
this number to the nearest whole number
and<00:01:27.480> that<00:01:28.480> means<00:01:28.750> I've<00:01:29.050> got<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.290> look<00:01:29.380> at<00:01:29.500> this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
and that means I've got to look at this

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.280 
and that means I've got to look at this
four<00:01:29.980> and<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.580> number<00:01:30.909> on<00:01:31.060> its<00:01:31.210> right<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.690> the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
four and the number on its right is the

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.350 
four and the number on its right is the
only<00:01:32.470> one<00:01:32.740> that's<00:01:32.890> important<00:01:33.550> any<00:01:33.760> numbers

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
only one that's important any numbers

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.290 
only one that's important any numbers
that<00:01:34.479> come<00:01:34.659> after<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.140> number<00:01:35.620> that<00:01:35.830> I'm

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
that come after that number that I'm

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.540 
that come after that number that I'm
looking<00:01:37.300> at<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:38.110> decide<00:01:38.290> whether<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.220> round

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
looking at to decide whether to round

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.760 
looking at to decide whether to round
that<00:01:39.670> up<00:01:39.700> or<00:01:39.970> not<00:01:40.120> don't<00:01:40.810> matter<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:41.470> doesn't

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
that up or not don't matter so doesn't

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.590 
that up or not don't matter so doesn't
matter<00:01:41.950> what<00:01:42.250> any<00:01:42.520> numbers<00:01:42.880> after<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.210> for

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
matter what any numbers after that for

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.170 
matter what any numbers after that for
our<00:01:43.830> it's<00:01:44.830> only<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.190> four<00:01:45.430> that's<00:01:45.610> important

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
our it's only the four that's important

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.010 
our it's only the four that's important
so<00:01:47.070> again<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.850> number<00:01:49.150> on<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.420> right<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.780> this

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
so again the number on the right of this

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.780 
so again the number on the right of this
four<00:01:50.350> which<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:51.010> one<00:01:51.159> that<00:01:51.310> unlike<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
four which is the one that unlike the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.910 
four which is the one that unlike the
rounding<00:01:52.180> up<00:01:52.299> or<00:01:52.450> keeping<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.930> same<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
rounding up or keeping the same the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.039 
rounding up or keeping the same the
number<00:01:54.250> on<00:01:54.400> its<00:01:54.549> right<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.390> 4<00:01:55.720> and

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
number on its right is this 4 and

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.590 
number on its right is this 4 and
because<00:01:56.590> it's<00:01:56.770> not<00:01:57.010> five<00:01:57.370> or<00:01:57.670> more<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.360> means

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
because it's not five or more that means

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.810 
because it's not five or more that means
I<00:01:58.750> don't<00:01:58.810> round<00:01:59.260> that<00:01:59.440> four<00:01:59.710> up<00:01:59.950> or<00:02:00.190> down<00:02:00.580> it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
I don't round that four up or down it

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.969 
I don't round that four up or down it
just<00:02:01.150> stays<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.570> same<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.260> so<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
just stays the same and so to the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.120 
just stays the same and so to the
nearest<00:02:03.280> whole<00:02:03.460> number<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:04.630> number<00:02:05.380> 24

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
nearest whole number that number 24

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.469 
nearest whole number that number 24
point<00:02:06.430> four<00:02:06.670> nine<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:07.240> equal<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.259> 24<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:10.060> in

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
point four nine is equal to 24 so in

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.300 
point four nine is equal to 24 so in
example<00:02:10.840> three<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.290> want<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.739> round<00:02:11.920> this

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
example three I want to round this

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.390 
example three I want to round this
number<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.879> nearest<00:02:13.120> whole<00:02:13.450> number<00:02:13.480> and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
number to the nearest whole number and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.559 
number to the nearest whole number and
this<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.549> where<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.819> can<00:02:15.939> get<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.209> little<00:02:16.450> bit

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
this is where it can get a little bit

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.040 
this is where it can get a little bit
tricky<00:02:16.930> so

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
tricky so

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.130 
tricky so
again<00:02:18.290> whole<00:02:19.130> number<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.660> nearest<00:02:20.780> whole

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
again whole number to the nearest whole

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.630 
again whole number to the nearest whole
number<00:02:21.170> means<00:02:21.770> I<00:02:21.950> need<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.190> look<00:02:22.400> at<00:02:22.520> this

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
number means I need to look at this

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.310 
number means I need to look at this
number<00:02:23.000> again<00:02:23.240> which<00:02:23.570> is<00:02:23.720> in<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.990> unit's

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
number again which is in the unit's

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.310 
number again which is in the unit's
column<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.760> number<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.270> its<00:02:26.570> right<00:02:26.990> is<00:02:27.290> a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
column and the number on its right is a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.040 
column and the number on its right is a
nine<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.400> because<00:02:28.820> that<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:29.270> five<00:02:29.660> or<00:02:29.690> more

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
nine so because that is five or more

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.590 
nine so because that is five or more
that<00:02:30.440> means<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.860> have<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.190> round<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.730> nine<00:02:32.270> up

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
that means I have to round this nine up

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.080 
that means I have to round this nine up
one<00:02:32.960> so<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:34.010> would<00:02:34.100> actually<00:02:34.130> become<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.730> ten

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
one so it would actually become a ten

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.530 
one so it would actually become a ten
and<00:02:35.390> really<00:02:36.350> what<00:02:36.470> I'm<00:02:36.590> doing<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.010> I'm<00:02:37.160> going

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and really what I'm doing is I'm going

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.230 
and really what I'm doing is I'm going
29<00:02:38.540> plus<00:02:39.140> one<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:40.610> know<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.910> answer<00:02:41.150> to

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
29 plus one and you know the answer to

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.600 
29 plus one and you know the answer to
that<00:02:41.270> so<00:02:41.900> nine<00:02:42.140> plus<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.680> ten<00:02:42.890> put<00:02:43.460> down

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
that so nine plus one is ten put down

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.020 
that so nine plus one is ten put down
the<00:02:43.760> zero<00:02:44.030> carry<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.540> 1<00:02:44.780> 2<00:02:45.080> plus<00:02:45.320> 1<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.770> 3<00:02:46.030> so

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
the zero carry the 1 2 plus 1 is 3 so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.290 
the zero carry the 1 2 plus 1 is 3 so
this<00:02:47.060> would<00:02:47.450> be<00:02:47.660> 30<00:02:48.460> so<00:02:49.460> another<00:02:49.700> way<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:50.120> doing

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
this would be 30 so another way of doing

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.450 
this would be 30 so another way of doing
that<00:02:50.510> would<00:02:50.660> be<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.500> say<00:02:51.710> well<00:02:52.040> what's<00:02:52.310> the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
that would be to to say well what's the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.550 
that would be to to say well what's the
next<00:02:52.640> number<00:02:52.880> after<00:02:53.150> 29<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.140> next<00:02:54.410> whole

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
next number after 29 the next whole

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.650 
next number after 29 the next whole
number<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.160> would<00:02:55.250> be<00:02:55.400> 30<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.480> that

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
number and that would be 30 so that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.140 
number and that would be 30 so that
would<00:02:56.780> be<00:02:56.930> another<00:02:57.380> way<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.740> rounding<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.820> 9

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
would be another way of rounding that 9

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.270 
would be another way of rounding that 9
up<00:02:59.360> 1<00:02:59.600> just<00:02:59.990> looking<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.560> next<00:03:00.830> whole

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
up 1 just looking for the next whole

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.100 
up 1 just looking for the next whole
number<00:03:01.310> after<00:03:02.210> 29<00:03:02.960> so<00:03:03.760> 29.99<00:03:04.930> rounded<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.080> the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
number after 29 so 29.99 rounded to the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.770 
number after 29 so 29.99 rounded to the
nearest<00:03:06.200> whole<00:03:06.590> number<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.880> number<00:03:08.150> 30<00:03:08.390> in

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
nearest whole number is the number 30 in

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.070 
nearest whole number is the number 30 in
this<00:03:09.410> last<00:03:09.770> example<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.610> want<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.690> round<00:03:11.960> this

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
this last example I want to round this

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.070 
this last example I want to round this
to<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.440> nearest<00:03:12.740> whole<00:03:13.130> number<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:14.080> once

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
to the nearest whole number and once

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.960 
to the nearest whole number and once
again<00:03:15.260> looking<00:03:15.890> at<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.160> number<00:03:16.460> in<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
again looking at the number in the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.660 
again looking at the number in the
unit's<00:03:17.360> column<00:03:17.540> which<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.050> this<00:03:18.200> 9<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.340> number

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
unit's column which is this 9 the number

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.990 
unit's column which is this 9 the number
on<00:03:19.850> its<00:03:20.210> right<00:03:20.720> is<00:03:21.020> this<00:03:21.260> 8<00:03:21.500> which<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.130> 5<00:03:22.970> or

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
on its right is this 8 which is 5 or

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.510 
on its right is this 8 which is 5 or
more<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.690> means<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:24.050> have<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.410> round<00:03:25.280> that

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
more so that means I have to round that

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.320 
more so that means I have to round that
9<00:03:25.820> up<00:03:26.000> one<00:03:26.270> so<00:03:27.520> what<00:03:28.520> I'm<00:03:28.640> really<00:03:28.820> doing<00:03:28.940> is

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
9 up one so what I'm really doing is

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.070 
9 up one so what I'm really doing is
adding<00:03:29.360> 1<00:03:30.050> to<00:03:30.470> 4<00:03:30.709> thousand<00:03:31.300> 799<00:03:32.300> which<00:03:32.870> would

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
adding 1 to 4 thousand 799 which would

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.199 
adding 1 to 4 thousand 799 which would
be<00:03:34.239> 4,800<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.920> then<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.520> if<00:03:37.670> you're<00:03:37.790> not<00:03:37.880> sure

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
be 4,800 and then so if you're not sure

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.360 
be 4,800 and then so if you're not sure
what<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.690> number<00:03:39.050> becomes<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.620> can<00:03:39.739> always<00:03:39.950> do

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
what a number becomes you can always do

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.790 
what a number becomes you can always do
like<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.270> did<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.660> last<00:03:41.690> example<00:03:42.020> set<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.709> up

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
like I did in the last example set it up

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.010 
like I did in the last example set it up
like<00:03:42.830> this<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.489> just<00:03:43.550> add<00:03:43.850> one<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.330> it<00:03:44.360> 9<00:03:44.750> plus

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
like this and just add one to it 9 plus

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.699 
like this and just add one to it 9 plus
1<00:03:45.200> is<00:03:45.260> 10

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
1 is 10

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.550 
1 is 10
put<00:03:46.070> down<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.400> zero<00:03:46.670> carry<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.239> 1<00:03:47.450> 9<00:03:48.110> plus<00:03:48.380> 1

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
put down the zero carry the 1 9 plus 1

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.120 
put down the zero carry the 1 9 plus 1
is<00:03:48.620> 10

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
is 10

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.210 
is 10
put<00:03:49.700> down<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.000> zero<00:03:50.270> carry<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.780> 1<00:03:51.020> 7<00:03:51.890> plus<00:03:52.190> 1

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
put down the zero carry the 1 7 plus 1

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.760 
put down the zero carry the 1 7 plus 1
is<00:03:52.430> 8<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.090> then<00:03:53.510> 4<00:03:53.810> plus<00:03:53.840> nothing<00:03:54.440> is<00:03:54.560> nothing

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
is 8 and then 4 plus nothing is nothing

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.600 
is 8 and then 4 plus nothing is nothing
and<00:03:55.360> that's<00:03:56.360> another<00:03:56.660> way<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:57.459> rounding<00:03:58.459> this

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
and that's another way of rounding this

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.390 
and that's another way of rounding this
up<00:03:58.850> one<00:03:59.330> so<00:03:59.900> some<00:04:00.410> key<00:04:00.709> things<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.190> need<00:04:01.370> to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
up one so some key things you need to

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.300 
up one so some key things you need to
remember<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:02.750> whole<00:04:02.989> numbers<00:04:03.380> are<00:04:03.709> always

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
remember the whole numbers are always

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.160 
remember the whole numbers are always
the<00:04:04.670> numbers<00:04:04.970> on<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.270> left<00:04:05.570> of<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.959> decimal

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
the numbers on the left of the decimal

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.610 
the numbers on the left of the decimal
point<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.550> decimal<00:04:07.760> numbers<00:04:08.480> are<00:04:08.840> the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
point and the decimal numbers are the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.580 
point and the decimal numbers are the
numbers<00:04:09.650> on<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.250> right<00:04:10.670> of<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.720> decimal

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
numbers on the right of the decimal

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.210 
numbers on the right of the decimal
point<00:04:12.910> this<00:04:13.910> number<00:04:14.420> immediately<00:04:14.840> before<00:04:15.739> or

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
point this number immediately before or

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.890 
point this number immediately before or
immediately<00:04:16.459> on<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.180> left<00:04:17.390> of<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.630> point

immediately on the left of the point

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.840 
immediately on the left of the point
that<00:04:18.109> is<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.620> units<00:04:19.040> column<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.580> when<00:04:19.700> you're

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
that is the units column and when you're

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.880 
that is the units column and when you're
rounding<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.450> decimal<00:04:20.870> number<00:04:20.930> to<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.680> nearest

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
rounding a decimal number to the nearest

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.720 
rounding a decimal number to the nearest
whole<00:04:22.190> number

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
whole number

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.820 
whole number
you<00:04:23.000> need<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.300> focus<00:04:23.540> on<00:04:23.900> this<00:04:24.110> number<00:04:24.500> in<00:04:24.680> the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
you need to focus on this number in the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.830 
you need to focus on this number in the
unit's<00:04:25.130> column<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.730> then<00:04:26.360> you're<00:04:26.720> looking

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
unit's column and then you're looking

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.159 
unit's column and then you're looking
for<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.380> number<00:04:27.530> on<00:04:27.860> its<00:04:28.460> right<00:04:28.880> if<00:04:29.330> it's<00:04:29.660> 5<00:04:29.930> or

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
for the number on its right if it's 5 or

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.930 
for the number on its right if it's 5 or
more<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:30.740> round<00:04:31.070> this<00:04:31.220> up<00:04:31.400> 1

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
more you round this up 1

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.580 
more you round this up 1
if<00:04:32.090> this<00:04:32.720> number<00:04:32.930> is<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.500> 0<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.430> 1<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:35.000> 2<00:04:35.060> or<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.990> 3<00:04:36.020> or

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
if this number is a 0 a 1 a 2 or a 3 or

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.900 
if this number is a 0 a 1 a 2 or a 3 or
a<00:04:36.650> 4<00:04:36.920> then<00:04:37.790> that<00:04:38.270> number<00:04:38.450> stays<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.140> same<00:04:39.170> and

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
a 4 then that number stays the same and

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.640 
a 4 then that number stays the same and
that's<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.210> information<00:04:41.450> you<00:04:41.870> need<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.560> be

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
that's the information you need to be

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.300 
that's the information you need to be
able<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.890> round<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.660> decimal<00:04:44.660> number<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:45.680> the

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
able to round a decimal number to the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.820 
able to round a decimal number to the
nearest<00:04:46.640> whole<00:04:46.820> number<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.480> that's<00:04:48.410> about<00:04:48.680> it

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
nearest whole number so that's about it

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.130 
nearest whole number so that's about it
for<00:04:48.980> this<00:04:49.160> lesson<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:50.210> will<00:04:50.450> see<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:50.870> in
