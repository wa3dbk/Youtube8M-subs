master basically will be separating
these<00:00:08.760> up<00:00:08.910> into<00:00:09.030> three<00:00:09.300> segments<00:00:09.780> about<00:00:09.900> one

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
these up into three segments about one

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.560 
these up into three segments about one
about<00:00:10.769> combos<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.400> include<00:00:11.880> Shockmaster

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
about combos that include Shockmaster

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.829 
about combos that include Shockmaster
two<00:00:13.500> combos<00:00:14.099> which<00:00:14.370> otk<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.540> produce

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
two combos which otk and just produce

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.470 
two combos which otk and just produce
big<00:00:16.049> fields<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.650> three<00:00:17.640> hand<00:00:18.150> looping

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
big fields and three hand looping

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.910 
big fields and three hand looping
because<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.199> still<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.439> handily<00:00:19.740> thing

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
because that can still do handily thing

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.160 
because that can still do handily thing
so<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.850> figured<00:00:21.210> let's<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:21.779> get<00:00:22.020> straight

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
so I figured let's just get straight

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
so I figured let's just get straight
