00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.550 
can work out the procedure of cutting
for<00:05:31.850> themselves<00:05:33.640> so<00:05:34.640> we'll<00:05:34.760> do<00:05:34.880> it<00:05:34.910> from<00:05:35.560> left

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
for themselves so we'll do it from left

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.060 
for themselves so we'll do it from left
from<00:05:37.490> line<00:05:37.700> one<00:05:37.940> just<00:05:38.750> to<00:05:38.810> show<00:05:38.870> you<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.320> pitch

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
from line one just to show you the pitch

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.740 
from line one just to show you the pitch
lines<00:05:40.400> I'll<00:05:40.910> call<00:05:41.900> these<00:05:42.080> segments<00:05:42.860> or<00:05:43.070> clicks

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
lines I'll call these segments or clicks

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.870 
lines I'll call these segments or clicks
one<00:05:44.750> two<00:05:46.900> three<00:05:47.900> and<00:05:48.200> four<00:05:49.220> we<00:05:49.669> walked

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
one two three and four we walked

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.029 
one two three and four we walked
backwards<00:05:50.120> there<00:05:50.510> because<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:51.800> left<00:05:51.979> hand

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
backwards there because the left hand

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.460 
backwards there because the left hand
twisting<00:05:52.490> there's<00:05:52.669> your<00:05:52.820> pitch<00:05:53.320> there's<00:05:54.320> your

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
twisting there's your pitch there's your

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.719 
twisting there's your pitch there's your
pitch<00:05:54.620> from<00:05:54.770> there<00:05:54.950> to<00:05:55.070> there<00:05:55.160> all<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.610> way

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
pitch from there to there all the way

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.909 
pitch from there to there all the way
around<00:05:55.910> a<00:05:56.030> piece<00:05:56.180> of<00:05:56.330> wood<00:05:56.450> but<00:05:57.350> we<00:05:57.530> intend<00:05:57.860> to

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
around a piece of wood but we intend to

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.070 
around a piece of wood but we intend to
cut<00:05:58.130> this<00:05:58.310> one<00:05:58.630> from<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:01.610> right<00:06:01.820> so<00:06:02.539> do<00:06:02.720> it<00:06:02.810> one

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
cut this one from the right so do it one

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.830 
cut this one from the right so do it one
all<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.250> way<00:06:04.340> down

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
all the way down

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.159 
all the way down
that's<00:06:05.840> one<00:06:06.140> pitch<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:08.270> second<00:06:08.690> pitch<00:06:08.900> line

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
that's one pitch the second pitch line

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.560 
that's one pitch the second pitch line
will<00:06:09.380> run<00:06:09.590> parallel<00:06:09.830> to<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.310> first<00:06:10.490> one<00:06:10.760> as

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
will run parallel to the first one as

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.520 
will run parallel to the first one as
you<00:06:12.050> can<00:06:12.200> see<00:06:12.440> we'll<00:06:13.220> go<00:06:13.310> all<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:14.000> way<00:06:14.030> down<00:06:14.530> to

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
you can see we'll go all the way down to

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.000 
you can see we'll go all the way down to
the<00:06:15.620> very<00:06:15.740> bottom<00:06:15.890> with<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.640> four<00:06:16.910> pitches

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
the very bottom with the four pitches

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.130 
the very bottom with the four pitches
and<00:06:19.010> we<00:06:19.100> should<00:06:19.340> end<00:06:19.550> up<00:06:19.700> on<00:06:20.000> line<00:06:20.539> one<00:06:20.840> which

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
and we should end up on line one which

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
and we should end up on line one which
makes<00:06:21.410> it<00:06:21.530> a<00:06:21.650> true<00:06:21.919> twist<00:06:22.780> there<00:06:23.780> well<00:06:24.160> line

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
makes it a true twist there well line

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.570 
makes it a true twist there well line
one

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
one

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.820 
one
one<00:06:26.090> two<00:06:26.419> three<00:06:26.720> four<00:06:26.990> pitches<00:06:27.260> which<00:06:27.680> is<00:06:27.800> a

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
one two three four pitches which is a

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.920 
one two three four pitches which is a
true<00:06:28.100> twist<00:06:29.080> now<00:06:30.080> that's<00:06:30.410> the<00:06:30.590> marking<00:06:31.039> out

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
true twist now that's the marking out

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.440 
true twist now that's the marking out
but<00:06:32.930> what<00:06:33.080> I<00:06:33.110> will<00:06:33.229> do<00:06:33.560> on<00:06:33.800> this<00:06:34.370> clip<00:06:34.669> is<00:06:34.789> also

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
but what I will do on this clip is also

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.740 
but what I will do on this clip is also
add

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
add

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.580 
add
a<00:06:36.780> little<00:06:37.740> salt<00:06:38.010> cotton<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:40.080> is<00:06:40.140> for<00:06:40.500> the

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
a little salt cotton this is for the

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.310 
a little salt cotton this is for the
next<00:06:40.920> tool<00:06:43.790> so<00:06:44.790> what<00:06:44.880> we<00:06:45.030> do<00:06:45.210> is<00:06:45.780> we<00:06:45.960> start<00:06:46.170> the

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
next tool so what we do is we start the

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.590 
next tool so what we do is we start the
line<00:06:46.440> one<00:06:46.710> we<00:06:47.370> saw<00:06:47.790> along<00:06:48.320> that<00:06:51.440> Cutler

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
line one we saw along that Cutler

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.190 
line one we saw along that Cutler
diagonal<00:06:54.600> line<00:06:54.810> is<00:06:55.080> the<00:06:55.230> cut<00:06:55.440> flight<00:06:57.200> starts

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200 
diagonal line is the cut flight starts

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.090 
diagonal line is the cut flight starts
from<00:06:58.320> line<00:06:58.560> one

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
from line one

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.550 
from line one
what<00:07:00.060> I'm<00:07:00.180> doing<00:07:00.210> is<00:07:00.630> obviously<00:07:00.960> sewing<00:07:01.410> just

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
what I'm doing is obviously sewing just

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.050 
what I'm doing is obviously sewing just
along<00:07:01.920> the<00:07:02.100> top<00:07:02.780> just<00:07:03.780> along<00:07:04.020> the<00:07:04.170> top<00:07:04.970> like<00:07:05.970> a

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 
along the top just along the top like a

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.920 
along the top just along the top like a
like<00:07:06.330> just<00:07:06.360> sawing<00:07:07.910> normally<00:07:08.910> and<00:07:09.090> this<00:07:09.510> work

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
like just sawing normally and this work

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.230 
like just sawing normally and this work
yeah<00:07:10.080> use<00:07:10.350> your<00:07:10.380> hand<00:07:10.710> to<00:07:10.920> work<00:07:11.160> piece<00:07:11.940> of<00:07:12.090> wood

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
yeah use your hand to work piece of wood

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.660 
yeah use your hand to work piece of wood
right<00:07:12.290> in<00:07:13.290> fact<00:07:13.560> you'll<00:07:13.830> aspire<00:07:14.250> off<00:07:14.490> you'll

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670 
right in fact you'll aspire off you'll

notice it's my left hand well you like
that<00:07:16.980> as<00:07:17.130> well<00:07:17.340> we'll<00:07:17.880> do<00:07:18.030> all<00:07:18.390> of<00:07:18.720> our<00:07:19.560> most<00:07:19.800> of

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
that as well we'll do all of our most of

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.940 
that as well we'll do all of our most of
the<00:07:20.220> work<00:07:20.400> with<00:07:21.360> the<00:07:21.510> respect<00:07:22.170> of<00:07:22.350> controlling

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 
the work with the respect of controlling

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.500 
the work with the respect of controlling
where<00:07:23.730> you<00:07:24.210> want<00:07:24.420> to<00:07:24.540> cut<00:07:24.750> or<00:07:25.500> use<00:07:25.650> a<00:07:25.680> tool<00:07:26.010> and
