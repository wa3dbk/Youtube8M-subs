00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
you might want to like have your

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.310 
you might want to like have your
character's<00:00:40.890> eyes<00:00:41.040> look<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.790> follow<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.809> with

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
character's eyes look and follow up with

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.779 
character's eyes look and follow up with
the<00:00:43.410> rest<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> face<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.160> usually<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the rest of the face I usually like to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.850 
the rest of the face I usually like to
start<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> eyes<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.899> then<00:00:46.379> work<00:00:46.530> my<00:00:46.559> way

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
start with the eyes and then work my way

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.639 
start with the eyes and then work my way
down<00:00:46.890> from<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> nose<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.600> mouth<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
down from the nose to the mouth to the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
down from the nose to the mouth to the
outer<00:00:49.829> edges<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> face<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
outer edges of the face and then up to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
outer edges of the face and then up to
the<00:00:51.750> hair<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the hair and that's for me is the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
the hair and that's for me is the
easiest<00:00:54.090> way<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.600> start<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> think<00:00:55.379> that's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
easiest way to start and I think that's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.119 
easiest way to start and I think that's
the<00:00:55.710> best<00:00:55.890> way<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> learn<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.789> draw<00:00:57.000> characters

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
the best way to learn to draw characters

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.439 
the best way to learn to draw characters
of<00:00:59.129> course<00:00:59.309> there<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.730> many<00:00:59.820> many<00:01:00.059> ways<00:01:00.270> you

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
of course there are many many ways you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.930 
of course there are many many ways you
can<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.800> only<00:01:02.309> way<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
can do this this is not the only way a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.579 
can do this this is not the only way a
lot<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> people<00:01:03.690> would<00:01:03.809> say<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.199> smarter<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
lot of people would say it's smarter to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.590 
lot of people would say it's smarter to
start<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> outer<00:01:05.339> edge<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> body<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
start with the outer edge of the body to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.120 
start with the outer edge of the body to
craft<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> overall<00:01:07.590> shape<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.979> your

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
craft the overall shape of your

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.609 
craft the overall shape of your
character<00:01:08.490> first<00:01:08.790> using<00:01:09.780> rudimentary

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
character first using rudimentary

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.149 
character first using rudimentary
circles<00:01:12.080> basically<00:01:13.080> sketch<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.650> rough<00:01:13.860> shape

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
circles basically sketch the rough shape

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
circles basically sketch the rough shape
of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> character<00:01:14.729> using<00:01:15.060> circles<00:01:15.509> squares

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
of the character using circles squares

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.560 
of the character using circles squares
and<00:01:16.320> any<00:01:16.409> other<00:01:16.619> basic<00:01:17.100> shapes<00:01:17.400> kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.270> erase

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and any other basic shapes kind of erase

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.990 
and any other basic shapes kind of erase
your<00:01:18.810> work<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:20.460> fill<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
your work as you go and then fill in the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
your work as you go and then fill in the
lines<00:01:21.360> from<00:01:21.720> there<00:01:21.960> adding<00:01:22.470> more<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.009> more

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
lines from there adding more and more

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.490 
lines from there adding more and more
detail<00:01:23.640> kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.270> working<00:01:24.540> away<00:01:24.659> outward<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
detail kind of working away outward and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.999 
detail kind of working away outward and
moving<00:01:26.340> inward<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.540> would<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.810> another<00:01:28.080> way

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
moving inward that would be another way

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.690 
moving inward that would be another way
to<00:01:29.040> go<00:01:29.540> learning<00:01:30.540> how<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.689> draw<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.409> never<00:01:31.979> easy

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
to go learning how to draw is never easy

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.819 
to go learning how to draw is never easy
at<00:01:33.240> first<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.200> frustrating<00:01:34.740> because

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
at first it can be frustrating because

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.620 
at first it can be frustrating because
you<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.189> these<00:01:35.430> ideas<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.090> head<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.540> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you have these ideas in your head but it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
you have these ideas in your head but it
seems<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.049> hand<00:01:37.290> won't<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.909> cooperate

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
seems like your hand won't not cooperate

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.230 
seems like your hand won't not cooperate
