00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
comfortable with doing Magic Loop or

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.160 
comfortable with doing Magic Loop or
using<00:02:39.980> two<00:02:40.160> circulars<00:02:40.760> then<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.900> can<00:02:42.019> just

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
using two circulars then you can just

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.160 
using two circulars then you can just
switch<00:02:42.410> over<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.680> be<00:02:42.830> pins<00:02:43.750> when<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.870> get<00:02:44.989> to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
switch over to be pins when you get to

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.150 
switch over to be pins when you get to
small<00:02:45.730> diameters<00:02:47.320> that's<00:02:48.320> what<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.650> always<00:02:48.830> do

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
small diameters that's what I always do

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:59.610 
small diameters that's what I always do
that<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.610> PCP<00:02:50.060> ends

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.600 

and<00:02:59.920> after<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:00.670> switch<00:03:00.970> all<00:03:01.209> this<00:03:01.420> over

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
and after you switch all this over

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.309 
and after you switch all this over
you'll<00:03:03.610> be<00:03:03.760> able<00:03:03.849> to<00:03:04.030> see<00:03:04.330> how<00:03:04.750> big<00:03:04.959> your<00:03:04.989> dish

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
you'll be able to see how big your dish

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.890 
you'll be able to see how big your dish
bucket<00:03:05.739> is<00:03:05.860> better<00:03:06.220> than<00:03:06.819> did<00:03:07.209> with<00:03:07.560> depends

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
bucket is better than did with depends

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:18.020 
bucket is better than did with depends
how's<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.050> circular<00:03:11.530> let's<00:03:11.800> it<00:03:12.040> stretch<00:03:12.370> out

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.020 

and<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.209> like<00:03:19.450> that

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.770 

now<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.690> don't<00:03:22.960> want<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.320> use<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:24.780> longer

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
now you don't want to use a longer

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.900 
now you don't want to use a longer
circular<00:03:26.620> unless<00:03:27.070> you're<00:03:27.280> comfortable<00:03:27.520> with

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
circular unless you're comfortable with

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:37.650 
circular unless you're comfortable with
doing<00:03:28.240> magically<00:03:31.080> knitting

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.010 

you<00:03:38.500> need<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.680> 16<00:03:39.250> inch<00:03:39.430> circular<00:03:40.270> so<00:03:40.990> I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
you need a 16 inch circular so I

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.460 
you need a 16 inch circular so I
finished<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.590> first<00:03:42.660> VPN<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:43.900> I'm<00:03:44.020> on<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.350> the

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
finished the first VPN and I'm on to the

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.750 
finished the first VPN and I'm on to the
second<00:03:44.890> opinion<00:03:45.930> I'm<00:03:46.930> just<00:03:47.170> kidding<00:03:47.760> because

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
second opinion I'm just kidding because

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:57.500 
second opinion I'm just kidding because
I'm<00:03:48.910> doing<00:03:49.030> round<00:03:49.330> 19<00:03:49.870> which<00:03:50.320> is<00:03:50.350> all<00:03:50.800> knit

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.610 

right

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.150 

thing

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.320 

I'm<00:04:10.160> sure<00:04:10.400> look<00:04:10.670> back<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.180> make<00:04:11.300> sure

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
I'm sure look back and make sure

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.760 
I'm sure look back and make sure
nothing's<00:04:11.840> slipping<00:04:12.170> off<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.320> end<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.710> your

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
nothing's slipping off the end of your

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:26.840 
nothing's slipping off the end of your
DQ<00:04:13.220> at<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:13.730> beginning

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.650 

I<00:04:26.880> think<00:04:27.600> round<00:04:27.780> 19<00:04:28.320> is<00:04:28.790> probably<00:04:29.790> just<00:04:30.510> the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
I think round 19 is probably just the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.050 
I think round 19 is probably just the
right<00:04:31.460> spot<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.820> switch<00:04:33.060> over<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.390> a<00:04:33.540> circular

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
right spot to switch over to a circular

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.760 
right spot to switch over to a circular
now<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.120> could<00:04:36.450> continue<00:04:36.900> making<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.560> whole

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
now you could continue making the whole

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.010 
now you could continue making the whole
disk<00:04:38.130> off<00:04:38.370> with<00:04:38.640> just<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.060> PN's<00:04:39.420> if<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.780> want

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
disk off with just the PN's if you want

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.370 
disk off with just the PN's if you want
that<00:04:41.000> for<00:04:42.000> me<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.420> gets<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.780> little<00:04:42.900> bit<00:04:43.110> crowded

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
that for me it gets a little bit crowded

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.330 
that for me it gets a little bit crowded
on<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.130> needles<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:45.920> I'm<00:04:46.920> always<00:04:47.160> afraid

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
on the needles and I'm always afraid

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.070 
on the needles and I'm always afraid
that<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.790> stitch<00:04:48.090> is<00:04:48.240> going<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.510> fall<00:04:48.690> off<00:04:48.720> the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
that a stitch is going to fall off the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.890 
that a stitch is going to fall off the
end<00:04:52.490> but<00:04:53.490> it's<00:04:53.640> not<00:04:53.850> impossible<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.480> do<00:04:54.720> you

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
end but it's not impossible to do you

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.980 
end but it's not impossible to do you
just<00:04:55.080> have<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.320> be<00:04:55.410> careful<00:04:56.690> there<00:04:57.690> are<00:04:57.750> some

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
just have to be careful there are some

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.690 
just have to be careful there are some
people<00:04:58.260> who<00:04:58.410> can<00:04:58.590> make<00:04:58.680> an<00:04:58.830> entire<00:04:59.130> sweater

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700
