and<00:01:51.670> I'll<00:01:51.789> start<00:01:52.000> with<00:01:52.119> automatic<00:01:52.539> just<00:01:52.929> show

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
and I'll start with automatic just show

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.290 
and I'll start with automatic just show
you<00:01:53.200> how<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.500> works<00:01:53.709> now<00:01:54.580> once<00:01:54.789> again<00:01:54.940> if<00:01:55.209> you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
you how it works now once again if you

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.699 
you how it works now once again if you
get<00:01:55.420> stuck<00:01:55.720> or<00:01:55.899> if<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.140> don't<00:01:56.319> know<00:01:56.410> what<00:01:56.560> to

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
get stuck or if you don't know what to

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:58.740 
get stuck or if you don't know what to
do<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.310> can<00:01:57.340> tap<00:01:57.640> on<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.849> question<00:01:58.239> mark<00:01:58.270> and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
do you can tap on the question mark and

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.779 
do you can tap on the question mark and
here<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.560> shows<00:01:59.619> overlay<00:02:00.429> which<00:02:00.640> is

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
here it shows overlay which is

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.839 
here it shows overlay which is
essentially<00:02:01.479> just<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:02.379> visual<00:02:02.739> depiction<00:02:03.429> of

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
essentially just a visual depiction of

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.300 
essentially just a visual depiction of
how<00:02:04.349> what<00:02:05.349> are<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.590> different<00:02:05.920> things<00:02:06.129> you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
how what are the different things you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.609 
how what are the different things you
can<00:02:06.429> do<00:02:06.610> in<00:02:06.729> Snapseed<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:07.959> it<00:02:08.200> just<00:02:08.410> shows<00:02:08.590> you

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
can do in Snapseed so it just shows you

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.680 
can do in Snapseed so it just shows you
what<00:02:09.340> are<00:02:09.429> your<00:02:09.580> options<00:02:09.759> what<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.300> can<00:02:10.509> do

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
what are your options what you can do

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.990 
what are your options what you can do
and<00:02:10.899> how<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.290> do<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.770> now<00:02:12.489> as<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.819> probably

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
and how to do this now as you probably

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.060 
and how to do this now as you probably
notice<00:02:13.510> one<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.440> things<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.710> can<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:14.980> is

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
notice one of the things you can do is

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.430 
notice one of the things you can do is
swipe<00:02:15.400> vertically<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.720> allows<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.290> to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
swipe vertically and that allows you to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.480 
swipe vertically and that allows you to
go<00:02:17.560> through<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.890> different

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
go through the different

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.370 
go through the different
adjustments<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.540> for<00:02:19.720> automatic<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.230> only

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
adjustments and for automatic you only

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.900 
adjustments and for automatic you only
have<00:02:20.590> two<00:02:20.770> adjustments<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.490> have<00:02:21.640> color

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
have two adjustments you have color

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.330 
have two adjustments you have color
correction<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.540> contrast<00:02:23.080> correction<00:02:23.590> which

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
correction and contrast correction which

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.390 
correction and contrast correction which
is<00:02:24.370> essentially<00:02:25.210> just<00:02:25.800> some<00:02:26.800> changes<00:02:27.250> that

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
is essentially just some changes that

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.040 
is essentially just some changes that
snap<00:02:27.610> seen<00:02:27.820> things<00:02:28.030> might<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.540> good<00:02:28.720> for<00:02:28.750> this

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
snap seen things might be good for this

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.340 
snap seen things might be good for this
photo<00:02:29.320> so<00:02:30.040> let's<00:02:30.160> start<00:02:30.340> with<00:02:30.460> color<00:02:31.170> as<00:02:32.170> we

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
photo so let's start with color as we

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.290 
photo so let's start with color as we
keep<00:02:32.470> moving<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.920> right<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.730> can<00:02:33.880> see

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
keep moving to the right you can see

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.630 
keep moving to the right you can see
that<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.570> colors<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.140> create<00:02:35.470> change<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.520> it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
that the colors in create change of it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.760 
that the colors in create change of it
or<00:02:36.850> if<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.150> move<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.540> left<00:02:37.750> they<00:02:38.500> become

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
or if you move to the left they become

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.340 
or if you move to the left they become
kind<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.130> warmer<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.660> left<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:41.170> think

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
kind of warmer and to the left I think

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.350 
kind of warmer and to the left I think
the<00:02:41.680> colors<00:02:41.950> become<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.250> tiny<00:02:42.490> bit<00:02:42.730> colder<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
the colors become a tiny bit colder and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.510 
the colors become a tiny bit colder and
for<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:43.900> picture<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.440> like<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.770> color<00:02:44.980> colors

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
for this picture I like the color colors

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.670 
for this picture I like the color colors
better<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.750> other<00:02:46.810> thing<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.170> can<00:02:47.350> do<00:02:47.500> is

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
better the other thing you can do is

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.450 
better the other thing you can do is
contrast<00:02:48.870> correction<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.050> once<00:02:50.530> again<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
contrast correction and once again you

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.880 
contrast correction and once again you
swipe<00:02:51.730> horizontally<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:53.260> can<00:02:53.290> see<00:02:53.710> how<00:02:53.830> the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
swipe horizontally you can see how the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.400 
swipe horizontally you can see how the
conscious<00:02:54.400> changes<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.270> generally<00:02:56.080> going<00:02:56.290> to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
conscious changes and generally going to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.990 
conscious changes and generally going to
the<00:02:56.530> left<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.980> make<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.340> image<00:02:57.580> less

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
the left to make the image less

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.270 
the left to make the image less
contrasted<00:02:58.870> I'm<00:02:59.020> going<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.440> derive<00:02:59.680> makes<00:03:00.130> it

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
contrasted I'm going to derive makes it

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.670 
contrasted I'm going to derive makes it
more<00:03:00.430> contrasted<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:02.020> don't<00:03:02.200> want<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.440> go

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
more contrasted and I don't want to go

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.620 
more contrasted and I don't want to go
too<00:03:02.740> high<00:03:03.070> on<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.400> because<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:04.000> think<00:03:04.300> it's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
too high on this because I think it's

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.990 
too high on this because I think it's
still<00:03:04.750> important<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.410> see<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.880> you

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
still important that you see that you

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.080 
still important that you see that you
see<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.360> nose<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.520> Hedgehog<00:03:09.520> quite<00:03:09.760> well

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
see the nose of the Hedgehog quite well

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.480 
see the nose of the Hedgehog quite well
so<00:03:10.390> I'll<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.630> leave<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.840> at<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.260> now<00:03:12.220> if<00:03:12.400> you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
so I'll just leave it at this now if you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.490 
so I'll just leave it at this now if you
want<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.730> compare<00:03:13.060> what<00:03:13.750> you've<00:03:13.930> done<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.410> the

save my changes again into a new picture
and<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:34.770> know<00:04:34.890> what<00:04:35.130> there<00:04:35.520> is<00:04:35.700> one<00:04:35.910> more

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
and you know what there is one more

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.760 
and you know what there is one more
thing<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.420> want<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.660> change<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.140> this<00:04:37.260> image<00:04:37.590> and

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
thing I want to change in this image and

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.210 
thing I want to change in this image and
that<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:38.730> adding<00:04:39.210> more<00:04:39.420> details<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:41.040> we

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
that is adding more details to it so we

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.730 
that is adding more details to it so we
open<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.610> details<00:04:42.180> module<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.930> left

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.130 

you'll<00:04:46.740> see<00:04:47.010> that<00:04:47.190> details<00:04:47.730> has<00:04:48.600> just<00:04:48.960> two

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
you'll see that details has just two

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.980 
you'll see that details has just two
adjustments<00:04:49.830> sharpening<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.670> structure<00:04:51.300> so

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
adjustments sharpening and structure so

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.720 
adjustments sharpening and structure so
let's<00:04:52.140> start<00:04:52.350> with<00:04:52.500> sharpening<00:04:53.040> what

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
let's start with sharpening what

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.820 
let's start with sharpening what
sharpening<00:04:54.210> does<00:04:54.450> essentially<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.260> makes

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
sharpening does essentially is makes

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.830 
sharpening does essentially is makes
your<00:04:56.040> blurred<00:04:56.370> out<00:04:56.580> images<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:57.060> bit<00:04:57.330> sharper

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
your blurred out images a bit sharper

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.350 
your blurred out images a bit sharper
now<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.500> might<00:04:58.650> be<00:04:58.710> hard<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.700> see<00:05:00.060> any

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
now it might be hard to see any

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.820 
now it might be hard to see any
difference<00:05:00.510> but<00:05:01.020> if<00:05:01.140> you<00:05:01.230> prepare<00:05:01.530> close

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
difference but if you prepare close

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.770 
difference but if you prepare close
attention<00:05:02.130> to<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.640> needles<00:05:02.970> of<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.270> Hedgehog

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
attention to the needles of the Hedgehog

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.630 
attention to the needles of the Hedgehog
and<00:05:04.080> now<00:05:04.680> you<00:05:04.740> look<00:05:04.980> at<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.160> photo<00:05:05.370> with

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
and now you look at the photo with

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.900 
and now you look at the photo with
sharpening<00:05:06.180> on<00:05:06.420> and<00:05:07.100> now<00:05:08.100> if<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.580> look<00:05:08.640> at<00:05:08.790> the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
sharpening on and now if you look at the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.030 
sharpening on and now if you look at the
same<00:05:09.060> photo<00:05:09.270> without<00:05:09.450> sharpening<00:05:10.320> you<00:05:10.890> can

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
same photo without sharpening you can

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.040 
same photo without sharpening you can
sort<00:05:11.220> of<00:05:11.280> see<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.490> difference<00:05:12.030> now<00:05:12.300> as<00:05:12.900> we've

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
sort of see the difference now as we've

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.620 
sort of see the difference now as we've
added<00:05:13.230> sharpening<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:14.220> know<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:15.300> little

the way to 100 because what often

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.350 
the way to 100 because what often
happens<00:05:26.070> is<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.520> when<00:05:26.820> you<00:05:26.850> take<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.120> photo

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
happens is that when you take a photo

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.600 
happens is that when you take a photo
like<00:05:27.600> this<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:28.200> you<00:05:28.920> open<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.310> up<00:05:29.400> on<00:05:29.550> a

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
like this and you open it up on a

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.390 
like this and you open it up on a
computer<00:05:30.180> if<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.200> increase<00:05:31.560> sharpening<00:05:32.160> or

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
computer if you increase sharpening or

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.820 
computer if you increase sharpening or
structure<00:05:33.000> weight<00:05:33.510> too<00:05:33.990> much<00:05:34.020> it<00:05:34.500> might<00:05:34.680> look

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
structure weight too much it might look

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.230 
structure weight too much it might look
you<00:05:35.040> down<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.340> small<00:05:35.580> screen<00:05:35.880> of<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.120> iPhone

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
you down the small screen of the iPhone

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.720 
you down the small screen of the iPhone
but<00:05:37.020> once<00:05:37.230> you<00:05:37.320> blow<00:05:37.470> up<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.770> photo<00:05:37.980> into<00:05:38.700> a

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
but once you blow up the photo into a

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.850 
but once you blow up the photo into a
larger<00:05:39.120> size<00:05:39.390> on<00:05:39.570> your<00:05:39.600> computer<00:05:40.170> you<00:05:40.680> might

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
larger size on your computer you might

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.290 
larger size on your computer you might
see<00:05:41.070> that<00:05:41.160> you've<00:05:41.310> actually<00:05:41.490> overdone<00:05:42.150> the

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
see that you've actually overdone the

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.120 
see that you've actually overdone the
editing<00:05:42.690> so<00:05:42.930> just<00:05:43.170> be<00:05:43.290> careful<00:05:43.500> with<00:05:43.860> that

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
editing so just be careful with that

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.280 
editing so just be careful with that
so<00:05:44.820> that's<00:05:45.000> sharpening<00:05:45.510> next<00:05:45.960> let's<00:05:46.140> have<00:05:46.260> a

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
so that's sharpening next let's have a

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.290 
so that's sharpening next let's have a
look<00:05:46.440> at<00:05:46.560> structure<00:05:47.130> which<00:05:47.700> essentially

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
look at structure which essentially

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.920 
look at structure which essentially
emphasizes<00:05:49.190> textures<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.550> other<00:05:51.330> similar

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
emphasizes textures and other similar

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.080 
emphasizes textures and other similar
features<00:05:52.320> of<00:05:52.530> the<00:05:52.620> photos<00:05:52.980> so<00:05:53.490> once<00:05:53.640> again<00:05:53.760> if

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
features of the photos so once again if

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.730 
features of the photos so once again if
you<00:05:54.210> want<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.450> see<00:05:54.630> how<00:05:54.780> structure<00:05:55.260> works<00:05:55.470> you

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
you want to see how structure works you

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.930 
you want to see how structure works you
should<00:05:55.770> look<00:05:56.010> at<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.310> needles<00:05:56.700> of<00:05:56.850> the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
should look at the needles of the

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.880 
should look at the needles of the
Hedgehog<00:05:57.420> and<00:05:57.630> then<00:05:58.110> the<00:05:58.230> gravel<00:05:58.650> in<00:05:58.800> the

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
Hedgehog and then the gravel in the

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.590 
Hedgehog and then the gravel in the
foreground<00:05:59.340> so<00:05:59.850> let's<00:06:00.000> just<00:06:00.150> go<00:06:00.270> ahead<00:06:00.300> and

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
foreground so let's just go ahead and

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.590 
foreground so let's just go ahead and
increase<00:06:01.220> structure<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:03.060> we'll<00:06:03.180> go<00:06:03.330> all<00:06:03.480> the

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
increase structure and we'll go all the

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.590 
increase structure and we'll go all the
way<00:06:03.720> to<00:06:03.780> 100<00:06:04.410> first<00:06:04.800> once<00:06:05.130> again<00:06:05.490> just<00:06:05.760> so<00:06:06.480> that

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
way to 100 first once again just so that

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.510 
way to 100 first once again just so that
you<00:06:06.720> can<00:06:06.900> see<00:06:07.110> what<00:06:07.290> it<00:06:07.380> looks<00:06:07.620> like<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:08.430> you

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
you can see what it looks like and you

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.010 
you can see what it looks like and you
know<00:06:08.640> the<00:06:08.850> difference<00:06:09.180> is<00:06:09.360> really<00:06:09.750> quite

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
know the difference is really quite

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.840 
know the difference is really quite
dramatic<00:06:10.170> so<00:06:10.980> once<00:06:11.100> again<00:06:11.220> this<00:06:11.580> is<00:06:11.700> before

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
dramatic so once again this is before

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.110 
dramatic so once again this is before
changes<00:06:12.600> and<00:06:12.840> this<00:06:13.800> is<00:06:14.040> after<00:06:14.400> sharpening<00:06:14.940> and

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
changes and this is after sharpening and

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.060 
changes and this is after sharpening and
structure<00:06:15.660> you<00:06:16.260> can<00:06:16.350> really<00:06:16.620> see<00:06:16.800> a<00:06:16.830> lot<00:06:16.920> more

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
structure you can really see a lot more

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.530 
structure you can really see a lot more
textures<00:06:17.760> in<00:06:17.970> the<00:06:18.090> crebbil

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
textures in the crebbil

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.720 
textures in the crebbil
and<00:06:18.690> in<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.170> needles<00:06:19.500> of<00:06:19.650> the<00:06:19.770> Hedgehog<00:06:20.220> but

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
and in the needles of the Hedgehog but

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.220 
and in the needles of the Hedgehog but
once<00:06:20.970> again<00:06:21.120> you<00:06:21.540> don't<00:06:21.720> want<00:06:21.900> to<00:06:21.990> leave<00:06:22.110> this

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
once again you don't want to leave this

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.740 
once again you don't want to leave this
at<00:06:22.380> 100<00:06:23.040> because<00:06:23.430> once<00:06:24.030> you<00:06:24.180> make<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.510> image

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
at 100 because once you make the image

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.140 
at 100 because once you make the image
larger<00:06:24.990> that<00:06:25.650> won't<00:06:26.040> look<00:06:26.220> so<00:06:26.460> good<00:06:26.670> to<00:06:27.000> look

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
larger that won't look so good to look

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.600 
larger that won't look so good to look
over<00:06:27.480> edited<00:06:27.990> so<00:06:28.530> to<00:06:28.590> make<00:06:28.800> sure<00:06:28.980> that<00:06:29.220> you

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
over edited so to make sure that you

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.390 
over edited so to make sure that you
don't<00:06:30.030> go<00:06:30.420> too<00:06:30.480> high<00:06:31.040> you<00:06:32.040> know<00:06:32.160> pick

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
don't go too high you know pick

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.980 
don't go too high you know pick
something<00:06:32.790> more<00:06:32.820> reasonable<00:06:33.120> something<00:06:33.840> like

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
something more reasonable something like

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.580 
something more reasonable something like
60<00:06:34.560> or<00:06:34.590> 50<00:06:35.160> I'd<00:06:35.310> say<00:06:35.700> in<00:06:36.600> fact<00:06:37.140> I'll<00:06:37.260> just<00:06:37.440> go

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
60 or 50 I'd say in fact I'll just go

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.580 
60 or 50 I'd say in fact I'll just go
for<00:06:37.800> 50<00:06:38.250> and<00:06:38.480> let<00:06:39.480> me<00:06:39.600> just<00:06:39.630> see<00:06:40.470> the

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
for 50 and let me just see the

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.350 
for 50 and let me just see the
difference<00:06:41.010> so<00:06:41.520> again<00:06:41.700> this<00:06:41.880> is<00:06:42.060> without

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
difference so again this is without

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.070 
difference so again this is without
structure<00:06:43.050> and<00:06:43.200> sharpening

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
structure and sharpening

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.379 
structure and sharpening
and<00:06:44.169> this<00:06:44.530> is<00:06:44.680> wit<00:06:44.919> and<00:06:45.159> you<00:06:45.849> know<00:06:45.970> if<00:06:46.150> you<00:06:46.240> look

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389 
and this is wit and you know if you look

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.719 
and this is wit and you know if you look
just<00:06:46.659> look<00:06:46.810> at<00:06:46.960> the<00:06:47.020> Hedgehog<00:06:47.500> it<00:06:48.340> looks<00:06:48.520> so

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
just look at the Hedgehog it looks so

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.159 
just look at the Hedgehog it looks so
much<00:06:48.789> more<00:06:49.090> beautiful<00:06:49.569> now<00:06:49.599> so<00:06:49.930> let's<00:06:50.080> apply

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
much more beautiful now so let's apply

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.309 
much more beautiful now so let's apply
changes<00:06:50.680> and<00:06:51.250> once<00:06:52.060> again<00:06:52.240> let's<00:06:52.810> stay<00:06:53.169> in<00:06:53.199> the

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 
changes and once again let's stay in the

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.699 
changes and once again let's stay in the
photo<00:06:53.590> to<00:06:53.860> photo<00:06:54.069> library
