 4 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.540
 the super directional interpreters but the people that love the time 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.540
 is by the triple-way switches 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.740
 therefore a three-way switch as you would with any 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.980
 another thing 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.980
 selected from the page but remains to be closed while 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.090
 ap 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.020
 there 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.300
 and adjust against the usual switch settings r 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.300
 p 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.550
 min 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.550
 p 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.800
 the triple sense 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.450
 provides that third level of variation that is lacking 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.450
 bidirectional switches 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.330
 the bidirectional interpreters are great but the people I love now 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
 is by triple-sense common switches 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.690
 therefore popular triple-way switch like any other 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.550
 thing 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.550
 the selected one of the page but it remains to close while 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
 is not easy 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.800
 and then put it 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.460
 incorrect 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.530
 at last 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.830

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.790
 jackson 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.010
 adjust against the usual switch settings p 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 p 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.240
 the triple sense provides that third level of variation that is lacking in 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.690
 bidirectional switches
