bridging some other advanced techniques

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.199 
bridging some other advanced techniques
are<00:03:31.000> bridge<00:03:32.000> flips<00:03:32.329> and<00:03:33.130> British<00:03:34.130> circles<00:03:34.519> so

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
are bridge flips and British circles so

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.630 
are bridge flips and British circles so
the<00:03:35.329> bridge<00:03:35.540> flips<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:36.860> know<00:03:36.980> I'm<00:03:37.340> going<00:03:37.579> to

the bridge flips you know I'm going to

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.310 
the bridge flips you know I'm going to
use<00:03:37.850> if<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.989> can<00:03:39.110> do<00:03:39.200> this

to go from a front bridge dad kick over
to<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.720> back<00:03:47.989> bridge

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
to a back bridge

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.170

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.190 

so<00:04:04.220> I'm<00:04:04.310> using<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:05.060> momentum<00:04:05.390> especially

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
so I'm using the momentum especially

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.560 
so I'm using the momentum especially
I'll<00:04:06.500> do<00:04:06.590> one<00:04:06.770> leg<00:04:06.950> at<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.130> time<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.550> help<00:04:07.580> create

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
I'll do one leg at a time to help create

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.780 
I'll do one leg at a time to help create
that<00:04:08.600> momentum<00:04:09.020> help<00:04:09.650> me<00:04:09.740> come<00:04:09.920> over<00:04:10.070> so

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
that momentum help me come over so

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.490 
that momentum help me come over so
that's<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:11.090> bridge<00:04:11.270> flip<00:04:11.510> so<00:04:11.930> if<00:04:12.020> you<00:04:12.140> need<00:04:12.290> to

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
that's a bridge flip so if you need to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.500 
that's a bridge flip so if you need to
you<00:04:13.040> can<00:04:13.160> do<00:04:13.310> them<00:04:13.430> too<00:04:13.490> close<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.030> wall<00:04:14.210> so

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
you can do them too close to the wall so

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.330 
you can do them too close to the wall so
that<00:04:15.080> way<00:04:15.320> after<00:04:15.590> you<00:04:15.620> jump<00:04:15.860> over<00:04:15.950> your<00:04:16.160> back

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
that way after you jump over your back

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.880 
that way after you jump over your back
bridge<00:04:16.640> if<00:04:16.880> you're<00:04:17.209> not<00:04:17.360> able<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.750> kick<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.800> up

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
bridge if you're not able to kick it up

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.320 
bridge if you're not able to kick it up
and<00:04:19.130> create<00:04:19.310> enough<00:04:19.459> momentum<00:04:19.580> to<00:04:19.820> jump<00:04:20.090> over

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
and create enough momentum to jump over

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.360 
and create enough momentum to jump over
you<00:04:20.870> can<00:04:21.020> use<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.290> wall<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.860> help<00:04:22.010> push<00:04:22.250> you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
you can use the wall to help push you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.740 
you can use the wall to help push you
over<00:04:22.640> this<00:04:23.120> gives<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.390> a<00:04:23.420> little<00:04:23.540> more

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
over this gives you a little more

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.410 
over this gives you a little more
stability<00:04:23.900> okay<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.790> other<00:04:25.820> exercise

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
stability okay and the other exercise

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.540 
stability okay and the other exercise
last<00:04:26.720> one<00:04:27.020> we're<00:04:27.980> going<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.160> go<00:04:28.280> over<00:04:28.310> today
