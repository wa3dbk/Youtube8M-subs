for the mana to go up but um me attack
my<00:03:26.210> strength<00:03:26.510> will<00:03:26.690> go<00:03:26.780> up<00:03:27.820> so<00:03:28.820> there's<00:03:29.000> my

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
my strength will go up so there's my

strength<00:03:29.540> going<00:03:30.230> up<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:31.160> think<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.400> got

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
strength going up and I think it got

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.340 
strength going up and I think it got
some<00:03:31.670> defense<00:03:32.030> whenever<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.450> person<00:03:32.900> attacks

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
some defense whenever a person attacks

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.260 
some defense whenever a person attacks
you<00:03:33.530> then<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.890> get<00:03:34.040> defense<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.850> for<00:03:35.120> some

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
you then you get defense and for some

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.450 
you then you get defense and for some
reason<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.540> crash<00:03:35.780> sometimes<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.350> happens<00:03:36.530> I

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460
