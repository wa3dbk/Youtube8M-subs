00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello everyone is valÃ©rie 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.580
 today we are going to make a makeup of 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.610
 tig 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.610
 the fund must consist of four 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 steps and it's really easy it's 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.640
 than any athlete so first 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.449
 I use a color that does not have a 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.960
 color that is more fluo so I take 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:33.329
 the ranger does it all outside 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.610
 makeup with this beach one is 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.940
 not have to take colors that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.430
 were born in haircut 9 on range 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.070
 very simple the most partying 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.780
 so here step number two it's with 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.820
 a revenge that is regular we come 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.500
 you are happy you come from a fund 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.690
 apply it to create the second stage 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 of our mask is a fade then we 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.059
 still going in the clearest with a 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.059
 leg 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.780
 again for this must 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.750
 make sure it's really a beautiful 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:20.299
 degraded when you type well to mix 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:22.640
 the colors until the tap more than 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.390
 people were coming to blend with their 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.390
 rows neon lights 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.220
 so after that we want to fill the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.220
 marine spaces of acorn 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:21.590
 once it's done we'll come 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:25.230
 do the strokes in black so to ski 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.680
 d link is important to start from 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.050
 funds applying the brush or at 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.860
 great full and releasing the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.930
 pressure and gently to create this 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.470
 effect our two largest towards the most 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.560
 narrow or to give an effect yet 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.300
 more more realistic and more enjoyable to 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:03:00.600
 the eye and so to go with a gesture 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:03:03.450
 Worse if it's a little trick of the day 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.640
 if you want one in the background 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.340
 keep a good brush and that the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.299
 hairs without ensuring that the hairs are 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.739
 especially for each of their beards 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.570
 that I advise you two slowly 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.000
 rotate in your movement 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.410
 always turned does not fall in the direction 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.540
 clockwise to do in 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.269
 so that brushes and always stays 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.910
 to its sharpest shape possible 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.590
 like that you're going to do you go 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.390
 keep your brush longer 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.769
 in addition to avoiding that the equal comes 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.570
 mess up your makeup because the 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.600
 finally runs there is a small line 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.489
 a hair that comes from arnaud focus like 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.049
 that you'll be sure to keep a 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.049
 story brushes and demonstrate 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.310
 once it's done we 'll add 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.210
 details 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.280
 a white the white really serves to 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.840
 add a few good things to our 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.430
 makeup make sure that they are 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.160
 less - flight if I can say like the 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.840
 buy small white lines on 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.310
 the end of my stripe puy velay 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.530
 get out of here the little dots that are 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.650
 actually really very very easy to 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:58.380
 to do with this bread according to me it has me 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:02.750
 surprised the mark reid brushes that are 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.750
 really nice to work with 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.060
 So a nickname and the hand up from the bench 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.800
 and that's what complements our 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.000
 tig makeup 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.430
 so I hope you have put and we are 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.810

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.810
