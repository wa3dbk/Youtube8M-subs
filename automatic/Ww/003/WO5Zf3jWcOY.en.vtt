00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.180 
eat a day and one of the things that I I
heard<00:02:38.210> on<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.660> documentary<00:02:38.960> is<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.890> if<00:02:40.100> you

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
heard on the documentary is that if you

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.630 
heard on the documentary is that if you
look<00:02:40.370> at<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:41.300> ingredients<00:02:42.080> or<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:43.100> daily

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
look at the ingredients or the daily

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.410 
look at the ingredients or the daily
value<00:02:44.360> on<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:45.490> towards<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.700> ingredients

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
value on the towards the ingredients

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.830 
value on the towards the ingredients
list<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:48.520> packaging<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:50.060> doesn't<00:02:50.480> tell<00:02:50.660> you

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
list on packaging it doesn't tell you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.260 
list on packaging it doesn't tell you
the<00:02:50.870> percentage<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:52.070> daily<00:02:52.430> value<00:02:52.790> for<00:02:53.030> sugar

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
the percentage of daily value for sugar

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.230 
the percentage of daily value for sugar

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
discoloration was still there so it has

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.830 
discoloration was still there so it has
nothing<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.100> do<00:03:49.490> with<00:03:49.520> my<00:03:50.060> drinking<00:03:50.600> or

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
think of I don't think it does

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.610

youtube<00:04:11.959> comment<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.650> replied<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.190> my<00:04:14.120> mom's

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
youtube comment I replied that my mom's

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.710 
youtube comment I replied that my mom's
in<00:04:14.690> her<00:04:14.840> 50s<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.680> her<00:04:16.520> nails<00:04:16.760> are<00:04:17.090> as<00:04:17.239> thick<00:04:17.480> as

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
in her 50s and her nails are as thick as

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.800 
in her 50s and her nails are as thick as
they<00:04:18.049> were<00:04:18.109> back<00:04:18.500> when<00:04:18.709> she<00:04:18.890> was<00:04:18.920> in<00:04:19.070> her<00:04:19.280> 20s

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
they were back when she was in her 20s

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.600 
they were back when she was in her 20s
so<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.200> really<00:04:21.680> don't<00:04:21.919> think<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.400> diet<00:04:22.700> has<00:04:22.880> an

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
so I really don't think that diet has an

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.529 
so I really don't think that diet has an
act<00:04:23.759> on<00:04:24.020> nails<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.439> also<00:04:25.979> said<00:04:26.669> in<00:04:26.969> the<00:04:27.090> comment

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
act on nails I also said in the comment

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.860 
act on nails I also said in the comment
that<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.289> think<00:04:28.889> it's<00:04:29.069> mostly<00:04:29.400> genes<00:04:29.909> if<00:04:30.300> it's

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
that I think it's mostly genes if it's

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.320 
that I think it's mostly genes if it's
in<00:04:31.020> your<00:04:31.199> genes<00:04:31.229> you're<00:04:31.830> just<00:04:32.039> gonna<00:04:32.159> have<00:04:32.520> the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
in your genes you're just gonna have the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.189 
in your genes you're just gonna have the
thickness<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:34.409> your<00:04:35.189> nails<00:04:35.430> sort<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.509> like<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
thickness in your nails sort of like the

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.990 
thickness in your nails sort of like the

they can make them thick I think they

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.149 
they can make them thick I think they
can<00:05:21.840> add<00:05:22.080> thickness<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.949> it

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159

can add thickness to it
which<00:05:23.699> is<00:05:23.879> not<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.090> same<00:05:24.479> thing<00:05:24.719> but<00:05:25.169> it's

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
which is not the same thing but it's

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.680 
which is not the same thing but it's
still<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:25.650> start<00:05:26.159> so<00:05:26.729> if<00:05:26.909> you<00:05:27.060> are<00:05:27.270> wanting<00:05:27.659> to
