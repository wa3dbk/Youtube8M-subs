the hair that they have and make it grow
better<00:00:21.450> let<00:00:22.450> me<00:00:22.570> show<00:00:22.750> you<00:00:22.780> an<00:00:22.960> example<00:00:23.050> up

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
better let me show you an example up

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.840 
better let me show you an example up
here<00:00:23.940> on<00:00:24.940> our<00:00:25.180> chart<00:00:26.100> if<00:00:27.100> we<00:00:27.250> look<00:00:27.400> at<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.670> hair

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
here on our chart if we look at the hair

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.800 
here on our chart if we look at the hair
loss<00:00:28.090> cycle<00:00:28.750> actually<00:00:29.910> antigen<00:00:30.910> stage<00:00:31.210> of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
loss cycle actually antigen stage of

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.290 
loss cycle actually antigen stage of
hair<00:00:32.320> growth<00:00:32.500> is<00:00:33.040> when<00:00:33.310> our<00:00:33.340> hair<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:34.000> growing

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
hair growth is when our hair is growing

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.450 
hair growth is when our hair is growing
healthy<00:00:34.810> and<00:00:35.230> will<00:00:35.440> grow<00:00:35.680> whatever<00:00:36.040> length

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
healthy and will grow whatever length

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.030 
healthy and will grow whatever length
that<00:00:36.610> we<00:00:36.730> want<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:37.030> to<00:00:37.060> grow<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:38.410> happens<00:00:38.890> in

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
that we want it to grow what happens in

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.690 
that we want it to grow what happens in
hair<00:00:39.220> loss<00:00:39.400> is<00:00:40.180> a<00:00:40.239> lot<00:00:40.450> of<00:00:40.540> times<00:00:40.800> DHT<00:00:41.800> will

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
hair loss is a lot of times DHT will

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.090 
hair loss is a lot of times DHT will
build<00:00:43.000> up<00:00:43.239> around<00:00:43.810> the<00:00:44.200> hair<00:00:44.380> follicle<00:00:44.920> and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
build up around the hair follicle and

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.889 
build up around the hair follicle and
this<00:00:45.340> we<00:00:45.640> can<00:00:45.760> see<00:00:45.940> in<00:00:46.060> the<00:00:46.149> cadogan<00:00:46.510> stage

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
this we can see in the cadogan stage

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.840 
this we can see in the cadogan stage
here<00:00:47.200> where<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:47.950> hair<00:00:48.070> bulb<00:00:48.310> starts<00:00:48.700> to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
here where the hair bulb starts to

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.710 
here where the hair bulb starts to
shrink<00:00:49.030> and<00:00:50.550> eventually<00:00:51.550> it<00:00:52.090> turns<00:00:52.300> into<00:00:52.450> the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
shrink and eventually it turns into the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.500 
shrink and eventually it turns into the
television<00:00:52.930> stage<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.829> resting<00:00:54.280> stage<00:00:54.550> right

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
television stage the resting stage right

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.560 
television stage the resting stage right
before<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.020> will<00:00:56.170> begin<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.470> follow<00:00:57.450> what<00:00:58.450> the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
before it will begin to follow what the

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.900 
before it will begin to follow what the
amazing<00:00:58.960> thing<00:00:59.140> about<00:00:59.380> the<00:00:59.829> new<00:01:00.610> laser

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
amazing thing about the new laser

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.590 
amazing thing about the new laser
brushes<00:01:01.630> is<00:01:02.260> that<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:02.649> will<00:01:02.829> happily

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
brushes is that it will happily

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.310 
brushes is that it will happily
stimulate<00:01:04.890> hair<00:01:05.890> growth<00:01:05.950> in<00:01:06.520> this<00:01:06.820> area

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
stimulate hair growth in this area

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.320 
stimulate hair growth in this area
increased<00:01:08.320> cell<00:01:08.590> regeneration<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.640> actually

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
increased cell regeneration and actually

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.190 
increased cell regeneration and actually
reduce<00:01:10.720> DHT<00:01:11.500> production<00:01:12.870> now<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:13.930> way<00:01:14.170> that

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
reduce DHT production now the way that

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.100 
reduce DHT production now the way that
we<00:01:14.500> suggest<00:01:14.979> using<00:01:15.220> this<00:01:15.549> is<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.510> actually<00:01:16.659> use

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
we suggest using this is to actually use

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.399 
we suggest using this is to actually use
it<00:01:17.140> three<00:01:17.890> times<00:01:18.159> a<00:01:18.310> week<00:01:18.340> for<00:01:19.140> 15<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.260> 20

laser<00:02:07.829> was<00:02:08.580> actually<00:02:09.030> has<00:02:09.300> gotten<00:02:09.630> approval

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
laser was actually has gotten approval

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.430 
laser was actually has gotten approval
by<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.739> FDA<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.640> we're<00:02:12.420> using<00:02:12.540> minoxidil<00:02:12.930> as

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
by the FDA and we're using minoxidil as

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.910 
by the FDA and we're using minoxidil as
approved<00:02:13.799> by<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> FDA<00:02:14.810> now<00:02:15.810> how<00:02:16.290> long<00:02:16.500> should

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
approved by the FDA now how long should

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.690 
approved by the FDA now how long should
we<00:02:16.980> use<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.629> basically<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:18.660> would<00:02:18.930> use<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.700> to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
we use this basically I would use it to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.460 
we use this basically I would use it to
give<00:02:20.849> it<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> good<00:02:21.150> shot<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.660> would<00:02:21.870> give<00:02:22.049> it<00:02:22.170> for

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
give it a good shot I would give it for

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.030 
give it a good shot I would give it for
six<00:02:22.860> months<00:02:23.360> ideally<00:02:24.360> six<00:02:24.630> months<00:02:25.040> three

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
six months ideally six months three

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.309 
six months ideally six months three
times<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.400> week<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.849> laser<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.480> using

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
times a week with the laser and using

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.660 
times a week with the laser and using
the<00:02:28.410> product<00:02:28.769> buying<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.099> conjunction<00:02:29.549> with

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
this condition at that time you just

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.949 
this condition at that time you just
want<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.209> continue<00:03:17.689> to<00:03:17.810> use<00:03:18.019> it<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:19.959> hopefully
