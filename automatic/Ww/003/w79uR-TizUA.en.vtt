using a richer color that can hide the
design<00:03:06.710> example<00:03:07.710> white<00:03:08.070> will<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.550> very

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
instead paint on about two to three

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.820 
instead paint on about two to three
layers<00:03:16.740> of<00:03:17.190> your<00:03:17.880> paint<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.480> then<00:03:19.410> make<00:03:19.800> sure

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
to let each layer dry for about 15 to 20

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.350 
to let each layer dry for about 15 to 20
minutes<00:03:22.770> before<00:03:22.920> painting<00:03:23.370> on<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.790> next<00:03:24.090> coat

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
minutes before painting on the next coat

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.780 
minutes before painting on the next coat
by<00:03:25.140> using<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.590> brush<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:26.040> will<00:03:26.160> automatically

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
by using a brush it will automatically

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.000 
by using a brush it will automatically
create<00:03:27.090> brush<00:03:27.480> lines<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.530> paint<00:03:28.830> and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
create brush lines if you paint and

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.040 
create brush lines if you paint and
stroke<00:03:29.640> with<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.880> brush<00:03:30.120> evenly<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.810> lines

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
stroke with the brush evenly the lines

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.670 
stroke with the brush evenly the lines
will<00:03:31.380> look<00:03:31.620> almost<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.610> Saffiano<00:03:33.300> leather

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
will look almost like Saffiano leather

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.199 
will look almost like Saffiano leather
the<00:03:34.680> texture<00:03:35.040> really<00:03:35.160> reminds<00:03:35.730> me<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.940> the

is<00:04:16.950> on<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.609> inside<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.630> doesn't<00:04:18.900> show<00:04:21.710> okay

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
is on the inside so it doesn't show okay

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.530 
is on the inside so it doesn't show okay
so<00:04:22.770> step<00:04:23.130> 5<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.700> fun<00:04:23.880> part<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.270> get<00:04:24.390> to

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
so step 5 is the fun part you get to

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.360 
so step 5 is the fun part you get to
decorate<00:04:24.690> this<00:04:25.080> however<00:04:25.320> way<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.800> like<00:04:25.950> I

have some brooches rhinestones here so

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.920 
have some brooches rhinestones here so
I'm<00:04:28.800> going<00:04:28.979> to<00:04:29.040> lay<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.370> out<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.880> see<00:04:30.390> how<00:04:30.900> I

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
I'm going to lay it out and see how I

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.520 
I'm going to lay it out and see how I
like<00:04:31.290> it

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
like it

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.740 
like it
afterward<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.610> will<00:04:32.850> start<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.240> glue<00:04:33.450> it<00:04:33.570> on

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
afterward I will start to glue it on

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.240 
afterward I will start to glue it on
with<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.140> hot<00:04:34.530> glue<00:04:34.770> gun

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.460 

once<00:04:40.250> that<00:04:40.430> part<00:04:40.700> is<00:04:40.820> complete<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.630> am<00:04:41.930> going<00:04:42.320> to

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
once that part is complete I am going to

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.160 
once that part is complete I am going to
glue<00:04:42.800> on<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.430> rings<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.660> way<00:04:44.810> you<00:04:44.870> hold

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
glue on the rings and the way you hold

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.280 
glue on the rings and the way you hold
this<00:04:45.350> is<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.800> hold<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.280> with<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.820> Rings

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
this is you hold it with the Rings

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.960 
this is you hold it with the Rings
facing<00:04:48.290> downwards<00:04:48.920> that<00:04:49.310> way<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.520> can<00:04:49.760> stick

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
facing downwards that way you can stick

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.560 
facing downwards that way you can stick
your<00:04:50.000> finger<00:04:50.120> through<00:04:51.250> this<00:04:52.250> will<00:04:52.790> fall<00:04:53.330> if

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
your finger through this will fall if

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.330 
your finger through this will fall if
you're<00:04:53.810> pretty<00:04:54.020> rough<00:04:54.260> with<00:04:54.440> this<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:55.100> let's

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
you're pretty rough with this so let's

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.340 
you're pretty rough with this so let's
just<00:04:55.460> assume<00:04:55.910> that<00:04:55.970> when<00:04:56.960> you're<00:04:57.170> wearing

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
just assume that when you're wearing

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.350 
just assume that when you're wearing
this<00:04:57.620> out<00:04:57.860> you're<00:04:58.100> going<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.460> act<00:04:58.670> ladylike

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
this out you're going to act ladylike

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.130 
this out you're going to act ladylike
and<00:04:59.810> be<00:05:00.650> very<00:05:00.860> gentle<00:05:01.420> so<00:05:02.420> that<00:05:02.600> way<00:05:02.810> these

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
and be very gentle so that way these

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.100 
and be very gentle so that way these
stones<00:05:03.500> don't<00:05:03.830> fall<00:05:04.160> out<00:05:04.480> obviously<00:05:05.480> if<00:05:05.900> your

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
stones don't fall out obviously if your

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.810 
stones don't fall out obviously if your
rough<00:05:06.320> with<00:05:06.500> this<00:05:06.680> they<00:05:07.160> will<00:05:07.400> eventually

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
rough with this they will eventually

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.130 
rough with this they will eventually
fall<00:05:08.750> out<00:05:10.210> okay<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.270> this<00:05:11.540> last<00:05:11.840> part<00:05:12.110> is

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
fall out okay so this last part is

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.140 
fall out okay so this last part is
optional<00:05:12.740> but<00:05:12.920> if<00:05:13.040> you<00:05:13.160> want<00:05:13.340> to<00:05:13.430> add<00:05:13.610> in<00:05:13.940> an

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
optional but if you want to add in an

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.420 
optional but if you want to add in an
lining<00:05:14.540> to<00:05:14.660> make<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:14.990> look<00:05:15.290> extra<00:05:15.770> fancy<00:05:15.800> you

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
lining to make it look extra fancy you

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.890 
lining to make it look extra fancy you
could<00:05:16.610> do<00:05:16.730> this

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
could do this

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.980 
could do this
so<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.530> basically<00:05:18.740> cut<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.640> rectangle<00:05:20.510> around<00:05:20.870> my

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
so I basically cut a rectangle around my

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.390 
so I basically cut a rectangle around my
box<00:05:21.670> next<00:05:22.670> what<00:05:22.850> I'm<00:05:22.970> going<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.240> do<00:05:23.510> is<00:05:24.400> fold

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
box next what I'm going to do is fold

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.810 
box next what I'm going to do is fold
the<00:05:25.820> raw<00:05:25.940> edges<00:05:26.210> in<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:27.020> then<00:05:27.460> glue<00:05:28.460> the

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
the raw edges in and then glue the

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.840 
the raw edges in and then glue the
fabric<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.690> each<00:05:30.350> end<00:05:30.770> of<00:05:31.100> my<00:05:31.370> box

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
fabric to each end of my box

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.810 
fabric to each end of my box
I'm<00:05:31.910> not<00:05:32.210> going<00:05:32.510> to<00:05:32.660> glue<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.410> sides<00:05:33.680> in<00:05:34.040> just

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
I'm not going to glue the sides in just

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.940 
I'm not going to glue the sides in just
because<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:35.300> going<00:05:35.480> to<00:05:35.600> make<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:36.440> box

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
because it's going to make the box

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.490 
because it's going to make the box
harder<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.640> close<00:05:37.910> so<00:05:38.630> just<00:05:38.690> make<00:05:39.290> sure<00:05:39.320> to

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
harder to close so just make sure to

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.920 
harder to close so just make sure to
tuck<00:05:39.950> in<00:05:40.130> your<00:05:40.250> raw<00:05:40.400> edges<00:05:40.670> and<00:05:41.090> that's<00:05:41.720> all

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
tuck in your raw edges and that's all

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.510 
tuck in your raw edges and that's all
you<00:05:42.050> have<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.350> do<00:05:42.500> it<00:05:42.710> would<00:05:42.860> still<00:05:43.190> look<00:05:43.430> very

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
you have to do it would still look very

00:05:43.520 --> 00:06:00.060 
you have to do it would still look very
nice

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.590
