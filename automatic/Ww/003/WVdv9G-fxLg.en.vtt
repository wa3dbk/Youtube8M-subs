 Miguel Marón Manzur 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.629
 breeding bluefin tuna in captivity is very complicated only japan got it 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.589
 after 40 years of research 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.759
 but for the first time in Europe in Murcia they have achieved the first natural laying 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.119
 of eggs in record time now we have to get them to reach adulthood 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.480
 this small than a red of little more than 10 centimeters 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.340
 is the realization of a great achievement the first time in Europe is this one 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.750
 does in quantity without hormone injection in a completely natural way the challenge 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.700
 now it's that survival 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.950
 grows very fast to home a large size up to 400 kilos 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.950
 and also has another difference with the pt ball that grows very sad 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.460
 maintain body temperature a little bit above the water treatment of 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.550
 sea ​​that makes it have an energetic burst the protecom resale very high 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.379
 for this day is issued science works with specimens captured in the sea 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.329
 are three of the juveniles 500 gram pounds born at the beginning of summer 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.730
 past the investigation continues in this farm 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.010
 for martín spreads an agreement for a year or two 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.600
 to compare the effort 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 correct response to artificial food from natural food 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 bluefin tuna is one of the most lucrative markets 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.590
 about 35 euros a kilo in the main consumer market in Japan 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.750
 the copies easily exceed ten thousand euros 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.060
 the massive and illegal capture put him on the verge of extinction in 2005 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.440
 the international commission for the conservation of tuna 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.370
 points out that restrictions on fishing have put us on the path of 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.280
 recovery of the species count 60% probability 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.200
 for others this is insufficient 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.210
 iccat recommends catches between 0 and 13 thousand five hundred tons 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.270
 if we really want 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.510
 a safe recovery 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.770
 of this population these light captures should not exceed six thousand 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.970
 tons 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.680
 in Murcia are optimists 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.940
 They hope to have the formula to feed them before the next month of 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.710
 May when a new egg laying occurs 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.310
 if so, the specimens born in captivity manage to reach the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.239
 productive 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.430
 the cycle will have closed
