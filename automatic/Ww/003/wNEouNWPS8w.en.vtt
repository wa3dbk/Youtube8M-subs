hello people of Internet my name is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.840 
hello people of Internet my name is
creation<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.619> today<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.130> thought<00:00:20.550> I'd<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
creation and today I thought I'd do a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.820 
creation and today I thought I'd do a
video<00:00:21.119> showing<00:00:21.539> off<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> Phantom<00:00:22.289> camouflage

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
video showing off the Phantom camouflage

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.460 
video showing off the Phantom camouflage
that<00:00:23.279> we<00:00:23.670> got<00:00:23.880> earlier<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.660> week<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.230> you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that we got earlier this week if you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.109 
that we got earlier this week if you
complete<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.070> film<00:00:26.310> training<00:00:26.820> assignment

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
complete the film training assignment

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.480 
complete the film training assignment
now<00:00:27.599> I'm<00:00:27.869> not<00:00:28.109> really<00:00:28.289> sure<00:00:28.410> why<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.890> camo

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
now I'm not really sure why the camo

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.700 
now I'm not really sure why the camo
looks<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> snake<00:00:30.359> maybe<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.439> hint

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
looks like a snake maybe it's a hint

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.090 
looks like a snake maybe it's a hint
maybe<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.850> die<00:00:33.180> strolling<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.559> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
maybe it's just die strolling but it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.729 
maybe it's just die strolling but it
looks<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.579> good<00:00:35.880> especially<00:00:36.559> on<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
looks really good especially on the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.250 
looks really good especially on the
transport<00:00:38.340> chopper<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.660> would<00:00:39.809> refer

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
transport chopper I think it would refer

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.619 
transport chopper I think it would refer
to<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:40.800> often<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> dragon<00:00:42.329> battle

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
to it more often as the dragon battle

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.209 
to it more often as the dragon battle
bus<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.290> once<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> strap<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> camera

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
bus because once you strap the camera

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.150 
bus because once you strap the camera
onto<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.420> does<00:00:45.690> look<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.440> flying

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
onto it really does look like a flying

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160 
onto it really does look like a flying
dragon<00:00:48.140> maybe<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.329> they're

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
dragon maybe but as we know they're

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.260 
dragon maybe but as we know they're
going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:52.949> other<00:00:53.100> camels<00:00:53.489> added<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
going to be some other camels added to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.930 
going to be some other camels added to
the<00:00:54.390> game<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.289> game<00:00:55.469> progresses<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the game as the game progresses but I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
the game as the game progresses but I
was<00:00:57.120> kind<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.390> wondering<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.899> else<00:00:58.440> are<00:00:58.710> we

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
was kind of wondering what else are we

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.260 
was kind of wondering what else are we
going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> get<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.760> phantom

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
going to get with these phantom

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.900 
going to get with these phantom
assignments<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.500> far<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.160> gotten<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.640> dog

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
assignments so far we have gotten a dog

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.080 
assignments so far we have gotten a dog
tag<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.739> camouflage<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.159> course<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.909> can

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
tag and camouflage of course you can

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.690 
tag and camouflage of course you can
expect<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.170> Megalodon<00:01:07.799> camo<00:01:08.310> or

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
expect to see the Megalodon camo or

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.359 
expect to see the Megalodon camo or
ghillie<00:01:09.240> suit<00:01:09.630> running<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> shark

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
ghillie suit running around as a shark

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.640 
ghillie suit running around as a shark
on<00:01:11.580> laughs<00:01:11.880> I'm<00:01:12.450> pretty<00:01:12.840> sure<00:01:13.049> no<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.470> would

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
on laughs I'm pretty sure no one would

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
on laughs I'm pretty sure no one would
notice<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.430> know<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.180> all<00:01:15.450> run<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.930> but

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
notice we know we would all run it but

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
notice we know we would all run it but
I'm<00:01:16.830> starting<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:17.850> phantom

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
I'm starting to think that these phantom

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.170 
I'm starting to think that these phantom
assignments<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:19.080> clues<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.369> some<00:01:20.759> bigger

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
assignments are clues to some bigger

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
assignments are clues to some bigger
easter<00:01:21.720> egg<00:01:21.869> because<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.220> hard

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
easter egg because they are really hard

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
easter egg because they are really hard
to<00:01:23.729> figure<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:25.020> time<00:01:25.320> progresses<00:01:25.710> I'm

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
to figure out and as time progresses I'm

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160 
to figure out and as time progresses I'm
pretty<00:01:26.340> sure<00:01:26.549> these<00:01:26.759> clues<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.900> add

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pretty sure these clues are going to add

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
pretty sure these clues are going to add
up<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.070> guys<00:01:29.220> haven't<00:01:29.460> started<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
up if you guys haven't started to

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.730 
up if you guys haven't started to
phantom<00:01:30.329> assignments<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.439> should

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
phantom assignments I think you should

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.280 
phantom assignments I think you should
really<00:01:31.979> try<00:01:32.280> them<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.840> assignment

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
really try them out now this assignment

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620 
really try them out now this assignment
was<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:35.189> hard<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.549> me<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
was really hard for me because of the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
was really hard for me because of the
jet<00:01:36.930> kills<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.560> am<00:01:38.159> NOT<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> jet<00:01:38.820> pro<00:01:39.090> well<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.259> used

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
jet kills I am NOT a jet pro well I used

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.499 
jet kills I am NOT a jet pro well I used
to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:42.060> playing<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
to be when I was playing with a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.830 
to be when I was playing with a
controller<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.229> haven't<00:01:43.649> adjusted<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:45.360> some<00:01:45.750> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
controller I haven't adjusted to some of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.469 
controller I haven't adjusted to some of
the<00:01:45.930> vehicles<00:01:46.409> especially<00:01:46.680> jets<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.790> pc<00:01:48.240> and

equipped it to any other vehicle but the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.250 
equipped it to any other vehicle but the
transports<00:03:11.920> they<00:03:12.400> look<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.819> lot<00:03:13.329> better<00:03:13.900> with

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260

the Phantom camo and I think it's worth

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.869 
the Phantom camo and I think it's worth
just<00:03:17.319> for<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.530> anyway<00:03:18.220> now<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.549> I<00:03:18.760> started

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
just for that anyway now that I started

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.589 
just for that anyway now that I started
to<00:03:19.209> think<00:03:19.449> about<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.079> Megaton<00:03:20.730> camo<00:03:21.730> /

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
to think about the Megaton camo /

to think about the Megaton camo /
ghillie<00:03:22.989> suit<00:03:23.349> I<00:03:23.560> can't<00:03:23.889> stop<00:03:24.280> thinking<00:03:24.699> about

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
ghillie suit I can't stop thinking about

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.899 
ghillie suit I can't stop thinking about
it<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.659> dice<00:03:25.930> get<00:03:26.319> onto<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:27.459> should<00:03:27.760> be<00:03:27.879> a

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
it so dice get onto that it should be a

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.330 
it so dice get onto that it should be a
gadget<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:28.659> allows<00:03:29.139> you<00:03:29.379> to<00:03:29.440> swim<00:03:29.829> faster

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
speaking of swimming faster I do think

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.550 
speaking of swimming faster I do think
there<00:03:32.709> should<00:03:33.280> be<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.459> perk<00:03:33.849> that<00:03:34.750> allows<00:03:35.260> you

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
there should be a perk that allows you

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.430 
there should be a perk that allows you
to<00:03:35.620> swim<00:03:36.099> faster<00:03:36.669> there<00:03:37.599> is<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.900> lot<00:03:38.409> of

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
to swim faster there is a lot of

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.189 
to swim faster there is a lot of
swimming<00:03:38.949> in<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.579> naval<00:03:39.909> strike<00:03:40.150> maps<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.840> it

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
swimming in the naval strike maps and it

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.809 
swimming in the naval strike maps and it
would<00:03:41.349> have<00:03:41.470> been<00:03:41.560> nice<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.829> have<00:03:42.129> kind<00:03:42.639> of<00:03:42.729> a

would have been nice to have kind of a

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.330 
would have been nice to have kind of a
perk<00:03:43.120> loadout<00:03:43.569> that<00:03:44.169> would<00:03:44.349> allow<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:44.769> to

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
perk loadout that would allow you to

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.830 
perk loadout that would allow you to
fasten<00:03:46.239> your<00:03:46.750> mobility<00:03:47.229> so<00:03:47.949> mantling

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
swimming and running there is already a

swimming and running there is already a
sprint<00:03:52.599> perk<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:53.079> know<00:03:53.199> that<00:03:53.379> but<00:03:53.889> I<00:03:54.099> think<00:03:54.220> that

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
sprint perk I know that but I think that

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.439 
sprint perk I know that but I think that
I<00:03:54.699> should<00:03:54.760> really<00:03:55.389> look<00:03:55.810> into<00:03:56.019> a<00:03:56.620> mobility

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
I should really look into a mobility

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.780 
I should really look into a mobility
perk<00:03:58.449> set<00:03:59.019> but<00:03:59.500> anyway<00:03:59.859> let<00:04:00.159> me<00:04:00.190> know<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.489> guys
