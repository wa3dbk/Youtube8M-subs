00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.759
 hi people today we get 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.490
 found for the opening of eight 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.949
 little surprise balls and containing 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.599
 pokemon magnets that's so I found 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.250
 that very recently and I was holding 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.890
 absolutely to make you an opening 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.570
 so I've never seen the magnets he 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.050
 is inside we will discover all that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.250
 together 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.869
 in any case I find this opening 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 really cool it's getting closer 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.170
 little bit of the pledge that I open 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
 usually with you with small 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 figurines except this time we 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.900
 will be entitled to pokemon magnets so 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 Well listen, let's look a little 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.530
 little a little doc ball that looks like 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.660
 that there are all the colors like you 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 can see it's pretty cool and we 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.910
 will start opening so at each 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.800
 time there is a little bit of tape so 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.820
 my best friend who will always be there 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.190
 to help us 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.079
 so I hope I can succeed 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.100
 open them without too much trouble 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.690
 or else I'm having a break like 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.789
 usually in excellent cairo I 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 pushed the little balls and we open the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.500
 first and we see one of eden then 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.850
 frankly it looks super nice at 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.710
 not what you think we're going to open it 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.360
 right now to watch a little bit 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.700
 How's it going 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.080
 ok so it's a very very beautiful magnets 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.550
 so we stick on his fridge 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.140
 I had already opened magnets 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.090
 but it was decreed you know and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.709
 it was a lot older than that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.720
 it's really new with xy 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:26.429
 and in that of Eden to begin 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.660
 I think it's too stylish I hope we 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.610
 is going to have a good pick of the blow we are going 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.410
 watch as there is a small flyer all 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.300
 the magnets that we can have so here 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.679
 the different magnets that we can have 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.869
 because it would be cool it's all 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.130
 have them there are six different ones good 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.929
 I took my boxes so maybe 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.119
 with luck we can all 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.220
 the assets of the coup go it's gone again 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.810
 we continue with the second box 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.310
 So I think the most difficult 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.679
 in the story it's to remove the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.160
 scotch once the scot is removed 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.200
 and well life is reaching us 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.550
 let's go for the second then 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.239
 here I'm just that I'm stuck on 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.340
 the fingers it's just too complicated and 

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.390
 we left and we have this time 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.280
 a fenech 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.170
 ok with will it was one that I wanted 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.629

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.489

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.349

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.000

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.440

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.050

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.410
 not if they did it on purpose for us 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.700
 masters when I do not know what they 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.590
 could have done it on purpose but in any 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.270
 case I am really super happy and 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.970
 well the pic killed what's funny it's 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.130
 that we opened 6 6 different and we 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.600
 had the six what so suddenly he we 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.830
 there are two left to put doubles but 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.810
 we had the entire collection 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.580
 it's really a cool opening 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.020
 I find I am really happy and 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.660
 So suddenly we left two 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.090
 we are gone we are going to open 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.169
 last two surprise boxes have 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.720
 the whole collection it was really this 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.740
 that I absolutely wanted and frankly 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.030
 I did well to take eight because 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.010
 than suddenly as I took 8 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.100
 and here we go we're all gone 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.410
 with the last one finally the front 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.880
 last little magnets and it's about 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.289
 marie are so it's pretty cool 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.120
 to have husband are I'd rather have fed up 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.830
 are admitted skull that even if I did 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.229
 nothing against mutu skull fans 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.430
 that's so cool this little husband 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.770
 without play you still shows them a 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.840
 time he's really cool with the 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.729
 smile he's having fun so 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.110
 it's really what we want 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.570
 to be happy in life is the most 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.919
 important is the last little box 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.150
 it would have been a fairly short opening 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.210
 but it's nice I hope she 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.169
 will be pleased it is abba mucus cult 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.560
 to finish well 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.750
 we have the tiny little one here and 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.340
 well super nice listen I found 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.050
 this opening really cool so 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.539
 so I 'm debating it and I 'm going to 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.560
 show the eight magnets we have 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:20.370
 had two we had the chance 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.760
 to have the six magnets different from the 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.770
 series 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.389
 I would have liked that he puts even so good 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.770
 here for next time if he 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:27.990
 listen to me if he hears me the same if it 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.639
 would surprise me secret magnets 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.200
 why do not you see a magnets 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.229
 legendary why not that could have 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.270
 to be other top to have a chance on 10 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.130
 I do not know to fall on a magnets 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.780
 legendary it would be really cool 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.970
 So here's something I really hope 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.620
 this opening of small balls 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.580
 surprises with magnets inside 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.229
