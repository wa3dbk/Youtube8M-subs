00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
in this game and this is one of my

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.439 
in this game and this is one of my
all-time<00:00:32.920> favorite<00:00:33.429> flash<00:00:33.609> games<00:00:33.909> ever<00:00:34.149> and

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
all-time favorite flash games ever and

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.869 
all-time favorite flash games ever and
it's<00:00:34.749> been<00:00:34.899> ported<00:00:35.289> to<00:00:35.499> mobile<00:00:35.979> devices<00:00:36.609> so

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
it's been ported to mobile devices so

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.849 
it's been ported to mobile devices so
and<00:00:37.329> that's<00:00:37.479> why<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.629> say<00:00:37.809> reimagining<00:00:38.559> cuz<00:00:38.739> it

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
and that's why I say reimagining cuz it

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.189 
and that's why I say reimagining cuz it
was<00:00:38.979> never<00:00:39.129> on<00:00:39.309> mobile<00:00:39.699> devices<00:00:39.940> before<00:00:40.510> until

was never on mobile devices before until

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.379 
was never on mobile devices before until
this<00:00:41.440> point<00:00:41.769> so<00:00:42.069> what<00:00:42.550> is<00:00:42.729> this<00:00:42.940> game<00:00:43.179> what's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.389

these things especially if you played
through<00:03:39.669> the<00:03:39.790> whole<00:03:39.940> game<00:03:40.150> more<00:03:40.480> than<00:03:40.690> once

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
through the whole game more than once

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.080 
through the whole game more than once
you're<00:03:41.949> gonna<00:03:42.040> need<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.280> spend<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.579> lot<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.970> that

money<00:03:43.389> on<00:03:43.510> these<00:03:44.049> upgrades<00:03:44.560> because<00:03:44.650> they

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
money on these upgrades because they

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.159 
money on these upgrades because they
incrementally<00:03:45.790> exponentially<00:03:46.690> get<00:03:46.870> higher

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
incrementally exponentially get higher

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.439 
incrementally exponentially get higher
after<00:03:47.979> each<00:03:48.159> upgrade<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:48.970> just<00:03:49.150> keep<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.299> in

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
after each upgrade so just keep that in

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.089 
after each upgrade so just keep that in
