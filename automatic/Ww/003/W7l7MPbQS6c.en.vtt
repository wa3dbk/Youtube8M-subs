00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello I hope you are super good 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.970
 Well today I come to talk 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.929
 as it says in the title of the video about 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.600
 two facial creams from libya asia is a 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.970
 super brand recognized a brand that 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.780
 I can say that most of your 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.940
 products are good but good if 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.779
 you have faults in some products but 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:35.210
 x I come to talk about two especially 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:37.510
 two specific and good I hope you 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.770
 is not so clear so let's start 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.610
 ok to the first cream that I'm going to 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:49.290
 to talk is about the lukewarm rinsed 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:53.160
 natural with advanced uv protection 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.550
 It is a facial and body cream 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.620
 blackberry and active extract saw 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.870
 lightening for all skin types is like this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.510
 I'm going to give you some approaches ok 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.670
 Well I liked the attention very much 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 new I think so I called a lot the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.420
 attention that is to clarify both 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.560
 facial and body 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.330
 I was very excited, it came out relatively 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.600
 economically I do not remember the price so 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.049
 that's why I'm not going to tell you one such 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.210
 never comes close to what it is but it is not 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.850
 It is not an expensive cream 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.080
 okay 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:38.090
 brings 100 milliliters and good is great 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.450
 It's good because I feel that I feel that 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.500
 protects me from the sun's rays be 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.420
 I feel I feel hydrated a little 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.830
 I use that keeps my skin as well as 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.050
 city â€‹â€‹and how I like what I know 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.180
 feel when you put the cream on your face 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.340
 I use it only on my face, I have not 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.400
 tested on the body and what I like 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.770
 is that it absorbs very fast or is it 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.490
 I put it five minutes before maybe 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.130
 if he's going to throw me base or X 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.540
 then it absorbs very fast and that 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.980
 like 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.329
 has a rich smell smells like everything with 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.129
 specific 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.680
 almost all the pains are the same I do not 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.240
 annoying for nothing divine good that lasts 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.720
 quite the cream I hold 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.380
 as poquitico and treated with a 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.390
 pass and I'm going then it 's 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.670
 well now what happened to this product 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.250
 that I'm not clear or I have some 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.550
 spots on the face and does not clarify 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.010
 Now I notice that I did not clarify anything 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.200
 I've been testing for a month and has not done it 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.760
 so I do not know if I have to give it 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.350
 like that more time I was again 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.700
 slow may need more time but 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.040
 I 'm not going to stop using it anyway 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.090
 I like what I feel in my face 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.220
 when he has made me less but if yes the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.030
 for now I can say that if you are 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.020
 looking to control two already so not 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.430
 you will not work but so will 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.040
 leave as a review and I'll be 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.170
 counting in some other video but for 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.270
 now he has not clarified now if you 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.120
 protects from sunlight and if 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.520
 you want a face cream that protects you 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.390
 of the sun's rays I recommend you 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.000
 and has clarified because it is very very in itself 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.330
 we are talking about protection ok 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.640
 let's continue with the next cream and it's the 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:48.780
 social cream of day hue before libya 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.700
 then it is this little bottle 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.650
 he says he has the protection factor 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.549
 solar of about 15 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.379
 I think it's good, it brings 50 milliliters 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:05.349
 brings half of what the other one brings 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:07.579
 cream and watch and see it is assumed that 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.099
 result that you have to give this cream 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.829
 etchart on the face is nuanced 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.760
 take off those glitters so for 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:19.530
 the oily skin is perfect 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:25.350
 if he does what he says and I loved it 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.430
 I use them by mixing it with the base and 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:34.360
 I put 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:36.100
 to see about 34.5 dots of bases and ni 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.360
 it's even a lot in fact it's with the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:46.570
 little finger one here here here here and 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:49.479
 here and the cream as if five points 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.280
 even I placed them next to the base and 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.690
 then with my hands totally in Libya 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.520
 you can do it with a brush like you 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.639
 want 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.560
 mixed tatata and I'm doing it and still 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:05.470
 so it turns out to me then it's too much 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.229
 Great indeed in use the 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.410
 mornings I go to ignacio and obviously 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:15.729
 there is no make-up more than all in 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.490
 the zone t and if it leaves me obviously I do not 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.710
 Leaves the skin completely matte as if 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.720
 I was using a powder or something 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.910
 obviously not but if you notice the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.070
 difference of that bright one is that I think 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.980
 I'm having it right now in the 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.590
 camera 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.630
 if you notice a lot the difference and if 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:39.010
 I love the result I also feel 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.200
 that protects me very much then 20 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.770
 points to nidia for taking this cream not 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.590
 I know if it's old 260 with the I bought it 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.020
 and I repeat it is not so expensive ok it is possible 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.320
 buy and it is also a product that lasts 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.020
 pretty although I have to say both 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.130
 use the two together so 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.930
 hard I stop I wash my face and I've 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:06.560
 made this cream 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:10.160
 on my face I leave five minutes for 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.970
 absorb well then if I'm going to use it goes to 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.620
 be and linked this cream as I said 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.360
 previously with the base and he has 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.440
 done and they both work for me 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:24.259
 wonder and I have twice as much protection 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.870
 solar so I do not expect anything if they have them 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.210
 tell me if you have to be for more time 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.340
 I already have a month tell me if you have 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.030
 clarified this I already have faith of truth that 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.759
 I clarified the spots that I have 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.940
 acne product then 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:43.340
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:48.160
 give me a comment on a moonlight if you 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.160
 liked and share it with your friends
