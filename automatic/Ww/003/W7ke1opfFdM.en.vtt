00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.050 
it's all dry cuz that would be the best
so<00:03:36.420> then<00:03:36.689> it<00:03:36.840> would<00:03:36.930> earn<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> plate<00:03:38.040> turn<00:03:38.819> out

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
so then it would earn a plate turn out

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.710 
so then it would earn a plate turn out
like<00:03:39.209> this

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
like this

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.210 
like this
now<00:03:40.230> on<00:03:40.379> the<00:03:40.470> back<00:03:40.829> you<00:03:41.159> got<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.370> draw<00:03:41.730> like<00:03:43.220> kind

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
now on the back you got a draw like kind

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:56.539 
now on the back you got a draw like kind
of<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.430> squiggly<00:03:54.079> like<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:56.280> there's

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
of like a squiggly like that so there's

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.979 
of like a squiggly like that so there's
the<00:03:56.819> hood<00:03:57.439> and<00:03:58.439> then<00:03:58.680> it's<00:03:58.859> like<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.989> so

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
the hood and then it's like that so

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.509 
the hood and then it's like that so
there<00:04:01.260> he<00:04:01.829> is

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
there he is

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:12.109 
there he is
there's<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.879> normal<00:04:05.780> guy<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.200> guess<00:04:08.389> there<00:04:09.389> he<00:04:10.079> is
