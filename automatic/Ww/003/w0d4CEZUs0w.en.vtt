00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
Baris having good career in Calgary so I

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.050 
Baris having good career in Calgary so I
think<00:01:26.710> that's<00:01:27.040> one<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.250> our<00:01:27.430> strengths<00:01:27.850> and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
think that's one of our strengths and

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.630 
think that's one of our strengths and
then<00:01:28.299> I<00:01:28.540> think<00:01:29.229> we<00:01:29.409> we're<00:01:29.740> fast<00:01:30.070> team<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.520> got

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
then I think we we're fast team you got

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.550 
then I think we we're fast team you got
a<00:01:30.670> lot<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:30.940> skilled<00:01:31.240> skilled<00:01:31.510> forwards<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.350> a

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
a lot of skilled skilled forwards and a

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.740 
a lot of skilled skilled forwards and a
lot<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:32.770> fast<00:01:33.040> forwards<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.610> then<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.150> we<00:01:34.630> got

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
lot of fast forwards and then and we got

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.630 
lot of fast forwards and then and we got
to<00:01:34.869> use<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.680> big<00:01:35.830> ice<00:01:36.010> surface<00:01:36.430> and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
to use that on the big ice surface and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.740 
to use that on the big ice surface and
yeah<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:36.970> might<00:01:37.119> be<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.299> little<00:01:37.420> advantage

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
yeah that might be a little advantage

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.740 
yeah that might be a little advantage
for<00:01:37.990> us<00:01:38.460> chase<00:01:39.460> in<00:01:39.700> question<00:01:40.119> for<00:01:40.330> you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
for us chase in question for you

strengths<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:41.440> challenges<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:42.490> this

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
strengths and challenges of this

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.149 
strengths and challenges of this
Canadian<00:01:43.360> team<00:01:43.540> yeah<00:01:44.200> obviously<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.920> think<00:01:45.040> the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
Canadian team yeah obviously I think the

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.830 
Canadian team yeah obviously I think the
the<00:01:45.610> forwards<00:01:45.970> are<00:01:46.060> probably<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.450> big

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
the forwards are probably the big

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.480 
the forwards are probably the big
strength<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.770> look<00:01:47.950> up<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.310> down<00:01:48.369> the

man<00:02:37.180> shot<00:02:37.540> up<00:02:37.840> close<00:02:38.320> do<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.800> see<00:02:38.920> yourself

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
man shot up close do you see yourself

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.440 
man shot up close do you see yourself
blocking<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:40.080> what<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.110> have<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:43.090> I'm

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
blocking it what I have to but I'm

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.880 
blocking it what I have to but I'm
probably<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.230> play<00:02:44.440> them<00:02:44.590> I'm<00:02:44.710> probably

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
probably if you play them I'm probably

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.950 
probably if you play them I'm probably
going<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.190> tell<00:02:45.340> them<00:02:45.550> yeah<00:02:46.420> we<00:02:46.540> got<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.780> take

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
going to tell them yeah we got to take

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.240 
going to tell them yeah we got to take
him<00:02:47.080> away<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.380> he<00:02:47.470> doesn't<00:02:47.500> get<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.950> shoot<00:02:48.100> it

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
him away so he doesn't get to shoot it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.770 
him away so he doesn't get to shoot it
because<00:02:48.700> if<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:48.940> shoot<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.300> there's<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.630> good

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
because if you shoot it there's a good

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.750 
because if you shoot it there's a good
chance<00:02:49.990> going<00:02:50.350> in<00:02:50.500> what<00:02:51.430> are<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.550> looking
