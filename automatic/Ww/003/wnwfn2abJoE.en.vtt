00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.330 

and<00:00:06.470> I've<00:00:06.620> switched<00:00:06.830> to<00:00:07.040> a<00:00:07.069> little<00:00:07.250> bit

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
and I've switched to a little bit

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.990 
and I've switched to a little bit
smaller<00:00:07.610> gouge

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.220 

you<00:00:15.000> don't<00:00:15.120> want<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.300> show<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> gouging<00:00:16.049> too

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
you don't want to show the gouging too

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.179 
you don't want to show the gouging too
far<00:00:16.500> otherwise<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.010> gonna<00:00:17.100> catch<00:00:20.030> okay<00:00:22.189> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
far otherwise it's gonna catch okay and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.370 
far otherwise it's gonna catch okay and
that's<00:00:23.610> pretty<00:00:23.790> much<00:00:23.910> gonna<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.750> shape<00:00:25.230> of

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that's pretty much gonna be the shape of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.519 
that's pretty much gonna be the shape of
this<00:00:25.529> ring<00:00:26.369> holder<00:00:27.020> okay<00:00:28.020> at<00:00:28.200> this<00:00:28.410> point

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
this ring holder okay at this point

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.589 
this ring holder okay at this point
normally<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> normally<00:00:29.430> do<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.939> sand<00:00:30.450> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
normally what I normally do is sand the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
normally what I normally do is sand the
piece<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.079> it's<00:00:31.680> something<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.250> I'd

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
piece and it's something like this I'd

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.220 
piece and it's something like this I'd
start<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:32.850> about<00:00:32.970> 180<00:00:33.300> grit<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:33.930> work<00:00:34.079> my

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
start with about 180 grit and work my

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.069 
start with about 180 grit and work my
way<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.560> at<00:00:34.950> least<00:00:35.190> 400<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:35.880> maybe<00:00:36.090> 600<00:00:36.720> grit

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
way up to at least 400 or maybe 600 grit

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.720 
way up to at least 400 or maybe 600 grit
I'll<00:00:37.320> also<00:00:37.530> slow<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> lathe<00:00:38.280> down<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
I'll also slow the lathe down the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.550 
I'll also slow the lathe down the
rotation<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> lathe<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.440> adjust

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
rotation of the lathe and I will adjust

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.380 
rotation of the lathe and I will adjust
the<00:00:40.800> belts<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.310> that<00:00:43.820> close<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.090> cover

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the belts for that close up my cover

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.569 
the belts for that close up my cover
again<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:51.410> start<00:00:52.410> sanding<00:00:52.679> now<00:00:53.309> there's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
again and start sanding now there's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.180 
again and start sanding now there's
nothing<00:00:53.879> magical<00:00:54.390> about<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:55.019> I'm<00:00:55.199> how<00:00:56.160> I

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
nothing magical about what I'm how I

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.220 
nothing magical about what I'm how I
sand<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:56.969> will<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:57.329> my<00:00:57.539> little<00:00:57.780> foot<00:00:57.929> pedal

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
sand but I will use my little foot pedal

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.090 
sand but I will use my little foot pedal
to<00:00:58.260> slow<00:00:58.559> things<00:00:58.769> down<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.219> bit<00:00:59.519> that

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
to slow things down a little bit that

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.919 
to slow things down a little bit that
fits<00:01:02.100> good<00:01:02.370> nice<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.030> snug<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.539> little<00:01:03.780> bit<00:01:03.870> of

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
fits good nice and snug a little bit of

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.540 
fits good nice and snug a little bit of
glue<00:01:04.080> will<00:01:04.170> hold<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.410> right<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:05.430> you

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
glue will hold it right in and there you

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:22.120 
glue will hold it right in and there you
have<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> ring<00:01:05.880> holder<00:01:06.180> once<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.630> finished

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.990 

and<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.399> see<00:01:23.579> how<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> tool

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and here you can see how the tool

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.550 
and here you can see how the tool
bounces<00:01:24.539> because<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.109> down<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
bounces because it's not down to a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.520 
bounces because it's not down to a
cylinder<00:01:25.920> yet

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.569 

and<00:01:35.530> I'm<00:01:35.619> going<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.799> move<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:36.009> two<00:01:36.189> rest<00:01:36.460> a

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
and I'm going to move the two rest a

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.319 
and I'm going to move the two rest a
little<00:01:36.700> bit<00:01:36.820> closer<00:01:38.609> and<00:01:39.609> as<00:01:39.909> soon<00:01:40.090> as<00:01:40.179> they

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
little bit closer and as soon as they

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.209 
little bit closer and as soon as they
get<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.869> excess<00:01:41.320> off<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.710> here<00:01:41.859> we'll<00:01:42.009> just

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
get the excess off of here we'll just

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.639 
get the excess off of here we'll just
part<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.579> off<00:01:42.700> friction<00:01:43.689> fit<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.020> finish

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
part it off friction fit it and finish

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.959 
part it off friction fit it and finish
the<00:01:44.770> bottom<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.280> that'll<00:01:45.460> be<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.670> end<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.880> the

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
the bottom and that'll be the end of the

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:54.320 
the bottom and that'll be the end of the
piece

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.200 

slow<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:55.560> bit<00:01:59.030> and<00:02:00.030> there

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
slow it down just a little bit and there

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.580 
slow it down just a little bit and there
you<00:02:00.300> have<00:02:00.480> that<00:02:03.230> shut<00:02:04.230> off<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> lathe<00:02:06.410> pop<00:02:07.410> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
you have that shut off the lathe pop it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:31.380 
you have that shut off the lathe pop it
off<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> confetti<00:02:15.570> oil<00:02:16.080> lamp

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.320 

I<00:02:34.740> generally<00:02:35.740> make<00:02:35.800> my<00:02:36.040> boxes<00:02:36.550> out<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.850> maple

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
I generally make my boxes out of maple

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.780 
I generally make my boxes out of maple
burl<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.800> first<00:02:39.010> thing<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.250> need<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.550> do<00:02:39.670> is

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
burl and the first thing I need to do is

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.010 
burl and the first thing I need to do is
to<00:02:39.910> turn<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.240> whole<00:02:40.390> thing<00:02:40.420> down<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.959> a

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
to turn the whole thing down to a

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.970 
to turn the whole thing down to a
cylinder<00:02:41.610> we're<00:02:42.610> doing<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:42.970> now<00:02:43.860> after<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.920> do

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
cylinder we're doing that now after I do

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:54.780 
cylinder we're doing that now after I do
that<00:02:45.130> I'll<00:02:45.580> true<00:02:45.850> up<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.120> top

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.039 

the<00:02:55.790> pencil<00:02:56.120> lines<00:02:56.299> just<00:02:56.569> allowed<00:02:56.870> me<00:02:57.019> to

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
the pencil lines just allowed me to

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.960 
the pencil lines just allowed me to
recenter<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.709> lid<00:02:57.890> after<00:02:58.310> I've<00:02:58.459> parted<00:02:58.849> it

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
recenter the lid after I've parted it

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.040 
recenter the lid after I've parted it
off<00:02:59.090> on<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.360> main<00:02:59.510> body<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.049> box

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:12.680 

and<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.500> remove<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.920> tail<00:03:05.160> center<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:12.540> this

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
and I remove the tail center and this

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.630 
and I remove the tail center and this
will<00:03:12.870> be<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.560> inside<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.040> box<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.460> will

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
will be the inside of the box this will

be the inside of the lid and what you

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.130 
be the inside of the lid and what you
don't<00:03:20.790> want<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> do<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.420> we<00:03:21.540> remove<00:03:21.690> too<00:03:22.110> much

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
don't want to do is we remove too much

don't want to do is we remove too much
material<00:03:22.800> from<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.070> top<00:03:23.250> because<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.700> want

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
material from the top because you want

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.420 
material from the top because you want
the<00:03:24.060> top<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.300> match<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.900> as<00:03:25.080> well<00:03:25.290> as<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.220> can

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
the top to match up as well as you can

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:38.030 
the top to match up as well as you can
with<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.730> lid<00:03:35.120> at<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.210> bottom<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:37.040> but

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
with the lid at the bottom of this but

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.140 
with the lid at the bottom of this but
still<00:03:38.250> get<00:03:38.430> an<00:03:38.520> idea<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:39.000> finished<00:03:39.330> shape

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
still get an idea of a finished shape

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.280 
still get an idea of a finished shape
then<00:03:42.150> she<00:03:42.300> probably<00:03:42.540> mentioned<00:03:42.960> again<00:03:43.170> this

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
then she probably mentioned again this

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.680 
then she probably mentioned again this
is<00:03:43.440> I'm<00:03:43.980> using<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.430> small<00:03:44.760> bowl<00:03:45.000> gouge<00:03:45.300> in<00:03:45.510> this

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
is I'm using a small bowl gouge in this

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.940 
is I'm using a small bowl gouge in this
but<00:03:45.870> there's<00:03:46.020> efening<00:03:46.320> no<00:03:46.470> reason<00:03:46.770> why<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
but there's efening no reason why a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.790 
but there's efening no reason why a
symbol<00:03:47.460> gods<00:03:47.640> wouldn't<00:03:47.940> work<00:03:51.650> keep<00:03:52.650> on

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
symbol gods wouldn't work keep on

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.550 
symbol gods wouldn't work keep on
refining<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.460> shape

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.780 

okay<00:04:01.560> now<00:04:01.709> just<00:04:01.920> kind<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.159> look<00:04:02.310> at<00:04:02.430> your<00:04:02.579> shape

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
okay now just kind of look at your shape

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.520 
okay now just kind of look at your shape
and<00:04:02.849> I'm<00:04:03.090> gonna<00:04:03.209> go<00:04:03.360> back<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.840> base<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.200> it

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
and I'm gonna go back to the base of it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.330 
and I'm gonna go back to the base of it
a<00:04:04.560> little<00:04:04.799> bit

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.369 

the<00:04:10.340> parts<00:04:10.970> on<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.390> just<00:04:11.720> kind<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:11.959> lengthen<00:04:12.290> it

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
the parts on it just kind of lengthen it

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.080 
the parts on it just kind of lengthen it
lengthens<00:04:12.830> it<00:04:13.010> out<00:04:13.129> and<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.580> just<00:04:13.760> makes<00:04:13.970> it

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
lengthens it out and and just makes it

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.199 
lengthens it out and and just makes it
look<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:15.410> little<00:04:15.769> bit<00:04:15.950> more<00:04:16.100> elegant<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.030> we'll

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
look a little bit more elegant so we'll

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.000 
look a little bit more elegant so we'll
use<00:04:17.329> a<00:04:17.359> little<00:04:17.450> superglue<00:04:18.169> here<00:04:18.380> it's<00:04:18.530> just<00:04:18.590> on

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
use a little superglue here it's just on

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.860 
use a little superglue here it's just on
the<00:04:19.040> cardboard<00:04:20.470> I'll<00:04:21.470> put<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.859> piece<00:04:22.160> in<00:04:23.710> and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
the cardboard I'll put that piece in and

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.240 
the cardboard I'll put that piece in and
the<00:04:26.870> next<00:04:27.200> piece<00:04:27.380> we'll<00:04:27.620> put<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:27.919> is<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.250> perch

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
the next piece we'll put in is the perch

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.190 
the next piece we'll put in is the perch
just<00:04:31.250> takes<00:04:31.490> a<00:04:31.610> little<00:04:31.910> bit<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.540> glue<00:04:32.750> too

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
just takes a little bit of the glue too

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.460 
just takes a little bit of the glue too
much<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.590> it<00:04:33.680> squirts<00:04:34.040> out<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:37.280> starts<00:04:37.669> to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
much and it squirts out it starts to

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.840 
much and it squirts out it starts to
look<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.560> little<00:04:39.680> more<00:04:39.830> interesting<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.700> this

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
look a little more interesting and this

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.230 
look a little more interesting and this
is<00:04:44.030> one<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.450> a<00:04:44.479> little<00:04:45.850> loose-fitting<00:04:46.850> so<00:04:47.150> I'm

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
is one is a little loose-fitting so I'm

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.610 
is one is a little loose-fitting so I'm
gonna<00:04:47.450> lecture<00:04:48.229> glue<00:04:48.650> in<00:04:48.800> there<00:04:50.169> and<00:04:51.169> also

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
gonna lecture glue in there and also

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.250 
gonna lecture glue in there and also
hold<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.010> in<00:04:52.100> place<00:04:52.310> so<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:52.910> can<00:04:53.060> see<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.419> and

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
hold it in place so you can see it and

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.020 
hold it in place so you can see it and
the<00:04:54.350> final<00:04:54.800> thing<00:04:55.010> is<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.550> little<00:04:57.610> brass<00:04:58.610> eye

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
the final thing is the little brass eye

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.440 
the final thing is the little brass eye
pin<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:01.280> just<00:05:01.490> get<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.639> little<00:05:01.790> extra<00:05:02.120> glue

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
pin and I just get a little extra glue

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.840 
pin and I just get a little extra glue
on<00:05:02.630> there<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.560> once<00:05:03.979> that<00:05:04.160> dries<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.639> your

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
on there and once that dries that your

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:12.360 
on there and once that dries that your
completed<00:05:05.450> ornament

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.650 

now<00:05:13.370> my<00:05:13.580> Christmas<00:05:13.970> tree<00:05:14.000> owner<00:05:14.390> once<00:05:14.570> I

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
now my Christmas tree owner once I

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.630 
now my Christmas tree owner once I
turned<00:05:14.930> to<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.110> finished<00:05:15.440> diameter<00:05:15.920> about<00:05:16.130> two

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
turned to a finished diameter about two

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.580 
turned to a finished diameter about two
and<00:05:16.760> a<00:05:16.820> quarter<00:05:17.110> we'll<00:05:18.110> take<00:05:18.260> a<00:05:18.290> little<00:05:18.500> bit

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
and a quarter we'll take a little bit

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:35.620 
and a quarter we'll take a little bit
more<00:05:18.710> out<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:18.890> that<00:05:24.730> joins<00:05:25.730> our<00:05:25.940> closest<00:05:26.390> farm

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:50.800 

and<00:05:36.630> see<00:05:36.900> how<00:05:37.050> it<00:05:37.170> fits<00:05:41.510> it's<00:05:42.510> a<00:05:42.570> perfect<00:05:42.960> fit

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.730 

sometimes<00:05:51.810> when<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:51.960> set<00:05:52.200> up<00:05:52.230> my<00:05:52.320> booth<00:05:52.500> for<00:05:52.680> the

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
sometimes when I set up my booth for the

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.380 
sometimes when I set up my booth for the
craft<00:05:52.980> show<00:05:53.130> I'll<00:05:53.490> look<00:05:53.640> at<00:05:53.790> my<00:05:53.910> display<00:05:54.360> and

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
craft show I'll look at my display and

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.430 
craft show I'll look at my display and
I'll<00:05:54.660> wonder<00:05:55.380> do<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:56.490> have<00:05:56.610> too<00:05:56.820> much<00:05:57.350> too<00:05:58.350> much

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
I'll wonder do I have too much too much

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.230 
I'll wonder do I have too much too much
a<00:05:58.560> variety<00:05:58.860> too<00:05:59.250> much<00:05:59.400> of<00:05:59.550> a<00:05:59.580> range<00:05:59.850> of<00:06:00.030> work

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
a variety too much of a range of work

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.120 
a variety too much of a range of work
from<00:06:00.600> you<00:06:01.020> know<00:06:01.140> very<00:06:01.380> inexpensive<00:06:01.950> things

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
from you know very inexpensive things

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.130 
from you know very inexpensive things
like<00:06:02.310> bottle<00:06:02.640> stoppers<00:06:03.090> up<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.480> more

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
like bottle stoppers up to more

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.780 
like bottle stoppers up to more
expensive<00:06:04.380> platters<00:06:05.190> and<00:06:05.400> that<00:06:05.520> kind<00:06:05.700> of

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
expensive platters and that kind of

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.750 
expensive platters and that kind of
things<00:06:06.380> and<00:06:07.380> I<00:06:07.770> look<00:06:07.950> at<00:06:08.040> other<00:06:08.190> craftspeople

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
things and I look at other craftspeople

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.670 
things and I look at other craftspeople
and<00:06:09.060> I<00:06:09.120> see<00:06:09.480> some<00:06:09.930> of<00:06:09.960> them<00:06:10.140> are<00:06:10.260> very<00:06:10.590> very

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
and I see some of them are very very

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.370 
and I see some of them are very very
focused<00:06:11.340> on<00:06:11.430> what<00:06:11.640> they<00:06:11.760> do<00:06:12.230> they<00:06:13.230> do

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
focused on what they do they do
