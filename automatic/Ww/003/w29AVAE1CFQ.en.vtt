00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.370
 this video we will learn to elaborate a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:13.150
 nice pendant in the shape of hearts 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.340
 well let's see how the 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.670
 materials to be used will be strips of 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.849
 paper but in this case they will be two of a 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.669
 single measure other two of another measure and 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.980
 other two of another measure for example I 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:32.110
 the longest I have 28 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.899
 centimeters the other 2 of 24 and the two 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.230
 smaller than 20 centimeters well 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.960
 we will also use some cord a 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:46.060
 lanyard or any tape they have in their 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.800
 house and a stapler or stapler 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.410
 to make our pendant 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.990
 we will place the strips of the largest 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.810
 smaller first we will take the 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.850
 pull longer and we will take our 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:03.570
 cord and we'll put it in the center 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.689
 in this way well after we will take the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 another longer strip and we'll put it 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.680
 on top of it we keep taking the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.060
 that continues to remember that it is the most 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.060
 big to the smallest 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 we put one below 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.740
 and we line up and finally we'll take the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.040
 smaller 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.900
 one up 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.440
 and the other one below and we lined up 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.080
 perfectly 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.510
 well in this way and then 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.510
 we will take our stapler 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.960
 and we will grab all the paper strips 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.880
 together with our cord 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.880
 this way well 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.530
 Now what follows is to take our 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.270
 figure in this way 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.960
 and what we will do is put the ends together 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.960
 from the bottom 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.079
 we put together the smallest 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.780
 and the largest 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.060
 in this way we align 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:30.810
 we will take our stapler again 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.170
 and we will put a staple and finally 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.390
 we finished our pendant 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.100
