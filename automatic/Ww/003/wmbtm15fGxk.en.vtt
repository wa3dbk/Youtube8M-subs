00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.520 
game ended a pretty dull game to be
honest<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:51.050> really<00:04:52.050> could<00:04:52.169> have<00:04:52.199> done<00:04:52.379> with

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
honest and really could have done with

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.679 
honest and really could have done with
some<00:04:52.680> more<00:04:52.800> goals<00:04:53.069> and<00:04:53.340> despite<00:04:54.060> me<00:04:54.240> trying<00:04:54.569> to

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:54.689 
some more goals and despite me trying to

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.529 
some more goals and despite me trying to
get<00:04:54.960> him<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.080> pay<00:04:55.349> extra<00:04:55.530> time<00:04:55.949> he<00:04:56.550> wanted<00:04:57.419> to

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
get him to pay extra time he wanted to

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.270 
get him to pay extra time he wanted to
end<00:04:57.659> much<00:04:57.870> as<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> draw<00:04:58.349> which<00:04:58.770> was<00:04:58.949> kind<00:04:59.189> of

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
end much as a draw which was kind of

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.459 
end much as a draw which was kind of
disappointing<00:04:59.879> to<00:05:00.000> see<00:05:00.150> but<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:01.199> know<00:05:01.289> what

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
disappointing to see but you know what

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.260 
disappointing to see but you know what
can<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.680> do<00:05:01.800> you<00:05:01.830> can't<00:05:02.219> the<00:05:02.400> decide<00:05:02.939> for

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
can you do you can't the decide for

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.320 
can you do you can't the decide for
other<00:05:03.389> people<00:05:03.750> can<00:05:03.900> do<00:05:04.050> so<00:05:04.430> anyway<00:05:05.430> go<00:05:06.240> off

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
other people can do so anyway go off

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.580 
other people can do so anyway go off
into<00:05:06.509> the<00:05:06.659> next<00:05:06.870> game<00:05:07.050> because<00:05:07.319> that's<00:05:07.500> all

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
into the next game because that's all

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:29.939 
and you know that is an amazing finish

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.019 
and you know that is an amazing finish
sure<00:05:30.210> it's<00:05:31.169> just<00:05:31.409> like<00:05:31.680> you<00:05:32.460> don't<00:05:32.610> expect<00:05:32.819> to

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
sure it's just like you don't expect to

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.540 
sure it's just like you don't expect to
see<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.360> from<00:05:33.539> him<00:05:33.779> and<00:05:34.159> while<00:05:35.159> you<00:05:35.279> went<00:05:35.400> in

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
see that from him and while you went in

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.579 
see that from him and while you went in
real<00:05:35.729> life<00:05:35.909> anyway<00:05:36.300> but<00:05:36.779> Alan<00:05:37.169> fee<00:05:37.319> for<00:05:37.500> it

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:37.589 
real life anyway but Alan fee for it

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.110 
real life anyway but Alan fee for it
seems<00:05:37.740> to<00:05:37.889> be<00:05:37.979> commonplace<00:05:38.370> for<00:05:38.669> him<00:05:38.819> to<00:05:38.909> score

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
seems to be commonplace for him to score

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.019 
seems to be commonplace for him to score
goals<00:05:39.150> like<00:05:39.599> that<00:05:39.750> so<00:05:39.990> he<00:05:40.169> went<00:05:40.289> one<00:05:40.469> no<00:05:40.589> up<00:05:40.770> and

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
goals like that so he went one no up and

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:43.399 
goals like that so he went one no up and
we<00:05:42.029> actually<00:05:42.300> came<00:05:42.449> back<00:05:42.690> through<00:05:42.900> a<00:05:42.960> penalty

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
we actually came back through a penalty

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.559 
we actually came back through a penalty
and<00:05:43.589> him<00:05:44.190> taking<00:05:44.400> me<00:05:44.639> out<00:05:44.759> in<00:05:44.969> the<00:05:45.089> box<00:05:45.330> as

defend<00:06:23.099> very<00:06:23.339> well<00:06:23.550> and<00:06:23.729> he<00:06:24.629> gets<00:06:25.620> another

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
defend very well and he gets another

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.129 
defend very well and he gets another
finesse<00:06:26.189> shot<00:06:26.219> so<00:06:26.819> a<00:06:27.029> bottle<00:06:27.810> really

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
finesse shot so a bottle really

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.209 
finesse shot so a bottle really
terrorizing<00:06:28.889> me<00:06:28.979> this<00:06:29.099> game<00:06:29.279> and<00:06:31.099> we<00:06:32.099> actually

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:32.219 
terrorizing me this game and we actually

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.870 
terrorizing me this game and we actually
come<00:06:32.490> back<00:06:32.639> again<00:06:33.409> Ibrahimovic<00:06:34.409> here<00:06:34.680> and<00:06:34.889> I

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
come back again Ibrahimovic here and I

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.519 
come back again Ibrahimovic here and I
was<00:06:36.149> it<00:06:36.419> was<00:06:36.509> pretty<00:06:36.659> stale<00:06:36.930> so<00:06:37.199> I<00:06:37.259> was<00:06:37.380> like

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:37.529 
was it was pretty stale so I was like

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:39.019 
was it was pretty stale so I was like
need<00:06:37.949> to<00:06:38.039> try<00:06:38.190> something<00:06:38.399> a<00:06:38.490> bit<00:06:38.550> different<00:06:38.610> so

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029 
need to try something a bit different so

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:40.399 
need to try something a bit different so
you<00:06:39.089> can<00:06:39.270> see<00:06:39.360> that's<00:06:39.539> why<00:06:39.719> I'm<00:06:39.990> pretty<00:06:40.380> much

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
you can see that's why I'm pretty much

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.910
