00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.440 
hands when we're done with this I'm not
touch<00:01:36.350> all<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.250> obviously<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
touch all right so this is obviously the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
touch all right so this is obviously the
most<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.810> hand<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.259> handy<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.740> light<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
most the hand it's handy and light and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.460 
most the hand it's handy and light and
usually<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.790> works<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> tool<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
usually it works to go to tool right and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.300 
usually it works to go to tool right and
it<00:01:43.590> usually<00:01:43.619> works

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it usually works

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.340 
it usually works
however<00:01:44.880> I've<00:01:45.240> had<00:01:45.450> some<00:01:45.659> occasions<00:01:46.140> where

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
however I've had some occasions where

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.429 
however I've had some occasions where
that<00:01:46.560> does<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.159> work<00:01:48.030> okay<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.229> some

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that does not work okay and in some

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440

that allows the spring mechanism to flow

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.949 
that allows the spring mechanism to flow
through<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.950> trap<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.489> toilet<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.450> it

tool at all you know out at the
campground<00:03:12.299> something<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.109> we've

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
campground something like that we've

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.009 
campground something like that we've
been<00:03:13.799> known<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.099> just<00:03:14.280> use<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.579> stick<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.780> go

been known to just use a stick just go
outside<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.859> find<00:03:17.129> a<00:03:17.220> stick<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.940> just

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
outside you find a stick and you just

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.539 
outside you find a stick and you just
poke<00:03:18.930> around<00:03:19.199> in<00:03:19.560> there<00:03:19.709> until<00:03:19.919> it<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.370> got<00:03:20.459> to

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
poke around in there until it you got to

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.770 
poke around in there until it you got to
be<00:03:20.609> careful<00:03:20.760> because<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.269> end<00:03:21.389> that's<00:03:21.599> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
be careful because the end that's the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.720 
be careful because the end that's the
guy<00:03:21.900> known<00:03:22.319> in<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.560> brain<00:03:22.769> but<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.639> know

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
guy known in the brain but you know

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.580 
guy known in the brain but you know
that's<00:03:23.849> sort<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.239> last<00:03:24.480> note<00:03:24.780> if<00:03:25.199> you<00:03:25.379> lose

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
that's sort of a last note if you lose

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.729 
that's sort of a last note if you lose
your<00:03:25.829> plunger<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.060> had<00:03:27.329> one<00:03:27.870> other<00:03:28.019> occasion

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
your plunger so I had one other occasion

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.189 
your plunger so I had one other occasion
where<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.819> neither<00:03:30.359> of<00:03:30.510> those<00:03:30.629> tools<00:03:30.900> worked

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
where the neither of those tools worked

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.009 
where the neither of those tools worked
we<00:03:31.379> kept<00:03:31.650> having<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:32.099> lot<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.430> slow<00:03:33.180> flow<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.900> we

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
we kept having a lot of slow flow and we

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.849 
we kept having a lot of slow flow and we
get<00:03:34.169> clogged<00:03:34.500> very<00:03:35.190> easily<00:03:35.489> hmm<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.019> there<00:03:37.650> is

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
get clogged very easily hmm so there is

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.830 
get clogged very easily hmm so there is
another<00:03:38.190> technique<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:39.030> use<00:03:39.299> right

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
another technique that I use right

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.360 
another technique that I use right
something's<00:03:40.199> in<00:03:40.319> there<00:03:40.500> blocking<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.340> but

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
something's in there blocking it but

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.059 
something's in there blocking it but
it's<00:03:41.609> not<00:03:42.349> dislodging<00:03:43.349> with<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.590> plunger<00:03:44.040> and

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
it's not dislodging with the plunger and

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.789 
it's not dislodging with the plunger and
the<00:03:44.730> closet<00:03:45.449> auger<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:46.109> right<00:03:46.230> past<00:03:46.290> it

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
the closet auger is going right past it

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.140 
the closet auger is going right past it
whatever<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.489> got<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.879> be<00:03:47.940> careful

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
whatever it is so you got to be careful

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.539 
whatever it is so you got to be careful
with<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.629> tool<00:03:48.930> when<00:03:49.889> you're<00:03:50.010> using<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.400> for

when it does that any of the water
that's<00:05:07.220> still<00:05:07.430> in<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.610> trap<00:05:07.850> you're<00:05:08.570> now

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
that's still in the trap you're now

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.960 
that's still in the trap you're now
potentially<00:05:09.050> sucking<00:05:09.650> up<00:05:09.830> sewer<00:05:10.100> gas<00:05:10.400> right

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
potentially sucking up sewer gas right

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.640 
potentially sucking up sewer gas right
so<00:05:11.120> it's<00:05:11.240> gonna<00:05:11.300> stink<00:05:11.720> it's<00:05:12.050> good<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.410> could

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
so it's gonna stink it's good it could

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.470 
so it's gonna stink it's good it could
stink<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.220> could<00:05:13.340> be<00:05:13.520> some<00:05:14.030> would<00:05:14.180> say<00:05:14.360> it

stink and it could be some would say it
might<00:05:14.570> be<00:05:14.720> a<00:05:14.750> little<00:05:14.870> dangerous<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.440> have<00:05:15.530> to

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
might be a little dangerous you have to

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.990 
might be a little dangerous you have to
be<00:05:15.680> careful<00:05:16.100> but<00:05:16.400> it's<00:05:16.550> gonna<00:05:16.700> you're<00:05:16.940> gonna

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
go through this process pretty quickly

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.040 
go through this process pretty quickly
it<00:05:19.070> takes<00:05:19.370> just<00:05:19.730> 2<00:05:19.940> seconds<00:05:20.390> so<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:20.690> may<00:05:21.020> be

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
it takes just 2 seconds so that may be

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.710 
it takes just 2 seconds so that may be
maybe<00:05:21.440> five<00:05:21.770> seconds<00:05:22.220> you'll<00:05:22.730> take<00:05:23.000> in<00:05:23.570> this

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
maybe five seconds you'll take in this

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.180 
maybe five seconds you'll take in this
