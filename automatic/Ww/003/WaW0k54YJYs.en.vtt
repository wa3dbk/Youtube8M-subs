00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
so recently I've been playing around

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.140 
so recently I've been playing around
with<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.470> program<00:00:04.980> on<00:00:05.160> my<00:00:05.190> Android<00:00:05.790> phone

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
with a program on my Android phone

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.129 
with a program on my Android phone
that's<00:00:06.600> called<00:00:06.899> pcap<00:00:07.620> now<00:00:07.950> pcap<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.139> pocket

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
that's called pcap now pcap is a pocket

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.249 
that's called pcap now pcap is a pocket
Wi-Fi<00:00:10.380> sniffing<00:00:11.340> software<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:13.049> written

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
Wi-Fi sniffing software and it's written

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.939 
Wi-Fi sniffing software and it's written
by<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.440> same<00:00:13.710> guy<00:00:14.009> who<00:00:14.070> brought<00:00:14.460> 'as<00:00:14.910> kismet

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
by the same guy who brought 'as kismet

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.670 
by the same guy who brought 'as kismet
basically<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.039> will<00:00:17.130> intercept<00:00:17.850> packets<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
basically it will intercept packets on a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.700 
basically it will intercept packets on a
Wi-Fi<00:00:19.680> connection<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.439> basically<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.529> can

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
Wi-Fi connection and basically you can

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.009 
Wi-Fi connection and basically you can
see<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.220> everybody<00:00:24.210> else<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.510> doing<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.869> that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
see what everybody else is doing on that

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.620 
see what everybody else is doing on that
Wi-Fi<00:00:25.830> connection<00:00:26.369> now<00:00:26.970> I'm<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.510> go

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
Wi-Fi connection now I'm not going to go

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.710 
Wi-Fi connection now I'm not going to go
into<00:00:28.170> how<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.500> actually<00:00:28.800> use<00:00:28.980> pcap<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.970> this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
into how you actually use pcap in this

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.420 
into how you actually use pcap in this
video<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.560> video<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.309> about

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to use pick up the best place to go is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.350 
to use pick up the best place to go is
to<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> forums<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.730> I'll<00:00:38.730> put<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> link<00:00:39.149> below

but Tim I've been playing around with it
and<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.140> hard<00:00:43.350> way<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.250> too

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and all this hard way it's just too

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910 
and all this hard way it's just too
bulky<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.450> want<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.140> actually

bulky so what I want to do is actually

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.279 
bulky so what I want to do is actually
make<00:00:47.340> something<00:00:47.670> that's<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:48.870> bit<00:00:49.110> more

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
an OTG cable and I just chopped it down

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.020 
an OTG cable and I just chopped it down
and<00:01:40.920> expose<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.640> wires<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:43.549> also<00:01:44.549> ordered

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
and expose the wires here I also ordered

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.929 
and expose the wires here I also ordered
a<00:01:45.210> couple<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.570> OTG<00:01:46.110> cables<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.710> had<00:01:46.860> dim<00:01:47.250> or<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
a couple of OTG cables that had dim or I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.929 
a couple of OTG cables that had dim or I
thought<00:01:48.750> where<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> left-hand<00:01:50.070> bending<00:01:50.729> them

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
thought where a left-hand bending them

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.609 
thought where a left-hand bending them
which<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.570> thought<00:01:51.750> would<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> lot<00:01:52.590> better

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
which I thought would be a lot better

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.219 
which I thought would be a lot better
but<00:01:53.250> became<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> they<00:01:54.450> had<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> rag<00:01:54.840> haven't

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
but became and they had a rag haven't

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.940 
but became and they had a rag haven't
been<00:01:55.380> sold<00:01:55.770> or<00:01:55.979> bending<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.229> it

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
been sold or bending up that way so it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.330 
been sold or bending up that way so it
would<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.219> caused<00:01:59.369> me<00:01:59.549> problems<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.299> I'm

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
would have caused me problems so I'm

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.469 
would have caused me problems so I'm
keeping<00:02:02.340> an<00:02:02.430> eye<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.579> trying<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.119> find<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
keeping an eye out trying to find a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.969 
keeping an eye out trying to find a
left-hand<00:02:03.930> Bend<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.680> think<00:02:04.740> this

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
left-hand Bend one because I think this

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.410 
left-hand Bend one because I think this
would<00:02:05.159> work<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.340> lot<00:02:05.610> better<00:02:05.790> than<00:02:06.119> having<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
would work a lot better than having a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.160 
would work a lot better than having a
straight<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:08.090> also<00:02:09.090> I've<00:02:09.869> got<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
straight one like this also I've got the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
straight one like this also I've got the

chipset<00:02:14.129> here<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:14.760> has<00:02:14.939> come<00:02:15.120> out<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
chipset here this has come out of a

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.309 
chipset here this has come out of a
cheap<00:02:17.189> Chinese<00:02:17.250> knockoff<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.750> actual

cheap Chinese knockoff of the actual

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.860 
cheap Chinese knockoff of the actual
alpha<00:02:19.709> card<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.640> exactly<00:02:20.939> the<00:02:21.060> same<00:02:21.269> chipset

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
alpha card it's exactly the same chipset

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.720 
alpha card it's exactly the same chipset
booked<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.709> quite<00:02:22.920> as<00:02:23.040> powerful<00:02:23.280> as

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
booked it's not quite as powerful as

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.420 
booked it's not quite as powerful as
this<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:25.170> I'm<00:02:25.769> like<00:02:25.980> I've<00:02:26.129> gone<00:02:26.280> ahead

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
this one here I'm like I've gone ahead

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.360 
this one here I'm like I've gone ahead
and<00:02:26.579> doing<00:02:26.909> it<00:02:27.150> had<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.500> mini<00:02:28.500> USB<00:02:28.890> connector

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
and doing it had a mini USB connector

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.690 
and doing it had a mini USB connector
here<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.239> have<00:02:30.420> D<00:02:31.079> soldered<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.799> and<00:02:32.220> I've

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
here and have D soldered that and I've

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.199 
here and have D soldered that and I've
attached<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.420> four<00:02:34.379> wires<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.909> connect

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
attached the four wires here to connect

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.619 
attached the four wires here to connect
straight<00:02:36.480> up<00:02:36.689> to<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.019> usb<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:39.359> reason

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
straight up to the usb and the reason

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.860 
straight up to the usb and the reason
I've<00:02:39.750> done<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.379> a<00:02:41.040> couple<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.400> things<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
I've done that is a couple of things the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.199 
I've done that is a couple of things the
actual<00:02:43.709> solar<00:02:44.159> pads<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:44.879> are<00:02:45.060> designed

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
actual solar pads on here are designed

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.140 
actual solar pads on here are designed
to<00:02:45.599> be<00:02:45.810> repeatedly<00:02:46.680> D<00:02:47.159> soldered<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.790> resold

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
to be repeatedly D soldered and resold

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.729 
to be repeatedly D soldered and resold
it<00:02:48.329> up<00:02:48.450> again<00:02:48.720> they'll<00:02:48.930> end<00:02:49.079> up<00:02:49.170> burning<00:02:49.439> off

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
it up again they'll end up burning off

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.979 
it up again they'll end up burning off
so<00:02:50.639> it's<00:02:51.030> going<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.239> be<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.329> lot<00:02:51.450> easier<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.930> me

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
so it's going to be a lot easier for me

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.569 
so it's going to be a lot easier for me
to<00:02:52.549> say<00:02:53.549> add<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:54.090> left-hand<00:02:54.689> turn<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.579> OTG

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
to say add a left-hand turn and OTG

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.819 
to say add a left-hand turn and OTG
cable<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:57.329> this<00:02:57.569> without<00:02:58.049> actually<00:02:58.650> damaging

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
cable to this without actually damaging

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.190 
cable to this without actually damaging
the<00:02:59.189> pads<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.609> just<00:02:59.939> dissolve<00:03:00.689> them<00:03:00.930> off<00:03:01.079> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the pads I just dissolve them off the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.190 
the pads I just dissolve them off the
wires<00:03:01.409> here<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.269> also<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.540> may<00:03:03.840> want<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.139> use

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
wires here and also I may want to use

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.589 
wires here and also I may want to use
this<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.829> future<00:03:04.859> for<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.730> another<00:03:06.329> project

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
this in future for a another project

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.199 
this in future for a another project
because<00:03:07.200> that's<00:03:08.040> what<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.340> quite<00:03:08.639> often<00:03:08.909> I

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
because that's what I do quite often I

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.800 
because that's what I do quite often I
tend<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:10.129> when<00:03:11.129> I've<00:03:11.370> had<00:03:11.879> enough<00:03:12.299> playing

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
tend to when I've had enough playing

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.319 
tend to when I've had enough playing
with<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.019> project<00:03:13.439> to<00:03:13.560> make<00:03:13.709> them<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.250> tend<00:03:15.239> to

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
with the project to make them I tend to

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.000 
with the project to make them I tend to
use<00:03:15.389> parts<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.109> recycle<00:03:16.620> them<00:03:16.739> in<00:03:16.829> other

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
use parts and recycle them in other

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.059 
use parts and recycle them in other
projects<00:03:17.479> so<00:03:18.479> another<00:03:18.750> idea<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.229> you<00:03:19.470> can<00:03:19.650> do

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
projects so another idea that you can do

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.409 
projects so another idea that you can do
for<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.489> get<00:03:20.760> one<00:03:20.879> of<00:03:20.970> these<00:03:21.060> adapters

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
for this is get one of these adapters

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.300 
for this is get one of these adapters
off<00:03:21.750> eBay<00:03:22.169> then<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.769> use<00:03:22.919> your<00:03:23.069> laptop

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
off eBay then you can use your laptop

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.099 
off eBay then you can use your laptop
card<00:03:23.909> and<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.930> again<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.769> artell<00:03:26.370> RTL<00:03:27.299> 8

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
card and this again is the artell RTL 8

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.030 
card and this again is the artell RTL 8
1<00:03:28.470> 8<00:03:28.739> 7<00:03:29.069> l<00:03:29.430> chipset<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.659> it's<00:03:31.290> very<00:03:31.500> important

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
1 8 7 l chipset and it's very important

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.009 
1 8 7 l chipset and it's very important
they<00:03:32.129> use<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.639> chipset<00:03:33.120> because<00:03:33.449> as<00:03:33.720> of

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
they use that chipset because as of

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.899 
they use that chipset because as of
uploading<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.709> video<00:03:35.069> it's<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.340> only<00:03:35.639> one

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
uploading this video it's the only one

uploading this video it's the only one
that's<00:03:36.120> supported<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:38.239> here<00:03:39.239> there's<00:03:39.930> a

that's supported and here there's a

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.430 
that's supported and here there's a
couple<00:03:40.379> of<00:03:40.440> RTL<00:03:40.919> chips<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.579> they<00:03:42.180> are<00:03:42.479> RTL<00:03:43.169> 8

couple of RTL chips and they are RTL 8
187<00:03:44.280> chips<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.419> this<00:03:45.569> one<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> B<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.760> this

one<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.379> just<00:04:01.709> be<00:04:01.829> wary<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.159> that<00:04:02.959> so<00:04:03.959> before<00:04:04.349> I

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
one so just be wary of that so before I

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.530 
one so just be wary of that so before I
do<00:04:04.560> anything<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.159> start<00:04:05.519> cutting<00:04:05.760> or<00:04:06.090> solder

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
do anything and start cutting or solder

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.300 
do anything and start cutting or solder
in<00:04:06.659> my<00:04:06.780> own<00:04:07.079> I've<00:04:07.199> just<00:04:07.349> laid<00:04:07.590> out<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.949> parts

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
in my own I've just laid out the parts

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.909 
in my own I've just laid out the parts
here<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.720> how<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> think<00:04:10.199> I'm<00:04:10.560> going

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
here and this is how I think I'm going

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.670 
here and this is how I think I'm going
to<00:04:10.979> have<00:04:11.220> them<00:04:11.489> so<00:04:12.180> we've<00:04:12.750> got<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> OTG<00:04:13.290> cable

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
to have them so we've got the OTG cable

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.710 
to have them so we've got the OTG cable
coming<00:04:14.009> down<00:04:14.280> here<00:04:14.699> and<00:04:15.090> now<00:04:15.419> I<00:04:15.449> should<00:04:15.689> be

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
coming down here and now I should be

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.020 
coming down here and now I should be
able<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.989> tuck<00:04:16.259> it<00:04:16.409> back<00:04:16.680> underneath<00:04:17.519> here<00:04:17.880> and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
able to tuck it back underneath here and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.409 
able to tuck it back underneath here and
close<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.419> case<00:04:18.780> when<00:04:19.019> I'm<00:04:19.109> not<00:04:19.259> using<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.859> and

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
close the case when I'm not using it and

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.180 
close the case when I'm not using it and
the<00:04:21.419> antenna<00:04:21.750> I'll<00:04:21.989> have<00:04:22.200> ground<00:04:22.620> about<00:04:22.830> here

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
the antenna I'll have ground about here

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.590 
the antenna I'll have ground about here
not<00:04:23.400> too<00:04:23.610> close<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.029> the<00:04:24.120> car

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
not too close to the car

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.160 
not too close to the car
and<00:04:25.910> shorten<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.000> clock<00:04:27.300> cable<00:04:27.900> here<00:04:28.140> and

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
and shorten this clock cable here and

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.830 
and shorten this clock cable here and
solders<00:04:28.830> on<00:04:28.980> down<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:29.460> at<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.670> bottom<00:04:29.850> so<00:04:30.300> I

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
solders on down here at the bottom so I

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.420 
solders on down here at the bottom so I
think<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.680> going<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.890> work<00:04:32.040> out<00:04:32.280> quite

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
think this is going to work out quite

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.900 
think this is going to work out quite
well<00:04:33.320> so<00:04:34.320> now<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:34.560> I've<00:04:34.800> got<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.340> actual

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
well so now that I've got the actual

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.390 
well so now that I've got the actual
cable<00:04:36.630> attached<00:04:37.470> now<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.010> I've<00:04:38.070> put<00:04:38.250> some

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
cable attached now and I've put some

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.830 
cable attached now and I've put some
heat<00:04:38.580> shrink<00:04:38.850> tubing<00:04:39.210> over<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.480> top<00:04:39.660> of<00:04:39.690> that

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
heat shrink tubing over the top of that

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.140 
heat shrink tubing over the top of that
to<00:04:40.260> make<00:04:40.890> it<00:04:41.040> even<00:04:41.160> stronger<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:41.820> hopefully

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
to make it even stronger and hopefully

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.730 
to make it even stronger and hopefully
protected<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:42.900> it's<00:04:43.050> not<00:04:43.140> going<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.350> pull<00:04:43.530> out

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
protected so it's not going to pull out

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.880 
protected so it's not going to pull out
I'm<00:04:44.670> now<00:04:44.940> going<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.390> attach<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.110> antenna<00:04:46.260> and

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
I'm now going to attach the antenna and

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.070 
I'm now going to attach the antenna and
the<00:04:46.950> antenna<00:04:47.850> is<00:04:48.240> going<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.450> go<00:04:48.570> at<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.780> top<00:04:48.960> of

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
the antenna is going to go at the top of

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.320 
the antenna is going to go at the top of
the<00:04:49.140> case<00:04:49.380> here<00:04:49.830> I'm<00:04:50.580> going<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.820> feed<00:04:51.060> down

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
the case here I'm going to feed down

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.230 
the case here I'm going to feed down
with<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.380> coax<00:04:52.800> I'm<00:04:53.340> going<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.640> sold<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:53.970> onto

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
with the coax I'm going to sold it onto

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.510 
with the coax I'm going to sold it onto
the<00:04:54.330> carb<00:04:54.600> down<00:04:54.900> here<00:04:55.140> in<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.320> corner<00:04:55.520> now

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
the carb down here in the corner now

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.340 
the carb down here in the corner now
somebody<00:04:57.000> recently<00:04:57.420> asked<00:04:57.690> me<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.960> best<00:04:58.140> way

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
somebody recently asked me the best way

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.380 
somebody recently asked me the best way
to<00:04:58.850> actually<00:04:59.850> splice<00:05:00.450> this<00:05:00.840> very<00:05:01.470> very<00:05:01.710> fine

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
to actually splice this very very fine

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.510 
to actually splice this very very fine
coax<00:05:03.390> they<00:05:03.540> found<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:03.990> laptops<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:05.280> trick

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
coax they found in laptops and the trick

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.290 
coax they found in laptops and the trick
is<00:05:05.700> not<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.000> use<00:05:06.330> any<00:05:07.050> kind<00:05:07.410> of<00:05:07.790> wire<00:05:08.790> strippers

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
is not to use any kind of wire strippers

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.980 
is not to use any kind of wire strippers
if<00:05:10.170> you<00:05:10.350> use<00:05:10.620> a<00:05:10.650> sharp<00:05:11.430> knife<00:05:11.850> and<00:05:12.210> actually

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
if you use a sharp knife and actually

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.530 
if you use a sharp knife and actually
just<00:05:13.140> shave<00:05:13.530> away<00:05:13.740> at<00:05:14.010> it<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.400> expose<00:05:14.880> each

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
just shave away at it to expose each

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.290 
just shave away at it to expose each
layer<00:05:15.960> you'll<00:05:16.740> find<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.340> you<00:05:17.880> get<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.090> lot

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
layer you'll find that you get a lot

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.670 
layer you'll find that you get a lot
better<00:05:18.480> results<00:05:18.540> if<00:05:19.080> you<00:05:19.170> use<00:05:19.200> a<00:05:19.350> pair<00:05:19.650> of

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
better results if you use a pair of

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.020 
better results if you use a pair of
these<00:05:19.890> you'll<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:20.280> end<00:05:20.490> up<00:05:20.580> normally

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
these you'll just end up normally

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
we've got the antenna a touch down here

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.590 
we've got the antenna a touch down here
we<00:05:25.950> can<00:05:26.130> actually<00:05:26.460> mount<00:05:26.640> it<00:05:26.880> inside<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.390> case

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
we can actually mount it inside the case

soldiering on this antenna to this card
was<00:05:48.330> really<00:05:48.660> easy<00:05:48.840> because<00:05:49.610> like<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.730> said<00:05:50.790> it

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
was really easy because like I said it

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.600 
was really easy because like I said it
was<00:05:51.120> actually<00:05:51.480> yeah<00:05:51.840> an<00:05:52.190> alpha<00:05:53.190> knockoff

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
was actually yeah an alpha knockoff

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.190 
was actually yeah an alpha knockoff
kinda<00:05:54.030> thing<00:05:54.210> wasn't<00:05:54.480> trying<00:05:54.870> to<00:05:55.020> look

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
kinda thing wasn't trying to look

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.010 
kinda thing wasn't trying to look
exactly<00:05:55.470> like<00:05:55.830> an<00:05:56.100> alpha<00:05:56.460> but<00:05:56.610> Tim<00:05:57.000> if<00:05:57.570> you<00:05:57.870> get

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
exactly like an alpha but Tim if you get

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.170 
exactly like an alpha but Tim if you get
my<00:05:58.140> meaning<00:05:58.170> if<00:05:59.040> you<00:05:59.310> didn't<00:05:59.580> take<00:05:59.820> a<00:05:59.880> close

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
my meaning if you didn't take a close

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.850 
my meaning if you didn't take a close
look<00:06:00.300> at<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.720> you<00:06:01.230> would<00:06:01.320> have<00:06:01.470> thought<00:06:01.620> you

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
look at it you would have thought you

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.530 
look at it you would have thought you
would<00:06:01.890> have<00:06:02.040> been<00:06:02.100> banging<00:06:02.580> alpha<00:06:02.880> card<00:06:03.150> so

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
would have been banging alpha card so

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.420 
would have been banging alpha card so
originally<00:06:04.020> there<00:06:04.200> was<00:06:04.290> some<00:06:04.470> coax<00:06:04.890> solid<00:06:05.310> on

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
originally there was some coax solid on

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.480 
originally there was some coax solid on
here<00:06:05.790> and<00:06:05.970> down<00:06:06.960> at<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.140> bottom<00:06:07.230> down<00:06:07.740> here<00:06:08.130> it

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
here and down at the bottom down here it

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.130 
here and down at the bottom down here it
came<00:06:08.790> out<00:06:08.970> to<00:06:09.180> a<00:06:09.210> reverse<00:06:09.600> decimate

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
came out to a reverse decimate

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.540 
came out to a reverse decimate
connections<00:06:10.650> so<00:06:10.800> you<00:06:10.860> could<00:06:11.070> attach<00:06:11.400> an

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
connections so you could attach an

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.760 
connections so you could attach an
antenna<00:06:11.910> to<00:06:12.120> it<00:06:12.270> so<00:06:12.510> the<00:06:13.170> actual<00:06:13.440> solder

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
antenna to it so the actual solder

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.230 
antenna to it so the actual solder
points<00:06:13.950> for<00:06:14.160> this<00:06:14.250> coax<00:06:14.700> are<00:06:14.850> already<00:06:15.150> in

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
points for this coax are already in

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.850 
points for this coax are already in
place<00:06:15.480> with<00:06:15.690> this<00:06:15.810> card<00:06:16.080> so<00:06:16.320> it's<00:06:16.470> nice<00:06:16.650> and

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
place with this card so it's nice and

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.270 
place with this card so it's nice and
easy

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
easy

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.830 
easy
I<00:06:17.310> haven't<00:06:17.700> had<00:06:17.790> to<00:06:17.940> modify<00:06:18.360> anything<00:06:18.600> with

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
I haven't had to modify anything with

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.350 
I haven't had to modify anything with
the<00:06:18.900> card<00:06:19.110> there<00:06:19.550> and<00:06:20.550> of<00:06:20.670> course<00:06:20.910> before<00:06:21.180> we

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
the card there and of course before we

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.570 
the card there and of course before we
asked<00:06:21.600> him<00:06:21.750> out<00:06:21.870> into<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.290> case<00:06:22.590> it's<00:06:23.250> a<00:06:23.430> good

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
asked him out into the case it's a good

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.220 
asked him out into the case it's a good
idea<00:06:23.730> to<00:06:23.940> check<00:06:24.270> that<00:06:24.420> make<00:06:24.930> sure<00:06:25.110> that

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
idea to check that make sure that

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.480 
idea to check that make sure that
everything<00:06:25.620> is<00:06:25.650> working<00:06:25.860> correctly<00:06:26.070> before

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
everything is working correctly before

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.000 
everything is working correctly before
you<00:06:26.730> do<00:06:26.970> as<00:06:27.630> you<00:06:27.810> can<00:06:27.990> see<00:06:28.200> here<00:06:28.410> on<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.770> phone

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
you do as you can see here on the phone

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.450 
you do as you can see here on the phone
got<00:06:29.730> the<00:06:29.880> RTL<00:06:30.600> 8<00:06:31.310> 187

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
got the RTL 8 187

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.920 
got the RTL 8 187
USB<00:06:33.060> connection<00:06:33.600> there

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
USB connection there

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.040 
USB connection there
so<00:06:33.990> everything<00:06:34.350> is<00:06:34.500> working<00:06:34.710> fine<00:06:35.100> so<00:06:36.050> it's

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
so everything is working fine so it's

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.659 
so everything is working fine so it's
all<00:06:37.199> finished<00:06:37.500> off<00:06:37.650> it's<00:06:37.889> up<00:06:38.039> and<00:06:38.220> running<00:06:38.520> and

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
all finished off it's up and running and

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.659 
all finished off it's up and running and
I've<00:06:39.509> actually<00:06:39.660> done<00:06:40.650> what<00:06:40.860> I<00:06:40.889> set<00:06:41.100> out<00:06:41.160> to<00:06:41.370> do

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
I've actually done what I set out to do

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.850 
I've actually done what I set out to do
which<00:06:41.940> was<00:06:42.150> to<00:06:42.419> get<00:06:42.810> rid<00:06:42.930> of<00:06:42.990> all<00:06:43.110> this<00:06:43.320> bulky

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
which was to get rid of all this bulky

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.070 
which was to get rid of all this bulky
Hardware<00:06:44.310> here<00:06:44.550> so<00:06:44.880> you're<00:06:45.509> not<00:06:45.539> sticking<00:06:45.870> out

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
Hardware here so you're not sticking out

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.379 
Hardware here so you're not sticking out
like<00:06:46.259> a<00:06:46.320> sore<00:06:46.620> thumb<00:06:46.650> in<00:06:47.070> the<00:06:47.280> coffee<00:06:47.850> shop

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.389 
like a sore thumb in the coffee shop

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.140 
like a sore thumb in the coffee shop
and<00:06:48.479> I've<00:06:49.199> also<00:06:49.380> cut<00:06:49.860> away<00:06:50.100> a<00:06:50.400> piece<00:06:50.940> of<00:06:51.090> the

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
and I've also cut away a piece of the

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.840 
and I've also cut away a piece of the
case<00:06:51.389> here<00:06:51.900> and<00:06:52.080> the<00:06:52.770> reason<00:06:52.919> for<00:06:53.130> that<00:06:53.610> is

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
case here and the reason for that is

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.620 
case here and the reason for that is
that<00:06:53.880> now<00:06:54.330> I<00:06:54.690> can<00:06:55.199> actually<00:06:55.490> close<00:06:56.490> it<00:06:56.669> up<00:06:56.820> and

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
that now I can actually close it up and

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.230 
that now I can actually close it up and
I<00:06:57.930> can<00:06:58.139> just<00:06:58.289> leave<00:06:58.440> it<00:06:58.590> on<00:06:58.680> the<00:06:58.740> side<00:06:59.240> actually

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
I can just leave it on the side actually

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.760 
I can just leave it on the side actually
doing<00:07:00.479> its<00:07:00.630> job<00:07:00.870> and<00:07:01.110> he<00:07:01.199> doesn't<00:07:01.500> look<00:07:01.560> out

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
doing its job and he doesn't look out

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.520 
doing its job and he doesn't look out
place<00:07:02.070> at<00:07:02.250> all<00:07:02.430> so<00:07:02.960> it'll<00:07:03.960> probably<00:07:03.990> work<00:07:04.380> a

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
place at all so it'll probably work a

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.290 
place at all so it'll probably work a
lot<00:07:04.680> better<00:07:04.919> when<00:07:05.460> I<00:07:05.520> actually<00:07:05.699> manage<00:07:06.180> to

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
lot better when I actually manage to

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.390 
lot better when I actually manage to
find<00:07:06.509> one<00:07:06.750> of<00:07:06.780> those<00:07:06.990> angled<00:07:07.650> connectors<00:07:08.190> here

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
find one of those angled connectors here

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.839 
find one of those angled connectors here
for<00:07:08.610> the<00:07:08.699> USB<00:07:09.020> but<00:07:10.020> for<00:07:10.650> now<00:07:10.800> it's<00:07:11.160> working

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:11.849 
for the USB but for now it's working

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.089 
for the USB but for now it's working
fine<00:07:12.270> so<00:07:12.300> I<00:07:12.840> hope<00:07:13.289> you<00:07:13.410> got<00:07:13.560> something<00:07:13.800> out<00:07:14.039> of
