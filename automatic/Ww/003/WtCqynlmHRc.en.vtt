just<00:02:08.470> simply<00:02:09.190> turn<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.899> turn<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.319> water

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
just simply turn that to turn the water

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.990 
just simply turn that to turn the water
off<00:02:11.680> there's<00:02:12.250> more<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.790> system<00:02:15.000> and

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
off there's more to the system and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.110 
off there's more to the system and
that's<00:02:16.270> also<00:02:16.660> where<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:18.340> Rao's<00:02:19.680> coming<00:02:20.680> from

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that's also where is Rao's coming from

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.610 
that's also where is Rao's coming from
this<00:02:22.120> black<00:02:22.360> goes<00:02:22.600> is<00:02:22.810> your<00:02:22.930> waste<00:02:23.170> water<00:02:23.260> hose

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
this black goes is your waste water hose

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
this black goes is your waste water hose
that's<00:02:24.160> also<00:02:24.580> hooked<00:02:24.760> up<00:02:24.940> back<00:02:25.150> here<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:27.520> it

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
that's also hooked up back here and it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640 
that's also hooked up back here and it
actually<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:27.970> goes<00:02:28.300> down<00:02:28.630> or<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.470> washing

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
actually just goes down or the washing

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.910 
actually just goes down or the washing
machine<00:02:30.100> waste<00:02:30.970> water<00:02:31.209> goes<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:34.060> other<00:02:34.239> hose

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920

is your storage water or your good luck
good<00:02:38.800> water<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.360> going<00:02:40.569> into

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
good water and I have that going into

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.809 
good water and I have that going into
brute<00:02:43.150> Rubbermaid<00:02:43.800> container<00:02:44.800> which<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:45.670> got

brute Rubbermaid container which I got
from<00:02:46.480> those<00:02:46.750> also<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:50.140> stores

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
from those also and it's just stores

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.690 
from those also and it's just stores
ro/di<00:02:52.720> water<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.989> right<00:02:56.230> here<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.130> float

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
to shut down the system I turn my system

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.680 
to shut down the system I turn my system
off<00:03:12.910> either<00:03:13.900> about<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:14.650> or<00:03:15.190> about<00:03:15.700> this

which is off about this right now
this<00:03:18.790> is<00:03:18.970> closed<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.510> it's<00:03:19.660> creating<00:03:20.019> back

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
this is closed so it's creating back

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.920 
this is closed so it's creating back
pressure<00:03:20.470> when<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.459> turn<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.730> on<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:24.930> releases

that back pressure closed turns the
system<00:03:28.090> on<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:30.519> water<00:03:30.790> flows<00:03:31.090> out<00:03:36.209> once

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
system on and the water flows out once

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.069 
system on and the water flows out once
it<00:03:37.329> gets<00:03:37.359> full<00:03:37.720> just<00:03:38.680> enclose<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.079> create

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
it gets full just enclose like so create

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.620 
it gets full just enclose like so create
back<00:03:41.260> pressure<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.030> system<00:03:43.450> will

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
back pressure and the system will

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
included in the kit while it was

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.030 
included in the kit while it was
included<00:03:51.010> in<00:03:51.280> my<00:03:51.400> kit<00:03:52.859> there'll<00:03:53.859> have<00:03:54.010> a

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
included in my kit there'll have a

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.740 
included in my kit there'll have a
special<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:54.760> much

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
special that much

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.290 
special that much
in<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.410> RO<00:03:56.560> system<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.100> purchase<00:03:57.550> you<00:03:58.120> get<00:03:58.270> a

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
in the RO system you purchase you get a

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.280 
in the RO system you purchase you get a
free<00:03:58.630> flow<00:03:58.990> file<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:01.240> got<00:04:01.420> lucky<00:04:01.720> but

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
free flow file so I got lucky but

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.930 
free flow file so I got lucky but
otherwise<00:04:03.100> you're<00:04:03.340> gonna<00:04:03.430> have<00:04:03.550> to<00:04:03.730> buy<00:04:03.880> this

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
otherwise you're gonna have to buy this

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:14.030 
otherwise you're gonna have to buy this
if<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:04.990> want<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.260> learn<00:04:05.680> it

resin<00:04:57.510> you<00:04:58.510> should<00:04:58.750> notice<00:04:59.140> we<00:04:59.560> need<00:04:59.680> to

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
resin you should notice we need to

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.460 
resin you should notice we need to
change<00:05:00.040> our<00:05:00.160> di<00:05:00.310> resin<00:05:00.580> because<00:05:01.290> it's<00:05:02.290> gonna
