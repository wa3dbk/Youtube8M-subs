rear oh and a shard of greed okay I know

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.429 
rear oh and a shard of greed okay I know
about<00:01:46.649> shard<00:01:46.979> agreed<00:01:47.810> kind<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> cool<00:01:49.170> card

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
about shard agreed kind of a cool card

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.889 
about shard agreed kind of a cool card
just<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.280> related<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> pot<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.509> greed
