okay<00:00:01.770> for<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.040> next<00:00:02.280> trick<00:00:02.550> we're<00:00:02.730> going<00:00:02.760> to

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
okay for my next trick we're going to

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.539 
okay for my next trick we're going to
fix<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.270> radius<00:00:03.689> Bowl<00:00:04.410> let<00:00:04.950> me<00:00:05.040> show<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.339> what

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
fix the radius Bowl let me show you what

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.540 
fix the radius Bowl let me show you what
I<00:00:05.580> mean<00:00:05.819> by<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.440> one<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:08.490> the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
I mean by that this is the one on the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.020 
I mean by that this is the one on the
side<00:00:09.480> that's<00:00:09.780> good<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.559> actually<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> bolt

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
side that's good this is actually a bolt

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.580 
side that's good this is actually a bolt
that<00:00:12.240> goes<00:00:12.300> all<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.690> way<00:00:12.809> through<00:00:13.170> here<00:00:13.380> it's

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
that goes all the way through here it's

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.499 
that goes all the way through here it's
tapered<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.250> either<00:00:14.490> end<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.210> when<00:00:15.389> you

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
tapered on either end so that when you

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.070 
tapered on either end so that when you
tighten<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:16.109> up<00:00:16.490> it<00:00:17.490> pulls<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.570> down<00:00:18.810> good

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
tighten this up it pulls this down good

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.230 
tighten this up it pulls this down good
and<00:00:19.289> snug<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.890> axle<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.640> one's<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.029> good

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and snug on the axle this one's in good

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.779 
and snug on the axle this one's in good
shape<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> these<00:00:22.380> are<00:00:22.560> spring<00:00:22.859> hangers<00:00:23.279> back

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
shape and these are spring hangers back

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.089 
shape and these are spring hangers back
in<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.029> old<00:00:24.210> days<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:25.260> end<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.890> would

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
in the old days the end of this would

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.099 
in the old days the end of this would
come<00:00:26.279> out<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.580> curl<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:28.050> thing

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
come out and curl up and this thing

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.630 
come out and curl up and this thing
would<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.650> facing<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.400> direction

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
would be facing in the right direction

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
would be facing in the right direction
so<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.359> spring<00:00:30.689> would<00:00:30.990> actually<00:00:31.349> hang<00:00:31.560> on

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
so that a spring would actually hang on

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.380 
so that a spring would actually hang on
that<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.189> think<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.579> one's<00:00:32.790> been<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.000> or

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that I think this one's been out or

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630 
that I think this one's been out or
turned<00:00:33.660> or<00:00:33.870> something<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.860> fine<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.399> way<00:00:35.430> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
turned or something it's fine the way it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
turned or something it's fine the way it
is<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.090> looks<00:00:36.300> kind<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> interesting<00:00:36.780> I'd

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
is it looks kind of interesting I'd

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.369 
is it looks kind of interesting I'd
rather<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.370> than<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:38.809> I<00:00:39.809> found

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
rather have it than not I found

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170 
rather have it than not I found
something<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.980> could<00:00:41.160> buy<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:41.969> they're

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
something that I could buy but they're

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.139 
something that I could buy but they're
different<00:00:42.559> they're<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.739> made<00:00:43.950> different<00:00:44.430> if

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
different they're just made different if

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.440 
different they're just made different if
I<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.570> save<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.879> it's<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> look

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
I can save this one it's going to look

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.869 
I can save this one it's going to look
right<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.649> also<00:00:49.890> serve<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> purpose

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
right and it will also serve the purpose

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.400 
right and it will also serve the purpose
the<00:00:51.180> only<00:00:51.360> thing<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:51.690> wrong<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.260> is

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the only thing that's wrong with it is

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130 
the only thing that's wrong with it is
that<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.149> frozen<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.719> there<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.050> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that it was frozen in there so it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
that it was frozen in there so it
wouldn't<00:00:55.379> tighten<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:57.180> same<00:00:57.390> guy

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
wouldn't tighten up and the same guy

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.400 
wouldn't tighten up and the same guy
that<00:00:57.780> worked<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.680> my<00:00:59.960> kingpin<00:01:00.960> bushings

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that worked on my kingpin bushings

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
that worked on my kingpin bushings
heated<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.280> thing<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.820> hammered<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> out

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
heated this thing up and hammered it out

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
heated this thing up and hammered it out
and<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:03.840> he<00:01:03.870> did<00:01:04.140> he<00:01:04.350> flattened<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.159> end

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and when he did he flattened this end

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.580 
and when he did he flattened this end
here<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> bit<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:07.020> no<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
here a bit so there's no way that that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
here a bit so there's no way that that
bolt<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.010> start<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:09.150> I'm<00:01:09.270> gonna

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
bolt will start on there what I'm gonna

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.109 
bolt will start on there what I'm gonna
do<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.689> take<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> grinder<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:11.760> I'm<00:01:11.970> gonna

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
do is just take a grinder and I'm gonna

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.630 
do is just take a grinder and I'm gonna
try<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:13.170> gently<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.340> don't<00:01:14.549> know

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
try to just very gently and I don't know

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.999 
try to just very gently and I don't know
this<00:01:14.790> dredge<00:01:15.090> looked<00:01:15.330> pretty<00:01:15.540> bad<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.110> don't

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
this dredge looked pretty bad I don't

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.170 
this dredge looked pretty bad I don't
know<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.700> or<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.060> what

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
know if I can do this or not but what

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.690 
know if I can do this or not but what
I'm<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> try<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:19.159> is<00:01:20.159> grind<00:01:20.490> this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
I'm going to try to do is grind this

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
I'm going to try to do is grind this
down<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.970> bit<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.479> rethread<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.740> this

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
down a bit and rethread it so that this

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
down a bit and rethread it so that this
bolt<00:01:23.189> will<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.520> back<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.210> snug<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
bolt will go back on there and snug this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.080 
bolt will go back on there and snug this
thing<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:26.070> gonna<00:01:26.310> fit<00:01:26.580> about<00:01:26.850> like

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
thing back up it's gonna fit about like

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.140 
thing back up it's gonna fit about like
that<00:01:30.259> camera<00:01:31.259> write<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.369> this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that camera write that like that this

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.520 
that camera write that like that this
might<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.540> something<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> can't<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.320> done

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
might be something that can't be done

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.080 
might be something that can't be done
but<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:34.950> gonna<00:01:35.100> give<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.430> try<00:01:35.670> anyway

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
but I'm gonna give it a try anyway

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.810 
but I'm gonna give it a try anyway
and<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> doesn't<00:01:37.619> work<00:01:37.799> I'll<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.670> come

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and if it doesn't work I'll have to come

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.810 
and if it doesn't work I'll have to come
up<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:38.970> another<00:01:39.240> plan

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:02:24.040 

I<00:02:21.400> think<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.760> going<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.120> work<00:02:23.150> let<00:02:24.020> me

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
I think this is going to work let me

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.890 
I think this is going to work let me
explain<00:02:24.380> what<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.620> did<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:25.430> thing<00:02:25.670> was<00:02:25.900> spread

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
on the end where it had been hammered so

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.070 
on the end where it had been hammered so
that<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:28.880> boat<00:02:29.150> wouldn't<00:02:29.450> go<00:02:29.570> on<00:02:29.600> here

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
that just boat wouldn't go on here

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.650 
that just boat wouldn't go on here
what<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> did<00:02:30.860> was<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.220> uh<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.640> took<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.910> grinder<00:02:32.420> and

what I did was I uh I took a grinder and
I<00:02:32.930> ground<00:02:33.260> off<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.709> spread<00:02:34.040> part<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:35.510> threats

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
I ground off the spread part the threats

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.320 
I ground off the spread part the threats
that<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.410> left<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.920> here<00:02:37.220> there's<00:02:37.730> about<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.970> half

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
that I left on here there's about a half

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.810 
that I left on here there's about a half
inch<00:02:38.720> maybe<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.230> little<00:02:39.320> bit<00:02:39.500> more<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:40.459> good

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
inch maybe a little bit more of good

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.509 
inch maybe a little bit more of good
threads<00:02:41.209> here<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.680> was<00:02:42.830> able<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.100> get<00:02:43.280> this

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
threads here and I was able to get this

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.570 
threads here and I was able to get this
old<00:02:43.910> bolt<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.570> go<00:02:44.690> over<00:02:45.019> them<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.410> find<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
old bolt to go over them and find the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.610 
old bolt to go over them and find the
threads<00:02:46.940> again<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:47.570> didn't<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:48.080> tap<00:02:48.410> the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
threads again I didn't have a tap the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.110 
threads again I didn't have a tap the
same<00:02:48.830> size<00:02:49.130> so<00:02:49.400> there's<00:02:49.549> no<00:02:49.670> way<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.820> was<00:02:50.030> going

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
same size so there's no way I was going

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.890 
same size so there's no way I was going
to<00:02:50.209> be<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.630> know<00:02:50.750> wreath<00:02:50.989> reading<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:52.900> but

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
to be you know wreath reading this but

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.960 
to be you know wreath reading this but
basically<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.680> on<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.160> original<00:02:55.250> threads

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
basically it is on the original threads

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.030 
basically it is on the original threads
down<00:02:56.540> below<00:02:56.900> where<00:02:57.140> it's<00:02:57.260> ground<00:02:57.530> off<00:02:57.799> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
down below where it's ground off the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.500 
down below where it's ground off the
part<00:02:58.280> where<00:02:58.459> it's<00:02:58.580> ground<00:02:58.790> off<00:02:59.000> up<00:02:59.239> here<00:02:59.420> is

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
part where it's ground off up here is

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.630 
part where it's ground off up here is
the<00:02:59.600> part<00:02:59.870> where<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.739> pen<00:03:00.980> would<00:03:01.190> go<00:03:01.340> through

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
the part where the pen would go through

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.949 
the part where the pen would go through
because<00:03:01.850> what<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.239> after<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.660> tighten

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
because what you do is after you tighten

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.680 
because what you do is after you tighten
this<00:03:03.049> up<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.380> stick<00:03:03.650> up<00:03:03.829> a<00:03:04.070> pin<00:03:04.880> there's<00:03:05.570> a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
this up you stick up a pin there's a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.900 
this up you stick up a pin there's a
hole<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.079> this<00:03:06.200> thing<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.430> stick<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.670> pin

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
hole in this thing and you stick a pin

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.310 
hole in this thing and you stick a pin
through<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.299> lock<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.660> in<00:03:08.780> place

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
through the lock it in place

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.160 
through the lock it in place
so<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.680> am<00:03:09.829> believing<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:11.420> I'm<00:03:11.600> gonna<00:03:11.840> be<00:03:12.049> able

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
so I am believing that I'm gonna be able

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.759 
so I am believing that I'm gonna be able
to<00:03:12.260> put<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:12.650> on<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.610> front<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.060> car

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.560 
came with the kingpins I used the
kingpin<00:04:10.980> shims<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.550> had<00:04:11.790> along<00:04:12.120> with<00:04:12.360> that

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
kingpin shims that I had along with that

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.110 
kingpin shims that I had along with that
one<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.500> idea<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.160> get<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.520> play<00:04:14.820> out

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
one and the idea is to get this play out

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.150 
one and the idea is to get this play out
of<00:04:15.930> here<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:16.170> think<00:04:16.470> I'm<00:04:16.560> gonna<00:04:16.650> cut<00:04:16.920> one<00:04:16.950> more

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
of here I think I'm gonna cut one more

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.600 
of here I think I'm gonna cut one more
of<00:04:17.489> those<00:04:17.670> not<00:04:18.510> sure<00:04:18.690> what<00:04:18.840> I'm<00:04:18.900> talking<00:04:19.230> about

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
of those not sure what I'm talking about

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.010 
of those not sure what I'm talking about
basically<00:04:20.610> this<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.060> kingpin<00:04:21.299> shim<00:04:21.810> and

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
basically this is the kingpin shim and

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.460 
basically this is the kingpin shim and
this<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.680> one<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:22.920> I<00:04:23.040> made<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:24.360> think<00:04:25.320> I'm

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
this is the one that I made I think I'm

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.870 
this is the one that I made I think I'm
gonna<00:04:25.560> cut<00:04:25.830> one<00:04:25.860> more<00:04:26.190> stick<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:26.580> in<00:04:26.760> there

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
gonna cut one more stick this in there

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.340 
gonna cut one more stick this in there
so<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.180> good<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.600> firm<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.110> then<00:04:28.260> I'm

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
so this is good and firm and then I'm

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.890 
so this is good and firm and then I'm
gonna<00:04:28.470> take<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:29.040> wire<00:04:29.910> wheel<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.510> just<00:04:30.660> clean

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
gonna take a wire wheel and just clean

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.620 
gonna take a wire wheel and just clean
this<00:04:31.110> up<00:04:31.320> real<00:04:31.620> good<00:04:32.120> so<00:04:33.120> this<00:04:33.300> will<00:04:33.480> go<00:04:33.600> down

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
this up real good so this will go down

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.420 
this up real good so this will go down
in<00:04:33.990> there<00:04:34.140> a<00:04:34.170> little<00:04:34.290> better<00:04:34.590> I've<00:04:34.860> also<00:04:35.070> taken

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
in there a little better I've also taken

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.320 
in there a little better I've also taken
a<00:04:35.760> wire<00:04:36.240> brush<00:04:36.570> here<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.430> worked<00:04:38.430> on<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.820> on

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
a wire brush here and worked on the on

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.750 
a wire brush here and worked on the on
the<00:04:39.510> axle<00:04:39.870> shaft

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
the axle shaft

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.720 
the axle shaft
you<00:04:41.760> know<00:04:41.880> clean<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.390> up<00:04:42.420> good<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:44.130> nice<00:04:44.550> be

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
that's what I'm doing here to get a good

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.910 
that's what I'm doing here to get a good
a<00:04:46.710> good<00:04:47.370> tight<00:04:47.700> fit<00:04:48.050> in<00:04:49.050> this<00:04:49.290> radius<00:04:49.680> right

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
a good tight fit in this radius right

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.790 
a good tight fit in this radius right
here<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.840> what<00:04:51.960> I'll<00:04:52.080> do<00:04:52.200> is<00:04:52.230> I'll<00:04:52.410> take<00:04:52.590> this

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
here and what I'll do is I'll take this

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.400 
here and what I'll do is I'll take this
and<00:04:53.040> keep<00:04:53.610> some<00:04:53.790> of<00:04:53.880> this<00:04:54.000> work<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.540> swing<00:04:55.260> that

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
and keep some of this work to swing that

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:30.370 
and keep some of this work to swing that
up<00:04:55.530> real<00:04:55.740> nice

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.629 

now<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.500> feels<00:05:31.740> about<00:05:31.949> like<00:05:32.160> it's<00:05:32.310> doing<00:05:32.460> the

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
now that feels about like it's doing the

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.280 
now that feels about like it's doing the
trick<00:05:32.910> I'm<00:05:33.120> not<00:05:33.300> going<00:05:33.449> to<00:05:33.509> type<00:05:33.660> this<00:05:33.870> up<00:05:34.080> real

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
trick I'm not going to type this up real

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.450 
trick I'm not going to type this up real
tight<00:05:34.500> because<00:05:34.860> what<00:05:34.979> I'm<00:05:35.040> gonna<00:05:35.130> do<00:05:35.280> instead

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
tight because what I'm gonna do instead

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.450 
tight because what I'm gonna do instead
is<00:05:35.729> move<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:36.780> axle<00:05:37.229> back<00:05:37.350> into<00:05:37.740> place<00:05:37.979> you<00:05:38.310> did

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
is move the axle back into place you did

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.490 
is move the axle back into place you did
anything<00:05:38.610> lined<00:05:39.030> up<00:05:39.330> once<00:05:39.780> it's<00:05:39.960> all<00:05:40.080> lined<00:05:40.320> up

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
anything lined up once it's all lined up

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.710 
anything lined up once it's all lined up
I'll<00:05:40.650> snug<00:05:40.979> this<00:05:41.160> down<00:05:41.430> with<00:05:42.030> these<00:05:42.210> shims<00:05:42.479> in

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
I'll snug this down with these shims in

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.480 
I'll snug this down with these shims in
here<00:05:42.990> it's<00:05:43.110> already<00:05:43.289> a<00:05:43.590> lot<00:05:43.800> tighter<00:05:44.070> than<00:05:44.250> it

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
here it's already a lot tighter than it

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.610 
here it's already a lot tighter than it
was<00:05:44.639> I<00:05:44.970> think<00:05:45.240> this<00:05:45.389> is<00:05:45.479> gonna<00:05:45.570> be<00:05:45.780> I<00:05:46.050> think

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
was I think this is gonna be I think

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.550 
was I think this is gonna be I think
this<00:05:46.800> is<00:05:46.889> going<00:05:47.039> to<00:05:47.100> be<00:05:47.160> okay
