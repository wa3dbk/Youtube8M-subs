00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.430
 hello girls that such good in this new 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.650
 section that I'm making of videos 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.039
 for the monster high I will teach you to 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.320
 do all these little things that you see here 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:20.680
 accessories and more furniture as per 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.210
 example magazines 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.519
 popcorn 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.109
 pet cups also televisions 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.989
 and today in particular we are going to focus 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.120
 in making a pencil jar with the 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.699
 own pencils so let's go there 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.140
 I hope you like to look like the 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:44.079
 pencils with pencils 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.310
 let's use glue sticks 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.410
 scissors 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.110
 A marker 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.760
 a bobbin of worn thread 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.700
 but decorative cardboard a pencil 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.670
 truth and I for not staining the table I'm going 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.560
 to use a little bit of good paper 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.020
 let's start by catching 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.250
 the coil of thread worn that we 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.600
 will serve to make the pot 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.960
 and we are going to cut with the scissors what 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:24.270
 Let's go with him to the boat 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 pencils what is not good we will have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.350
 something like that 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.180
 now we take the decorative zeal 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.990
 and we are going to cover 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.990
 all 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.150
 in fact with the coil to go 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.090
 If you do not have decorative hair, you can 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.090
 use adhesive tape 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 when we have the thread bobbin 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.140
 covered by the decorative zeal we 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.660
 something like that will remain 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.660
 now let's take the cardboard 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.239
 and we are going to cut out a square 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.239
 in cardboard 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.560
 we are going to put glue on the coil of 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.170
 thread at one end 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.680
 to stick it to the piece of cardboard that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.680
 it would be the platform 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.280
 and now while we wait for it to be 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.280
 I know we 're going to make chopsticks 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.760
 what will we do with them the clear pencils 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.490
 for this we are going to take a toothpick and 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.200
 let's cut what we go to 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.190
 use to make the pencil that will be 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.190
 more or less something like that 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.170
 we will be doing little touches with 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.810
 the scissors and then we'll break it with 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.270
 hands 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.700
 you know why we have to do this in 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.319
 instead of cutting it all at once 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.760
 we do so that afterwards we do not get the 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:39.290
 tip shot 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:44.530
 good and now with a marker we're going to 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.530
 paint the stick leaving one end 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.900
 we have to leave the end of the tip 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:55.900
 because that's how we will make the tip of the plant 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.230
 A) Yes 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.840
 and the end that we have left that not 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.880
 we have to paint we will use it to 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.100
 make the tip by picking up the pencil 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.100
 truth and painting the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.729
 and we have a pencil left 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.520
 and we can put it in our 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:36.000
 pen you can make as many pencils 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.000
 you want and of any color the stick 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.370
 well see you in the next program 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.960
 in which will be taught to do 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:49.069
 a magazine for monster high 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.300
 with pages and pictures of them this is good 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.300
 it has been all for today goodbye
