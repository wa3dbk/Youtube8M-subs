00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.490
 sum of instagram so from ling-garden 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.730
 description notes but after i also one 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.590
 on the left you enter your salary chip or alcohol 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.029
 I spoke with those guys 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 it's really super friendly people 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.789
 are they 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.080
 and I have also seen the website of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.820
 leave love to the description if you like 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.759
 the code that is used is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.300
 actually thicker because it's easy 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.610
 used to be 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.309
 so I accidentally get 5% off it is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.750
 a fairly easy surf spot is that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.219
 is actually also the pages and what 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.800
 Clearer is just pretty simple 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.149
 contact and I also said I would like this 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.370
 Don't do it if I do n't trust you 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.260
 I first bought it myself 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.030
 little but I sold on my under k 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.899
 first to test it under and that worked 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.160
 I'm curious 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.120
 and hopefully you will also find what is 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.190
 i would say look now can not 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.020
 description and if there is something like you now 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.030
 you're right then the mine always looks 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.760
 passing on wings immediately is also common 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.770
 settles when case I enter this box 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.630
 open and hopefully your own path 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.930
 this is only the second pack opening that i have 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.460
 I did this year so this year 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.549
 I hope I'm good at it 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.350
 i hope i hope i hope the joke i know 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.090
 not whether I always had chicken or not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 I have always believed more lucky than me 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:32.430
 skip right to a bro 3s 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.950
 for you this guy is that he himself 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.140
 you had to set the new really explain 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.770
 long we play student as our chipped 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.740
 pack is rising and how we do this is nothing 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.380
 special in itself 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.810
 john van den brom certain trick set 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.979
 I just dump this a club because I do 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.460
 there almost nothing sensible sit 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.219
 of course and i might becomes will for 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.240
 call for a ball but also six 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.619
 to go 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.719
 I am curious how this will go I have 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.899
 i love dike opening sentence it is fun 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.549
 if it does a little and people do 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.509
 Confidence website so I trust 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.160
 purely because I have tested it myself and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.240
 i also have a twitter so that is 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.130
 by the way also the chocolate 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.360
 that might be easier you can 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.650
 just come into contact with that is 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.420
 think even easier you have to because 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.310
 it is slightly smaller 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.840
 you have the opportunity to go faster 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.460
 I contacted it a lot 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.420
 People is important if you are not now 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.550
 being right 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.410
 I mean I had it about 5 minutes 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.350
 I had a small show percent back button 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.190
 I then send the data or for 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.620
 a door on twitter 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.820
 and so it was fast for the on so if 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.840
 your interest the link is in the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.760
 Description 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.000
 and we can use code thick three 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.550
 to get a 5% off of your things 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.580
