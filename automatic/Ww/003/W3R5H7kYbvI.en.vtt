market so thats can be quite interesting
and<00:01:09.270> quite<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> fact<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.590> just

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and quite like the fact that it's just

and quite like the fact that it's just
one<00:01:11.159> although<00:01:11.430> maybe<00:01:11.909> would<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.090> been<00:01:12.240> nice

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
one although maybe would have been nice

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.030 
one although maybe would have been nice
with<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> couple<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> others<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.229> we'll<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
with a couple of others so we'll have to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.590 
with a couple of others so we'll have to
see<00:01:14.189> how<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> plays<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.729> I've<00:01:14.909> added<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
see how that plays out I've added that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.030 
see how that plays out I've added that
one<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:16.049> server<00:01:16.320> today<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.920> you're

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
one into my server today so if you're
almost<00:01:17.130> server<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:18.270> come<00:01:18.479> into

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
almost server that one will come into

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.620 
almost server that one will come into
the<00:01:18.810> mix<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.490> then<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.549> got<00:01:20.670> gun<00:01:21.000> master<00:01:21.240> mode

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
again perhaps a you know smaller

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
again perhaps a you know smaller
concentration<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.049> got<00:01:31.170> scavenge

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
concentration there and we got scavenge

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
concentration there and we got scavenge
mode<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.579> would<00:01:32.640> expect<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.090> new<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.450> all

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
mode as you would expect the new one all

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.480 
mode as you would expect the new one all
four<00:01:33.960> maps<00:01:34.170> there<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.310> back<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
four maps there and I'm going back to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.789 
four maps there and I'm going back to
conquest<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.720> most<00:01:36.930> part<00:01:37.170> most<00:01:37.470> game

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
conquest so for the most part most game

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.160 
conquest so for the most part most game
modes<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.220> play<00:01:38.579> all<00:01:38.850> four<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.930> maps

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
modes you can play all four of the maps

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.690 
modes you can play all four of the maps
there's<00:01:40.380> only<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.560> couple<00:01:40.619> which<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.250> reduced

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
there's only a couple which have reduced

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.359 
there's only a couple which have reduced
as<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.270> conquest<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.220> obviously<00:01:44.220> with

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
conquest you see we don't have to our
market<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.460> interesting<00:01:47.790> why

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
market so that's kind of interesting why

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.340 
market so that's kind of interesting why
they<00:01:48.240> chose<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.600> leave<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:48.930> out<00:01:49.020> I'm

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
they chose to leave that one out I'm

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.200 
they chose to leave that one out I'm
assuming<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.369> they've<00:01:50.820> made<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
assuming it's because they've made it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.510 
assuming it's because they've made it
conquest<00:01:51.840> assault<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.740> they<00:01:52.829> decided<00:01:53.189> things

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
conquest assault so they decided things

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.859 
conquest assault so they decided things
it's<00:01:53.729> already<00:01:53.970> conquest<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.689> didn't

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it's already conquest or so they didn't

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.899 
it's already conquest or so they didn't
want<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> make<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.350> conquest<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.280> seems<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.820> bit

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
want to make it conquest but seems a bit

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.830 
want to make it conquest but seems a bit
of<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> shame<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.479> you've<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.689> these

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
of a shame that if you've got these

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.469 
of a shame that if you've got these
three<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:58.920> left<00:01:59.280> out<00:01:59.460> but<00:02:00.360> for

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
three that that one is left out but for

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.090 
three that that one is left out but for
the<00:02:00.540> most<00:02:00.689> part<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.259> see<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.920> all

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the most part as you can see it's all

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.190 
the most part as you can see it's all
for<00:02:02.460> running<00:02:03.090> pretty<00:02:03.299> much<00:02:03.479> across<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> board

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
for running pretty much across the board

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
for running pretty much across the board
it's<00:02:04.619> only<00:02:04.890> conquest<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.579> doesn't<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it's only conquest that doesn't have it

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
it's only conquest that doesn't have it
but<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> same<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.829> good<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> see<00:02:08.369> that

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
but all the same it's good to see that

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.850 
but all the same it's good to see that
you<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.060> example<00:02:09.149> scavenger<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.110> gun

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
you know for example scavenger and gun

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.470 
you know for example scavenger and gun
master<00:02:11.129> left<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.760> anyone<00:02:12.120> who<00:02:12.239> wants<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
is extra modes you can play them on all

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.100 
is extra modes you can play them on all
of<00:02:14.610> them<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.880> everything<00:02:15.660> else<00:02:15.870> pretty<00:02:16.020> much

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
of them and everything else pretty much

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.840 
of them and everything else pretty much
across<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.470> board<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.980> there<00:02:17.190> got<00:02:17.670> team

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
across the board is there got team

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.460 
across the board is there got team
deathmatch<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.450> close<00:02:19.020> call<00:02:19.230> team

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
deathmatch and close call team

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.250 
deathmatch and close call team
deathmatch<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.460> it's<00:02:20.730> good<00:02:21.110> anything<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.140> would

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
deathmatch so it's good anything I would

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.510 
deathmatch so it's good anything I would
say<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.740> would<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:22.950> been<00:02:23.010> really<00:02:23.130> nice<00:02:23.340> i

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
say it would have been really nice i

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.490 
say it would have been really nice i
think<00:02:23.730> if<00:02:23.880> they've<00:02:24.060> got<00:02:24.240> close<00:02:24.600> quarter<00:02:25.320> team

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
think if they've got close quarter team

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.170 
think if they've got close quarter team
deathmatch<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.640> maybe<00:02:26.820> they<00:02:26.970> could<00:02:27.090> have

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
deathmatch that maybe they could have

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.480 
deathmatch that maybe they could have
had<00:02:27.360> conquest<00:02:28.350> domination<00:02:28.470> because<00:02:29.310> that's

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
had conquest domination because that's

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.520 
had conquest domination because that's
such<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> fast<00:02:30.090> intense<00:02:30.690> game<00:02:30.990> mode<00:02:31.200> i<00:02:31.230> could

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
such a fast intense game mode i could

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.930 
such a fast intense game mode i could
imagine<00:02:31.650> conquest<00:02:32.400> domination<00:02:32.490> would<00:02:32.850> have

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
imagine conquest domination would have

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.880 
imagine conquest domination would have
been<00:02:33.060> really<00:02:33.210> nice<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.780> these<00:02:34.260> maps<00:02:34.470> by<00:02:34.710> them

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
been really nice on these maps by them

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.860 
been really nice on these maps by them
there<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.430> go<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.790> most<00:02:35.940> part<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.630> I'm
