00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
volume of two separate amps so let's put

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.790 
volume of two separate amps so let's put
this<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.150> our<00:00:33.180> pedal<00:00:33.540> board<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:33.900> see<00:00:34.650> this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
this on our pedal board and see this

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.770 
this on our pedal board and see this
thing<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.040> action<00:00:35.360> okay<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.420> we're<00:00:36.660> checking

different amps with one knob and the
knob<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.440> obviously<00:00:58.980> big<00:00:59.250> enough<00:00:59.550> where<00:00:59.730> you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
knob is obviously big enough where you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
knob is obviously big enough where you
can<00:00:59.879> move<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:00.899> foot<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.680> makes

for a great small compact stereo volume
let's<00:01:06.060> check<00:01:06.270> out<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> volume<00:01:06.690> levels

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.780 

so<00:01:38.540> it's<00:01:38.720> very<00:01:38.930> easy<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.500> use<00:01:39.700> very<00:01:40.700> simple

so it's very easy to use very simple

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.510 
so it's very easy to use very simple
it's<00:01:41.690> a<00:01:41.750> great<00:01:41.960> pedal<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.410> have<00:01:42.590> if<00:01:42.830> you<00:01:43.190> put<00:01:43.370> it

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
it's a great pedal to have if you put it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.730 
it's a great pedal to have if you put it
at<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.730> end<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.600> your<00:01:44.690> effects<00:01:45.080> chain<00:01:45.440> it

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
at the end of your effects chain it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.950 
at the end of your effects chain it
controls<00:01:46.310> your<00:01:46.490> overall<00:01:47.150> volume<00:01:47.420> it's<00:01:47.810> like

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
controls your overall volume it's like

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.870 
controls your overall volume it's like
turning<00:01:48.170> both<00:01:48.530> amps<00:01:49.010> up<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:49.430> down<00:01:49.580> at<00:01:49.820> the

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
turning both amps up and down at the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.030 
turning both amps up and down at the
same<00:01:50.000> time<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.990> controls<00:01:51.380> your<00:01:51.470> guitar<00:01:51.830> volume

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
same time it controls your guitar volume

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.520 
same time it controls your guitar volume
and<00:01:52.520> your<00:01:53.150> pedalboard<00:01:53.480> volume<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.260> let's<00:01:54.440> say

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
and your pedalboard volume so let's say

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.410 
and your pedalboard volume so let's say
you<00:01:54.560> get<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.860> good<00:01:55.160> sounding<00:01:55.610> overdrive<00:01:56.150> tone

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
you get a good sounding overdrive tone

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.870 
you get a good sounding overdrive tone
with<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:57.050> good<00:01:57.440> sounding<00:01:57.740> delay<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.370> you<00:01:58.700> don't

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
with a good sounding delay and you don't

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.940 
with a good sounding delay and you don't
want<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.240> mixes<00:01:59.660> or<00:02:00.020> your<00:02:00.200> guitar<00:02:00.500> gain<00:02:00.770> to

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
want the mixes or your guitar gain to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.950 
want the mixes or your guitar gain to
change<00:02:01.250> this<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.210> perfect<00:02:02.360> pedal<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.810> have

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
change this is the perfect pedal to have

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.050 
change this is the perfect pedal to have
it<00:02:03.140> end<00:02:03.410> of<00:02:03.620> your<00:02:03.740> pedal<00:02:04.010> board<00:02:04.040> because<00:02:04.640> it

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
it end of your pedal board because it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.240 
it end of your pedal board because it
just<00:02:05.180> takes<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.540> volume<00:02:06.050> and<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.380> level<00:02:07.130> that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
just takes the volume and the level that

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.859 
just takes the volume and the level that
you<00:02:07.400> have<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.880> sound<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:08.390> have<00:02:08.600> and

you have the sound that you have and
just<00:02:08.959> lifts<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.590> or<00:02:10.010> decreases<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:12.170> it's

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
just lifts it or decreases it so it's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.960

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.640 

and<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:29.120> not<00:02:29.150> very<00:02:29.600> sensitive<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.200> also<00:02:30.560> it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
and is not very sensitive it also it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.440 
and is not very sensitive it also it
gives<00:02:30.740> you<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.950> good<00:02:31.130> range<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.880> turn<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.240> up

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
gives you a good range to turn this up

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.210 
gives you a good range to turn this up
and<00:02:32.600> down<00:02:32.720> there's<00:02:32.930> not<00:02:33.080> very<00:02:33.110> many<00:02:33.620> volume

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
and down there's not very many volume

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.070 
and down there's not very many volume
jumps

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.320 

and<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:42.280> good<00:02:42.490> let's<00:02:42.730> say<00:02:42.790> if<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:42.940> slip

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
and that's good let's say if you slip

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and that's good let's say if you slip
with<00:02:43.480> your<00:02:43.600> foot<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.960> don't<00:02:44.140> want<00:02:44.260> your

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
with your foot you don't want your

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.030 
with your foot you don't want your
volume<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:45.040> jump<00:02:45.790> out<00:02:45.940> at<00:02:46.150> somebody<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.780> this

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
volume to jump out at somebody so this

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.500 
volume to jump out at somebody so this
increases<00:02:48.040> with<00:02:48.220> volume<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.790> decreases<00:02:49.270> with

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
increases with volume and decreases with

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:59.140 
increases with volume and decreases with
volume<00:02:49.900> at<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.140> very<00:02:50.470> good<00:02:50.800> slow<00:02:51.130> rate

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.209 

Oh
