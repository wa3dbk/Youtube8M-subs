 syndicate wants to be the new name 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 we are curious how this part because 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.080
 This time again virtuoso and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.939
 Parks and Resorts is a company 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220
 for breathtaking attractions in 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.810
 Their park is often known for pulling this 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.850
 own directly into the world of the topic 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.650
 into it and you will be amazed 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.509
 no more out this company has become 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.220
 now assembled with nintendo 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.990
 some elements of the world are the ones 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.729
 nintendo characters to shape the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.680
 big attractions should be around 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.970
 turning the main nintendo figures 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.650
 More detailed concepts and other details 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 have not been announced yet 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.740
 but as soon as the planning phase 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.280
 you can go ahead with it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 count 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.530
 we live in the era of virtual reality 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.420
 Headsets become one with all of them 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.280
 new devices and variants slow though 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.200
 certainly definitely 100 percent 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.600
 we could move to another world 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.820
 so far none of the concepts 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.700
 because now comes where I am a virtual 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.250
 reality leisure park a vr headset and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.290
 a pulse vest which is a vibration 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.370
 missed and physically just in 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.960
 This world belongs to 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.220
 basic equipment with weapon dummies as 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.860
 controller then enters a 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.450
 labyrinth has something from laser tag to man 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.130
 the glasses suddenly sit down in 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.840
 the confused corridors of a spaceship 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.610
 or in the middle of a jungle 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.650
 also nozzles are installed around steam heat 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.990
 to simulate sources and even rain 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.730
 the perfect game experience and if you are 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.739
 do not bother on magic dungeons or 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.239
 an intergalactic battle on one 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.680
 you also have foreign planets 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.209
 just put in a flight simulator 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.430
 and fight a battle of air 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.100
 Unfortunately, the first park comes only 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.840
 in utah but plans for more in 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.239
 we hope to exist all over the world 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.040
 just that as far as their sting 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.480
 what the promises can fulfill 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.820
 After all, everyone believes there were such 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.769
 promises often at half past one 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.430
 and then it was the end 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.630
 Also rather discussed with us if you are 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.890

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.239
