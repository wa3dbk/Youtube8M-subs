get<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:38.140> couple<00:02:38.470> more<00:02:38.709> mile<00:02:38.920> an<00:02:39.069> hour<00:02:39.189> out<00:02:39.430> this

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
get a couple more mile an hour out this

00:02:39.549 --> 00:03:04.410 
get a couple more mile an hour out this
room<00:02:45.060> ready<00:02:49.860> one<00:02:50.860> final<00:02:51.250> one

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.760 

okay<00:03:05.420> great<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.960> little<00:03:06.320> draw<00:03:07.120> mathematicae

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
okay great a little draw mathematicae

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.270 
okay great a little draw mathematicae
five<00:03:10.000> good<00:03:11.000> solid<00:03:11.390> ones<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:12.050> with<00:03:12.350> Nike<00:03:13.160> Vapor

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
five good solid ones a with Nike Vapor

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.270 
five good solid ones a with Nike Vapor
pro<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:14.660> switch<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:15.080> some<00:03:15.290> scientists<00:03:15.770> see

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
pro but switch on some scientists see

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.140 
pro but switch on some scientists see
how<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.490> comes<00:03:16.700> out

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
how that comes out

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.600 
how that comes out
so<00:03:17.770> again<00:03:18.770> you<00:03:18.920> know<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.040> little<00:03:19.310> separate

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
so again you know a little separate

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.060 
so again you know a little separate
video<00:03:20.180> on<00:03:20.240> this<00:03:20.510> one<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:21.380> know<00:03:21.410> like<00:03:21.500> all<00:03:21.890> the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
video on this one you know like all the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.670 
video on this one you know like all the
talus<00:03:22.430> drivers<00:03:22.880> sits<00:03:23.330> very<00:03:23.660> very<00:03:24.170> neutral

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
talus drivers sits very very neutral

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.280 
talus drivers sits very very neutral
very<00:03:24.920> very<00:03:25.640> adjustable<00:03:25.880> as<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.720> NACA<00:03:27.050> one<00:03:27.170> is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
very very adjustable as the NACA one is

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.740 
very very adjustable as the NACA one is
with<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.500> net<00:03:27.740> that<00:03:28.730> looks<00:03:28.970> great<00:03:29.240> behind<00:03:29.570> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
with a net that looks great behind the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:39.130 
with a net that looks great behind the
ball<00:03:33.340> for<00:03:34.340> me<00:03:34.490> a<00:03:34.520> much<00:03:34.790> much<00:03:35.180> louder<00:03:35.660> driver<00:03:38.140> we

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
ball for me a much much louder driver we

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.410 
ball for me a much much louder driver we
really<00:03:39.590> feel<00:03:39.830> like<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:40.250> explodes<00:03:40.760> up<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.209> base

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
really feel like it explodes up the base

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.510 
really feel like it explodes up the base
to<00:03:42.020> me<00:03:42.170> compared<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.650> thank<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:46.400> just

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
to me compared to thank you it's just

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.310 
to me compared to thank you it's just
why<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.670> feel<00:03:47.000> will<00:03:47.330> see<00:03:47.510> on<00:03:47.600> five<00:03:47.840> stop<00:03:48.140> when

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
why I feel will see on five stop when

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.150 
why I feel will see on five stop when
that's<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.590> case

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:07.150 

seventy

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:23.540 

okay<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.220> show<00:04:08.610> them<00:04:08.790> at<00:04:08.910> sea

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.200 

shut<00:04:24.550> number<00:04:24.760> three

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
shut number three

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.610 
shut number three
and<00:04:25.510> when<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:25.690> said<00:04:25.900> completely<00:04:26.350> different

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
and when I said completely different

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.250 
and when I said completely different
sound<00:04:26.830> even<00:04:27.400> though<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.550> looks<00:04:28.260> fairly

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
sound even though it looks fairly

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:45.360 
sound even though it looks fairly
similar<00:04:36.090> great<00:04:37.090> flying<00:04:37.620> shaking<00:04:38.620> that<00:04:44.370> we

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
similar great flying shaking that we

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.210 
similar great flying shaking that we
certainly<00:04:45.790> for<00:04:46.000> me<00:04:46.199> when<00:04:47.199> my<00:04:47.229> eye<00:04:47.410> looks<00:04:48.070> like

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
certainly for me when my eye looks like

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.920 
certainly for me when my eye looks like
it<00:04:48.370> spins<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.880> little<00:04:49.030> bit<00:04:49.300> less<00:04:49.479> looks<00:04:49.810> a

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
it spins a little bit less looks a

00:04:49.930 --> 00:05:06.870 
it spins a little bit less looks a
little<00:04:50.169> bit<00:04:50.470> flatter<00:04:50.830> trajectory<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:06.070> one

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
little bit flatter trajectory and one

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:20.419 
little bit flatter trajectory and one
final<00:05:07.479> one<00:05:07.630> with<00:05:07.840> d3

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:20.429 

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:22.529 

again<00:05:21.429> keep<00:05:22.089> quiet

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
again keep quiet

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.859 
again keep quiet
really<00:05:22.779> it's<00:05:22.929> over<00:05:23.549> so<00:05:24.549> guys<00:05:24.759> let's<00:05:24.999> put<00:05:25.719> some

really it's over so guys let's put some

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:28.499 
really it's over so guys let's put some
numbers<00:05:25.899> on<00:05:26.139> flight<00:05:26.409> school<00:05:27.059> probably<00:05:28.059> fairly

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
numbers on flight school probably fairly

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.319 
numbers on flight school probably fairly
close<00:05:28.929> have<00:05:29.379> I<00:05:29.529> struck<00:05:29.949> those<00:05:30.159> not<00:05:30.579> absolute

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:31.329 
close have I struck those not absolute

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:34.289 
close have I struck those not absolute
perfection<00:05:31.779> or<00:05:32.109> fairly<00:05:32.979> close<00:05:33.249> some<00:05:34.059> that<00:05:34.179> was

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:34.299 
perfection or fairly close some that was

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:37.129 
perfection or fairly close some that was
on<00:05:34.419> flight<00:05:34.629> scope

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.299 

okay<00:05:38.139> guys<00:05:38.349> we<00:05:38.559> can<00:05:38.709> see<00:05:38.829> the<00:05:38.949> numbers<00:05:39.279> there

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:39.309 
okay guys we can see the numbers there

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.809 
okay guys we can see the numbers there
with<00:05:39.759> name<00:05:40.179> one<00:05:40.389> 5d3<00:05:40.929> and<00:05:41.349> vapor<00:05:41.769> Pro<00:05:41.979> just<00:05:42.579> one

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
with name one 5d3 and vapor Pro just one

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.509 
with name one 5d3 and vapor Pro just one
yard<00:05:43.089> and<00:05:43.269> it<00:05:43.329> carry<00:05:43.629> but<00:05:44.439> seven<00:05:44.859> yards<00:05:45.219> total

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:45.519 
yard and it carry but seven yards total

yard and it carry but seven yards total
overall<00:05:46.559> strong<00:05:47.559> vapor<00:05:47.889> Pro<00:05:48.069> a<00:05:48.099> little<00:05:48.669> bit

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819 
overall strong vapor Pro a little bit

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:51.029 
overall strong vapor Pro a little bit
quicker<00:05:49.029> didn't<00:05:49.869> strike<00:05:50.199> it<00:05:50.379> quite<00:05:50.619> as<00:05:50.799> well

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
quicker didn't strike it quite as well

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.119 
quicker didn't strike it quite as well
but<00:05:51.279> certainly<00:05:52.179> with<00:05:52.329> both<00:05:52.539> drivers<00:05:53.049> set<00:05:53.349> nine

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
but certainly with both drivers set nine

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.999 
but certainly with both drivers set nine
and<00:05:54.399> a<00:05:54.459> half<00:05:54.489> with<00:05:55.059> the<00:05:55.149> stiff<00:05:55.359> shaft<00:05:56.009> launched

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
and a half with the stiff shaft launched

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.489 
and a half with the stiff shaft launched
the<00:05:57.399> tight<00:05:58.179> with<00:05:58.389> slightly<00:05:58.659> higher<00:05:58.809> and<00:05:59.199> spun

00:05:59.489 --> 00:05:59.499 
the tight with slightly higher and spun

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:01.109 
the tight with slightly higher and spun
it<00:05:59.529> west<00:05:59.859> which<00:06:00.159> is<00:06:00.279> gonna<00:06:00.429> give<00:06:00.609> us<00:06:00.669> that<00:06:00.939> a

00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:01.119 
it west which is gonna give us that a

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:03.299 
it west which is gonna give us that a
little<00:06:01.659> bit<00:06:01.839> more<00:06:02.019> distance<00:06:02.529> but<00:06:03.129> both

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:03.309 
little bit more distance but both

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:05.789 
little bit more distance but both
performed<00:06:03.849> really<00:06:04.269> really<00:06:04.539> well<00:06:04.799> good

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:05.799 
performed really really well good

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:08.119 
performed really really well good
numbers<00:06:06.219> not<00:06:06.579> sure<00:06:06.849> either<00:06:07.239> of<00:06:07.569> them<00:06:07.779> are<00:06:07.869> set

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
numbers not sure either of them are set

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.249 
numbers not sure either of them are set
absolutely<00:06:09.129> ideally<00:06:09.669> for<00:06:09.879> me<00:06:09.939> but<00:06:10.749> we<00:06:10.839> can<00:06:10.869> see

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
absolutely ideally for me but we can see

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.409 
absolutely ideally for me but we can see
they're<00:06:11.619> just<00:06:12.099> a<00:06:12.189> very<00:06:12.219> slight<00:06:12.819> winner<00:06:13.209> with

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
they're just a very slight winner with

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.189 
they're just a very slight winner with
the<00:06:13.449> name<00:06:13.779> one<00:06:13.989> 5d3<00:06:14.649> from<00:06:15.189> Titleist<00:06:16.199> okay

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
the name one 5d3 from Titleist okay

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:17.789 
the name one 5d3 from Titleist okay
absolutely

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:17.799 
absolutely

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:20.939 
absolutely
see<00:06:17.949> they're<00:06:18.159> very<00:06:18.659> very<00:06:19.659> close<00:06:19.869> numbers<00:06:20.229> but

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
see they're very very close numbers but

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.819 
see they're very very close numbers but
