00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.000
 The difference between heliocentric and helical movement ... 

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:21.001
 We have a lot of comment on our movement in the galaxy and the "frame of reference" ... 

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:25.002
 This video is just about that. 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.000
 Size, distance and time is NOT scale. Only movements are shown. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 The center of the galaxy is likely to be a black hole or central star. 

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:47.001
 (this is the star in the video) 

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:57.001
 There are about 400 billion stars in our galaxy. 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.440
 The galaxy diameter is 100,000 light years (approx. 1000 quadrillion KM) 

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:38.002
 The distance from the center of the galaxy to the sun is about 27 thousand trillion KM 

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:44.004
 Galaxy plane 

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:53.004
 Star particle wind. 

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:44.604
 A tour around the galaxy center of the sun lasts 226 million. 

00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:51.404
 A tour of the sun's vortex movement lasts 26 thousand years. 

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:57.007
 Our current angle is 60 degrees 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.380
 The sun draws 8692 spirals in a round of galactic orbit. 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.000
 Approximate speed of the sun 720 thousand KM / h 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:29.000
 The other planets with Earth as the sun draws spiral (vortex). 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.340
 And our galaxy is also in the form of Vortex. 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.080
 Vortex shape in the world is seen everywhere in nature 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:57.360
 "He created the night, the day, the sun, and the moon. Each one swims in an orbit." Enbiya33
