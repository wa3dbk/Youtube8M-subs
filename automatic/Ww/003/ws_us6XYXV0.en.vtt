hey<00:00:10.560> guys<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.160> Steven<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.670> today<00:00:11.880> we're

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
hey guys this is Steven and today we're

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.150 
hey guys this is Steven and today we're
going<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.360> be<00:00:12.450> making<00:00:12.770> flashing<00:00:13.770> lights<00:00:13.980> in

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
going to be making flashing lights in

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.710 
going to be making flashing lights in
cinema<00:00:14.460> 4d<00:00:14.610> like<00:00:14.970> the<00:00:15.060> ones<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.510> just

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
cinema 4d like the ones that you just

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.960 
cinema 4d like the ones that you just
saw<00:00:15.930> now<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.280> just<00:00:17.490> messing<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
saw now this is just messing with the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.120 
saw now this is just messing with the
light<00:00:18.150> intensities<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> making<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.560> keyframe

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
light intensities and making a keyframe

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.850 
light intensities and making a keyframe
all<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.730> way<00:00:20.790> throughout<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.090> entire<00:00:21.450> thing

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
all the way throughout the entire thing

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.590 
all the way throughout the entire thing
so<00:00:22.860> what<00:00:23.310> we're<00:00:23.430> gonna<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.700> doing<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.150> coming

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
so what we're gonna be doing is coming

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.570 
so what we're gonna be doing is coming
up<00:00:24.690> to<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> light<00:00:25.320> tab<00:00:25.590> holding<00:00:26.460> that

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
up to here to the light tab holding that

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.019 
up to here to the light tab holding that
down<00:00:26.790> and<00:00:27.090> selecting<00:00:27.750> light<00:00:28.759> and<00:00:29.759> I'm<00:00:29.849> just

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
down and selecting light and I'm just

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.670 
down and selecting light and I'm just
going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> reposition<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.349> soon<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
going to reposition this as soon as it

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.770 
going to reposition this as soon as it
comes<00:00:31.800> out<00:00:33.020> there<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.110> goes<00:00:35.420> just<00:00:36.420> make<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.720> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
comes out there it goes just make it a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.770 
comes out there it goes just make it a
little<00:00:36.870> higher<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.650> and<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.600> light

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
little higher like that and the light

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.590 
little higher like that and the light
intensity<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.380> at<00:00:40.500> 100%<00:00:41.100> right<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.480> but<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
intensity is at 100% right now but to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.870 
intensity is at 100% right now but to
keyframe<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.560> have<00:00:43.650> to<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.160> while<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
keyframe all we have to do is while the

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.700 
keyframe all we have to do is while the
light<00:00:45.060> is<00:00:45.300> selected<00:00:45.810> come<00:00:46.230> down<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.590> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
light is selected come down here to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.460 
light is selected come down here to
where<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.860> says<00:00:46.950> intensity<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.230> all<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.380> have

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
where it says intensity and all we have

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.520 
where it says intensity and all we have
to<00:00:49.560> do<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.920> hold<00:00:50.100> ctrl<00:00:50.580> and<00:00:51.570> dot<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.200> like<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to do is hold ctrl and dot it like that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.430 
to do is hold ctrl and dot it like that
and<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.070> makes<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.430> little<00:00:53.640> keyframe<00:00:54.230> now<00:00:55.230> I'm

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and that makes a little keyframe now I'm

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.690 
and that makes a little keyframe now I'm
going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.650> drag<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.860> forward<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.340> timeline

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
going to drag it forward on the timeline

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.440 
going to drag it forward on the timeline
to<00:00:56.760> frame<00:00:57.240> 10<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.760> I'm<00:00:59.760> gonna<00:00:59.850> hit<00:01:00.030> control

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
to frame 10 and I'm gonna hit control

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.910 
to frame 10 and I'm gonna hit control
intensity<00:01:00.960> down<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.350> bring<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.910> down<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.210> zero

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
intensity down and bring it down to zero

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.960 
intensity down and bring it down to zero
we're<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.820> should

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
we're going to do that and that should

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.700 
we're going to do that and that should
have<00:01:06.030> made<00:01:06.180> another<00:01:06.420> key<00:01:06.659> frame<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
have made another key frame so that it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
have made another key frame so that it
lights<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.200> then<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> goes<00:01:10.470> down<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.909> then

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
lights up and then it goes down and then

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.109 
lights up and then it goes down and then
all<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:14.280> bring<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> back<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:14.969> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
all we have to do is bring it back up to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.469 
all we have to do is bring it back up to
100<00:01:15.450> again<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> I'll<00:01:17.939> bring<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> back<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.329> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
100 again so I'll bring it back up to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.099 
100 again so I'll bring it back up to
100<00:01:18.780> hold<00:01:18.960> control<00:01:19.579> click<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:20.700> again<00:01:20.789> and<00:01:21.109> that

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
100 hold control click it again and that

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.130 
100 hold control click it again and that
made<00:01:22.320> another<00:01:22.530> keyframe<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.899> it<00:01:24.899> would<00:01:25.020> be

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
made another keyframe so it would be

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.410 
made another keyframe so it would be
flashing<00:01:25.469> sort<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.429> like<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.700> we'll<00:01:27.060> play<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
flashing sort of like that we'll play it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.039 
flashing sort of like that we'll play it
through<00:01:29.149> it'll<00:01:30.149> be<00:01:30.240> cleaner<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.719> final

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
through it'll be cleaner in the final

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.989 
through it'll be cleaner in the final
video<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:31.710> pretty<00:01:31.859> much<00:01:32.039> it<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
video but that's pretty much it if you

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:35.300 
video but that's pretty much it if you
want<00:01:33.179> to<00:01:33.270> make<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.539> you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:35.159> bit

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
want to make it you know a little bit

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.919 
want to make it you know a little bit
faster<00:01:35.789> you<00:01:35.999> can<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.270> drag<00:01:36.509> these<00:01:36.659> keyframes

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
faster you can just drag these keyframes

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.569 
faster you can just drag these keyframes
together<00:01:37.469> like<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:40.130> it'll<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.249> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
together like this so that it'll be a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.300 
together like this so that it'll be a
little<00:01:41.789> faster<00:01:42.179> so<00:01:42.799> start<00:01:43.799> back<00:01:43.950> over<00:01:44.219> here

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
little faster so start back over here

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.440 
little faster so start back over here
just<00:01:47.310> tell<00:01:47.429> us<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.609> bit<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:47.909> flashing

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
just tell us a little bit more flashing

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
just tell us a little bit more flashing
but<00:01:49.139> there<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.100> messing

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
but there you go that's just messing

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.800 
but there you go that's just messing
with<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> light<00:01:50.819> intensity<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:51.600> make

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
with the light intensity how to make

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.059 
with the light intensity how to make
flashing<00:01:52.139> lights<00:01:52.319> I<00:01:52.530> hope<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.770> guys<00:01:52.889> like

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069
