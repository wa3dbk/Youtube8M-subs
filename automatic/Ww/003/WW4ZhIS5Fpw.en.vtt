the series the graphics overall I felt
were<00:02:51.319> bland<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.920> dated<00:02:52.280> especially<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.090> the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
were bland and dated especially in the

were bland and dated especially in the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220

quality<00:02:55.670> as<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> previous<00:02:56.090> games<00:02:56.480> but<00:02:57.020> by

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
quality as the previous games but by

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.510 
quality as the previous games but by
this<00:02:57.260> point<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.709> time<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:58.069> feel<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.400> they

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
this point in time I feel that they

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.699 
this point in time I feel that they
should<00:02:58.550> be<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.790> lot<00:02:59.000> better<00:02:59.230> hopefully<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.350> pc

actually let me have them basically I'm
saying<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:31.900> game<00:06:32.050> is<00:06:32.200> pretty<00:06:32.380> glitchy<00:06:32.740> as

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
saying the game is pretty glitchy as

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.520 
saying the game is pretty glitchy as
well<00:06:33.630> Assassin's<00:06:34.630> Creed<00:06:34.840> 3<00:06:35.020> took<00:06:35.289> me<00:06:35.410> roughly

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
well Assassin's Creed 3 took me roughly

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.080 
well Assassin's Creed 3 took me roughly
30<00:06:36.010> hours<00:06:36.340> to<00:06:36.460> complete<00:06:36.820> including

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
30 hours to complete including

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.790 
30 hours to complete including
completion<00:06:37.780> of<00:06:37.870> majority<00:06:38.440> of<00:06:38.470> the<00:06:38.590> side

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
completion of majority of the side

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.680 
completion of majority of the side
quests<00:06:39.160> and<00:06:39.250> collection<00:06:40.150> of<00:06:40.270> most<00:06:40.479> of<00:06:40.630> the

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
quests and collection of most of the

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.870 
quests and collection of most of the
collectibles<00:06:41.430> attempting<00:06:42.430> to<00:06:42.520> earn<00:06:42.669> one

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
collectibles attempting to earn one

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.670 
collectibles attempting to earn one
hundred<00:06:43.210> percent<00:06:43.289> synchronization<00:06:44.289> would

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
hundred percent synchronization would

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.290 
hundred percent synchronization would
have<00:06:44.770> taken<00:06:44.950> several<00:06:45.310> more<00:06:45.550> hours<00:06:45.580> so<00:06:45.880> I

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
have taken several more hours so I

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.820 
have taken several more hours so I
certainly<00:06:46.599> can<00:06:46.930> say<00:06:47.080> I<00:06:47.110> got<00:06:47.380> my<00:06:47.500> money's<00:06:47.800> worth

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830

throughout this review i've mentioned a

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.700 
throughout this review i've mentioned a
lot<00:06:52.120> of<00:06:52.270> negative<00:06:52.720> things<00:06:52.960> and<00:06:53.200> i<00:06:53.349> stand<00:06:53.620> by

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
lot of negative things and i stand by

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.740 
lot of negative things and i stand by
those<00:06:53.950> comments<00:06:54.520> there<00:06:55.060> are<00:06:55.180> a<00:06:55.240> lot<00:06:55.419> of<00:06:55.450> things

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
those comments there are a lot of things

those comments there are a lot of things
that<00:06:55.930> keep<00:06:56.080> ac3<00:06:56.830> from<00:06:57.039> being<00:06:57.250> great<00:06:57.610> as<00:06:57.820> it

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
that keep ac3 from being great as it

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.060 
that keep ac3 from being great as it
stands<00:06:58.810> i<00:06:58.990> find<00:06:59.200> the<00:06:59.289> game<00:06:59.440> to<00:06:59.560> be<00:06:59.590> just

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
stands i find the game to be just

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.070 
stands i find the game to be just
average<00:07:00.460> or<00:07:00.700> slightly<00:07:01.030> better<00:07:01.360> than<00:07:01.479> that<00:07:01.780> but

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
average or slightly better than that but

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.469 
average or slightly better than that but
not<00:07:02.260> good<00:07:02.500> or<00:07:02.770> great<00:07:03.010> the<00:07:03.880> story<00:07:04.180> and

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
not good or great the story and

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:05.700 
not good or great the story and
interactive<00:07:05.020> learning<00:07:05.169> that<00:07:05.440> takes<00:07:05.590> place

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
interactive learning that takes place

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.800 
interactive learning that takes place
where<00:07:06.070> the<00:07:06.160> best<00:07:06.370> part<00:07:06.669> of<00:07:06.729> the<00:07:06.849> game<00:07:06.880> the<00:07:07.570> rest

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
where the best part of the game the rest

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.050 
where the best part of the game the rest
certainly<00:07:08.200> needed<00:07:08.380> more<00:07:08.620> work<00:07:08.650> if<00:07:09.639> you<00:07:09.849> like

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
certainly needed more work if you like
