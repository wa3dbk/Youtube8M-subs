another<00:02:51.569> game<00:02:51.930> anyway<00:02:52.200> with<00:02:52.379> Ibrahimovic<00:02:52.769> and

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
another game anyway with Ibrahimovic and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.740 
another game anyway with Ibrahimovic and
he<00:02:53.400> pretty<00:02:53.549> much<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:53.790> runs<00:02:54.209> through<00:02:54.599> this

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
he pretty much just runs through this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.970 
he pretty much just runs through this
guy's<00:02:54.959> team<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.439> he<00:02:55.500> was<00:02:55.620> actually<00:02:55.739> on<00:02:55.950> the

guy's team and he was actually on the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.800 
guy's team and he was actually on the
mic<00:02:56.189> raging<00:02:56.669> I<00:02:56.760> think<00:02:56.970> he<00:02:57.060> was<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.209> Geordie<00:02:57.659> it's

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810

as you can see rage quit again so early

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.530 
as you can see rage quit again so early
on<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.489> game<00:03:02.519> when<00:03:02.849> slatten<00:03:03.209> had<00:03:03.359> two

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
on in the game when slatten had two

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.330 
on in the game when slatten had two
goals<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.989> know<00:03:04.019> his<00:03:04.319> Latin<00:03:04.620> was<00:03:04.799> going<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
goals you know his Latin was going to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.890 
goals you know his Latin was going to
score<00:03:05.519> four<00:03:05.760> or<00:03:05.790> five<00:03:06.060> goals<00:03:06.359> in<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.689> game

score four or five goals in that game

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.720 
score four or five goals in that game
and<00:03:07.169> it's<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.799> unfortunate<00:03:08.099> because<00:03:08.489> I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
and it's just unfortunate because I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.890 
and it's just unfortunate because I
would<00:03:08.849> have<00:03:08.939> boosted<00:03:09.239> his<00:03:09.389> goal<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.750> gain

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
would have boosted his goal to gain

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.199 
would have boosted his goal to gain
ratio<00:03:10.319> anyway<00:03:10.919> the<00:03:11.129> next<00:03:11.159> team<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:11.909> come<00:03:12.090> up

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
ratio anyway the next team we come up

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.300 
ratio anyway the next team we come up

gonna be moving on to the final game of
this<00:06:48.190> episode<00:06:48.550> is<00:06:48.610> a<00:06:48.700> pretty<00:06:48.880> different<00:06:49.180> team

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
this episode is a pretty different team

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.000 
this episode is a pretty different team
you<00:06:49.630> don't<00:06:49.780> really<00:06:49.960> see<00:06:50.139> teams<00:06:50.440> like<00:06:50.680> that<00:06:50.889> on

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
you don't really see teams like that on

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.950 
you don't really see teams like that on
FIFA<00:06:51.460> too<00:06:51.639> much<00:06:51.910> so<00:06:52.090> fair<00:06:52.300> play<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.480> him<00:06:52.630> takes

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
FIFA too much so fair play to him takes

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.650 
FIFA too much so fair play to him takes
a<00:06:53.110> lead<00:06:53.320> with<00:06:54.070> his<00:06:54.430> playa<00:06:54.850> there<00:06:55.060> I<00:06:55.389> think

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
a lead with his playa there I think

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.390 
a lead with his playa there I think
you're<00:06:55.780> the<00:06:55.870> Sun<00:06:56.169> the<00:06:56.590> five-star<00:06:57.070> week<00:06:57.220> for

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
you're the Sun the five-star week for

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.980 
you're the Sun the five-star week for
their<00:06:57.490> helping<00:06:57.820> him<00:06:57.910> out<00:06:58.000> he<00:06:58.150> gets<00:06:58.300> the<00:06:58.540> second

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
their helping him out he gets the second

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.440 
their helping him out he gets the second
goal<00:06:59.110> as<00:06:59.290> well<00:06:59.440> in<00:06:59.560> the<00:06:59.680> 72nd<00:07:00.430> minute<00:07:00.580> at<00:07:01.330> this

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
goal as well in the 72nd minute at this

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.790 
goal as well in the 72nd minute at this
point<00:07:01.660> I'm<00:07:01.810> thinking<00:07:01.990> well<00:07:02.380> this<00:07:02.410> is<00:07:02.620> game

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
point I'm thinking well this is game

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.020 
point I'm thinking well this is game
over<00:07:02.830> already<00:07:03.160> and<00:07:03.460> maybe<00:07:03.580> this<00:07:03.790> is<00:07:03.910> another

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
over already and maybe this is another

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.909 
over already and maybe this is another
loss<00:07:04.419> with<00:07:05.020> this<00:07:05.230> team<00:07:05.380> maybe<00:07:05.590> it's<00:07:05.740> time<00:07:05.889> to

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
loss with this team maybe it's time to

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.560 
loss with this team maybe it's time to
change<00:07:06.160> a<00:07:06.310> team<00:07:06.460> but<00:07:06.610> Ibrahimovic<00:07:06.850> was<00:07:07.330> having

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
change a team but Ibrahimovic was having

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.480 
change a team but Ibrahimovic was having
none<00:07:07.690> of<00:07:07.750> it<00:07:07.960> he<00:07:08.320> pretty<00:07:08.470> much<00:07:08.590> runs<00:07:08.680> through

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
none of it he pretty much runs through

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.400 
none of it he pretty much runs through
his<00:07:09.760> whole<00:07:10.060> defense<00:07:10.480> gets<00:07:10.720> a<00:07:10.810> bit<00:07:10.840> lucky<00:07:11.230> but<00:07:11.380> a

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410 
his whole defense gets a bit lucky but a

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.990 
his whole defense gets a bit lucky but a
lovely<00:07:11.950> finish<00:07:12.160> with<00:07:12.400> the<00:07:12.490> outside<00:07:12.820> of<00:07:12.940> his

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
lovely finish with the outside of his

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.510 
lovely finish with the outside of his
boot<00:07:13.270> to<00:07:13.480> get<00:07:13.660> the<00:07:13.750> 19th<00:07:14.200> goal<00:07:14.440> of<00:07:14.710> this

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520
