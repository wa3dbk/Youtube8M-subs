00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
some areas where the foundation can be a

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.380 
some areas where the foundation can be a
little<00:01:18.189> bit<00:01:18.340> more<00:01:18.490> challenging<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:19.119> apply

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
little bit more challenging to apply

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.700 
little bit more challenging to apply
which<00:01:19.630> tends<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.960> be<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.170> corners<00:01:20.530> on<00:01:20.650> the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
which tends to be the corners on the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.039 
which tends to be the corners on the
nose<00:01:20.890> decrease<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.970> chin<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.720> little<00:01:22.930> bit

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
nose decrease the chin and a little bit

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.590 
nose decrease the chin and a little bit
underneath<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.650> eyes<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:25.060> need<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.360> apply

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
underneath the eyes you need to apply

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.140 
underneath the eyes you need to apply
your<00:01:25.840> prime<00:01:26.049> up<00:01:26.229> after<00:01:26.770> your<00:01:26.920> moisturizer<00:01:27.490> so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
your prime up after your moisturizer so

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.940 
your prime up after your moisturizer so
usually<00:01:28.390> what<00:01:28.689> I'll<00:01:28.840> do<00:01:29.020> is<00:01:29.259> moisturize<00:01:29.770> the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
usually what I'll do is moisturize the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.770 
usually what I'll do is moisturize the
skin<00:01:29.979> and<00:01:30.430> leave<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.909> skin<00:01:31.150> for<00:01:31.299> about<00:01:31.479> two<00:01:31.750> or

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
skin and leave the skin for about two or

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.420 
skin and leave the skin for about two or
three<00:01:32.079> minutes<00:01:32.229> for<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.650> moisturizer<00:01:33.159> to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
three minutes for the moisturizer to

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.520 
three minutes for the moisturizer to
absorb<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:34.060> then<00:01:34.720> what<00:01:34.900> I'll<00:01:35.020> definitely<00:01:35.229> do

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
absorb in then what I'll definitely do

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.200 
absorb in then what I'll definitely do
is<00:01:35.650> get<00:01:35.829> straight<00:01:36.159> in<00:01:36.310> with<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.549> primer<00:01:36.820> and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
is get straight in with the primer and

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.690 
is get straight in with the primer and
what<00:01:38.200> I'll<00:01:38.290> do<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.500> massage<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:39.189> primer<00:01:39.460> in

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
what I'll do is massage the primer in

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.429
