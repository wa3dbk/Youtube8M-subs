00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.349
 hello to all i'm margot du 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.639
 blogging fashion.fr in this video 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.169
 deco i will show you how to do 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.169
 suspended terrarium 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.930
 my first terrarium I will use 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.400
 so a transparent ball so that's 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.689
 things you can buy everything 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.800
 done and it's super convenient because it 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 there is a job hook can the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.369
 suspend afterwards and I'm going 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.590
 plant a plant that does not need 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.520
 of water so a tillandsias and that's it 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.690
 it's still much more practical 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.820
 to not have to water them 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.430
 so I started by putting down the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.210
 bulb inside and I'm going to the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.519
 cover with earth 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.050
 and as often terrariums are 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.739
 rather small things it's a job 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.350
 quite meticulous 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.350
 I use a spoon to handle mater 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.640
 I will put to decorate small 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 gravel so it exists in full of 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.340
 colors it exists in many forms 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.140
 there are also very small pebbles 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.260
 even added foam is very 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.260
 pretty 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.890
 so that's what it gives I'm going 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.789
 first do my second is then I 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.000
 will show you how we can 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.000
 install 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.570
 for my second terrarium I 'm going 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.190
 always use the same worm bubble 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.300
 the little glass nest with the hook 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.800
 it's very convenient I find it very 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.240
 pretty but there is no limit you can 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.530
 really use a lot of things from 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.720
 small jars of small bottles 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.920
 even a small aquarium is very pretty 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.330
 but maybe more difficult to 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.010
 suspend in any case there I go 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.540
 continue to use small plants 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.820
 who do not need water because 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.100
 it is very practical is also a microphone 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.630
 succulent I already told you about these 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.070
 planes in another video is of 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.930
 plants that really requires very very 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.100
 little water so here is always very 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.660
 convenient to stay in the side 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 practice with plants otherwise if you 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.850
 do not have a green thumb it can do 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 disaster 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.100
 I will remove the succulent 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.160
 you 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 you 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.060
 and for the decoration this time I'm going 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.030
 use colored sand so the same 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.590
 can also use small pebbles 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.970
 pebbles like here but the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.390
 shu is funny to add a small 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.390
 touch of color 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.260
 so my two terrariums are over 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.340
 it really makes small universes 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.450
 little worlds in little balls 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.650
 it's really what I like in this 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.650
 terrarium shape 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.880
 for hangers I will use 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.350
 the rope of the rope really raw you 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.760
 know that I like that and actually I 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.410
 will double it like that I'm when 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.430
 even sure that it fits well and make a 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.430
 knot so I'm going to show you that 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.720
 and that's what terrariums give 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.310
 once suspended so I have them 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.450
 hung at a different height because 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 that as I hooked them to the same 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.480
 place I did not want little ones nor 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.890
 of glasses clash 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.390
 so I hope the result will have you 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.130
 more if you want to find more 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.350
