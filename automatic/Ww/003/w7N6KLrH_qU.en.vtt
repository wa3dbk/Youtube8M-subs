okay<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.469> what<00:00:02.280> we<00:00:02.399> really<00:00:02.669> need<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.850> do<00:00:03.030> now<00:00:03.210> is

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay so what we really need to do now is

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.240 
okay so what we really need to do now is
is<00:00:03.870> check<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:04.440> against<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.040> actual

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
is check this against the actual

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.549 
is check this against the actual
bodywork<00:00:05.819> see<00:00:06.420> how<00:00:06.540> close<00:00:06.899> we<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:09.559> little

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
bodywork see how close we are a little

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.540 
bodywork see how close we are a little
bit<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.769> tweaking<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.610> adjustment<00:00:14.000> try<00:00:15.000> up

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.660 

that<00:00:20.550> doesn't<00:00:20.820> look<00:00:21.090> too<00:00:21.150> bad<00:00:21.390> look<00:00:21.869> at<00:00:21.990> that

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
that doesn't look too bad look at that

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.160 
that doesn't look too bad look at that
it's<00:00:23.670> pretty<00:00:24.029> close<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.779> sides

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
it's pretty close to the sides

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.990 
it's pretty close to the sides
Burning<00:00:25.710> Man<00:00:25.740> needs<00:00:25.980> plenty<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.430> overlap<00:00:26.849> as

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
Burning Man needs plenty of overlap as

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.130 
Burning Man needs plenty of overlap as
I've<00:00:27.119> described<00:00:27.510> before<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.900> make<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I've described before you make the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.349 
I've described before you make the
tunnel<00:00:28.410> much<00:00:28.560> bigger<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.730> advantage<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.300> that

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
tunnel much bigger the advantage of that

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
tunnel much bigger the advantage of that
is<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.869> shrinkie<00:00:31.289> max<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.920> will<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.250> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
is the shrinkie max that we will get in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.310 
is the shrinkie max that we will get in
these<00:00:32.520> panels<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.360> trim<00:00:33.719> them<00:00:33.899> off<00:00:33.930> so

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
these panels we can trim them off so

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.900 
these panels we can trim them off so
they<00:00:34.440> won't<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.770> visible<00:00:37.489> there's<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.550> first

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
they won't be visible there's a first

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.840 
they won't be visible there's a first
triumph<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:40.020> let's<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.860> compare

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
triumph of that let's just compare

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.380 
triumph of that let's just compare
it<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> panel<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.809> made<00:00:42.989> earlier

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
it now with a panel that we made earlier

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.020 
it now with a panel that we made earlier
try<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> two<00:00:45.629> together<00:00:45.840> -<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.469> go

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
try the two together - there we go

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.229 
try the two together - there we go
looks<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.950> reasonably<00:00:49.950> well<00:00:52.820> that<00:00:53.820> fits<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
looks like reasonably well that fits to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.770 
looks like reasonably well that fits to
the<00:00:54.329> body<00:00:58.699> yet<00:00:59.699> same<00:00:59.969> again<00:01:00.239> look<00:01:00.390> we've

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the body yet same again look we've

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
the body yet same again look we've
clearly<00:01:01.079> got<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:01.680> profiling

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
clearly got the right profiling

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
clearly got the right profiling
curvature<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.140> flows<00:01:04.530> down

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
curvature do we think it flows down

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.640 
curvature do we think it flows down
correctly<00:01:05.729> quite<00:01:06.600> good<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
correctly quite good I think is that a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.560 
correctly quite good I think is that a
little<00:01:08.220> bit<00:01:08.340> more<00:01:08.490> shrinking<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.479> we

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
little bit more shrinking and I think we

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.530 
little bit more shrinking and I think we
need<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> progress<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> medium<00:01:10.770> crown<00:01:11.070> wheel

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
need to progress to a medium crown wheel

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
need to progress to a medium crown wheel
possibly<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.600> smoothing<00:01:13.020> wheel<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.700> that's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
possibly the smoothing wheel and that's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.990 
possibly the smoothing wheel and that's
that<00:01:14.880> panel<00:01:15.240> Marlys<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.979> stage

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.620 

okay<00:01:22.220> let's<00:01:23.220> swap<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> wheels<00:01:23.640> around<00:01:29.630> so

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
okay let's swap the wheels around so

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
okay let's swap the wheels around so
they<00:01:31.140> run<00:01:31.320> we've<00:01:31.560> started<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> very<00:01:32.280> high

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
they run we've started with a very high

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.399 
they run we've started with a very high
crowd<00:01:32.820> wheel<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:36.360> smooths<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.020> Mallik

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
crowd wheel it smooths out the Mallik

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.899 
crowd wheel it smooths out the Mallik
mats<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.820> also<00:01:39.240> raise<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.810> ship<00:01:40.579> lifted<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
mats and also raise the ship lifted the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:02:45.750 
mats and also raise the ship lifted the
ship<00:01:42.200> medium<00:01:43.200> traveler<00:01:43.799> back<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.520> again

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.400 

so<00:02:46.760> far<00:02:47.030> we<00:02:47.120> have<00:02:47.209> not<00:02:47.330> used<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.660> profile<00:02:48.140> gauge

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
so far we have not used to profile gauge

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.380 
so far we have not used to profile gauge
on<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.680> we're<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:49.490> using<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:52.220> look<00:02:52.490> it's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
on it we're just using and the look it's

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.110 
on it we're just using and the look it's
it's<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.410> term<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:54.920> was<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.580> was<00:02:55.730> given<00:02:56.000> to

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
it's a term that was that was given to

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.510 
it's a term that was that was given to
me<00:02:56.440> one<00:02:57.440> time<00:02:57.470> ago<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.890> think<00:02:58.010> when<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.400> was

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
me one time ago I think when I was

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.460 
me one time ago I think when I was
popping<00:02:58.760> 16<00:02:59.209> learning<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.750> trade<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.380> it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
popping 16 learning this trade and it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.960 
popping 16 learning this trade and it
was<00:03:00.620> about<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.860> craftsman<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.430> served<00:03:01.670> my<00:03:01.819> time

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
was about a craftsman I served my time

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.030 
was about a craftsman I served my time
with<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.600> it's<00:03:03.170> called<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.500> rack<00:03:03.739> of<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.890> I

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
with and it's called the rack of the I

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.970 
with and it's called the rack of the I
basically<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.150> look<00:03:05.600> at<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:05.959> look<00:03:06.709> at<00:03:06.890> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
basically just look at it look at the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.620 
basically just look at it look at the
shape<00:03:07.190> on<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.580> bodywork<00:03:07.880> study<00:03:08.450> that

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
shape on the bodywork study that

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.620 
shape on the bodywork study that
momentarily<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:09.739> then<00:03:10.730> look<00:03:10.940> at<00:03:11.030> your<00:03:11.150> panel

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
momentarily and then look at your panel

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.350 
momentarily and then look at your panel
and<00:03:11.890> compare<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.040> two<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.880> comes<00:03:14.180> with

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
and compare the two that comes with

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.910 
and compare the two that comes with
practice<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.959> can<00:03:15.019> look<00:03:15.290> from<00:03:15.440> one<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.890> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
practice you can look from one to the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.150 
practice you can look from one to the
other<00:03:16.040> nothing<00:03:17.050> too<00:03:18.050> low<00:03:18.290> there<00:03:18.530> too<00:03:18.920> much

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
other nothing too low there too much

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.130 
other nothing too low there too much
there<00:03:19.489> needs<00:03:20.000> more<00:03:20.239> shrinkage<00:03:20.630> it's<00:03:20.810> just<00:03:21.050> a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
there needs more shrinkage it's just a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.030 
there needs more shrinkage it's just a
trend<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:22.400> rack<00:03:22.610> of<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.880> eye<00:03:24.040> many

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
trend I the rack of the eye many

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.670 
trend I the rack of the eye many
craftsmen<00:03:25.550> have<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.880> ability<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.360> do<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.780> in

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
craftsmen have the ability to do that in

roofers<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.850> not<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.480> craftsmanship

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
roofers this is not just craftsmanship

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.520 
roofers this is not just craftsmanship
there's<00:03:37.040> also<00:03:37.250> an<00:03:37.489> artistic<00:03:37.850> flair<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:39.350> this

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
there's also an artistic flair to this

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.770 
there's also an artistic flair to this
and<00:03:39.800> it's<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.069> ability<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.730> recognize<00:03:41.450> good

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
and it's the ability to recognize good

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.160 
and it's the ability to recognize good
shape<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.530> imitate<00:03:43.069> it<00:03:43.340> or<00:03:44.120> even<00:03:44.510> create<00:03:44.870> your

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
shape and imitate it or even create your

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:53.289 
shape and imitate it or even create your
own<00:03:45.590> ship<00:03:50.049> yes<00:03:51.049> I<00:03:51.320> can<00:03:51.680> see<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.160> feel<00:03:52.549> a<00:03:52.940> hollow

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
own ship yes I can see and feel a hollow

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.030 
own ship yes I can see and feel a hollow
in<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.480> middle<00:03:53.570> that<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.170> another<00:03:54.500> another

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
in the middle that is another another

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.979 
in the middle that is another another
technique<00:03:55.489> we<00:03:56.030> are<00:03:56.060> often<00:03:56.420> tricked<00:03:56.780> by

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
technique we are often tricked by

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.900 
technique we are often tricked by
looking<00:03:57.350> at<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.799> may<00:03:57.950> appear<00:03:58.280> correct

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
looking at it it may appear correct

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.940 
looking at it it may appear correct
so<00:03:59.329> even<00:03:59.540> feeling<00:03:59.780> it<00:04:00.049> we<00:04:00.170> think<00:04:00.440> it's<00:04:00.650> correct

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
so even feeling it we think it's correct

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.490 
so even feeling it we think it's correct
one<00:04:01.579> one<00:04:02.239> technique<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.750> check<00:04:02.959> it<00:04:03.140> is<00:04:03.440> to

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
one one technique to check it is to

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.110 
one one technique to check it is to
actually<00:04:03.890> mom<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.250> tell<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.549> close<00:04:04.790> your<00:04:04.940> eyes

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
actually mom and tell it close your eyes

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.800 
actually mom and tell it close your eyes
or<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.540> look<00:04:05.720> away<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.350> rely<00:04:06.769> on<00:04:07.329> the<00:04:08.329> feeling

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
or to look away just rely on the feeling

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.310 
or to look away just rely on the feeling
of<00:04:08.870> your<00:04:08.989> hand

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
of your hand

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.349 
of your hand
I<00:04:09.410> now<00:04:09.739> know<00:04:10.010> that<00:04:10.340> it's<00:04:10.850> hollow<00:04:11.060> in<00:04:11.239> the

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
I now know that it's hollow in the

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.310 
I now know that it's hollow in the
middle<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:12.109> now<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.320> look<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.799> can<00:04:12.950> see<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:14.320> so

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
middle and now I look I can see that so

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.930 
middle and now I look I can see that so
what<00:04:15.440> I'm<00:04:15.530> going<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:15.829> do<00:04:16.039> is<00:04:16.370> increase<00:04:16.789> the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
what I'm going to do is increase the

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.599 
what I'm going to do is increase the
pressure<00:04:17.390> and<00:04:17.780> work<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:18.739> air<00:04:18.950> and<00:04:19.130> pull<00:04:19.400> down

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
pressure and work that air and pull down

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:51.480 
pressure and work that air and pull down
to<00:04:20.600> lift<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.260> raise

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:06.970 

it's<00:04:52.490> still<00:04:52.880> very<00:04:53.060> needs<00:04:53.420> some<00:04:53.660> more<00:05:05.980> it's

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
it's still very needs some more it's

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.510 
it's still very needs some more it's
coming<00:05:07.250> out<00:05:07.370> now<00:05:07.550> we're<00:05:07.700> giving<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.030> ship<00:05:12.520> ok

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
coming out now we're giving the ship ok

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.700 
coming out now we're giving the ship ok
well<00:05:13.700> we're<00:05:13.850> very<00:05:13.880> quick<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.419> compare<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.140> on

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
well we're very quick to compare that on

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.490 
well we're very quick to compare that on
to<00:05:15.980> the<00:05:16.130> car<00:05:16.370> again<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.300> see<00:05:17.510> whether<00:05:17.720> we're

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
to the car again to see whether we're

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:28.589 
to the car again to see whether we're
getting<00:05:18.770> somewhere<00:05:19.010> close

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.789 

the<00:05:29.599> difficulty<00:05:30.259> with<00:05:30.409> this<00:05:30.469> particular

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:30.799 
the difficulty with this particular

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:33.009 
the difficulty with this particular
vehicle<00:05:31.459> is<00:05:31.939> obviously<00:05:32.329> the<00:05:32.449> bottom<00:05:32.599> of<00:05:32.839> Pama

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:33.019 
vehicle is obviously the bottom of Pama

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:35.739 
vehicle is obviously the bottom of Pama
work<00:05:33.259> has<00:05:33.469> disappeared<00:05:34.039> so<00:05:34.819> at<00:05:35.119> the<00:05:35.239> moment<00:05:35.419> we

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:35.749 
work has disappeared so at the moment we

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:38.499 
work has disappeared so at the moment we
have<00:05:35.899> nothing<00:05:36.169> to<00:05:36.529> work<00:05:36.829> to<00:05:37.099> and<00:05:37.879> so<00:05:38.149> I<00:05:38.389> have

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
have nothing to work to and so I have

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.259 
have nothing to work to and so I have
various<00:05:38.989> photographs<00:05:39.289> and<00:05:39.939> I<00:05:40.939> will<00:05:41.059> have<00:05:41.149> to

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:41.269 
various photographs and I will have to

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:43.839 
various photographs and I will have to
consult<00:05:41.629> those<00:05:41.929> to<00:05:42.199> determine<00:05:42.489> exactly<00:05:43.489> the

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
consult those to determine exactly the

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:51.639 
consult those to determine exactly the
shape<00:05:44.059> of<00:05:44.269> the<00:05:44.419> bottom<00:05:44.689> of<00:05:44.809> this<00:05:44.929> panel<00:05:50.649> that

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:51.649 
shape of the bottom of this panel that

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:59.499 
shape of the bottom of this panel that
looks<00:05:51.769> quite<00:05:52.069> good<00:05:53.259> okay<00:05:57.579> so<00:05:58.579> basically<00:05:58.759> it

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
looks quite good okay so basically it

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:00.969 
looks quite good okay so basically it
just<00:05:59.809> wants<00:06:00.079> smoothing<00:06:00.469> now<00:06:00.589> we'll<00:06:00.799> head

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
just wants smoothing now we'll head

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.559 
just wants smoothing now we'll head
towards<00:06:01.099> the<00:06:01.429> smoothing<00:06:01.819> up<00:06:01.939> stage<00:06:02.209> with<00:06:02.419> this

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
towards the smoothing up stage with this

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.899 
towards the smoothing up stage with this
panel
