00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.980 
side a crimp and then we'll bring that
down<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.290> little<00:03:14.320> bit<00:03:17.460> prove<00:03:18.460> that<00:03:18.730> there<00:03:19.510> and

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
down a little bit prove that there and

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.170 
down a little bit prove that there and
then<00:03:20.680> we're<00:03:20.830> going<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.070> repeat<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:21.670> same<00:03:21.910> for

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
then we're going to repeat the same for

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.610 
then we're going to repeat the same for
the<00:03:22.300> other<00:03:22.480> ear<00:03:22.780> but<00:03:22.960> we're<00:03:23.140> going<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.320> crimp

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the other ear but we're going to crimp

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.699 
the other ear but we're going to crimp
it<00:03:23.770> down<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.070> little<00:03:24.370> bit<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.500> it's

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
it down a little bit and so that it's

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.770 
it down a little bit and so that it's
going<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.980> sit<00:03:27.250> at<00:03:27.490> an<00:03:27.670> angle<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.630> other

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
going to sit at an angle to the other

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.170 
going to sit at an angle to the other
one<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.650> I'll<00:03:32.920> just<00:03:32.950> continue<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.760> creep<00:03:34.000> on

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
one so I'll just continue to creep on

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.960 
one so I'll just continue to creep on
these<00:03:34.450> hematite<00:03:35.110> rounds<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.730> have

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
these hematite rounds and I have

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.300 
these hematite rounds and I have
repeated<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.780> same<00:03:37.990> technique<00:03:38.740> I've<00:03:38.950> used

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
repeated the same technique I've used

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.760 
repeated the same technique I've used
for<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.820> first<00:03:40.060> drop<00:03:40.420> with<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.350> second

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
for the first drop with the second

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.130 
for the first drop with the second
earring<00:03:42.040> wire<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:43.270> just<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.630> finish<00:03:43.810> off

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
earring wire and I just to finish off

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.570 
earring wire and I just to finish off
these<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.709> just<00:03:45.070> need<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.430> cut<00:03:45.670> these<00:03:45.970> at<00:03:46.690> about

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
these I just need to cut these at about

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.190 
these I just need to cut these at about
three<00:03:48.580> or<00:03:48.610> four<00:03:48.730> millimeters<00:03:49.510> Oh<00:03:49.780> probably

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
three or four millimeters Oh probably

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.460 
three or four millimeters Oh probably
two<00:03:50.530> millimeters<00:03:51.070> actually<00:03:52.020> from<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.200> bottom

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
two millimeters actually from the bottom

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.270 
two millimeters actually from the bottom
of<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.709> crimp<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:55.380> do<00:03:56.380> this<00:03:56.560> Saints<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:57.220> the
