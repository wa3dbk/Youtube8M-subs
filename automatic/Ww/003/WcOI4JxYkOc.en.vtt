00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it was quite awkward in some cases and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.690

grams so that should give you an
indication<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.689> how<00:01:43.170> sort<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.500> lightweight

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
indication of how sort of lightweight

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.330 
indication of how sort of lightweight
this<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.820> general<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.540> build<00:01:46.380> quality<00:01:46.650> I'm

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
this is in general the build quality I'm

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.310 
this is in general the build quality I'm
fairly<00:01:48.060> certain<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.049> pretty

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
fairly certain it's going to be pretty

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.160 
fairly certain it's going to be pretty
much<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.400> previous<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.150> was<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
much just what my previous one was and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.539 
much just what my previous one was and
the<00:01:52.290> thinking<00:01:52.680> fact<00:01:52.950> that's<00:01:53.189> half<00:01:53.369> this

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the thinking fact that's half this

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.190 
the thinking fact that's half this
properly<00:01:54.030> spread<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> floor<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.110> get

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
properly spread out on the floor to get

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.340 
properly spread out on the floor to get
a<00:01:55.259> better<00:01:55.439> right<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
a better right here of it and as you can

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.649 
a better right here of it and as you can
see<00:01:58.409> I'm<00:01:59.009> sure<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.790> exactly<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
see I'm sure this is exactly what you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.230 
see I'm sure this is exactly what you
expected<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.729> simple

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
expected it to be as in it's a simple

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.960 
expected it to be as in it's a simple
zip<00:02:03.869> down<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.170> side<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.530> bottom<00:02:04.970> rectangular

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.279 
sleeping bag if we care up a little bit
closer

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
closer

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.580 
closer
have<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.590> closer<00:02:10.310> look<00:02:10.579> at<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.480> general<00:02:12.049> makeup

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
have a closer look at the general makeup

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.740 
have a closer look at the general makeup
of<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.609> you<00:02:13.700> can<00:02:13.819> see<00:02:14.090> obviously<00:02:14.540> it's

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
of it so you can see obviously it's

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.140 
of it so you can see obviously it's
black<00:02:15.349> or<00:02:15.620> very<00:02:15.680> dark<00:02:16.069> grey<00:02:16.519> on<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.730> outside

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
black or very dark grey on the outside

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.330 
black or very dark grey on the outside
it's<00:02:17.659> got<00:02:17.780> green<00:02:18.079> on<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.409> inside<00:02:18.769> on<00:02:18.950> this<00:02:19.099> one

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
it's got green on the inside on this one

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.729 
it's got green on the inside on this one
and<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:19.849> very<00:02:20.299> lightweight<00:02:20.629> I<00:02:21.140> can<00:02:21.439> say

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
and it is very lightweight I can say

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.140 
and it is very lightweight I can say
this<00:02:21.890> whole<00:02:22.099> thing<00:02:22.159> wraps<00:02:22.609> up<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.060> you've

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
this whole thing wraps up and you've

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.990 
this whole thing wraps up and you've
seen<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.599> size<00:02:23.840> little<00:02:24.230> wrapper<00:02:24.980> for<00:02:25.430> storage

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
seen the size little wrapper for storage

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.460 
seen the size little wrapper for storage
you<00:02:26.209> could<00:02:26.329> probably<00:02:26.540> move<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.200> few

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
you could probably move a few

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.559 
you could probably move a few
compression<00:02:28.069> straps<00:02:28.370> get<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.819> bag<00:02:29.030> even<00:02:29.359> a

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
compression straps get that bag even a

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.589 
compression straps get that bag even a
little<00:02:29.780> bit<00:02:30.049> smaller<00:02:30.560> than<00:02:30.769> it<00:02:31.069> is<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.459> as<00:02:32.239> it

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
little bit smaller than it is and as it

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.690 
little bit smaller than it is and as it
is<00:02:32.750> only<00:02:32.989> 700<00:02:33.470> grams<00:02:33.950> for<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.310> whole<00:02:34.489> thing

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
is only 700 grams for the whole thing

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.940 
is only 700 grams for the whole thing
you<00:02:35.269> can<00:02:35.299> tell<00:02:35.689> we're<00:02:35.930> obviously<00:02:36.349> does<00:02:36.709> make

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
you can tell we're obviously does make

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.160 
you can tell we're obviously does make
it<00:02:37.129> a<00:02:37.220> very<00:02:37.430> lightweight<00:02:37.760> sleeping<00:02:38.269> bag<00:02:38.629> but

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
it a very lightweight sleeping bag but

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.229 
it a very lightweight sleeping bag but
the<00:02:39.409> most<00:02:39.739> important<00:02:40.280> thing<00:02:40.519> if<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.819> ask<00:02:40.849> me

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
the most important thing if you ask me

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.170 
the most important thing if you ask me
is<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.650> can<00:02:42.859> basically<00:02:43.010> get<00:02:43.639> an<00:02:43.760> attempt

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
is that you can basically get an attempt

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.420 
is that you can basically get an attempt
at<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.359> end<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.689> the<00:02:44.780> night<00:02:44.959> maybe<00:02:45.709> if<00:02:46.220> you

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
at the end of the night maybe if you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.250 
at the end of the night maybe if you
wonder<00:02:46.849> if<00:02:47.269> you're<00:02:47.419> in<00:02:47.569> extremely<00:02:47.989> cold

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
wonder if you're in extremely cold

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.780 
wonder if you're in extremely cold
conditions<00:02:48.409> and<00:02:49.040> obviously<00:02:49.370> you're<00:02:49.519> going<00:02:49.700> to

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
conditions and obviously you're going to

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.849 
conditions and obviously you're going to
need<00:02:49.939> something<00:02:50.239> thicker<00:02:51.079> than<00:02:51.409> this<00:02:51.590> or

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
need something thicker than this or

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.449 
need something thicker than this or
maybe<00:02:52.310> keep<00:02:52.700> your<00:02:52.760> jumper<00:02:53.299> on<00:02:53.329> hey<00:02:53.959> but<00:02:54.769> as<00:02:55.010> you

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
maybe keep your jumper on hey but as you

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.789 
maybe keep your jumper on hey but as you
would<00:02:55.579> expect<00:02:55.730> basically<00:02:56.659> as<00:02:56.989> long<00:02:57.260> as<00:02:57.620> you

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
would expect basically as long as you

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.099 
would expect basically as long as you
can<00:02:57.980> hop<00:02:58.159> in<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.549> wrap<00:02:59.150> yourself<00:02:59.540> up<00:02:59.750> at<00:02:59.989> the

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
can hop in this wrap yourself up at the

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.470 
can hop in this wrap yourself up at the
end<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.409> a<00:03:00.530> walk<00:03:00.859> or<00:03:01.250> whatever<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:02.120> happen<00:03:02.269> to

be doing and zip up the side and it's

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.149 
be doing and zip up the side and it's
all<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:05.329> nice<00:03:05.689> simple<00:03:06.230> in<00:03:06.379> fact<00:03:06.590> if<00:03:06.829> I<00:03:06.950> just

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
all like nice simple in fact if I just

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.030 
all like nice simple in fact if I just
put<00:03:07.669> some<00:03:07.819> weight<00:03:08.000> here<00:03:08.269> say<00:03:09.200> zips<00:03:09.560> nice<00:03:09.799> and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
put some weight here say zips nice and

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.069 
put some weight here say zips nice and
smooth<00:03:10.310> it's<00:03:10.879> basically<00:03:11.359> everything<00:03:11.959> that

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
smooth it's basically everything that

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.509 
smooth it's basically everything that
you<00:03:12.290> would<00:03:12.439> want<00:03:12.650> from<00:03:12.859> a<00:03:12.980> nice<00:03:13.220> cheap

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
you would want from a nice cheap

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.869 
you would want from a nice cheap
sleeping<00:03:14.000> bag<00:03:14.180> once<00:03:14.840> again<00:03:15.019> 7<00:03:15.979> pound<00:03:16.190> 50<00:03:16.609> I

sleeping bag once again 7 pound 50 I

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.129 
sleeping bag once again 7 pound 50 I
don't<00:03:17.150> think<00:03:17.359> there's<00:03:17.510> much<00:03:17.659> more<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.019> can

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
don't think there's much more you can

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.409 
don't think there's much more you can
ask<00:03:18.349> of<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.769> starving<00:03:19.669> this<00:03:19.849> up<00:03:20.060> both

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
ask of it I starving this up both

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.449 
ask of it I starving this up both
literally<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.319> sleeping<00:03:21.739> bag<00:03:21.919> and<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:22.370> this

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
literally the sleeping bag and in this

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.550 
literally the sleeping bag and in this
video<00:03:22.909> i'll<00:03:23.359> say<00:03:23.629> the<00:03:23.870> measurements<00:03:24.409> when

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
video i'll say the measurements when

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.339 
video i'll say the measurements when
it's<00:03:24.709> open<00:03:25.129> are<00:03:25.400> 75<00:03:26.329> by<00:03:26.629> a<00:03:26.659> hundred<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:27.169> eighty

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
it's open are 75 by a hundred and eighty

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.180 
it's open are 75 by a hundred and eighty
centimeters<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:29.209> material<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.919> think

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
centimeters and the material is I think

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.240
