continuing<00:00:00.599> our<00:00:00.690> discussion<00:00:00.750> on<00:00:01.290> winemaking

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
continuing our discussion on winemaking

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.820 
continuing our discussion on winemaking
we've<00:00:02.760> established<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.230> set<00:00:04.650> up<00:00:04.680> your

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
we've established how to set up your

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.789 
we've established how to set up your
primary<00:00:05.490> fermentation<00:00:06.200> today<00:00:07.200> we've<00:00:07.500> taken

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
primary fermentation today we've taken

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.839 
primary fermentation today we've taken
from<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.849> finished<00:00:09.380> primary<00:00:10.380> fermentation

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
from a finished primary fermentation

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.060 
from a finished primary fermentation
over<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.000> secondary<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.320> process<00:00:13.590> we

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
over to secondary and in that process we

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.750 
over to secondary and in that process we
have<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.610> dig<00:00:14.910> ass<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.570> wine<00:00:15.949> what<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.340> is

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
have to dig ass the wine what that is is

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.120 
have to dig ass the wine what that is is
of<00:00:17.970> course<00:00:18.240> getting<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> co2<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.680> of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
of course getting the co2 out of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.359 
of course getting the co2 out of
solution<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:21.960> wine<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.800> improve<00:00:23.160> its

solution of of your wine to improve its
flavor<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.000> its<00:00:24.539> longevity<00:00:24.810> when<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.920> rack

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
flavor and its longevity when you rack

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.650

what you're doing in this point is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.940 
what you're doing in this point is
getting<00:01:29.759> rid<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.150> co2<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.380> still<00:01:31.650> trapped

getting rid of co2 that is still trapped

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280 
getting rid of co2 that is still trapped
in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.250> liquid<00:01:32.640> because<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.750> will<00:01:33.900> affect

in the liquid because that will affect

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.319 
in the liquid because that will affect
the<00:01:34.530> flavor<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> longevity<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.850> your

I'm<00:01:39.810> still<00:01:40.140> thinking<00:01:40.320> beer<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.759> all<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
I'm still thinking beer you see all that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.719 
I'm still thinking beer you see all that

hour<00:02:05.549> there's<00:02:06.450> more<00:02:06.750> surface<00:02:07.320> area<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.979> so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
hour there's more surface area here so

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.180 
hour there's more surface area here so
more<00:02:08.580> gases<00:02:09.239> coming<00:02:09.509> out

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
more gases coming out

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.220 
more gases coming out
once<00:02:10.490> than<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.210> does<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.630> that<00:02:11.780> tiny<00:02:12.080> little

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
once than it does to that tiny little

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.580 
once than it does to that tiny little
hole<00:02:12.710> over<00:02:13.220> there<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.960> can<00:02:15.140> actually<00:02:15.320> smell

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
hole over there you can actually smell

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.420 
hole over there you can actually smell
the<00:02:16.190> carbonic<00:02:16.730> acid<00:02:17.210> coming<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.280> air

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
the carbonic acid coming out in the air

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.990 
the carbonic acid coming out in the air
so<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.820> gets<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.270> very<00:02:20.540> tart<00:02:20.900> tangy<00:02:21.320> smell

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
so it gets this very tart tangy smell

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.270 
so it gets this very tart tangy smell
you<00:02:23.000> don't<00:02:23.240> need<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.780> your<00:02:23.930> wine<00:02:24.280> you

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you don't need that in your wine you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.060 
you don't need that in your wine you
want<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.550> make<00:02:25.790> sure<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.080> bubbling

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
want to make sure that that bubbling

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.580 
want to make sure that that bubbling
takes<00:02:28.400> place<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.390> bucket<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.900> not<00:02:30.380> all

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
takes place in the bucket and not all

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.370 
takes place in the bucket and not all
over<00:02:30.650> your<00:02:31.070> floor<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.700> don't<00:02:31.940> get

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
over your floor so don't get

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.270 
over your floor so don't get
enthusiastic<00:02:33.380> with<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.650> wine<00:02:33.800> one<00:02:34.040> don't

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
enthusiastic with the wine one don't

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.880 
enthusiastic with the wine one don't
crank<00:02:34.670> open<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.090> drill<00:02:35.410> because<00:02:36.410> even<00:02:36.770> in

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
crank open the drill because even in

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.710 
crank open the drill because even in
that<00:02:37.010> larger<00:02:37.580> bucket<00:02:38.000> where<00:02:38.180> we're<00:02:38.360> trying<00:02:38.510> to

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
that larger bucket where we're trying to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.900 
that larger bucket where we're trying to
get<00:02:38.810> as<00:02:38.960> much<00:02:39.170> surface<00:02:39.500> area<00:02:39.800> as<00:02:39.980> possible<00:02:40.280> if

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
get as much surface area as possible if

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.520 
get as much surface area as possible if
you<00:02:40.970> get<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.180> little<00:02:41.330> too<00:02:41.600> enthusiastic<00:02:42.410> with

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
you get a little too enthusiastic with

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.890 
you get a little too enthusiastic with
the<00:02:42.650> wine<00:02:42.860> whip<00:02:43.130> well<00:02:43.850> you're<00:02:44.540> going<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.720> get

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the wine whip well you're going to get

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.660 
the wine whip well you're going to get
it<00:02:45.020> all<00:02:45.140> over<00:02:45.170> your<00:02:45.440> floor<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:46.040> that's<00:02:46.190> not

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
it all over your floor and that's not

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.740 
it all over your floor and that's not
good<00:02:46.910> that's<00:02:47.120> wasteful

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
good that's wasteful

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.930 
good that's wasteful
so<00:02:47.960> make<00:02:48.320> sure<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:49.010> see<00:02:49.190> larger<00:02:49.610> bubbles

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
so make sure that you see larger bubbles

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.970 
so make sure that you see larger bubbles
first<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.570> then<00:02:50.810> smaller<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.500> smaller<00:02:51.770> and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
first and then smaller and smaller and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.880 
first and then smaller and smaller and
finer<00:02:52.220> bubbles<00:02:53.230> generally<00:02:54.230> with<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> drill

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
finer bubbles generally with a drill

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.340 
finer bubbles generally with a drill
with<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> wine<00:02:55.820> whip<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.270> takes<00:02:56.540> about<00:02:56.720> twenty

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
with a wine whip it takes about twenty

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.410 
with a wine whip it takes about twenty
or<00:02:57.380> thirty<00:02:57.920> minutes<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.340> accomplish<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:59.180> if

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
or thirty minutes to accomplish this if

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.810 
or thirty minutes to accomplish this if
you<00:03:00.110> are<00:03:00.260> trying<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.590> stir<00:03:00.830> by<00:03:01.010> hand<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.610> is

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
you are trying to stir by hand it is
