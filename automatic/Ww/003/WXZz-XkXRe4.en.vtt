Chemical and I'm here today to talk to
you<00:00:05.879> about<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.480> two-step<00:00:07.160> washing<00:00:08.160> system

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
you about the two-step washing system

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.700 
you about the two-step washing system
the<00:00:08.730> two-step<00:00:09.269> system<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:10.080> probably<00:00:10.440> heard

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
the two-step system you probably heard

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.430 
the two-step system you probably heard
about<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:11.040> maybe<00:00:11.610> use<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.210> you've<00:00:12.990> been<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
about it maybe use it you've been in the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.230 
about it maybe use it you've been in the
fleet<00:00:13.769> washing<00:00:14.160> business<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.670> any<00:00:14.820> length<00:00:15.059> of

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
fleet washing business for any length of

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.939 
fleet washing business for any length of
time<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.690> probably<00:00:15.990> know<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> lot<00:00:16.440> about<00:00:16.740> it

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
time you probably know a lot about it

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.070 
time you probably know a lot about it
let<00:00:17.490> me<00:00:17.520> tell<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.060> most<00:00:18.240> important<00:00:18.840> thing

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
let me tell you the most important thing

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.380 
let me tell you the most important thing
that<00:00:19.109> goes<00:00:19.740> through<00:00:20.039> my<00:00:20.070> mind<00:00:20.310> when<00:00:20.880> somebody

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
that goes through my mind when somebody

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.390 
that goes through my mind when somebody
asks<00:00:21.750> me<00:00:21.779> about<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.170> two-step<00:00:22.830> cleaning

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
asks me about the two-step cleaning

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.060 
asks me about the two-step cleaning
system<00:00:23.840> what's<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.019> two-step<00:00:25.470> system<00:00:25.710> how

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
system what's the two-step system how

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.890 
system what's the two-step system how
does<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.460> work<00:00:26.640> how<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.180> get<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.779> work

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
does it work how can I get it to work

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.689 
does it work how can I get it to work
for<00:00:27.960> me<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> heard<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.010> magic<00:00:29.519> bullet

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
for me I heard it's the magic bullet

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.690 
for me I heard it's the magic bullet
well<00:00:30.420> what<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.779> says<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.260> me<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.340> need

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
well what that says to me is if you need

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.510 
well what that says to me is if you need
a<00:00:32.730> two-step<00:00:33.660> system<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.829> product<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.370> got

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
a two-step system the product you got

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
a two-step system the product you got
isn't<00:00:35.790> working<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.960> you're<00:00:37.170> doing<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.680> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
isn't working what you're doing now is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.240 
isn't working what you're doing now is
not<00:00:38.040> working<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.820> two-step<00:00:39.690> system<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.890> good

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
not working a two-step system is a good

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920 
not working a two-step system is a good
way<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> wash<00:00:41.910> trucks<00:00:42.329> there's<00:00:42.629> good

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
way to wash trucks there's good

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.869 
way to wash trucks there's good
chemistry<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.860> there's<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> good<00:00:44.340> chemical

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
chemistry in it there's a good chemical

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.310 
chemistry in it there's a good chemical
reaction<00:00:45.480> there<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:45.989> call<00:00:46.200> an

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
reaction there what we call an

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.069 
reaction there what we call an
exothermic<00:00:46.739> chemical<00:00:47.340> reaction<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
exothermic chemical reaction when the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
exothermic chemical reaction when the
alkali<00:00:49.590> meets<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.370> acid<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.340> means

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
alkali meets the acid and and that means

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.490 
alkali meets the acid and and that means
it<00:00:53.670> gives<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:54.000> heat<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.570> chemical<00:00:55.050> reaction

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it gives off heat the chemical reaction

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.760 
it gives off heat the chemical reaction
gives<00:00:55.680> off<00:00:55.920> heat<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.660> should<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.199> rare

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
gives off heat but it should be a rare

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.540 
gives off heat but it should be a rare
rare<00:00:59.460> occasion<00:01:00.329> when<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.170> need<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
rare occasion when you need that to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.450 
rare occasion when you need that to
clean<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.210> vehicle<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> fleet<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:05.220> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
clean a vehicle or a fleet what that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.520 
clean a vehicle or a fleet what that
means<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> chemical<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.990> you've<00:01:07.200> got

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
means is the chemical that you've got

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
means is the chemical that you've got
didn't<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> job<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.060> wouldn't<00:01:09.390> need

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
didn't do the job or you wouldn't need

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.570 
didn't do the job or you wouldn't need
the<00:01:09.630> two-step<00:01:10.049> system<00:01:10.290> doesn't<00:01:11.159> mean<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the two-step system doesn't mean you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
the two-step system doesn't mean you
never<00:01:11.820> need<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.450> means<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.840> should<00:01:12.869> rarely

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
never need it it means you should rarely

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.820 
never need it it means you should rarely
need<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.450> chemicals<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.619> are

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
need it if you have chemicals that are

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
need it if you have chemicals that are
doing<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.490> they're<00:01:17.670> supposed<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
doing what they're supposed to do in the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
doing what they're supposed to do in the
first<00:01:19.380> place<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.159> problem<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
first place the problem is a lot of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.330 
first place the problem is a lot of
people<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.170> lot<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> people<00:01:22.920> have

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
people don't a lot of people have

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
people don't a lot of people have
products<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.299> formulated<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
products that are just formulated and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.940 
products that are just formulated and
what<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.820> me<00:01:27.000> are<00:01:27.299> strange<00:01:28.229> ways<00:01:28.590> with

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
what what to me are strange ways with

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.460 
what what to me are strange ways with
just<00:01:29.220> obvious<00:01:29.729> failures<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.540> formulation<00:01:31.290> an

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
just obvious failures and formulation an

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.649 
just obvious failures and formulation an
obvious<00:01:32.250> lack<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.729> understanding<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.540> the

obvious lack of understanding of the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
obvious lack of understanding of the
chemistry<00:01:34.140> that's<00:01:34.350> involved<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
chemistry that's involved and when you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
chemistry that's involved and when you
combine<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.450> 10<00:01:36.630> years<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.079> experience<00:01:37.170> that

combine the 10 years of experience that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.230 
combine the 10 years of experience that
we<00:01:37.950> had<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> truck<00:01:38.670> washing<00:01:39.119> business

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
we had in the truck washing business

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.420 
we had in the truck washing business
with<00:01:40.140> our<00:01:40.320> knowledge<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.920> chemical

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
with our knowledge of chemical

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.850 
with our knowledge of chemical
formulation<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.530> come<00:01:43.829> up

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
formulation that's when you can come up

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.710 
formulation that's when you can come up
with<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.490> kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.939> products<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.689> have

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
with the kind of products that we have

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.510 
with the kind of products that we have
because<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.380> know<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.920> they're<00:01:47.070> supposed<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
because we know what they're supposed to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.060 
because we know what they're supposed to

making bullets who've never fired a gun

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.120 
making bullets who've never fired a gun
well<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:55.649> make<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> good

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
well you know can they make a good

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.399 
well you know can they make a good
bullet<00:01:56.369> yeah<00:01:56.790> hit<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.420> miss<00:01:57.479> hit<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.259> miss

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
bullet yeah hit and miss hit and miss

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.709 
bullet yeah hit and miss hit and miss
and<00:01:58.729> unfortunately<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.909> may<00:02:00.090> may<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.570> been

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
and unfortunately you may may have been

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.499 
and unfortunately you may may have been
the<00:02:00.810> victim<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> some<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.560> those<00:02:01.649> misses<00:02:02.509> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the victim of some of those misses the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.389 
the victim of some of those misses the
advantages<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> two-step<00:02:04.770> system<00:02:05.009> are

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
advantages of the two-step system are

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.789 
advantages of the two-step system are
that<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.729> powerful<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.750> chemical<00:02:07.200> reaction

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that it's powerful the chemical reaction

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.190 
that it's powerful the chemical reaction
the<00:02:07.950> acid<00:02:08.369> would<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.640> alkali<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.629> powerful

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the acid would the alkali is a powerful

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.040 
the acid would the alkali is a powerful
reaction<00:02:10.500> that

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
reaction that

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.470 
reaction that
there's<00:02:11.320> more<00:02:11.680> energy<00:02:12.190> than<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.000> sum<00:02:13.240> total

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
there's more energy than the sum total

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.520 
there's more energy than the sum total
of<00:02:13.780> either<00:02:13.990> product<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:14.710> that's<00:02:14.950> good

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
of either product so that's good

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.160 
of either product so that's good
the<00:02:18.000> disadvantages<00:02:19.000> are<00:02:19.210> that<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.600> costs<00:02:19.990> more

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the disadvantages are that it costs more

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.930 
the disadvantages are that it costs more
because<00:02:20.410> you're<00:02:20.650> using<00:02:20.830> two<00:02:21.190> products<00:02:21.700> when

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
because you're using two products when

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.150 
because you're using two products when
one<00:02:22.240> product<00:02:22.750> should<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.350> done<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.650> job<00:02:23.860> and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
one product should have done the job and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.090 
one product should have done the job and
it<00:02:24.970> takes<00:02:25.000> more<00:02:25.630> time<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.620> takes<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.890> lot<00:02:27.070> more

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
it takes more time it takes a lot more

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.700 
it takes more time it takes a lot more
time<00:02:27.490> it<00:02:27.700> takes<00:02:27.850> twice<00:02:28.060> as<00:02:28.120> much<00:02:28.270> time<00:02:28.480> well<00:02:29.350> it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
time it takes twice as much time well it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.290 
time it takes twice as much time well it
takes<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.160> lot<00:02:30.370> more<00:02:30.400> time<00:02:30.790> because<00:02:31.120> you're

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
takes a lot more time because you're

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.360 
takes a lot more time because you're
applying<00:02:31.600> two<00:02:31.960> products<00:02:32.470> instead<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.860> one<00:02:33.130> and

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
applying two products instead of one and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.140 
applying two products instead of one and
then<00:02:33.460> you're<00:02:33.640> rinsing

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
then you're rinsing

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.660 
then you're rinsing
so<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.930> takes<00:02:35.110> considerably<00:02:35.770> more<00:02:36.010> time<00:02:36.340> and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
so it takes considerably more time and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.510 
so it takes considerably more time and
also<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.720> takes<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.110> lot<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.440> experience<00:02:39.400> to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
also it takes a lot of experience to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.960 
also it takes a lot of experience to
know<00:02:39.850> when<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.960> two-step<00:02:41.500> system<00:02:42.040> needs<00:02:42.850> to

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
know when that two-step system needs to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.880 
know when that two-step system needs to
be<00:02:43.060> employed<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.840> can't<00:02:44.080> always<00:02:44.260> tell<00:02:44.590> just

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
be employed you can't always tell just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.220 
be employed you can't always tell just
by<00:02:44.950> looking<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.880> bottom<00:02:46.360> line<00:02:46.600> when<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.050> comes

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
by looking the bottom line when it comes

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.260 
by looking the bottom line when it comes
to<00:02:47.410> two-step<00:02:47.700> chemicals<00:02:48.700> when<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.940> comes<00:02:49.120> to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
to two-step chemicals when it comes to

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.320 
to two-step chemicals when it comes to
the<00:02:49.390> two-step<00:02:49.810> process

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
the two-step process

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.060 
the two-step process
ninety-eight<00:02:52.360> ninety-five<00:02:53.350> percent<00:02:53.710> of<00:02:53.980> the

ninety-eight ninety-five percent of the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.880 
ninety-eight ninety-five percent of the

time I'll be safe ninety-five percent of
the<00:02:56.980> time<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.430> shouldn't<00:02:57.790> need<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.090> if<00:02:58.450> you've

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
the time you shouldn't need it if you've

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.110 
the time you shouldn't need it if you've
got<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> good<00:02:59.290> alkaline<00:03:00.130> truck<00:03:00.400> wash<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.000> a

good aluminum brightener and we make

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.370 
good aluminum brightener and we make
some<00:03:03.160> videos<00:03:03.460> on<00:03:03.700> those<00:03:03.910> then<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.050> shouldn't

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
some videos on those then you shouldn't

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.470 
some videos on those then you shouldn't
need<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.740> when<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.130> do<00:03:06.280> fine<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:07.060> should<00:03:07.300> be

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
need it when you do fine it should be

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.970 
need it when you do fine it should be
there<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.960> we'll<00:03:08.140> talk<00:03:08.320> some<00:03:08.380> more<00:03:08.590> about<00:03:08.920> it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
there and we'll talk some more about it
