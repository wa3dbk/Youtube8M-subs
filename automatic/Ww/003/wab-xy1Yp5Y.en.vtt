00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 hi girls a new mecca preview on 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.460
 a product proposed by oreal which is the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.740
 clinton or the sun then after the moon 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.260
 Czech tram that has a foundation that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.390
 you know i loved it they have 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.359
 proposed the same packaging and the same 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.060
 application methodology for what it is 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.220
 a cross between a foundation 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.890
 tanning bed and an extra liquid earth 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.859
 they have revived the classic lands 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.149
 maxi and the new lands oreal glenn 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.510
 brown 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.020
 finally even those matt and those 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.040
 mat 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.219
 I find it wonderful year round 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.129
 under the mirror the small brush e 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.530
 he then had for one thing at a time 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.510
 we talk about the bronze glam of the sun 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.190
 I was excited about this product 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.530
 I immediately wanted to buy up to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.859
 when I realized that there is a problem either 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.760
 if you play super sheen then took the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.049
 envelope applies as the other foundation 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.710
 then shaking opens the sketch and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.210
 bring a couple of drops of the product 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.210
 on companies then work 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:28.820
 that is unique I tell you the truth is less 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.790
 and less shimmer than it looks 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.150
 in the tester because on the text he observed 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.300
 super brillantino zoe instead on him 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.760
 but being a unique color if not 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.150
 roll out really well does not go 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:49.400
 well unless you are tanned 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.259
 then I tell myself with respect to the chief tester 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.050
 phoned in the store looks like a 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.240
 different product so I wouldn't want that 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.250
 you seem to change my mind from one 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.990
 moment to the other but I started it with 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.540
 an idea while like people 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.090
 intelligent can not change e 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.840
 applying it to the skin is very beautiful 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.100
 a bit like the defant and then if you do it 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.890
 applied as land apply it with ad 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.530
 example a synthetic brush this is 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.420
 Biso in perfect cut you and I'll 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.290
 put a little on the hand it went to 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.519
 sculpting the features is very beautiful 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.760
 used so I had tried it 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.890
 always shop than the store 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.850
 they looked like glitter while this or 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:40.730
 no or not to a lighting effect but 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:45.980
 not glittered so that's that if you have 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.950
 loved then so it is perfect to pass 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.840
 at the same type of product you know 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.330
 which gives it so much it also won the prize 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.820
 help her to work because foundation 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.950
 truly impalpable perfection 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.620
 to the complexion this does the same thing 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.840
 that is, you have no product perception 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.299
 see how the complexion is uniform and 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.090
 the proof you know I'm using 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.130
 the new self-tan of dior vero 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.739
 said of the tutorial if you have seen it e 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.450
 so it's ok for me now 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.519
 on my classic complexion 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.230
 probably would have been a little dark 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.170
 but a product that was born more 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.959
 in the summer it dries up immediately does not go 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.970
 opaque even with powder and I have to 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.560
 say that it has a very very product 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.260
 beautiful 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.450
 the only limit in my opinion is that it is a bit the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.540
 limit also of the other produced that 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.090
 they are 20 ml so however there is little is 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.900
 true that they are not really the two drops 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.760
 but very little is applied 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.739
 back to the earth 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.650
 the new lands made this way 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.900
 in the shimmer version you know you can 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.310
 use as a blush then in i 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.620
 most exposed points of the cheekbone face nasa 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.060
 etc. is not beautiful on the whole face 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.660
 because the face loses 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.330
 three-dimensional and loses its naturalness 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.980
 the earth bakayoko took the color 00 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.510
 probably the cannes blog 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.480
 probably for me now it's a bit 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.459
 clear you see but I want to do it 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.890
 see why it really is a beautiful land 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.070
 I take a bison brush these are 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.829
 always made brushes that I love 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:28.479
 I took the product has a silkiness 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:30.280
 truly incredible when you do law 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.950
 school team is very important to 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.500
 color this little triangle you must 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.289
 seem that the shadow arrives naturally 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.550
 from you and not a line put there and then yes 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.550
 fades upwards 

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:51.139
 then when you want to make corrections of 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.779
 face I recommend never to arrive 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.819
 too down if not with smoke effect 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.409
 the goal must be to create the oval 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.779
 perfect therefore with much objectivity 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.599
 you have to look in the mirror and say 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:04.219
 then what a defect 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.110
 I for example have this double effect 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.909
 because they are so it is 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.830
 I take the brush is simply 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:14.990
 I do if that is the basic rule of the 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.199
 trick is that the clear I bring out 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.899
 the dark picture inside will optically have 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.580
 a falling effect when for example 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:25.610
 of girls who have jaws 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.899
 pronounced let's say I had a little 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.269
 of square 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:32.389
 we take the product we put it 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:34.249
 gently right on the little bone 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.330
 own product is that we fade towards 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:37.459
 up 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.649
 there must be no lines or nothing 

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:42.769
 one should not see but looking at 

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:47.119
 mirror we will see oh hell if but that 

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:50.269
 have your face thinned I want you 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:53.300
 just seeing the silkiness of the 

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:57.050
 product looks almost like a baron powder 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:00.379
 zandt I guarantee you that as dull earth 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.199
 it's really very, very, very good 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:05.149
 value for money is very pretty 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.469
 according to me it is applied and on its bottom 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:08.860
 won more than land to drive it 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.599
 you will therefore call TV fund absolutely 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.050
 very good products are very much 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.719
 happy but I swear that the tester of 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.069
 this one of the shops in the stores where I have it 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.769
 tried and that's not in like of 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.059
 they looked like eni glitter while they are 

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:25.699
 glad there are none 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:30.079
 so if you are very clear expect it 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.639
 get a tan or something that I had 

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:32.719
 I also tried some ros by name 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.999
 buy it 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.879
 if you already have road and many to find out 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:39.800
 But you put a little wait for the summer 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.769
 mix some and a little very nice 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.490
 the effect I hope they were a useful one 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.490
 kiss girls
