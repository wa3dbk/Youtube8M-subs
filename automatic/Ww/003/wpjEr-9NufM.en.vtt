00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
keep this very short but this is what

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660 
keep this very short but this is what
I've<00:00:35.820> come<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.320> far<00:00:37.350> now<00:00:38.309> it's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
I've come up with so far now it's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
I've come up with so far now it's
definitely<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.510> complete<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
definitely not complete I do want to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.779 
definitely not complete I do want to
make<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.760> bit<00:00:42.149> taller<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> idea<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
make it a little bit taller the idea is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.990 
make it a little bit taller the idea is
to<00:00:45.570> keep<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> tower<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.460> actually

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to keep this as a tower and actually

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.560 
to keep this as a tower and actually
build<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.780> base<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:52.070> 132<00:00:53.070> floors<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.940> 32

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
build up a base that's 132 floors at 32

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.760 
build up a base that's 132 floors at 32
by<00:00:54.840> 32<00:00:55.910> on<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> base<00:00:57.239> plate<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.500> gonna

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
by 32 on a base plate and then I'm gonna

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.029 
by 32 on a base plate and then I'm gonna
sit<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.520> on<00:01:00.030> top<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.379> make<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
sit this on top of it to make it a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.750 
sit this on top of it to make it a
little<00:01:02.219> bit<00:01:02.489> taller<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:05.040> main<00:01:05.309> feature

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
little bit taller so the main feature

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.200 
little bit taller so the main feature
that<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.420> wanted<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.040> go<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.850> mock

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that I wanted to go with with this mock

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.920 
that I wanted to go with with this mock
is<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.570> really<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.729> full<00:01:11.729> glass<00:01:12.150> angled

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
is I really like this full glass angled

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.770 
is I really like this full glass angled
panel<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.799> front<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> building<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.390> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
panel on the front of the building so I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.039 
panel on the front of the building so I
had<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> make<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> few<00:01:17.250> sacrifices<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:18.750> achieve

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
had to make a few sacrifices to achieve

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.090 
had to make a few sacrifices to achieve
that<00:01:20.000> one<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> those<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.110> couldn't<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that one of those was I couldn't make it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.999 
that one of those was I couldn't make it
modular<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.960> got<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.470> couple<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
modular but I have got a couple of

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.190 
modular but I have got a couple of
little<00:01:26.159> things<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.640> my<00:01:26.820> sleeve<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.630> they'll

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
little things up my sleeve there they'll

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.060 
little things up my sleeve there they'll
show<00:01:28.530> show<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.250> real<00:01:29.670> quickly<00:01:31.009> definitely<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
show show you real quickly definitely a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.050 
show show you real quickly definitely a
work<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.610> progress<00:01:33.740> not<00:01:34.740> happy<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
work in progress not happy with the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
work in progress not happy with the
front<00:01:36.810> part<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.229> I'll<00:01:37.530> probably<00:01:37.710> shorten

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
front part here I'll probably shorten

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
front part here I'll probably shorten
that<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:39.119> starters<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:39.780> still<00:01:40.049> sort<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
that up for starters I'm still sort of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.700 
that up for starters I'm still sort of
working<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.659> made<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.170> where<00:01:43.409> I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
working on that I have made it where I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.690 
working on that I have made it where I
can<00:01:44.280> slide<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.119> top<00:01:45.840> section<00:01:46.140> there<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
can slide this top section there here so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.550 
can slide this top section there here so
you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.380> basically

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
you can see in there so basically

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.179 
you can see in there so basically
instead<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.880> making<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> modular<00:01:52.020> I'm<00:01:52.649> just

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
instead of making it modular I'm just

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.389 
instead of making it modular I'm just
gonna<00:01:53.430> make<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.880> where<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.509> remove<00:01:55.399> parts

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
gonna make it where you can remove parts

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.109 
gonna make it where you can remove parts
of<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.780> inside<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.850> main

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
of it so you can see inside so the main

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.060 
of it so you can see inside so the main
thing<00:02:00.750> he<00:02:01.020> actually<00:02:01.409> I'll<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.680> give<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
thing he actually I'll just give it a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
thing he actually I'll just give it a
spin<00:02:02.340> around<00:02:02.490> first<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> main<00:02:06.360> thing<00:02:06.659> I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
spin around first so the main thing I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.040 
spin around first so the main thing I
sort<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.229> really<00:02:07.890> wanted<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.550> do<00:02:09.270> here<00:02:09.599> was<00:02:09.629> use

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
sort of really wanted to do here was use

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.140 
sort of really wanted to do here was use
as<00:02:10.259> much<00:02:10.679> trans<00:02:11.459> pee

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
as much trans pee

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.399 
as much trans pee
as<00:02:12.510> possible<00:02:13.409> and<00:02:13.970> eliminate<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.930> use<00:02:16.140> of

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
as possible and eliminate the use of

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.630 
as possible and eliminate the use of
solid<00:02:16.890> bricks<00:02:17.220> where<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:17.879> could<00:02:18.390> say<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.650> mean<00:02:20.400> I

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
solid bricks where I could say I mean I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.940 
solid bricks where I could say I mean I
could<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.299> made<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.720> wider<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.440> filled<00:02:22.709> in

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
little bit tight but once I unclip it so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.699 
little bit tight but once I unclip it so
that<00:03:14.489> whole<00:03:14.790> front<00:03:15.269> wall<00:03:15.659> just<00:03:16.349> comes

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
that whole front wall just comes

that whole front wall just comes
straight<00:03:17.669> out<00:03:18.169> and<00:03:20.000> then<00:03:21.000> you'll<00:03:21.989> actually<00:03:22.200> be

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
straight out and then you'll actually be

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.670 
straight out and then you'll actually be
able<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.099> see<00:03:24.060> inside<00:03:24.299> here<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.139> instead<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.500> it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
able to see inside here so instead of it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.909 
able to see inside here so instead of it
being<00:03:25.940> modular<00:03:27.139> it's<00:03:28.139> just<00:03:28.500> gonna<00:03:28.680> be

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
being modular it's just gonna be

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.039 
being modular it's just gonna be
open-faced<00:03:29.910> where<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.239> can<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.510> take<00:03:30.900> the
