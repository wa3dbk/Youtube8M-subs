a better fluid movement of the dogs we

and working dogs tend to get arthritis
they<00:01:46.409> tend<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.860> back<00:01:47.100> problems<00:01:47.640> lower

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
they tend to get back problems lower

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.600 
they tend to get back problems lower
back<00:01:48.180> problems<00:01:48.689> knee<00:01:49.350> problems<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.280> our<00:01:50.430> hope

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
back problems knee problems and our hope

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.929 
back problems knee problems and our hope
is<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.149> by<00:01:51.930> using<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.470> technology

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
is that we can by using this technology

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.899 
is that we can by using this technology
we<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:53.970> watch<00:01:54.479> how<00:01:54.720> they<00:01:54.899> move<00:01:55.640> say<00:01:56.640> what<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
we can watch how they move say what the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.310 
we can watch how they move say what the
angle<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> their<00:01:57.360> hips<00:01:57.600> are<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.110> stand

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
angle of their hips are when they stand

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.649 
angle of their hips are when they stand
up<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.619> their<00:01:58.740> hind<00:01:58.799> legs<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.579> that'll<00:02:00.329> let<00:02:00.479> us

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
up on their hind legs and that'll let us

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.020 
up on their hind legs and that'll let us
again<00:02:01.380> apply<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.100> adult<00:02:02.520> working<00:02:02.820> dogs

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
again apply it to adult working dogs

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.550 
again apply it to adult working dogs
that<00:02:03.479> might<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.899> having<00:02:04.020> problems<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that might be having problems and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.139 
that might be having problems and
hopefully<00:02:04.890> help<00:02:05.040> prevent<00:02:05.399> problems<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
hopefully help prevent problems in the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.329 
hopefully help prevent problems in the
long<00:02:06.299> run
