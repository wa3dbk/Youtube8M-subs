understanding<00:00:10.830> tire<00:00:11.280> tread<00:00:13.370> most<00:00:14.370> people

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
understanding tire tread most people

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
understanding tire tread most people
think<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.969> health<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.299> their<00:00:15.389> tire

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
think about the health of their tire

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.720 
think about the health of their tire
then<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.440> basically<00:00:16.590> equates<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.310> tread<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
then it basically equates to tread and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.000 
then it basically equates to tread and
clearly<00:00:18.119> aware<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.930> tread<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.439> important

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
clearly aware on the tread is important

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.290 
clearly aware on the tread is important

the tread is still very deep there's a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.060 
the tread is still very deep there's a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
lot of visible tread this is what you

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.439 
lot of visible tread this is what you

would see when you walk up to the car
with<00:00:31.349> tires<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.309> bought<00:00:32.520> from

with tires that you just bought from
tire<00:00:32.969> racks<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> tread<00:00:34.530> pattern

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
tire racks you can see the tread pattern

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.260 
tire racks you can see the tread pattern
there's<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> lot<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.430> features<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> tread

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
there's a lot of features in the tread

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.490 
there's a lot of features in the tread
pattern<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:36.930> gives<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.230> traction

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
pattern this is what gives you traction

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.220 
pattern this is what gives you traction
in<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.250> snow<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.969> rain<00:00:41.840> this<00:00:42.840> tire<00:00:43.079> is

about 75% worn now and this is the same

about 75% worn now and this is the same
tires<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.190> looked<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.239> see

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
tires we just looked at but you can see

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299 
tires we just looked at but you can see
there's<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.840> noticeable<00:00:49.469> change<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> tread

there's a noticeable change in the tread

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.220 
there's a noticeable change in the tread
pattern<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:51.210> much<00:00:51.449> shallower<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> look

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
pattern it's much shallower if you look

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
pattern it's much shallower if you look
at<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> grooves<00:00:52.680> there's<00:00:53.640> not<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
at the grooves there's not a lot of

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
at the grooves there's not a lot of

through wet conditions it's about time

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.649 
through wet conditions it's about time
to<00:01:23.430> consider<00:01:23.700> replacing<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.270> tires

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to consider replacing your tires

car<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.400> family<00:01:32.759> okay<00:01:32.970> show

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
car for you or for your family okay show

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.109 
car for you or for your family okay show
me<00:01:33.600> something<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.110> bad<00:01:34.320> well<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.030> an

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
me something really bad well this is an

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.560 
me something really bad well this is an
example<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.439> same<00:01:37.680> tire<00:01:37.979> now<00:01:38.310> down<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
example of the same tire now down at the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.569 
example of the same tire now down at the
bare<00:01:39.750> minimum<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:40.229> two<00:01:40.470> thirty<00:01:40.740> Seconds<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
bare minimum at two thirty Seconds and

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.670 
bare minimum at two thirty Seconds and
in<00:01:41.700> most<00:01:41.850> states<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.659> two<00:01:43.079> thirty<00:01:43.290> Seconds

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
in most states this two thirty Seconds

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.679 
in most states this two thirty Seconds
minimum<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.430> legal<00:01:44.729> minimum<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.360> by<00:01:45.509> now

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
minimum is the legal minimum but by now

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.080 
minimum is the legal minimum but by now
this<00:01:45.960> tire<00:01:46.170> has<00:01:46.409> very<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.340> traction<00:01:47.729> in

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
this tire has very little traction in

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.819 
this tire has very little traction in
the<00:01:48.210> rain<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> has<00:01:48.570> virtually<00:01:48.810> no<00:01:49.140> subtraction

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the rain it has virtually no subtraction

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
the rain it has virtually no subtraction
if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> happen<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> drive<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> snow<00:01:50.970> but

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
if you happen to drive in the snow but

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.270 
if you happen to drive in the snow but
yet<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.259> most<00:01:52.439> people<00:01:52.710> they<00:01:52.799> look<00:01:52.950> at<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
yet to most people they look at this and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.590 
yet to most people they look at this and
say<00:01:53.399> well<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.729> they're<00:01:53.850> still<00:01:54.030> tread<00:01:54.360> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
say well but they're still tread you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.850 
say well but they're still tread you
know<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.470> checkbook<00:01:55.770> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
know it's kind like your checkbook I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.810 
know it's kind like your checkbook I
still<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.159> checks<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.549> can't<00:01:56.729> be

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
still have checks so I can't be

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.340 
still have checks so I can't be
overdrawn<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.479> still<00:01:57.750> haven't<00:01:57.930> read<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.200> should

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
overdrawn I still haven't read it should

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
overdrawn I still haven't read it should
still<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.590> traction<00:01:58.920> well<00:01:59.579> maybe<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
still have traction well maybe not the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.270 
still have traction well maybe not the
case<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.409> one<00:02:01.590> there's<00:02:01.770> still<00:02:01.920> visible

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
case this one there's still visible

case this one there's still visible
treads<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.479> know<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
treads here on the you know the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.790 
treads here on the you know the
outermost

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
outermost

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.440 
outermost
and<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.100> wonder<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.400> people<00:02:05.490> judge<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.910> that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
and I wonder if people judge it that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.940 
and I wonder if people judge it that
helper<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> tired<00:02:07.170> by<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.590> without

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
helper the tired by that without

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.640 
helper the tired by that without
recognizing<00:02:08.670> how<00:02:09.090> strict<00:02:09.600> down<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.290> central

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
recognizing how strict down the central

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.890 
recognizing how strict down the central
power<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.250> exactly<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.210> walk<00:02:12.390> by<00:02:12.540> your<00:02:12.720> car

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
power is exactly as you walk by your car

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.300 
power is exactly as you walk by your car
as<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.320> go<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> work<00:02:13.710> in<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> morning<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.280> mean

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
as you go to work in the morning I mean

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.710 
as you go to work in the morning I mean
through<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.730> wheel<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.450> all<00:02:15.600> that

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
through the wheel well this is all that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.180 
through the wheel well this is all that
you're<00:02:15.870> going<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.260> gee<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> looks<00:02:16.680> okay

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
you're going to see gee it looks okay

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.980 
you're going to see gee it looks okay
but<00:02:17.820> then<00:02:17.940> when<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.150> look<00:02:18.300> at<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.840> main

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
but then when you look at the the main

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.300 
but then when you look at the the main
part<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.350> tread<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.680> actually<00:02:19.980> provides

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
part of the tread that actually provides

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.820 
part of the tread that actually provides
the<00:02:20.460> traction<00:02:20.850> there's<00:02:21.090> very<00:02:21.420> little<00:02:21.830> tread

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the traction there's very little tread

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.260 
the traction there's very little tread
to<00:02:22.860> actually<00:02:23.340> take<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.520> bite<00:02:23.760> out<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> grip

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
to actually take a bite out of the grip

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
to actually take a bite out of the grip
out<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.630> snow<00:02:24.870> or<00:02:25.140> out<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.380> rain<00:02:25.530> if

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
out of the snow or out of the rain if

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.290 
out of the snow or out of the rain if
that's<00:02:26.100> what<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.250> happen<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.460> be<00:02:26.550> driving<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
that's what you happen to be driving and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.580 
that's what you happen to be driving and
when<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.510> say<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.020> legal<00:02:28.260> limit<00:02:28.290> so

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
when you say this is the legal limit so

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.170 
when you say this is the legal limit so
it<00:02:28.710> is<00:02:28.830> legal<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.820> car<00:02:30.000> but

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
it is legal to have this on the car but

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.330 
it is legal to have this on the car but
any<00:02:30.420> second<00:02:30.870> now<00:02:30.900> we've<00:02:31.590> gone<00:02:31.770> into<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.160> right

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
any second now we've gone into the right

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.430 
any second now we've gone into the right
here<00:02:32.670> well<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.780> what<00:02:34.320> does<00:02:34.410> that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
here well what is that what does that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.740 
here well what is that what does that
mean<00:02:34.680> exactly<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.970> know<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.570> legal

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
mean exactly it you know the legal

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.570 
mean exactly it you know the legal
minimum<00:02:37.020> says<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.190> know<00:02:38.280> by

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
minimum says that this is you know by

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.160 
minimum says that this is you know by
the<00:02:38.640> basic<00:02:39.090> rules<00:02:39.300> by<00:02:39.570> people<00:02:39.990> who<00:02:40.050> probably

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the basic rules by people who probably

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.230 
the basic rules by people who probably
don't<00:02:40.350> know<00:02:40.470> much<00:02:40.590> about<00:02:40.650> tires<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.090> as

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
don't know much about tires this is as

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.370 
don't know much about tires this is as
shallow<00:02:42.480> as<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.780> should<00:02:42.930> drive<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.350> your

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
tires but common sense and our testing

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.750 
tires but common sense and our testing
shows<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.440> at<00:02:46.890> least<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.310> step<00:02:47.520> higher<00:02:47.730> than

this<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.510> tire<00:02:48.660> looked<00:02:48.900> at<00:02:48.990> previously<00:02:49.410> was

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
this the tire looked at previously was

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.470 
this the tire looked at previously was
about<00:02:49.770> four<00:02:50.040> thirty<00:02:50.220> seconds<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.000> really<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
about four thirty seconds is really a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.150
