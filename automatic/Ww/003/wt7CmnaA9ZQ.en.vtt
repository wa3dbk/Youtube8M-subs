on this thing was easier to the pic that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:13.250 
on this thing was easier to the pic that
part<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.570> think<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.840> actually<00:03:03.900> do<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.350> pic

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.230 

and<00:03:14.260> sometimes<00:03:14.860> I'll<00:03:15.040> nobody<00:03:15.670> now<00:03:15.820> go<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.760> hit

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
and sometimes I'll nobody now go and hit

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.320 
and sometimes I'll nobody now go and hit
that<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.990> third<00:03:20.290> string<00:03:20.650> open<00:03:21.610> you<00:03:22.030> can<00:03:22.060> do

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
that that third string open you can do

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.420 
that that third string open you can do
it<00:03:22.420> at<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.720> fourth<00:03:23.350> string<00:03:23.680> fifth<00:03:24.160> fret

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.690 

I<00:03:28.769> think<00:03:29.769> they<00:03:29.890> might<00:03:30.069> do<00:03:30.219> it<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.489> way<00:03:30.640> but

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
I think they might do it that way but

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:45.190 
I think they might do it that way but
I've<00:03:31.540> been<00:03:31.780> hitting<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.290> search<00:03:32.500> hangover

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
all right let me just do it real slow

00:03:47.129 --> 00:04:05.230 
all right let me just do it real slow
once<00:03:52.430> let<00:03:53.430> me<00:03:53.489> do<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.760> again

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.370
