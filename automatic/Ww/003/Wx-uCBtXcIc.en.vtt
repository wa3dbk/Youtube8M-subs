sometimes<00:01:59.040> snap<00:01:59.610> quite<00:01:59.880> easily<00:02:00.259> you<00:02:01.259> can

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
sometimes snap quite easily you can

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.990

actually<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.860> pop<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> little<00:02:02.340> wire<00:02:02.610> through

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
actually just pop a little wire through

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.130 
actually just pop a little wire through
it<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> even<00:02:05.250> without<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.610> stem<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.180> can

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
it so even without the stem you can

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.219 
it so even without the stem you can
still<00:02:07.560> use<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:09.270> fluff<00:02:09.690> up<00:02:09.899> with<00:02:10.140> your

if you had to type carnations it would

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.170 
if you had to type carnations it would
take<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> lot<00:02:28.970> more<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.770> gently<00:02:34.160> last<00:02:34.760> year<00:02:35.120> you

once<00:02:41.000> you've<00:02:41.210> done<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.720> can<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.170> check

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
once you've done it you can just check

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.770 
once you've done it you can just check
that<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.640> shape<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.150> want<00:02:44.270> it<00:02:44.630> to

you're<00:02:47.270> not<00:02:47.420> using<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:48.020> ready-made<00:02:48.920> commander

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.910 

that's<00:02:58.340> pretty<00:02:58.640> much<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:59.290> not<00:03:00.290> hard<00:03:00.560> i<00:03:00.680> think

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
that's pretty much it not hard i think

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.120 
that's pretty much it not hard i think
pretty<00:03:01.040> much<00:03:01.190> anyone<00:03:01.670> could<00:03:01.940> do<00:03:02.090> this

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
pretty much anyone could do this

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.850 
pretty much anyone could do this
Alaska<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.730> little<00:03:04.940> spray<00:03:05.240> down<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.530> it

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
Alaska the little spray down so that it

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.740 
Alaska the little spray down so that it
absorbs<00:03:07.430> some<00:03:07.550> water<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.970> its<00:03:08.090> petals<00:03:08.330> because

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
absorbs some water to its petals because

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.410 
absorbs some water to its petals because
there's<00:03:08.900> not<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.140> lot<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.410> water<00:03:09.650> in<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:10.070> wall

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
there's not a lot of water in that wall

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.980 
there's not a lot of water in that wall
and<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.630> should<00:03:11.810> last<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.590> good<00:03:12.650> week
