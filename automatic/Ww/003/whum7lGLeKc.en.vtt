00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.110
 for the manufacture of an aluminum wood window the traditional craft 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.110
 the carpenter and always in the foreground 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.849
 we use the door a few months I first submitted aurora hostages 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.579
 will have task 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.309
 the planing end 10 hydrokit machining donald to the windows their surface 

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.309
 extremely a track it reflects as well as their prosperity 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:29.579
 this process ensures that in addition it is extremely accurate shaping with a 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.070
 good dimensional stability 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.830
 for reports by holding on the sleepers and coats of our 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.150
 wooden windows mechanically phrased at the same time as the 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.090
 offenders 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.090
 the dimensions are constantly checking to avoid gaps 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.340
 then different elements and sleeping and coats his colleague has 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.510
 seemed strongly 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.130
 because their agreements are durable goods the elements are still 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.390
 mechanically pressed 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.960
 framing made using this traditional technique more and more 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.770
 sophisticated are extremely strong and highly stable 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.790
 dimensional 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.950
 the application of a consolidating agent and immediate sanding elects the surface 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.230
 to prepare it for painting 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.610
 first of all the frame is immersed in a bath to apply the layer of 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.620
 shape without leaving a vacuum 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.120
 a simple process that contribute significantly to longevity and 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.020
 the ecological character of our windows 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.020
 thanks to the use of special internet-based water 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.960
 after applying the bottom run the window is prepared in place of 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.040
 finale by the second concert 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.030
 we rely on the latest water base they are also products 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.020
 ecological 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.660
 an excellent ecological balance and a pleasant indoor climate on the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660
 result of all his efforts 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.369
 before assembly all the aluminum frames are fixed by a point of 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.910
 additional welding 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.910
 this process increase their shape stability 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.040
 Aluminum wood windows can be made in any shape 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.170
 possible 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.340
 it is possible to provide the double in addition to triple glazing 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.279
 the glazing is insulated by the high quality silicone player 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.419
 matt aluminum wood windows withstand the weather very well 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:15.429
 their wooden frame provide extraordinary thermal insulation and 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.179
 gives the house a comfortable character 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.749
 the aluminum hull to ask still brings you a greater choice of 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:22.239
 edge type
