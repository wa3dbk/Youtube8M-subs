00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.849
 hello friends today we want to make known 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.250
 the anatomy of the foot important part 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.070
 of human anatomy that serves as 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.369
 link between our body and the earth 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.020
 that we step biomechanically the foot is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.200
 the one in charge of receiving the impact 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.380
 against the ground when we walk and from 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.719
 support much of the body weight what 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.540
 which makes it a key part of 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.910
 our health therefore take care of our 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.400
 feet and our footprint is essential for 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.370
 maintain good biomechanical health 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.350
 just have the footprint altered to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.000
 develop problems in knees 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.350
 hips or even the spine 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.380
 imagine for a moment that your car 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.600
 I had a slanted wheel and I drove 6 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.340
 kilometers and kilometers in this way 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.110
 what kind of problems do you think 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.829
 would cause the operation of the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.810
 engine and on the chassis or body and 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.149
 if we apply this same example to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.549
 our body I hope you have 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.340
 learned a little more about the role that 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.920
 play the foot in our health after this 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.620
 small but intense explanation we passed 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.560
 to more technical details of the anatomy 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.770
 bone of the foot we perform a first 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.710
 study from such a sagittal view and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.680
 as we see the foot if we lower the head and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.900
 we look towards him 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.470
 the foot just as the hand is 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.510
 formed by three groups of bones of the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.790
 tarso that is articulated in its part 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.710
 upper with tibia and fibula- the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.710
 metatarsus and the phalanges 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.229
 the bones of the tarsus are divided into two 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.229
 rows 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.330
 a first row consisting of two 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.220
 big bones the great bone calcaneus 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.070
 that makes up the heel with which we 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.860
 support on the ground and above the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.560
 Astragalus bone that lies between the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.140
 warm and fibula forming a clamp 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.080
 called shroud warm fibula 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.690
 astragalino 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.910
 this shroud and especially its ligaments 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.340
 are those that are affected when 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.980
 we suffered a sprained ankle 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.739
 these two great bones are articulated 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.620
 with the second row of the stem formed 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.800
 for which the bolt is square bone 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.200
 located on the external part of the foot the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.959
 navicular or scaphoid shaped 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.019
 crescent and its three small wedges that 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.480
 they are articulated on the front ordered 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.160
 inside out as first second 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.560
 and third wedge 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.720
 if the left side of the scheme is the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.880
 inside of the foot and the right side the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.260
 outside of which side is the foot that 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.510
 we are seeing right or left 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.060
 after this deep riddle 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.700
 we passed to the metatarsal five long bones 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.970
 that articulate with the tasso from behind 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.909
 and with the phalanges ahead and this 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.290
 brings us to another question that I would prefer 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.719
 be tarsus or phalanges 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.049
 all fingers are made up of 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:21.480
 three phalanges except for the big toe 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.049
 which is too fat and only has 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.230
 two phalanges finally we can not leave 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.450
 to name the sesamoid bone 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.549
 small bones with a rounded shape that 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.489
 on the foot they are below the 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.609
 metatarsus of the big toe these bones are 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.709
 they are embedded in the tendon 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.709
 decreasing the tension that it suffers 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.000
 usually fractures of the foot 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.129
 occur in the metatarsal between the 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.769
 we have the base of the fifth 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.750
 metatarsal produced by being a victim 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.420
 of a stomp or by an attraction 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.479
 sudden of the peroneos in sprains 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.090
 of ankle of great gravity in general 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.370
 the rest of the metatarsal fractures are 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.860
 produced by trauma or shock 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.610
 direct as for example when we are 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.009
 they fall something heavy on the foot 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.860
 a special type of fracture is the 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.110
 Fatigue fracture of the second or third 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.810
 metatarsal that is produced by the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.539
 stress of repeated micro trauma 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.979
 such as a prolonged walk 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.979
 with inappropriate shoes 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.340
 finally the fracture of the calcaneus is 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.500
 usual in those people who fall or 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.140
 jump high with support 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.070
 violent in the heels directly 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.070
 against the floor 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.340
 and with this the review of the fractures 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.340
 commons is concluded 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.000
 I hope you have acquired great 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.070
 knowledge about your foot your 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.730
 importance and the bones that what 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.180
 make up 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:19.800
 it is important to know yourself before 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.800
 to know others 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.620
 if you liked the video consider 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.379
 share it with all people 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.840
 close to you share wellness and health 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:32.629
 and help all those people who 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.169
 have a problem similar to yours with 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:38.770
