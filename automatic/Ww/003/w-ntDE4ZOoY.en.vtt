 idea of what I bought in the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.090

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.180
 four gigabytes of memory as the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.710
 motherboard as I already informed you 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.320
 I bought 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.799

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.740
 of packaging 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.930

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.750

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.420

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.159
 stiletto to open our packaging 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.409

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.040

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.850

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:44.820

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:48.240
 My source is a 7 real color 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:52.810

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.170
 sealed in the box with your due 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.630
 manuals and everything we sometimes go 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.450
 street shopping and products is already open 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.800
 exposed for us we end up 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.150
 kind of lost after that comes missing 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.100
 something 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.320
 so I do not want to pull the sardines if 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.000
 come this is my twitter 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.920

 the guys and the wolves there from amd something 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.910
 but at the time when I gave up the 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:44.620
 My setup beans are straight 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:49.739
 everything sealed also apparently not 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.739
 displays that it was opened in another location 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:04:00.280
 and then we'll see what else is in here 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:07.739
 because it thinks it's too big 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:13.760
 the invoice is not good for the player 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:20.750

 manaus amazonas complaints then the 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.460

 connotation that the joke that we 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.250
