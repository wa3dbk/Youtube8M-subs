00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.670 
want our pie to be soggy so we need to
let<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.620> reduce<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.930> lot<00:03:38.870> meanwhile<00:03:39.870> we<00:03:40.260> can

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
let it reduce a lot meanwhile we can

divide<00:05:05.880> it<00:05:05.940> in<00:05:06.210> two<00:05:06.240> because<00:05:06.780> we<00:05:07.380> want<00:05:07.620> 1/2<00:05:08.490> for

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
divide it in two because we want 1/2 for

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.560 
divide it in two because we want 1/2 for
the<00:05:09.240> bottom<00:05:09.570> part<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:10.200> one<00:05:10.380> for<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.880> top<00:05:11.880> and

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
the bottom part and one for the top and

I started I just made a rough and round
shape<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.080> now<00:05:19.260> with<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:19.919> help<00:05:20.130> of<00:05:21.320> roll<00:05:22.320> pin

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
shape and now with the help of roll pin

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.580 
shape and now with the help of roll pin
I<00:05:22.890> flatten<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.940> dough<00:05:23.970> until<00:05:24.540> it<00:05:25.050> was<00:05:25.260> quite

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
I flatten the dough until it was quite

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
thin and it covered all the surface of

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.450 
thin and it covered all the surface of
my<00:05:31.110> mold<00:05:31.550> this<00:05:32.550> time<00:05:33.210> I<00:05:33.450> used<00:05:34.100> round<00:05:35.100> shape

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
adjust the door to your mold and now we

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.120 
adjust the door to your mold and now we
can<00:05:59.430> fill<00:05:59.640> it<00:05:59.789> well<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.900> continued<00:06:01.500> with<00:06:01.680> the

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130

second<00:06:02.660> half<00:06:03.660> of<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:03.960> dough<00:06:04.880> and<00:06:06.770> then<00:06:07.770> I

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
second half of the dough and then I

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.980 
second half of the dough and then I
filled<00:06:08.310> my<00:06:08.610> pie<00:06:09.210> with<00:06:09.690> the<00:06:10.500> tuna<00:06:10.740> filling<00:06:11.220> I

filled my pie with the tuna filling I
spread<00:06:12.990> it<00:06:13.050> evenly<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:16.160> now<00:06:17.160> we<00:06:17.220> can<00:06:17.430> cover

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
spread it evenly and now we can cover

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.170 
spread it evenly and now we can cover
with<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:18.030> second<00:06:18.300> part<00:06:18.539> of<00:06:18.690> the<00:06:18.780> dome

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.760 

and<00:06:24.180> now<00:06:24.570> you<00:06:25.260> need<00:06:25.470> to<00:06:25.800> trim<00:06:26.190> the<00:06:26.640> excess<00:06:27.770> of

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
and now you need to trim the excess of

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.940 
and now you need to trim the excess of
dough<00:06:29.340> and<00:06:30.110> the<00:06:31.110> final<00:06:31.410> step<00:06:31.620> is<00:06:32.420> you<00:06:33.420> need<00:06:33.600> to

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
dough and the final step is you need to

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.410 
dough and the final step is you need to
make<00:06:34.950> the<00:06:35.340> corner<00:06:36.300> with<00:06:36.600> the<00:06:36.720> help<00:06:36.930> of<00:06:37.020> your

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
make the corner with the help of your

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.390 
make the corner with the help of your
fingers<00:06:39.420> as<00:06:39.720> you<00:06:39.780> see<00:06:39.990> here<00:06:40.350> and<00:06:40.530> a<00:06:40.980> crucial

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
fingers as you see here and a crucial

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.640 
fingers as you see here and a crucial
step<00:06:41.820> is<00:06:42.030> that<00:06:42.360> you<00:06:42.510> need<00:06:42.660> to<00:06:42.690> practice<00:06:43.020> a<00:06:43.410> hole

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
step is that you need to practice a hole

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.130 
step is that you need to practice a hole
in<00:06:43.860> the<00:06:43.950> middle<00:06:44.220> of<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.520> pie<00:06:44.730> so<00:06:45.060> you<00:06:45.540> let<00:06:45.930> the

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
in the middle of the pie so you let the

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:52.880 
in the middle of the pie so you let the
steam<00:06:46.440> get<00:06:47.400> out<00:06:47.550> of<00:06:49.130> of<00:06:50.130> the<00:06:50.190> filling<00:06:51.890> and

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
steam get out of of the filling and

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.850 
steam get out of of the filling and
finally<00:06:53.370> you<00:06:54.270> can<00:06:55.370> put<00:06:56.370> some<00:06:56.640> oil<00:06:56.940> on<00:06:57.300> top<00:06:57.860> so

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
finally you can put some oil on top so

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.330 
finally you can put some oil on top so
you<00:06:58.890> will<00:06:59.580> get<00:06:59.790> a<00:06:59.850> nicer<00:07:00.390> color<00:07:00.710> after<00:07:01.710> baking

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
you will get a nicer color after baking

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.140 
you will get a nicer color after baking
it<00:07:02.670> and<00:07:03.630> now<00:07:03.810> put<00:07:04.800> it<00:07:04.920> in<00:07:05.070> the<00:07:05.100> oven<00:07:05.310> for<00:07:05.790> 40

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.210 
it and now put it in the oven for 40
minutes<00:07:06.180> or<00:07:06.630> until<00:07:06.780> it<00:07:07.170> looks<00:07:07.440> golden<00:07:07.980> brown

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
minutes or until it looks golden brown

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.020 
minutes or until it looks golden brown
