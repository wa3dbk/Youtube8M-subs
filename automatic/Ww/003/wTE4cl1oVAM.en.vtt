00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.470
 Welcome to a purchase by the Marbacher 2 GB My Name is 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.800
 Although US and I are equally in the plans, it is not mine 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.179
 It's smaller by Gundolf GroÃŸmann and he makes a few 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.099
 ultimately is 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 GM also knows this place on my channel 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.970
 but later to the bass 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.020
 and now, first of all, tickets for the "Iceman" thank you 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.110
 us smaller rattle in mind the chance gives a bit more 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.360
 Easy to reach viewers 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.620
 and yes 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.200
 So first off a bit of what the gameplay as you can see he has here 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.120
 Serve Juke percent cheaper the Dult packed with muffler and the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.440
 Files are already betrayed so he goes to Newhook 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.460
 And by default he does not do anything as well as anyone like the Henri 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.440
 wrapped background in the UKE 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.040
 and 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.420
 And suddenly the short wenes of a marathon kroha are smaller and narrower 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.409
 So everything flew open and because currently gambled with a headset and therefore in the 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.210
 Front me sure all know percent really brings deaths emitted in mw2 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.049
 but what urgently helped hopeful next to commentator once chewed 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.400
 and you have 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.920
 now the chance of what she finds on our channel and what 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.450
 Judge expects that whenever it's possible 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.690
 So first 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.150
 the focus should be on us more often see fit shooters are 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.800
 but now lethal to men already some Clarisse of Nine open game 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.120
 Metro 2033 stuck 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.450
 I do not know if she knows Matthew but now how is the most famous one 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.210
 game 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.470
 Statements are very interesting Dr 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.869
 everyone else is also in harmony 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.460
 and around 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.540
 the MACD is his last 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.340
 Year still exactly Firth means I've uploaded five more and one 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.290
 very cool came off something and yesterday has a beautiful world completely 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.160
 deleted 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.060
 so and now will most likely now I know more because summer vacation 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.509
 I am now in the upper grades around me 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.059
 and if special cases Whitmarsh difficult and so but I definitely want that 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.229
 use the time 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.909
 make about 80 more flatrate without end 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.669
 and including Holland 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.789
 Percent want to say 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:25.649
 namely that we are mainly action shooter or first 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:26.650
 Person shooter 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.559
 on our plates 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.329
 Envy commented gameplay is natural and I know that maybe 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.029
 spontaneous or similar comes sometime who knows who knows 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.999
 So far, as I've already mentioned, we're keeping leg strength now 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.930
 so a paparazzo blows so not so outstanding right now so that were 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.399
 my first attempts 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.119
 on what topics to Babel so 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:55.010
 I waited for the first time I would say if you also unnatural world in the forest 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.819
 Percent knows Maike Kappes we do 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.659
 easy in the world 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.329
 create wonderful world 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.329
 and yes 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:08.649
 The Metro 2033 now also blows other picture shooter 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.529
 So for the people who are interested 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:16.219
 and here as well that still remain high Black Ops would have it too 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:17.219
 already ready 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.099
 Mon two roles Thelen what have we already uploaded so I could 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.619
 just drop by if you feel like we have through me on each 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.299
 Fall forward 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.779
 And if you really have what he has when you want to have five prizes for it 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.279
 Brand film lifts 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.799
 it's really fun to listen to Wendland 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.799
 Saab and Yen would and cool off in the beginning 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.789
 so 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.619
 I can now tell you a little bit about what I really have like that 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.759
 You can tell him more about the plans 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.919
 but only for a very short time she is barely alive after all four minutes 30 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.279
 there is scarce 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.849
 and today, let's talk briefly what people are getting closer to No 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.099
 Action shooter so mainly in multiplayer course 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:05.459
 which I noticed especially the last few weeks as we did 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.319
 me with my plan a bit 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.579
 TuS Kaltehardt or have to because they had dared 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.799
 he really was 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.969
 always lousy mood than the Black Ops have collected and because 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.649
 I know that they are not. I would not really recommend it 

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.830
 say because in the chain all the community are the other players 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.139
 in sync with the YouTube and that's not the deciding race for it 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.389
 which would then supply us with the game and therefore 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.620
 if I'm not even a game developer right now 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.639
 blame him for the people who ended up costing Knut in the 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.819
 Corner Cham 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.639
 and yes I have my doubts no suggestions or always have to 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.300
 to think that he is the community and not the 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.830
 indie-developer 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.129
 and and fast here the score is 47 3 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:52.059
 of it is the bear and I hope he will be lucky then 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.249
 then
