 This is my first video. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.510
 is teaching you a video lesson from 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.740
 how to tear down an online service website 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:17.250
 good for you to start you should have the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.140
 is http Tholl dolls I is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.580
 available in the video description 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.180

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.980
 computer error 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.980
 I think you guys are not going to go 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:39.640
 open here I searched for the gui file 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.640
 point is that it takes two clicks 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.230
 then the program is already open on the website 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.850
 of the server site with the felling is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.150
 this one the UAW and a point with br 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.660
 put neither url then put a 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:05.760
 proxy no connections puts four thousand 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.190
 connect to hate one thousand diagnostics brands 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.900
 to this option we can still receive the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.320
 attack information 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.390
 let's go there an attack to start the attack 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.790
 Let's wait for the end of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.400
 upload me back to using the video 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.400
 here to be faster 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.869
 good already ended here 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.110
 now let's see if this site was 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.110
 knocked down 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.700
 I updated here 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.420
 we will still authorize loading the i is 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.070
 page is not available 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.700
 It means that the site was brought down with 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.560
 success and that's just it will be 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.650
 available and available for 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.350
 you the link of the download remembering 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.000
 also has an insight that is to have a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:05.050
 more protection but it is more useful doing 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.780
 what makes it hard for you to take down more 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.610
 that you should have a gps help from 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.950
 some friends with a good internet there 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.170

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.740

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.680
