00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 each one 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.349
 quiet soft beauty the style of going 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.519
 For Europe, this is a glasses. 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.040
 ray-ban the team is a half-rap style 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.449
 rock the band up is a bit like 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.820
 Is it going to be there what is it like? 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.220
 will feel like commanding the team there so much 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.620
 the guys are a wee lewis do not keep 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.420
 a command and 4 face super tension one of the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.299
 best of brazil but the best 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.890
 prepare prepared will be 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.659
 It will be on this trip. 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.670
 I'm very happy to idc team captain 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:57.119
 two guys, man, he's very good and with 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.650
 What is this? What are you traveling to do? 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.900
 a trip to europe all over europe with 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.150
 play the video game with a trio and 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.549
 old man explains paying that by imagining how 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.870
 is that it came with a very thing the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.220
 I was never ever go outside but 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.920
 I think it's going to be going to be very crazy. 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.380
 That was in 2006, he rehearses new 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.500
 we 've never been there some alone 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.620
 Only Michel I think the rest of the team is that I 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.560
 I give a whole new experience in 2006 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.750
 When you entered SX you thought that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.580
 One day you get to talk but I see you. 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.930
 I will give a life in the game with a 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.820
 everything paid is quiet 1 71 I'm already leaving 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 It will happen to you on this trip. 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.440
 I had already thought enough to hit the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.200
 lock once you do not know it's a clash already 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.330
 I hit the crossbar a lot but always think 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.250
 in snow travel I think everyone who 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.220
 play like this always think about being able to 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.810
 to exchange with the Greek trunks and the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.710
 we have the opportunity we have to 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.580
 enjoy 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.200
 I think it takes away some of the Douro is 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.400
 game is the lack of an event that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.140
 says that what will be the last of the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.740
 counter-strike a concept of people to 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.750
 speak 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.350
 the crowd was already cs go that is not 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.110
 will support the na'vi nanÃ¡ pgs portal 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.530
 cnet that the team still so level 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.180
 it's not for sure 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.770
 No one talks to lose for sure. 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.840
 the brass cards spent money 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.420
 who was beyond the money they still 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.209
 They are training the sun and I still have 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.980
 life has fanatic goes full 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.560
 guys so attached the son just 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.760
 go online so I think that everything 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.980
 world will play to win no one wants 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.290
 end up losing the game, last time 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.540
 losing championship is the time that you 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.630
 were had is 83 if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.310
 be much above the tactics of 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.080
 guys you as captain of an analyzed 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.660
 we give it already going to be one year old 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.790
 with the gringos there how was your 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.880
 preparation as captain so I saw 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.989
 some of them just that we do not 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.850
 will play on them will not play 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.860
 even in our game I will only see tim cook 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.560
 tactic is going to get better only it does not 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.660
 to know a lot because our group 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.290
 exotic that we do not know I did not see any 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.319
 their 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.300
 the fanatic and just entered a player 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.769
 so I do not know how the Indian is not 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.930
 I know how he's playing he does not have 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.630
 a video of them and the Russians will still 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.910
 play with the neo completing it 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.680
 also said that there is no charge 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.230
 that they did not train that they just go 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.880
 there and how to mix even happening in the first 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.700
 and held the country of Africa and the play 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.769
 John , I really forgot that football. 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.720
 National passion is not personal, it is 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.790
 not having a graphic I do not know what there is 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.530
 but it really is a game that is inactive 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.570
 because of that everything is right can happen 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.970
 a different game is that neither football - and 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.489
 said it 's when you're better 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.109
 It's going to win and it 's the message for guys there. 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.670
 hoping not to be a line of his 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.440
 Brother will definitely be there now. 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.359
 had to send a hug for him to leave 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.190
 cheer for the people we're going to do 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.600
