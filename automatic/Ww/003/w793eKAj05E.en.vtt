00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.450
 a day in the life of mumbai 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.580
 well our day starts early in 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.240
 the morning around 8 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.669
 tomorrow well you have to be realistic my 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.710
 day starts at 8 in the morning because 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:21.420
 in a country you are probably awake 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.090
 from 4 or 5 in the morning 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.310
 and well the first thing I do is clean 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.980
 the mountain sand box because as 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.590
 everyone already knows cats do not like it 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.960
 use the dirty litter box so 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.060
 this is a very good time to start 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.160
 to do this task 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.200
 and good, taking advantage of the fact that I have to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.960
 wash my hands I take this moment 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.880
 to wash mumbai dishes since 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.360
 because nobody likes to eat in the 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.360
 Dirty plates 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.570
 it is important to always have water 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.129
 fresh available 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.079
 I should put a little dish 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.640
 bigger for the water but how am I 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.199
 here at home then I can be at 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.850
 pending of it and when the dish is 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.689
 a bit empty so I can put a 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.689
 more water 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.250
 and for all those who have 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 asked what kind of food I give to 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.830
 mumbai good the brand is health science 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.020
 I have spent several months starts giving of 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.580
 eat this specific brand and the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.400
 true that until now everything has gone very 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.960
 well I made the change because with the other 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.090
 mark that was giving notice that the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.979
 hair was getting a bit dry and 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.479
 with this good until now I've seen 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.479
 a pretty favorable change 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.300
 for your breakfast today I'm going to 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.270
 give a can of food of this same 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.160
 brand and unfortunately when you 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.080
 meets food and I did not realize this 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.600
 latitas specifically designed for 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.760
 Adult kittens over the age of 7 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.470
 years on but, well, not 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.270
 we can let the food go to waste 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.270
 so I'm going to give you this tin 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.420
 to her 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.160
 mounts and can spend hours looking at 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.530
 through this door or the windows 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.410
 as they know cats love to watch 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.650
 its exterior and mumbai of course is not 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.650
 The exeption 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.370
 and good taking what I was doing 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.469
 this video I decided to play with one for a 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.629
 game that I almost always play with her 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:29.150
 he basically grabbed me running like 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.040
 crazy I go and I hide and I know that she 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.469
 will find me because he always does what 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.719
 same and good then it turns out that 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:38.569
 exactly today when I decide 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:41.389
 record this video I went to stumble and I 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.609
 I fell almost broke my teeth to be 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.260
 playing as I say is not the first 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.000
 time I play there as you can see it 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.190
 they fell down to the lenses was a 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.800
 very very funny situation 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.690
 He gave me a holy blow that you can not imagine 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.580
 but the truth is that it did not hurt so much 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.310
 how I thought I was going to hurt there 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.890
 I'm laughing and laughing like crazy but more than 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.440
 nothing laughter is because I fell and because 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.050
 mounts and puts that face of fright that the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.530
 it really gave me so much laughter that I could not 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.530
 endure 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.090
 and good if you wonder why I 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.820
 send or upload videos so often then 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.400
 here I will tell you why the reason 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.530
 it's just montaigne every time I go to 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.480
 do some video that I'm going to edit or I'm going 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.460
 to look for information it turns out that I 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.100
 I come to sit at the desk and what is it 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.800
 what happens, he rides and comes and goes to bed 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.020
 the desk obviously like me 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.240
 they love cats and I love montaigne 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.860
 well I can not stand the desire and 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.460
 I start caressing her and there I 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.060
 I entertain with her and then watch video 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.060
 it just is not done 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.400
 whenever I'm going to cook or every time 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.910
 I go to the kitchen and open the fridge, which is what 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.580
 What's up 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.680
 Mumbai follows me and lies down in the middle 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.020
 from the floor to look at each of the 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.540
 movements that I do 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.030
 or not 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.570
 Hello 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.570
 efe 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.930
 directly 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.250
 the hunger games to those who do not 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.720
 like this movie is one of my 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.820
 favorites the truth is that I've already 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.980
 seen many times but it does not bore me 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.570
 how can you see a country 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.730
 she is not so interested in the 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.730
 movie she just lie down and 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:40.070
 she stays there lying in the armchair and 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.850
 meanwhile I take advantage and start 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.850
 edit video 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.080
 Mumbai has many favorite places 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.930
 to rest can be in the 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.570
 stairs in the armchair in a box in a 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.470
 closet on this occasion decided to choose 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.470
 a chair 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.030
 before going to sleep I give a little 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.130
 of food so you do not get hungry in the 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.430
 night and also so that it is not of the 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.430
 thing 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.370
 Goodnight
