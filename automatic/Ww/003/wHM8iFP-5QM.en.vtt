get is how do I create more variations
for<00:00:08.820> my<00:00:08.940> foot<00:00:09.179> work<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.870> know<00:00:09.990> people<00:00:10.349> they<00:00:10.650> do

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
for my foot work you know people they do

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.410 
for my foot work you know people they do
like<00:00:11.219> three<00:00:11.580> rounds<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.030> they<00:00:12.150> feel<00:00:12.389> like

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
like three rounds that they feel like

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.360 
like three rounds that they feel like
they're<00:00:12.690> running<00:00:12.960> these<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.860> same<00:00:14.160> moves

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
they're running these the same moves

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.490 
they're running these the same moves
over<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.030> over<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.480> over<00:00:15.570> again<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.289> they're

asking you know how do I create more

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.349 
asking you know how do I create more
variations<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.850> video<00:00:21.029> I'm<00:00:21.240> actually

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
variations so in this video I'm actually

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.660 
variations so in this video I'm actually
gonna<00:00:21.689> show<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.050> two<00:00:22.410> different<00:00:22.670> concepts

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
gonna show you two different concepts

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.550 
gonna show you two different concepts
they're<00:00:24.210> really<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.720> moves<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.410> can

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
they're really just moves that you can

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.769 
they're really just moves that you can
actually<00:00:25.740> play<00:00:26.220> around<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.760> okay<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.359> let's

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
actually play around with okay so let's

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.620 
actually play around with okay so let's
get<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.109> down<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:30.449> might

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
get right down to it this one you might

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.620 
get right down to it this one you might
have<00:00:30.869> seen<00:00:31.050> Disney<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.450> people<00:00:33.450> wait

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
have seen Disney do it people wait

have seen Disney do it people wait
Disney<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.469> Toronto<00:00:34.920> supernatural<00:00:35.700> you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
Disney do from Toronto supernatural you

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.160 
Disney do from Toronto supernatural you
might<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.180> seen<00:00:36.360> him<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.809> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
might have seen him do it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.049 
might have seen him do it
in<00:00:37.320> some<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.770> sets<00:00:38.129> or<00:00:38.520> some<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
in some of that sets or some of the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.700 
in some of that sets or some of the
Toronto<00:00:39.450> people<00:00:39.629> which<00:00:39.840> might<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.410> but

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
Toronto people which might do this but

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.360 
Toronto people which might do this but
it's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.579> concept<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.149> hasn't<00:00:42.510> really<00:00:42.719> been

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
it's a concept that hasn't really been

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.830 
it's a concept that hasn't really been
explored<00:00:44.370> too<00:00:44.670> much<00:00:44.910> yet<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> people<00:00:45.780> at

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
explored too much yet in the people at

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.619 
explored too much yet in the people at
work<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> swivel<00:00:47.670> type<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.180> concept

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
work and it's the swivel type of concept

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.000 
work and it's the swivel type of concept
with<00:00:48.750> unique<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:50.420> back<00:00:51.420> okay<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.649> this

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
with unique so this back okay so this

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.979 
with unique so this back okay so this
concept<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.960> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
concept what you can do is you can do it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.380 
concept what you can do is you can do it
from<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> foot<00:00:56.070> position<00:00:56.730> right<00:00:56.940> obviously

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
from the foot position right obviously

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.810 
from the foot position right obviously
and<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.800> really<00:00:59.010> want<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.489> creative

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and if you really want to get creative

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.360 
and if you really want to get creative
you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.420> actually<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.140> from<00:01:01.590> even<00:01:02.190> from

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you can actually do it from even from

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.330 
you can actually do it from even from
standing<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:05.840> okay<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.830> tell<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.159> can

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
standing so okay so you can tell you can

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
standing so okay so you can tell you can
play<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> lovelace<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.110> if

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
play with the lovelace with it but if

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
play with the lovelace with it but if
you're<00:01:10.500> doing<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.010> yes<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.420> how

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you're doing for yes so you can see how

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.179 
you're doing for yes so you can see how
you<00:01:12.689> can't<00:01:13.080> play<00:01:13.260> around<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.680> concept

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you can't play around with that concept

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
you can't play around with that concept
and<00:01:14.430> create<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> new<00:01:14.880> forward<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.110> second

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and create a new forward so the second

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.340 
and create a new forward so the second
concept<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.299> grabbing<00:01:19.049> light

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
concept here is the grabbing light

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.460 
concept here is the grabbing light
concept<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.340> there's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.840> mean<00:01:22.170> there's<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
concept now there's a I mean there's a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.990 
concept now there's a I mean there's a
lot<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> different<00:01:23.130> ways<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.790> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
lot of different ways you can do that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
lot of different ways you can do that
and<00:01:24.240> people<00:01:24.330> are<00:01:24.570> playing<00:01:24.869> around<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and people are playing around with you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
and people are playing around with you
know<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> trigger<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:27.020> was<00:01:28.700> popular<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.390> in

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
much just yet so the concept is

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.310 
much just yet so the concept is
and<00:01:39.550> you're<00:01:39.670> like<00:01:39.850> mmm<00:01:40.780> like<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.380> okay<00:01:42.250> so
