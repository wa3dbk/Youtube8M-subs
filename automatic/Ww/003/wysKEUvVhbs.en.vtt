00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
preference and you'd be correct it is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.669 
preference and you'd be correct it is
about<00:01:20.549> preference<00:01:21.180> however<00:01:22.050> there<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.649> no

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
about preference however there is no

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:24.830 
about preference however there is no
option<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.280> anyone<00:01:23.729> who<00:01:23.880> doesn't<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.539> blue

option for anyone who doesn't like blue

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.020 
option for anyone who doesn't like blue
and<00:01:25.140> even<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.250> point<00:01:26.550> we're<00:01:26.910> not

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and even more on that point we're not

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.730 
and even more on that point we're not
talking<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.659> forty<00:01:28.050> dollar<00:01:28.080> keyboard

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
talking about a forty dollar keyboard

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.200 
talking about a forty dollar keyboard
we're<00:01:29.250> talking<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.729> keyboard<00:01:30.179> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
we're talking about a keyboard that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.359 
we're talking about a keyboard that
costs<00:01:30.479> more<00:01:30.840> than<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.080> hundred<00:01:31.289> dollars<00:01:31.710> so

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
costs more than a hundred dollars so

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.889 
costs more than a hundred dollars so
it's<00:01:32.520> only<00:01:32.610> normal<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.270> expect<00:01:33.600> more

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
it's only normal to expect more

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.149 
it's only normal to expect more

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.180 
though the noisiness of the keys did not
affect<00:01:48.630> performance<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.380> figured<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.979> sound

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
affect performance I figured the sound

00:01:50.190 --> 00:02:02.670 
affect performance I figured the sound
