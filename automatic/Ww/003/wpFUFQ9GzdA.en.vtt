00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.779
 Hello, how are you? 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.180
 super good thing this time we 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.510
 I bring another one of the orders that I 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.450
 did you do some decoration for 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.460
 can give away on these dates or when or 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.590
 when you want I have chosen in this 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.470
 occasion show how to make a mini 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.850
 cupcake that is super super simple already 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.699
 you are going to see it has nothing of 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.769
 complication and good inside you can 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.840
 save what you want to give to the 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.640
 another person I will teach you to 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.309
 do it and for that we're going to start 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.920
 first of all with the materials what 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.770
 what are you going to need are some chuches 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.170
 jelly beans whatever you like and then 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.329
 some noodles these are edible that already 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.030
 they use them we will use them for the 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.450
 decorating this container I got it 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.170
 in kfc is where he puts us in the ice cube 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.239
 a little ball scissors something decoration 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.219
 glazes or you can also use 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.949
 painting but I did not have at home and more 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.850
 you bathe and a bow a letter and the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.020
 silicone pistolite 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.200
 next we are going to paint our 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.049
 our parts of the container and I have 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.150
 decided then the upper part that is 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.850
 brown color and the bottom that is 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.799
 Rosita but the colors, you can 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.330
 change and use the ones you like most 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:28.180
 with our silicone gun we are going to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.430
 we are going to paste in the east part of the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.700
 ball but you can also use 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.220
 glue of the type you want while 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.410
 paste is enough 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.650
 Then the next thing we're going to do is 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:46.540
 catch one in a transparent glaze and 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.370
 let's make small circles or 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.490
 little spots with him to be able 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.890
 paste the colored noodles 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.259
 and well we have to put them all 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.630
 the top to give the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.970
 feeling that it's a sweet and 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.289
 also then it gives the touch so very nice 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.660
 and I think it's what he calls the most 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:15.730
 final attention of this cupcake 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.730
 and so on all the surface 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.939
 but it is very important that you have to 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.730
 keep in mind that if we do not look 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:30.290
 the videos are going to fall then I'll 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.599
 what I did is after I finished having 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.260
 the result that I liked with the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.120
 videos I started to put enamel 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.670
 transparent above them to 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.670
 that will look good and not fall 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.050
 and good I'm taking the works 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.900
 because I dropped a lot and they 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.020
 I use again and nothing there I am 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.460
 showing then that as how do I put a 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.070
 little bit above enamel 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.880
 transparent nothing a little touches and 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.280
 already fixed it does not need either to be 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.400
 barbarian amounts a little bit is 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.380
 enough as you see with materials that 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.160
 we have at home we can form new 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.020
 things and recycle and make a gift 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.820
 special to another person with our 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.020
 own hands we do not need to go to 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.060
 buy many things I have decided to 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.450
 last hour put a little bit of felt 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.610
 at the bottom as you see 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.910
 simply cropped and put without gluing 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.300
 and without anything as well as protection between what 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.000
 what is the package and the jelly beans that I have 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.560
 put and nothing you can put what 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.740
 you want inside I have chosen to put 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.740
 jelly beans candies and the card 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.160
 finally also cross a few lacasitos 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.450
 super super tiny so they decorate 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.450
 even more and it's already your cupcake 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.070
 then once we have it 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.890
 done let's put a little bow so that 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.950
 fix better but if you want to close it 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.220
 with fix or zeal or whatever you want too 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.890
 it is valid of course 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.030
 I have chosen this pink bow with 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:31.210
 little dots and I think that in the end 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.640
 pretty nice put but that's the color 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.870
 Well, I did not choose a bit, combining 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.870
 the colors that you have put 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:45.949
 and we bathed her a little bit and lacito 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.229
 As you can see there is a lovely cupcake left to me 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.120
 I love oats is giving it away 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.509
 because it is previous if you want to stay 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.150
 and nothing here I show you finally 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.689
 how has the result been for all 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.599
 the cupcake parties and I hope that you 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:06.349
 like it and that you put it into practice and I 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:08.360
 you will tell if you do anything girls 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.150
 thank you very much for being there and guys 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.740
 I also send you a strong kiss and we 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.740
 we see in the next video chao
