00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.120
 I don't believe I'm here again. 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.560
 I'd rather recommend SuperCsubis leather jackets. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.000
 You may need help. 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.640
 Let's go! 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.360
 Come on! 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.360
 Come on! 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.780
 Dominic! 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.000
 I'm not well. It's not nothing ... 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.260
 Braaaiiins ... 

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:33.468
 What was that? Did you see that too? 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.200
 * Screams * 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.300
 Jesus! 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 Well, how did that get in my face ?! 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.560
 This is here, King Jen, king of the animals. 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.180
 So what is this wild animal called? 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.320
 Black Papa! 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.840
 'Blow, buddy? 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.560
 Let me congratulate you! You're still alive. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.280
 Most are not grateful ... for their lives. 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.400
 But you will be ... from today! 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.380
 Hi! 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.040
 Haaallóóóó? 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.300
 * Stumbles * 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940
 That you didn't bring me a cookie 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.000
 the jerk 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.080
 thirsty thing! 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.460
 Curse! Curse! The window glass is so dirty that I can't see anything! 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.680
 No problem! Here we come! 2x 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.540
 Excuse me, do you have a few minutes to talk about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ? 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.500
 Dawn. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.293
 I get out of bed. 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.180
 My friend is waiting for me! 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.560
 Now you die, you bio-beast! 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.680
 He's a Teddy Bear! Freddy the Teddy Bear! 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.700
 Are you ready? 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.380
 Well then 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.660
 MEHEEEEEEEEE-- 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.100
 Do you want sugar? 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.700
 Ankhesenamun ?? 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.000
 In winter and summer, 

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:13.001
 in the snow and mud, 

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.573
 hero teddy boldly 

00:02:14.573 --> 00:02:16.033
 it is a good thing. 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.660
 I KILL YOU! 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.920
 Niko said you could get some good drugs. 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.234
 This is bullshit! 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.660
 So! What the fuck? 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.440
 Hey! 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.900
 - I'm not here. - We?! 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.480
 Kibaszdmeg! 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.200
 IIIj! 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.540
 It makes no sense. 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.800
 Heee-hehe! 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.220
 What is love? 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.380
 Baby, don't hurt me, 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.600
 don't hurt me, 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.754
 no more! 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.040
 You geccchih !!! 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.020
 I brought grass! 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.600
 Well ... 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.100
 Hm ... 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.420
 I didn't think guards would be here. 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.880
 They cut the topic. 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.180
 So that's it? 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.620
 Was this the plan ?? 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.660
 And now? 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.340
 I didn't think he'd be a guard at the back entrance. 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.949
 This is an unknown unknown! 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.394
 Well, this was a bad plan ... 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.820
 Mission failed! 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.080
 You didn't disappoint. 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.009
 Five people died of you. 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.740
 I'm not even such a heart-- 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.349
 RETURN FROM UTAM !! 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.040
 This is the one who starts with me! 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.140
 AND HEAD FOR THE BARRICADE !! 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.640
 FIGHT! 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.940
 FIGHT! 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.780
 * * Ráreagál 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.040
 Come here, little boy! Come here to Dad! 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.500
 Hey, you fucker! 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.880
 Don't have an Aspirin? 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.980
 Fucking my head all day long! 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.680
 - Listen, syntax? - Ebtelep, yes. 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.980
 Here's a great brown dog! 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.420
 He's in the offensive position! 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.660
 Hey, you fucker! 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.962
 I know, Aspirin! 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.140
 Hallo? Hey, you dickhead! 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.140
 God pull the lousy, ragged, fucking FUCK !!!! 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.860
 I have a question: 

00:04:22.914 --> 00:04:24.714
 do you tell me, why are you dice-headed? 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.900
 HE ?! 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.380
 The fuck! Everybody here is such a big dick ?! 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.060
 I ain't afraid of no ghosts! 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.580
 I ain't afraid of no ghosts! 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.260
