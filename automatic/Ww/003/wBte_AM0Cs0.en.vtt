00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.679 
Denova keep up you can't see very well I
plug<00:02:01.270> up<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.630> camera<00:02:02.079> high<00:02:02.200> enough<00:02:02.439> up<00:02:02.619> but

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
plug up the camera high enough up but

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.060 
plug up the camera high enough up but
it's<00:02:04.689> definitely<00:02:04.869> got<00:02:05.170> some<00:02:05.200> nose-heavy<00:02:05.740> but

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
it's definitely got some nose-heavy but

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.729 
it's definitely got some nose-heavy but
I<00:02:06.130> do<00:02:06.189> have<00:02:06.460> eight<00:02:07.240> or<00:02:07.659> nine<00:02:07.930> extra<00:02:08.289> ounces<00:02:08.649> of

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
I do have eight or nine extra ounces of

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.759 
I do have eight or nine extra ounces of
weight<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.069> there<00:02:10.080> had<00:02:11.080> an<00:02:11.200> interesting<00:02:11.410> take

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
weight in there had an interesting take

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.640 
weight in there had an interesting take
on<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.849> touching<00:02:13.180> go<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:15.250> doing<00:02:15.459> good

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
on the touching go but it's doing good

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.339 
on the touching go but it's doing good
so<00:02:17.650> far<00:02:17.680> feels<00:02:18.190> good<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.870> bringing<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.319> a

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
so far feels good it's bringing for a

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.990 
so far feels good it's bringing for a
quick<00:02:20.560> landing<00:02:20.980> make<00:02:21.190> sure<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.550> control

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
quick landing make sure that control

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.750 
quick landing make sure that control
surfaces<00:02:22.480> are<00:02:22.540> still<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.769> line<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.640> they

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
surfaces are still a line like they

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.030 
surfaces are still a line like they
should<00:02:24.970> be<00:02:25.000> make<00:02:25.870> sure<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.440> electronics

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
should be make sure that the electronics

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.250 
should be make sure that the electronics
are<00:02:27.160> overheating<00:02:27.750> another<00:02:28.750> ounce<00:02:28.900> out<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
are overheating another ounce out of the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:38.330 
are overheating another ounce out of the
nose<00:02:29.440> weight

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.839 

right<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.300> Flies

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.100 

it's<00:02:42.849> actually<00:02:43.150> pretty<00:02:43.299> warm<00:02:43.510> considering

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
it's actually pretty warm considering

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.420 
it's actually pretty warm considering
how<00:02:44.170> cold<00:02:44.439> it<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.890> means<00:02:45.010> we're<00:02:45.220> probably

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
how cold it is that means we're probably

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.589 
how cold it is that means we're probably
draw<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> lot<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.000> power<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:48.269> kind<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.329> dope<00:02:49.450> cut

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
draw a lot of power and kind of dope cut

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.949 
draw a lot of power and kind of dope cut
my<00:02:49.720> face<00:02:49.900> off<00:02:50.519> yeah<00:02:51.519> I<00:02:51.819> kissed<00:02:52.420> some<00:02:52.599> motors<00:02:52.840> to

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
my face off yeah I kissed some motors to

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.110 
my face off yeah I kissed some motors to
give<00:02:53.079> a<00:02:53.110> good<00:02:53.290> luck<00:02:53.439> but<00:02:53.829> a<00:02:53.860> motor<00:02:54.730> feels<00:02:54.939> nice

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
give a good luck but a motor feels nice

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.470 
give a good luck but a motor feels nice
and<00:02:55.329> uh<00:02:55.420> nice<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.019> cool<00:02:56.640> motor<00:02:57.640> bolts<00:02:58.120> motor

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
and uh nice and cool motor bolts motor

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.250 
and uh nice and cool motor bolts motor
mounts<00:02:58.840> are<00:02:58.959> all<00:02:59.019> nice<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.439> the<00:02:59.560> solid<00:03:00.069> still

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
mounts are all nice in the solid still

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.500 
mounts are all nice in the solid still
and<00:03:02.260> let's<00:03:02.920> feel<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.129> battery<00:03:03.489> yeah<00:03:03.849> I'm<00:03:04.359> sure

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
and let's feel the battery yeah I'm sure

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.179 
and let's feel the battery yeah I'm sure
the<00:03:04.599> battery<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:04.900> fine<00:03:05.109> but<00:03:05.349> that<00:03:05.859> definitely

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
the battery is fine but that definitely

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.440 
the battery is fine but that definitely
means<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.609> drawing<00:03:06.849> quite<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.090> few<00:03:07.239> amps

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
means it's drawing quite a few amps

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.970 
means it's drawing quite a few amps
because<00:03:07.659> if<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.049> getting<00:03:08.170> warm<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.769> it's

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
because if it's getting warm and it's

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.520 
because if it's getting warm and it's
this<00:03:09.700> cold<00:03:10.000> outside<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.720> might<00:03:11.200> need<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.349> get<00:03:11.470> a

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
this cold outside I might need to get a

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.470 
this cold outside I might need to get a
bigger<00:03:11.709> ESC<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.519> is<00:03:12.700> pulling<00:03:13.030> probably<00:03:13.269> 30

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
bigger ESC this is pulling probably 30

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.930 
bigger ESC this is pulling probably 30
amps<00:03:13.780> at<00:03:13.900> full<00:03:14.049> throttle<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:14.849> something<00:03:15.849> to

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
amps at full throttle so something to

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.910 
amps at full throttle so something to
consider<00:03:16.180> for<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.870> power<00:03:17.079> consumption<00:03:17.560> but

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
consider for the power consumption but

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.369 
consider for the power consumption but
that<00:03:18.849> was<00:03:18.940> an<00:03:19.000> awesome<00:03:19.180> flight<00:03:19.629> it<00:03:19.900> had<00:03:20.079> a<00:03:20.109> lot

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
that was an awesome flight it had a lot

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.470 
that was an awesome flight it had a lot
of<00:03:20.409> notes<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.980> was<00:03:21.099> -<00:03:21.220> nose<00:03:21.400> heavy<00:03:21.639> but<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.329> did

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
of notes it was - nose heavy but I did

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.270 
of notes it was - nose heavy but I did
add<00:03:22.629> 9<00:03:23.139> ounces<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.769> front<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.099> I<00:03:24.129> should

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
add 9 ounces to the front so I should

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.920 
add 9 ounces to the front so I should
take<00:03:24.370> more<00:03:24.579> out<00:03:24.639> and<00:03:24.760> that's<00:03:25.629> actually<00:03:25.780> really

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
take more out and that's actually really

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.509 
take more out and that's actually really
good<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.379> so<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> better<00:03:26.920> than<00:03:27.069> I<00:03:27.099> thought<00:03:27.310> but<00:03:27.459> I

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
good it so a better than I thought but I

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.559 
good it so a better than I thought but I
always<00:03:27.639> like<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.819> go<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.000> little<00:03:28.120> nose<00:03:28.359> heavy

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
always like to go a little nose heavy

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.780 
always like to go a little nose heavy
just<00:03:28.810> in<00:03:28.930> case<00:03:29.109> so<00:03:29.889> let<00:03:30.099> me<00:03:30.159> take<00:03:30.280> an<00:03:30.400> ounce<00:03:30.519> out

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
just in case so let me take an ounce out

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.240 
just in case so let me take an ounce out
flat<00:03:31.659> around<00:03:31.900> some<00:03:32.049> more<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.409> there<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.129> go
