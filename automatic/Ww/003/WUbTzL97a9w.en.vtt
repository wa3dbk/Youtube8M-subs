00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.440
 good afternoon I am 13 years old hiding in 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.589
 the country is about 2 years old 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:13.769
 Attention 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.819
 first need to be respected 

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:17.689
 safety engineering 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.720
 remember glass vario plus is 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.059
 control windows 

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:22.619
 electric shock 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.779
 tension will go today 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.419
 so when working with glass is necessary 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.619
 observe all precautions as 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.300
 when working with high voltage 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.570
 equipment without the need for 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.949
 leave the glass with the voltage applied 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.130
 until glass is installed 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.180
 turn off running transformers 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.940
 controller when they don't use 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.550
 if you are not sure that you can contact com 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.710
 don't take the risk 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.970
 entrust installation to professionals 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.530
 glass bar survey is glass 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.560
 manufactured using 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.620
 smartphone technology what in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.639
 translate means 

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:57.900
 truly 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.980
 and indeed glass currency will be able to 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.870
 change its characteristics 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.790
 user wishes for 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.570
 application lists number only 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.480
 active convention 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.790
 glass bar survey 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.790
 this but dignity 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.900
 outer layers are high quality 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.700
 glass and inside soldered actively 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.890
 today he has 4 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.540
 thanks to the forming film 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.540
 glass is very hard once 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.719
 on this map the news of this case than 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.810
 usually the car's windshield 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.329
 thanks to internally optimus glass layer 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.470
 acquires unique 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.240
 specifications 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.189
 now a little more in detail and the very 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.040
 technology actively conditions 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.270
 many call this technology the electorate 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.770
 term 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.000
 this is not true 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.030
 electronic glass has long been known 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.080
 Igor using a car is not 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.170
 suitable for many reasons ranging from 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.960
 state change time 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.750
 it can take minutes 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.310
 and ending the reason of such he is 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.790
 another year 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.890
 american company 20 percent 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.080
 apply means of hobby technology 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.110
 within 75 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 and without 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.349
 This is essentially an approximate calculation of how 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.089
 historical device on behalf of 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.089
 glass years 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.129
 the glass of the chamber is very easy to distinguish from 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.519
 all other unprofitable condition 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.109
 there is when the glass is not served 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.629
 voltage and we have 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.389
 matt 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.389
 or mighty 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.649
 when voltage is applied, the glass becomes 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.099
 transparent or completely transparent 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.200
 changing the level of transparency can 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.790
 cannabinoid occur so 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.399
 smoothly 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.859
 it all depends on the desire of the user 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.509
 since the level of light transmission 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.429
 depends on the voltage applied 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.959
 Of course, you can fix any 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.869
 without intermediate themselves 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.869
 it's warm here 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.129
 already more perfect glass it 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.869
 device creating mid example 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.329
 nanoparticles 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.290
 technology is quite a lot and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.829
 has not yet reached such a wide 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.109
 range by changing the light transmission 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.549
 glasses using cng 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.499
 technology 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:12.929
 but now you can successfully apply 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:14.279
 on transport 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.029
 product line cook plus 50 rubles 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.459
 bears the name skype 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.939
 power cubes 1000 that is, it is not served 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.269
 voltage it becomes 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.799
 as opaque as possible 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.779
 change glass when voltage is applied 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.790
 the level of its light transmission and 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.469
 this is the case when exactly as the plan 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:34.869
 and naturally you can fix any 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.519
 if the transparency level by 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.759
 to the user's wish 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.479
 now let's see the glass 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.579
 fighting tents 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.169
 and before us is the glass chamber to come the river 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.169
 light transmission of 60 to ten percent 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.529
 P 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.239
 and glass scanner respectively 53 1 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.309
 percent 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.139
 together with the change in transparency 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.099
 ability also changes 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.039
 transmit infrared rays 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.500
 less transparent 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.210
 who better protects the glass interior 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.050
 car from heating it with solar 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.909
 rays 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.909
 the message hot sunny 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.030
 the best results for this indicator 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.030
 glasshouse name reuters 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.659
 now see a smooth change 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.480
 light transmission 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.870
 first reached 2 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.990
 glass chambers consumes up to 16 ipad per 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.949
 square meter 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.490
 consumption depends on the degree 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.849
 transparency 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.459
 maximum consumption measure 

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:42.159
 never glass as much as possible 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.259
 transparent 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.689
 fixed arbitrary 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.689
 light transmittance 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.120
 let's see how poems work barrier 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.919
 cooking just melts more economical than 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:04:59.919
 Pavla 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.379
 and consumes up to five 20 per square meter 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.469
 sat down 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.229
 consumption also depends on the degree 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.039
 plan transparency 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.749
 and the more transparency those 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.749
 more consumption 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.240
 we fix intermediate 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 condition 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.050
 glass bar managed not only regulate 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.639
 light transmittance level and 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.249
 infrared radiation 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:25.729
 but also completely block 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.729
 ultraviolet radiation 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.839
 glass is thicker due to its construction 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.039
 harder than usual 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.860
 glass thickness depends on it 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.630
 brought 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.750
 the greater the curvature of today is greater 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.389
 equipped with glass 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.680
 deluxe glass is thick 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.680
 from five days 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.009
 no heat also depends on it 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.169
 thickness 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.569
 Should be guided canopy 13 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:00.849

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.310
 with heat barrier plus wards 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.310
 search installed in the car 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.160
 controlled by 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
 specialized control 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:17.119
 control tasks take command 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:19.229
 enjoy converted 12 field 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:20.619
 because car systems in 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:23.520
 network management solution requirements 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.370
 by its design of control it 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.669
 driven transformation 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.379

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.120
 place 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.139
 so in each of these companies 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.139
 that you will agree very much 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.900
 should pay attention that 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.620
 the controller comes without 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.490
 control elements 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.340
 all controls such as 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.729
 could with balance and only wireless solutions 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.449
 must be chosen for a specific 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.469
 car interior and customer requirements 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.289
 Bryansk control control course 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.879
 various combinations can be applied 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.849
 buttons and the remainder or us wireless 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.909
 systems on the radio or and in vain he 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:02.649
 there is a possibility 

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:05.559
 Connection control in point is good 

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:08.499
 car if required 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.189
 to install a set of glasses 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:12.599
 need to replace the original glass 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:13.530
 the car 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.889
 boil on the glass plus install and 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:18.729
 connect control then there are about three years 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.460
 with a job to handle a couple 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.030
 literacy protest 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.529
 according to experts 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:25.470
 also in warm control 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.020
 come with a Russian-speaking 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.080
 documentation 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.080
 learn more about the installation process 

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:34.749
 be careful when installing 

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:36.189
 double glazing 

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:38.599
 95 percent of all glass failures and 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.009
 equipment 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:41.960
 with non-professional som 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.620
 find the nearest installers and 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.690
 detailed information on the timing is available on 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.139
 project site type of flu 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:50.509
 place got 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:53.509
 several color solutions are available 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.580
 gutters 

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:07.089
 like that 

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:11.240
 percent 

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.140
