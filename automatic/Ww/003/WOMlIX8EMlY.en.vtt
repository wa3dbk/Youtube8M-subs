00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 to keep winning and winning to visit or 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.769
 start to win revisit and follow 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.570
 winning from crazy 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.530
 we are sure that san martín is going to 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:19.460
 do all the 100% points 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.410
 us to get closer and get to 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.710
 last game with chances both of power 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.570
 fight the title 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.839
 it's a teacher party about to 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.839
 break 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 but if we interpret it to that way we 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.309
 we would cheat everyone as we thought 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.840
 everything that we would have won her 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.510
 closer and twisting we know that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.200
 we have possibilities even more being the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.180
 site 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.950
 neither does this guarantee you much because 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.970
 the games have to be played there has been 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.190
 surprises 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.769
 and the different games of 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.809
 from this group and from here to the end sure 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.579
 there will continue to be a surprise this 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.710
 time the possibility that they are in a 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.809
 goal of the opponent and also fits the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.150
 possibility that is not linked to a 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.970
 goal of the team was thrashed work 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.770
 work 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.740
 in the end we have three archers 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.290
 and always Oscar is rotating them to 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.510
 finish the lime trainings like this 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.890
 no idea I had read 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.360
 I had for six weeks still not 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.940
 have been fulfilled but nobody has the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.290
 need for the expulsion of beautiful 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.600
 to put someone with more experience 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.810
 but it is already franco decision of the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.810
 people 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.940
 overtake nothing in ending up with a slap 12 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.540
 luckily today we have them operative 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.410
 even but we're also going let's see 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.410
 how we close the week 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.650
 it could be a bad result always and 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.940
 when you are 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.540
 always when you lose sanmartín 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.220
 but we won from home against san martín 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.220
 with three points less us with better 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.440
 difference of goal I do not discard anything 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.840
 a lot has to do not only in our 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.420
 game but also the results the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.940
 rivals of san martin we do not know what 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.430
 can move from here to the end of the tournament 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.500
 as tc we are still four or five 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.400
 teams that have a chance to fight is 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.400
 a hard knock 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.970
 yes because always a defeat is a bath 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.100
 of humility allows you to work from 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.770
 another perspective 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.390
 annoying like that because if he had won 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.360
 as I said at the time did not win a 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.670
 huancayo but the first to recognize 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.460
 that I deserved a rival that generated you 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.400
 little bit 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.010
 that we had several arrivals as for 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.660
 define not concrete are learnings 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.930
 today we are still a team of 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.850
 information and as such we assimilate in the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.070
 hit everything was on how you replenish and 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.910
 not so much in substantiating what you 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.500
 happened on how to make this this 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.500
 group again be back 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.350
 distracted but somewhat inaccurate in the 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.610
 moment of explanation but also 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.520
 much has to the subject of the court 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.690
 let's see a video about that 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:26.750
 distracts a bit to sleep but two 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.550
 Months sorry this but already tomorrow too 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.650
 How good to pass these details 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.380
 screaming trainings from outside 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.810
 the parties is complicated 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.570
 I can correct but it 's part of the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.750
 learning I already what we have lived in 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.120
 past dates for me 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.800
 back today is the day by day and as such 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.510
 one tries to correct to follow 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.500
 adding things and being able to continue 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.020
 being it 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.640
 on that side we seek the indications 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.950
 because what has been the team of 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.740
 the truth is not satisfied but I know 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.260
 that already today that is not enough we have seen or 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.050
 If I do not know if you have more 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.520
 time living here I do not know how many times 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.320
 he needs to come and has played 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.590
 practically with the car 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.030
 first the first quarter of the court and 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.520
 That is the merit of what is still the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.680
 team but neither can we stay 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.019
 in that consolation of fools because we do not 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.530
 it also cost us the first 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.530
 defeat at home 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.310
 we had more than we played maybe 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.669
 we had more control than I had 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.120
 seen this live already in the video you see 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.490
 that we had perhaps more control of the 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.770
 two parties that generate more than what 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.270
 I had thought but we are missing those 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.100
 details 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.230
 at three and a half months as I said in 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.470
 some time you will not perceive insurance 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:55.030
 about six eight months that we have more 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.030
 variants to solve
