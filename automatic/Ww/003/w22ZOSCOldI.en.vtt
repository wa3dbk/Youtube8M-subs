00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.890
 women new video on fifa ultimate 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.830
 team 13 to make money 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.940
 a little trick to make money 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.230
 I will also show you the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.789
 teams that I have now set up 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.699
 and I will open live three packs 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.279
 together then first thing is a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.570
 way to make money easily 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.390
 in fifa ultimate team it works 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.029
 only at the beginning you will see that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.719
 it's a lot more complicated by the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.770
 next I told you about the sahel as 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.770
 you see I have a lot of players who 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.309
 no longer have a contract and that's when 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.280
 even the players on my team 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.180
 main which you take life members 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.500
 and on the other hand I do not want 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.309
 to buy contract cards that will the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.170
 150 or 200 to the unit it would cost me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.770
 relatively expensive gold the swiss I 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.469
 can you propose 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.670
 is that you have in the shop 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.920
 you take a bronze package in 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.199
 bronze costs 400 but you will not have 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.449
 all the shots were good shots 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.760
 obligatorily at least two cards of 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.949
 firm contract instead of paying 150 to 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.770
 auction so if I have at least two 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.450
 it would be 300 there the pack you 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.400
 go see you at least two cards from 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.900
 contract that you can either use 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.159
 for you on resales so you 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.950
 already know that you have to make 300 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.229
 on the package and after you will remain ten 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.210
 cards that on average even if you 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.939
 sell everything at 150 even it takes time 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.119
 will make you at least 1500 recreated on 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.000
 a pack at 400 if they really do not have 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.259
 of luck you can be made go 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.509
 easy between 1000 and 1200 if you sell 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.040
 the contract cards if you look at them 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.479
 contract cards could you do 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.680
 practically double in just 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.860
 to be a little patient you put some 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.850
 auction cards for one hour 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.369
 me for example I really have nothing 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.049
 I sold everything and I'm really 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.009
 small cards which is mailleront 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.880
 true it's really me I'm on 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.049
 I know jersey there but is still 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.470
 someone on the other end of the planet 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.740
 who will put the 150 and who you 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.750
 will make your pack more profitable 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.670
 last thing so in my team 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.719
 active but it's my team bronze 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.530
 of origin not that they lack 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.869
 contract I also created finally I 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.200
 always my little korean team 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.209
 but my team has me in Korea with 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.720
 the sense of understanding and I managed to make 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.140
 finally I finished for the moment my 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.160
 team 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.500
 now I have a team with 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.510
 players not necessarily with a super 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:34.019
 note but it's only super players 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:38.879
 fast 87 French 74 76 83 before 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:41.670
 Jesus 88 91 to 88 to know that I have 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.860
 turned around the thirty thousand fifa 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.080
 credit only by doing business 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.879
 by buying interesting cards not 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.769
 expensive in reselling them more expensive you 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.569
 will give two frank tips on two 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:58.830
 cards that are not bad 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:03:00.750
 money back to the compact package 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.970
 bronze cast 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.420
 I 'm coming live news I'm from 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.610
 anyway I need them I have 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.599
 need to buy me back credits 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.090
 so here I know that I will always have 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.959
 bad quality cards but hey I 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.430
 need of descartes will therefore count at 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.680
 you as you can see I got 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.989
 a compliant 4 plus will therefore necessarily 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.909
 embarrassment and well profitable map 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.670
 from bread and then after small logos 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:33.060
 you will see that it necessarily 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:35.670
 the players put at 150-200 his share in 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.099
 general there I have everything stored in the top 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.489
 May 2 spent later on the pile of 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:47.390
 changes shows any kind open the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.390
 second to make it twice feet 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.730
 in addition here you go a little luck 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.549
 I keep a black boys card 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.489
 exists what did I have 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.840
 so this is a rare card on 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.510
 will count so I was lucky enough to be 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.379
 immediately after that there will not be 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.580
 jersey logos yes it's a 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.659
 little logo of the little cards 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.769
 will always sell so even if you 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.930
 count 150 150 150 out of 10 because what 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.859
 looking at both contracts to make 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.320
 one thousand five hundred on a paper I you 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.910
 give game open when I'm there we go 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.940
 do this together 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.350
 I opened a gold package at the same time 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.400
 a general 7500 package I rarely open 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.889
 packages because I try first 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.030
 to build my original team 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.430
 but as my team is not 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.199
 relatively complete for the moment there 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.050
 I really expected to have a lot 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.759
 money aside to strengthen with 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.540
 quality players to players who 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.919
 worth 20 to 30 or even 40 thousand men 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.509
 fadi which I opened live solution 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.610
 I do not expect much but good 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.199
 with you because yesterday and videos that I have 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.669
 to have a lot of luck we know 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.130
 never yes because I have today 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:07.470
 it's to tell you it's really con 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:09.090
 10am and that's it for example everything to 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.330
 the hour I was talking to you to revise a 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.430
 package to bron it was easy there for 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.860
 profitability 7500 is what I have 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.690
 cedh is relatively impossible so 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.880
 the trick we can do it with a package 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.949
 bronze because it's the cards we 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.280
 always happen to have a 100 150 but 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.400
 there if I sell them even 300 pieces 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.169
 each map on 12 47 and 3600 and at 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.050
 levis not the 1500 must really have 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.870
 a good map to make the 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.270
 port packets after that's true 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.650
 will end it and then the fun of it 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.370
 it's opening packages and trying 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.199
 having 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.030
 interesting map but technically and 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:52.669
 financially it's not at all 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:56.520
 profitable to do his actions 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.560
 so I personally did it 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.699
 Once I do a lot of business is 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.740
 a lot like the stock market I bought from 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.120
 Cheap players I will watch for the 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.100
 good deal and I will resell more 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.919
 expensive to know if you want the 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.850
 cards are selling fast 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.250
 for example when you do your 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.440
 business to buy cards who who 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.090
 have a very high speed 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.220
 me for example the business that I do 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.389
 currently i will give you little ones 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.220
 secrets for the moment 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.410
 anyway I have more credit for 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.199
 to be able to do it you still need a 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.020
 little money count ten thousand with 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.970
 10000 purchasing cards 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.680
 I do the trick on the map 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.289
 aubameyang on attack take 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.830
 saint-etienne how fast do we 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.300
 will not make head of 94 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.789
 I can buy it around 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:46.080
 3000 3500 and I will put it in 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.770
 flesh and in direct purchase to 1000 more 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.479
 at least 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.639
 you're going to tell me it's not huge but 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.610
 it but if you hear from three by 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.470
 day without playing it's still 3000 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.979
 to win the second card with 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:02.190
 which I do the trick is good 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:04.289
 viany so you're looking for the ranks md 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.419
 put the right to parma 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:09.240
 so yes the 96th speed is a pie 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.979
 and at age 77 general note him with 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.190
 a lot of luck to have it around 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:15.710
 2500 ha in the worst case 3000 and that's 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.960
 a card that could easily sell 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.460
 3900 to 4000 live auction 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.340
 it's so really you want them 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:26.160
 sell quickly, do not hesitate to 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.750
 leave comments there are some 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.660
 little suggestions near video that's my

 first videos on fifa ultimate team 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.300
 is in general so I know I have to 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.699
 still improve myself to the general but 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.380
