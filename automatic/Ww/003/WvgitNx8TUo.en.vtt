00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
it for a very very long time and I would

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
it for a very very long time and I would

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
all the proof that I needed simply

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.200 
all the proof that I needed simply
because<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.979> had<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> presence<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:39.030> long

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
as I had the presence I had to prove to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.249 
as I had the presence I had to prove to
tell<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.939> he<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.270> real<00:01:42.479> because<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:43.020> course

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
like I said I had the presence so he had

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.999 
like I said I had the presence so he had
to<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.329> real<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.200> honest<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.500> never<00:01:46.560> had

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
to be real and to be honest I never had

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.350 
to be real and to be honest I never had
the<00:01:47.159> feeling<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.610> parents<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.180> buy
