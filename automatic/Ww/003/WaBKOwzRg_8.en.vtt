00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
every palate um I believe that it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.620 
every palate um I believe that it
depends<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.640> you're<00:00:29.789> looking<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
depends on what you're looking for and a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.870 
depends on what you're looking for and a
lot<00:00:30.929> depends<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.500> personal<00:00:31.830> preference<00:00:32.099> so

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
lot depends on personal preference so

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.450 
lot depends on personal preference so
just<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:33.870> i<00:00:34.020> don't<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.829> i<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:35.010> like

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
just because i don't like it i do like

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
just because i don't like it i do like
something<00:00:36.000> about<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.480> doesn't<00:00:36.870> mean<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> you

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
something about it doesn't mean that you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.750 
something about it doesn't mean that you
know<00:00:37.410> everyone<00:00:37.739> will<00:00:38.040> agree<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.399> me<00:00:38.579> but

so if you're gonna use a color like that
I<00:02:02.689> would<00:02:03.689> definitely<00:02:03.810> recommend<00:02:04.170> putting

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
I would definitely recommend putting

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.760 
I would definitely recommend putting
some<00:02:05.490> paper<00:02:06.360> underneath<00:02:06.719> or<00:02:07.229> something<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
some paper underneath or something to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.279 
some paper underneath or something to
catch<00:02:07.979> fallout<00:02:08.610> because

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
catch fallout because

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.920 
catch fallout because
it<00:02:09.409> gets<00:02:09.739> really<00:02:10.129> really<00:02:10.549> crazy<00:02:11.000> everywhere

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
it gets really really crazy everywhere

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.080 
it gets really really crazy everywhere
all<00:02:12.110> over<00:02:12.140> your<00:02:12.530> face<00:02:12.739> glittery<00:02:13.219> so<00:02:13.519> that's

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
all over your face glittery so that's

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.089 
all over your face glittery so that's
only<00:02:14.209> negative<00:02:14.629> thing<00:02:14.659> but<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.620> think<00:02:15.680> that's

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
only negative thing but I think that's

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.280 
only negative thing but I think that's
kind<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.420> cannibals<00:02:17.420> for<00:02:17.599> anything<00:02:17.870> glittery

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
kind of cannibals for anything glittery

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.160 
kind of cannibals for anything glittery

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:09.259 
wouldn't be grabbing for it all the time

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.499 
wouldn't be grabbing for it all the time
and<00:04:09.680> honestly<00:04:10.040> in<00:04:10.430> this<00:04:10.849> palette<00:04:11.269> if<00:04:11.389> I

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
and honestly in this palette if I

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.360 
and honestly in this palette if I
actually<00:04:11.689> was<00:04:12.169> to<00:04:12.319> use<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:12.949> I<00:04:13.009> really

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
actually was to use this and I really

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.909 
actually was to use this and I really
would<00:04:14.000> choose<00:04:14.359> my<00:04:14.569> favorite<00:04:14.959> colors<00:04:15.379> I<00:04:15.620> would

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
would choose my favorite colors I would

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.900 
would choose my favorite colors I would
have<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.220> say<00:04:16.250> I'd<00:04:16.699> go<00:04:16.940> with

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
have to say I'd go with

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.910 
have to say I'd go with
this<00:04:18.269> first<00:04:18.510> color<00:04:18.780> here<00:04:19.110> just<00:04:19.320> because<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.769> is

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
this first color here just because it is

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.050 
this first color here just because it is
a<00:04:19.950> nice<00:04:20.250> white<00:04:20.730> it<00:04:21.890> is<00:04:22.890> nice<00:04:23.220> white<00:04:23.580> highlight

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
a nice white it is nice white highlight

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.820 
a nice white it is nice white highlight
color<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.510> do<00:04:24.570> really<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.140> this<00:04:25.290> gold<00:04:25.590> color

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
color I do really like this gold color

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.890 
color I do really like this gold color
and<00:04:26.190> I'll<00:04:26.910> probably<00:04:27.150> use<00:04:27.360> some<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.810> these

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
and I'll probably use some of these

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.660 
and I'll probably use some of these
matte<00:04:28.170> colors<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.800> then<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:29.040> just<00:04:29.280> go<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
matte colors and then I just go to the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.640 
matte colors and then I just go to the
darker<00:04:30.000> colors<00:04:30.300> just<00:04:30.480> because<00:04:30.840> all<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.350> pinks

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
darker colors just because all the pinks

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.870 
darker colors just because all the pinks
I<00:04:31.770> would<00:04:32.010> probably<00:04:32.160> never<00:04:32.760> ever<00:04:33.060> touch<00:04:34.040> so<00:04:35.040> am

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
I would probably never ever touch so am

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.850 
I would probably never ever touch so am
I<00:04:36.210> really<00:04:36.570> noodles<00:04:36.900> not<00:04:37.050> liking<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.590> full

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
I really noodles not liking the full

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.770 
I really noodles not liking the full
palette<00:04:38.340> i<00:04:38.490> am<00:04:38.610> not<00:04:38.880> just<00:04:39.270> because<00:04:39.390> i'm<00:04:39.600> not<00:04:39.720> a

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
palette i am not just because i'm not a

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.450 
palette i am not just because i'm not a
fan<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.080> every<00:04:40.350> single<00:04:40.500> color<00:04:40.830> but<00:04:41.160> i<00:04:41.190> mean

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
fan of every single color but i mean

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.280 
fan of every single color but i mean
with<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.090> palette<00:04:42.480> that's<00:04:42.630> already<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:43.260> know

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
with the palette that's already you know

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.440 
with the palette that's already you know
the<00:04:43.860> colors<00:04:44.160> are<00:04:44.310> already<00:04:44.580> chosen<00:04:44.910> for<00:04:45.090> you

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
the colors are already chosen for you

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.980 
the colors are already chosen for you
you<00:04:46.140> obviously<00:04:46.770> won't<00:04:47.640> necessarily<00:04:48.390> like

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
you obviously won't necessarily like

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.080 
you obviously won't necessarily like
every<00:04:49.320> single<00:04:49.620> color<00:04:49.890> just<00:04:50.370> because<00:04:50.670> I<00:04:50.700> mean

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
every single color just because I mean

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.880 
every single color just because I mean
unless<00:04:52.050> you're<00:04:52.170> gonna<00:04:52.290> build<00:04:52.560> your<00:04:52.680> open

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
unless you're gonna build your open

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.980 
unless you're gonna build your open
palette<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.460> really<00:04:53.760> can't<00:04:54.180> like<00:04:54.570> every

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
palette you really can't like every

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.180 
palette you really can't like every
single<00:04:55.350> one<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.650> colors<00:04:55.830> on<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.160> palette

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
single one of the colors on the palette

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.700 
single one of the colors on the palette
so<00:04:56.940> out<00:04:57.120> of<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.330> 12<00:04:57.630> colors<00:04:58.110> I<00:04:58.290> would<00:04:58.440> have<00:04:58.560> to

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
so out of the 12 colors I would have to

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.110 
so out of the 12 colors I would have to
say<00:04:58.740> there<00:04:59.160> are<00:04:59.250> three<00:04:59.610> colors<00:04:59.970> that<00:05:00.060> I

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
say there are three colors that I

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.360 
say there are three colors that I
especially<00:05:00.390> would<00:05:00.810> never<00:05:01.080> touch<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:02.250> will

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
especially would never touch and it will

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.770 
especially would never touch and it will
probably<00:05:02.580> be<00:05:02.850> um<00:05:04.430> these<00:05:05.430> three<00:05:05.760> right<00:05:06.060> here<00:05:06.120> so

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
probably be um these three right here so

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.420 
probably be um these three right here so
the<00:05:07.110> second<00:05:07.470> third<00:05:07.620> one<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.010> then<00:05:08.160> this<00:05:08.370> one

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
the second third one and then this one

colors are beautiful pigmented but it

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.730

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.780 
you know exclusive new brand new colors
so<00:07:03.960> that's<00:07:04.230> why<00:07:04.410> I<00:07:04.440> want<00:07:04.680> to<00:07:04.770> get<00:07:05.040> it<00:07:05.190> and<00:07:05.340> I'm

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
so that's why I want to get it and I'm

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.940 
so that's why I want to get it and I'm
not<00:07:05.940> getting<00:07:06.240> the<00:07:06.330> palo<00:07:06.540> negative<00:07:07.110> review<00:07:07.620> um

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:07.950 
not getting the palo negative review um

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.550 
not getting the palo negative review um
because<00:07:08.790> I<00:07:08.850> mean<00:07:09.420> based<00:07:10.110> on<00:07:10.290> personal

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
because I mean based on personal

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.110 
because I mean based on personal
preference<00:07:10.800> it's<00:07:11.130> just<00:07:11.340> I<00:07:11.430> don't<00:07:11.520> like<00:07:11.850> pink

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
preference it's just I don't like pink

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.510 
preference it's just I don't like pink
and<00:07:12.300> but<00:07:13.050> I<00:07:13.200> just<00:07:13.530> think<00:07:13.650> that<00:07:14.010> if<00:07:14.220> you<00:07:14.340> like

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
and but I just think that if you like

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.300 
and but I just think that if you like
pink<00:07:14.870> my<00:07:15.870> cousin<00:07:16.410> Michelle<00:07:16.440> really<00:07:17.100> likes

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
pink my cousin Michelle really likes

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.770 
pink my cousin Michelle really likes
pink<00:07:17.550> and<00:07:17.730> she<00:07:17.850> thinks<00:07:18.060> all<00:07:18.240> the<00:07:18.360> closet<00:07:18.690> meet

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
pink and she thinks all the closet meet

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.060 
pink and she thinks all the closet meet
well<00:07:18.900> I<00:07:19.050> agree<00:07:19.260> all<00:07:19.440> the<00:07:19.650> colors<00:07:19.890> are

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
well I agree all the colors are

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.280 
well I agree all the colors are
definitely<00:07:20.520> beautiful<00:07:20.640> but<00:07:21.150> um<00:07:21.390> pink<00:07:22.020> is<00:07:22.080> just

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.290 
definitely beautiful but um pink is just

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.290 
definitely beautiful but um pink is just
not<00:07:22.770> the<00:07:23.130> greatest<00:07:23.340> color<00:07:23.700> on<00:07:23.850> me<00:07:23.970> too<00:07:24.150> because

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 
not the greatest color on me too because

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.090 
not the greatest color on me too because
I<00:07:24.480> think<00:07:24.660> it<00:07:24.780> washes<00:07:25.230> me<00:07:25.380> out<00:07:25.410> doesn't<00:07:25.860> give<00:07:25.980> me

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100 
I think it washes me out doesn't give me

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.150 
I think it washes me out doesn't give me
a<00:07:26.250> deep<00:07:27.000> bold<00:07:27.690> enough<00:07:28.110> I<00:07:28.380> shadow<00:07:28.740> although<00:07:29.130> I

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
a deep bold enough I shadow although I

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.480 
a deep bold enough I shadow although I
don't<00:07:29.250> bear<00:07:29.760> wear<00:07:30.210> dark<00:07:30.600> makeup<00:07:30.900> anyway<00:07:31.380> so

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.490 
don't bear wear dark makeup anyway so

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.100 
don't bear wear dark makeup anyway so
yeah<00:07:32.490> that's<00:07:32.700> pretty<00:07:32.910> much<00:07:33.150> it<00:07:33.270> i<00:07:33.540> hope<00:07:33.840> it<00:07:34.020> was

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
yeah that's pretty much it i hope it was

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.990 
yeah that's pretty much it i hope it was
helpful<00:07:34.140> it's<00:07:34.740> kind<00:07:34.920> of<00:07:34.980> hard<00:07:35.280> to<00:07:35.370> say<00:07:35.640> cuz<00:07:35.880> i

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 
helpful it's kind of hard to say cuz i

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.640 
helpful it's kind of hard to say cuz i
like<00:07:36.240> The<00:07:36.450> Naked<00:07:36.600> palette<00:07:36.750> in<00:07:37.110> general<00:07:37.530> it's

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650 
like The Naked palette in general it's

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.050 
like The Naked palette in general it's
just<00:07:37.830> the<00:07:38.130> colors<00:07:38.430> weren't<00:07:38.700> really<00:07:38.850> my<00:07:39.000> thing

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
just the colors weren't really my thing

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.030 
just the colors weren't really my thing
but<00:07:39.570> I<00:07:39.900> mean<00:07:40.290> I<00:07:40.320> knew<00:07:40.620> what<00:07:40.800> I<00:07:40.830> was<00:07:40.980> getting

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.040 
but I mean I knew what I was getting

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.680 
but I mean I knew what I was getting
into<00:07:41.340> when<00:07:41.550> i<00:07:41.700> purchased<00:07:41.940> the<00:07:42.210> naked<00:07:42.540> 3

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.690 
into when i purchased the naked 3

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.020 
into when i purchased the naked 3
because<00:07:42.900> it<00:07:43.020> was<00:07:43.170> rosy<00:07:43.590> tones<00:07:43.830> so<00:07:44.250> but<00:07:44.730> i<00:07:44.760> mean

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.030 
because it was rosy tones so but i mean

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.790 
because it was rosy tones so but i mean
i<00:07:45.240> think<00:07:45.480> i<00:07:45.960> would<00:07:46.020> recommend<00:07:46.560> it<00:07:46.680> if<00:07:46.770> you're

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800

repeating myself it's really hard to

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.640 
repeating myself it's really hard to
explain<00:07:50.460> how<00:07:50.760> I<00:07:50.820> feel<00:07:50.970> because<00:07:51.870> I<00:07:52.050> like<00:07:52.320> it<00:07:52.530> but
