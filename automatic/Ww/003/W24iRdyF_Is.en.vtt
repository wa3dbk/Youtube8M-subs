that's<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.450> switching<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.960> my<00:01:40.079> mega<00:01:40.320> form<00:01:40.619> yet

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
that's not switching to my mega form yet

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
that's not switching to my mega form yet
which<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:41.880> move<00:01:42.270> because<00:01:42.390> he<00:01:42.630> actually

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
which is a good move because he actually

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
which is a good move because he actually
goes<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> u-turn<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.369> i<00:01:44.460> switch<00:01:44.640> into

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
goes to the u-turn so if i switch into

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.969 
goes to the u-turn so if i switch into
my<00:01:45.000> megaphone<00:01:45.329> gardens<00:01:46.140> turns<00:01:46.380> into<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.649> part

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
my megaphone gardens turns into a part

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.590 
my megaphone gardens turns into a part
dark<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.090> turn<00:01:48.329> would<00:01:48.479> have

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
dark and that you turn would have

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 
dark and that you turn would have
completely<00:01:48.799> destroyed<00:01:49.799> garba<00:01:50.159> dose<00:01:50.310> right

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
completely destroyed garba dose right

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.880 
completely destroyed garba dose right
then<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.000> there<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.720> anyway<00:01:52.079> now<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.649> comes

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
which is hilarious because God was doing

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.840 
which is hilarious because God was doing
