you<00:01:57.710> can<00:01:57.980> see<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:59.560> spot<00:02:00.560> maybe<00:02:01.070> you'll<00:02:01.340> see<00:02:01.550> a

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
you can see a spot maybe you'll see a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.770 
you can see a spot maybe you'll see a
drip<00:02:01.940> if<00:02:02.510> I<00:02:02.600> wait<00:02:02.840> long<00:02:02.870> enough<00:02:04.510> well<00:02:05.510> anyway

drip if I wait long enough well anyway
that's<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.140> spot<00:02:07.300> take<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.330> look<00:02:08.600> under<00:02:08.899> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
that's the spot take a look under the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:19.410 
that's the spot take a look under the
car<00:02:09.290> and<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:16.820> see<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.060> lot<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.300> things<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.840> see

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
car and you see a lot of things you see

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.210 
car and you see a lot of things you see
fact<00:02:20.420> that

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
fact that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.110 
fact that
a<00:02:22.310> super<00:02:23.120> green<00:02:23.420> here

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
a super green here

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.300 
a super green here
but<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.750> really<00:02:26.170> don't<00:02:26.290> think<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.799> water<00:02:27.010> pump

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
but I really don't think the water pump

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.600 
but I really don't think the water pump
is<00:02:27.430> leaking<00:02:29.370> honestly

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.710 

come<00:02:34.210> over<00:02:34.390> here<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.960> see

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.690 

coolant<00:02:38.620> dripping<00:02:39.070> off<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.520> oil<00:02:40.290> pan

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.730 

and<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.270> try<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.540> spot<00:02:47.020> where<00:02:47.290> it's<00:02:47.470> coming

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
and you try to spot where it's coming

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.840 
and you try to spot where it's coming
from<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.800> only<00:02:50.980> thing<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.370> can<00:02:51.490> come<00:02:51.700> up

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
from and the only thing you can come up

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.580 
from and the only thing you can come up
with<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:54.250> gap<00:02:56.010> that's<00:02:57.010> between<00:02:57.400> the

engine and the transaxle it's coming
from<00:03:08.200> up<00:03:08.380> in<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:08.770> you<00:03:08.950> can<00:03:09.100> see<00:03:09.280> it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
from up in there you can see it

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.370 
from up in there you can see it

collecting on the bell housing and
dripping<00:03:17.709> off<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:20.050> also<00:03:20.200> drips<00:03:20.620> off<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.070> oil

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
dripping off it also drips off the oil

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.900 
dripping off it also drips off the oil
pan<00:03:22.170> there's<00:03:23.170> some<00:03:23.320> oil<00:03:23.500> leakage<00:03:24.010> as<00:03:24.190> well<00:03:24.430> you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
pan there's some oil leakage as well you

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.630 
pan there's some oil leakage as well you
can<00:03:25.060> see<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.269> drop<00:03:25.570> on<00:03:25.750> me<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.400> drain<00:03:27.790> plug
