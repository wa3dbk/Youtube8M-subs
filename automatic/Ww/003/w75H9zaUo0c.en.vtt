this<00:00:37.570> area<00:00:37.870> right<00:00:37.990> here<00:00:38.050> for<00:00:38.320> example<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.770> top

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
this area right here for example the top

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.620 
this area right here for example the top
of<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.100> double<00:00:39.250> stairs<00:00:39.610> and<00:00:39.910> then<00:00:40.240> going<00:00:40.480> down

of the double stairs and then going down

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.600 
of the double stairs and then going down
towards<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.080> rubble<00:00:41.380> it's<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.950> nice<00:00:42.130> area<00:00:42.460> I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
towards the rubble it's a nice area I

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.220 
towards the rubble it's a nice area I
step<00:00:42.970> out<00:00:43.090> towards<00:00:43.360> B<00:00:43.480> to<00:00:43.630> kill<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:43.930> guy<00:00:44.080> off

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
step out towards B to kill the guy off

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.750 
step out towards B to kill the guy off
but<00:00:44.410> I<00:00:44.440> don't<00:00:44.530> go<00:00:44.830> out<00:00:44.920> there<00:00:45.130> cuz<00:00:45.610> they're

found<00:00:46.030> in<00:00:46.150> areas<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.480> deathtrap<00:00:46.810> so<00:00:47.710> I<00:00:47.740> stay

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
found in areas a deathtrap so I stay

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.100 
found in areas a deathtrap so I stay
back<00:00:48.190> here<00:00:48.340> by<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.550> furniture<00:00:49.060> just<00:00:49.870> trying

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
back here by the furniture just trying

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.480 
back here by the furniture just trying
to<00:00:50.170> stick<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:50.440> all<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:50.710> shock<00:00:50.950> in<00:00:51.130> friendly

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
to stick to all the shock in friendly

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.370 
to stick to all the shock in friendly
areas<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.000> create<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.570> loop<00:00:52.780> that<00:00:52.960> I<00:00:53.050> can<00:00:53.200> run

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
areas and create a loop that I can run

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.140 
areas and create a loop that I can run
around<00:00:53.500> constantly<00:00:53.860> whilst<00:00:54.730> knowing<00:00:55.060> I'm

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
around constantly whilst knowing I'm

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150 
around constantly whilst knowing I'm
always<00:00:55.300> in<00:00:55.480> close<00:00:55.660> quarters<00:00:56.050> but<00:00:56.650> this<00:00:56.829> area

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
always in close quarters but this area

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.590 
always in close quarters but this area
is<00:00:57.310> kind<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.579> touch-and-go<00:00:57.880> it<00:00:58.180> depends<00:00:58.540> on

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
is kind of touch-and-go it depends on

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.360 
is kind of touch-and-go it depends on
how<00:00:58.750> populated<00:00:59.380> it<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.560> and<00:01:00.040> where<00:01:00.280> the

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
how populated it is and where the

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.310 
how populated it is and where the
enemies<00:01:00.640> come<00:01:00.850> from<00:01:01.149> in<00:01:01.360> ground<00:01:01.989> war<00:01:02.140> it's

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
enemies come from in ground war it's

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.780 
enemies come from in ground war it's
even<00:01:02.530> more<00:01:02.649> dangerous<00:01:02.890> and<00:01:03.340> it's<00:01:03.460> more<00:01:03.610> often

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
even more dangerous and it's more often

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.000 
even more dangerous and it's more often
the<00:01:03.880> knots<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.360> they'll<00:01:04.689> go<00:01:04.900> but<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:05.860> is

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
the knots and they'll go but this is

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.160 
the knots and they'll go but this is
only<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.220> 6v6<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:07.120> I<00:01:07.210> went<00:01:07.479> towards<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.840> flag

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
only a 6v6 and I went towards the a flag

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.050 
only a 6v6 and I went towards the a flag
again<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:09.010> clear<00:01:09.220> our<00:01:09.400> guy<00:01:09.580> who<00:01:09.640> was<00:01:09.820> coming

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060

again to clear our guy who was coming
from<00:01:10.150> there<00:01:10.360> but<00:01:11.080> it<00:01:11.350> is<00:01:11.530> taken<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.920> risk<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:12.310> I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
from there but it is taken a risk and I

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.130 
from there but it is taken a risk and I
backtrack<00:01:12.850> start<00:01:13.479> running<00:01:13.720> this<00:01:13.840> loop<00:01:14.020> again

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
backtrack start running this loop again

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.020 
backtrack start running this loop again
this<00:01:14.860> area<00:01:15.159> is<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.280> nice<00:01:15.430> place<00:01:15.670> going<00:01:15.909> out

with<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.770> suppressor<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.430> think<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.000> big<00:04:39.150> bomb

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300

is<00:04:39.420> a<00:04:39.510> little<00:04:39.750> beyond<00:04:40.020> my<00:04:40.290> reach<00:04:40.530> with<00:04:40.860> that
