hi<00:00:01.439> everyone<00:00:02.179> one<00:00:03.179> problem<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.720> see<00:00:03.750> that

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hi everyone one problem that I see that

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.460 
hi everyone one problem that I see that
a<00:00:04.049> lot<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.380> people<00:00:04.680> have<00:00:04.920> with<00:00:05.460> their<00:00:06.470> straps

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
a lot of people have with their straps

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.250 
a lot of people have with their straps
on<00:00:07.740> their<00:00:07.859> backpacks<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:09.540> once<00:00:10.019> they

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
on their backpacks is that once they

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.740 
on their backpacks is that once they
adjust<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.860> straps<00:00:11.219> they<00:00:12.059> leave<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> straps

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
adjust the straps they leave the straps

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.360 
adjust the straps they leave the straps
hanging<00:00:13.049> loose<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.830> looks<00:00:14.070> kind<00:00:14.309> of

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
hanging loose and it looks kind of

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.060 
hanging loose and it looks kind of
sloppy<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.630> be<00:00:15.719> kind<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.020> noisy<00:00:16.410> one

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
sloppy and it can be kind of noisy one

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.920 
sloppy and it can be kind of noisy one
solution<00:00:17.640> for<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.210> something<00:00:18.600> called

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
solution for that is something called

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.700 
solution for that is something called
Ranger<00:00:19.560> bands<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.750> here's<00:00:21.750> an<00:00:21.869> example<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
Ranger bands and here's an example of a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.200 
Ranger bands and here's an example of a
ranger<00:00:23.070> band<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.029> made<00:00:24.949> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.279> about<00:00:26.939> an

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
ranger band that I made this is about an

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.349 
ranger band that I made this is about an
inch<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.599> half<00:00:27.630> wide<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
inch and a half wide and so it's the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.500 
inch and a half wide and so it's the
perfect<00:00:30.599> size<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:33.770> on<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:35.550> waist<00:00:35.790> belt<00:00:36.149> if
