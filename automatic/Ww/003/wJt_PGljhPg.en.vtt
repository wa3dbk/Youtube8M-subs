what<00:00:14.880> makes<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.240> different<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.740> is

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
what makes it different is that this is

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.880 
what makes it different is that this is
3/4<00:00:17.580> inch<00:00:17.730> MDF<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.420> have<00:00:18.539> here<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.930> he

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
3/4 inch MDF that I have here and he

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.769 
3/4 inch MDF that I have here and he
actually<00:00:20.250> designs<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.270> shaft<00:00:21.510> is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
actually designs it so that the shaft is

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.179 
actually designs it so that the shaft is
longer<00:00:23.000> there<00:00:24.000> normally<00:00:24.570> they're<00:00:24.810> made<00:00:24.960> for

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
longer there normally they're made for

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.740 
longer there normally they're made for
metal<00:00:26.189> control<00:00:26.490> panels<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.090> one's<00:00:27.300> 3/4

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
metal control panels but this one's 3/4

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.509 
metal control panels but this one's 3/4
inch<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> perfect
