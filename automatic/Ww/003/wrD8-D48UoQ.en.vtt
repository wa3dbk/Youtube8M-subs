00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
here there is a slime on the ground on a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.929 
here there is a slime on the ground on a
picture<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.990> I'm<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.130> sure<00:00:29.279> who<00:00:29.429> posted<00:00:29.789> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
picture that I'm not sure who posted it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.209 
picture that I'm not sure who posted it
but<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> has<00:00:30.960> been<00:00:31.080> published<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.859> that's<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
but it has been published so that's the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.670 
but it has been published so that's the
most<00:00:32.399> important<00:00:32.850> thing<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.440> slimes<00:00:34.440> are

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
most important thing so slimes are

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
most important thing so slimes are
actually<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.630> next<00:00:36.960> update

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
actually going to be in the next update

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
actually going to be in the next update
which<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> big<00:00:38.250> surprise<00:00:39.829> because<00:00:41.390> they

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
which is a big surprise because they

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.119 
which is a big surprise because they
never<00:00:42.540> said<00:00:42.960> anything<00:00:43.230> about<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:43.829> anyway

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
never said anything about it but anyway

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.459 
never said anything about it but anyway
we<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.000> them<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.329> game<00:00:45.480> as

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
we are going to have them in the game as

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.200 
we are going to have them in the game as
you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:46.980> there's<00:00:47.160> only<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.910> little

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you can see there's only like the little

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
you can see there's only like the little
one<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.660> think<00:00:49.170> we'll<00:00:49.379> probably<00:00:49.559> also<00:00:49.920> have

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
one but I think we'll probably also have

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520 
one but I think we'll probably also have
to<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> bigger<00:00:50.789> ones<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.239> stuff<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.350> he

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to like the bigger ones and stuff so he

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
to like the bigger ones and stuff so he
is<00:00:52.649> working<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.610> working<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.210> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
is working they are working on that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.900 
is working they are working on that
which<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.770> awesome<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.760> get

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
which is just awesome that we just get

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.119 
which is just awesome that we just get
two<00:00:57.390> new<00:00:57.600> mobs<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> game<00:00:58.379> because<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.949> also

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
two new mobs in the game because we also

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.939 
two new mobs in the game because we also
get<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> Enderman<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.710> see

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
get the Enderman so as you can see

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.590 
get the Enderman so as you can see
they're<00:01:02.160> all<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
they're all so that you can see the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.719 
they're all so that you can see the
version<00:01:04.170> open<00:01:04.710> nine-point-oh<00:01:05.189> alpha<00:01:05.549> pulled

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
version open nine-point-oh alpha pulled

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.300 
version open nine-point-oh alpha pulled
one<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.180> i<00:01:06.210> think<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.869> should<00:01:07.170> get<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> Alpha

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
one so i think we should get the Alpha

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.330 
one so i think we should get the Alpha
builds<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.330> Android<00:01:09.750> pret<00:01:10.200> pretty<00:01:10.530> soon<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
builds for Android pret pretty soon I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.270 
builds for Android pret pretty soon I
think<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.360> myself<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> be

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
think I myself I think it's going to be

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.679 
think I myself I think it's going to be
like<00:01:15.049> march<00:01:16.460> beginning<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.549> March<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.090> then

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like march beginning of March and then

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.340 
like march beginning of March and then
we<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.170> probably<00:01:19.909> get<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.210> release<00:01:21.720> around

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
we will probably get the release around

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.580 
we will probably get the release around
to<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> end<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:23.189> March<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.630> say<00:01:25.380> I'm

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
hopefully we get this slime blocks

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.249 
hopefully we get this slime blocks
instantly<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.189> thing<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.810> slimes<00:01:42.810> will

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
instantly now the thing is slimes will

instantly now the thing is slimes will
drop<00:01:43.649> slime<00:01:44.040> balls<00:01:44.340> which<00:01:45.299> means<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:47.070> we

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
drop slime balls which means that we

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.280 
drop slime balls which means that we
would<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:50.390> we<00:01:51.390> will<00:01:51.570> there's<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
would have to get or we will there's a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.920 
would have to get or we will there's a
couple<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.130> possibilities<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.270> possibly

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
couple of possibilities we can possibly

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.690 
couple of possibilities we can possibly
get<00:01:56.719> sticky<00:01:57.719> pistons<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> future<00:01:58.799> which

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
get sticky pistons in the future which

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.010 
get sticky pistons in the future which
is<00:02:00.140> where<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.380> need<00:02:01.590> slime<00:02:02.579> balls<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.030> or<00:02:03.240> we

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
is where we need slime balls for or we

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
is where we need slime balls for or we
need<00:02:04.200> leads<00:02:04.590> which<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.189> an<00:02:05.310> item<00:02:05.670> where<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
need leads which is an item where you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.020 
need leads which is an item where you
can<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.290> piece<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.099> string<00:02:08.580> which

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
can it's like a piece of string which

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.380 
can it's like a piece of string which
you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.390> attach<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.099> mob<00:02:11.099> or<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.520> anything

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you can attach to a mob or a anything

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.150 
you can attach to a mob or a anything
like<00:02:12.540> overs<00:02:12.810> are<00:02:12.900> any

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
like overs are any

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.180 
like overs are any
and<00:02:13.430> then<00:02:14.240> they<00:02:14.870> kind<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.260> follow<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:15.950> because

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and then they kind of follow you because

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.380 
and then they kind of follow you because
you<00:02:16.940> are<00:02:17.240> kind<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.780> taking<00:02:18.020> them<00:02:18.470> with<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:18.920> and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
you are kind of taking them with you and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.900 
you are kind of taking them with you and
or<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.450> slime<00:02:21.380> block<00:02:21.680> which<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.100> think<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
or a slime block which is I think the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.420 
or a slime block which is I think the
three<00:02:23.330> only<00:02:25.180> uses<00:02:26.180> for<00:02:26.420> slime<00:02:26.810> balls<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.400> I

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
three only uses for slime balls so I

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.180 
three only uses for slime balls so I
think<00:02:29.150> we<00:02:29.390> might<00:02:29.600> see<00:02:29.930> one<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.440> those<00:02:30.620> three<00:02:30.980> at

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
think we might see one of those three at

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.960 
think we might see one of those three at
least<00:02:31.460> in<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.810> open<00:02:33.140> net<00:02:33.260> window<00:02:33.620> update

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
least in the open net window update

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.390 
least in the open net window update
might<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.120> wrong<00:02:35.330> but<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.780> think<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.590> otherwise

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
might be wrong but I think so otherwise

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.450 
might be wrong but I think so otherwise
I<00:02:37.460> think<00:02:37.610> these<00:02:38.330> slimes<00:02:38.810> will<00:02:39.290> be<00:02:39.500> pre<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.370> of

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
I think these slimes will be pre and of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.240 
I think these slimes will be pre and of
pointless<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.260> anyway<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.470> hope<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.860> enjoy

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
pointless but anyway I hope you enjoy

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.420 
pointless but anyway I hope you enjoy
