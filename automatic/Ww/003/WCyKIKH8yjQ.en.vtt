 videogame wars show of lost games 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.890
 a pleasant surprise to know the new ones 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.200
 received indications that only 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.510
 won the first was disorder but 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.400
 counting as a studio year 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.129
 will cause the study but the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.970
 studio is there because it made the game 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.370
 finally 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.580
 Secondly, Johnny is a 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.620
 exclusive and psn and the walking dead 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.320
 that has for pc xbox 360 and ps3 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.720
 only these two games are studies 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.309
 independent games are Indian games that 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.710
 games. 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.379
 investment because the studies do not 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.140
 very resourceful and both one and the other 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.580
 are occurring and the game of the year is mine 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.120
 comrade together with great 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.510
 classics there as the designer of 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.520
 assassin's creed 3 enÃ©zio effect 3 only 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.060
 weight game and I did not like it much 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.430
 these little games to say 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.700
 had this recognition without deserving 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.670
 whether or not they will win or not there is another 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.399
 history'm not here to argue the fact is 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.250
 which is very important for the industry 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.490
 especially for us consumers who 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.229
 these smaller and independent studios 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.229
 have their games recognized because of 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.479
 fact has much quality both 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.880
 I'll tell you why it's important 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.920
 independent studies should 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.710
 recognition is to pick up but like all 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.420
 large companies that we have today 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:03.219
 win the division and the software 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.900
 either with conan month 47 77 for all of them 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.120
 were small 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.160
 one day I take the example of the activist 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.190
 that I solved in the story of her creation 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.990
 was in the middle of the second generation of 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.640
 I will leave here the link of the 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.910
 environment on the history of 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.900
 video games in the second generation of my 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.060
 story some developers of attac 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.950
 dominated the market at the time did not like 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.460
 of this monopoly that was taking 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.790
 of the atari and ended up leaving the area 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.280
 thus creating the activision and then these 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.350
 four councilors created nothing more 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.500
 unless one of the best selling games only 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.810
 lag behind technical and Lugano that 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.360
 was the kit that provided her 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.440
 have a pc if you decide on new 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.690
 games nine franchises becoming what 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.810
 it is today a company that holds the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.209
 crazy more tortuous inside the big 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.730
 video game companies mainly 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.230
 by the Internet franchise it happens that 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.260
 formerly for you to develop a 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.420
 I was not as expensive as I am today. 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.190
 two three four people succeeded 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.880
 develop the whole game 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.730
 nowadays you need 20 30 sometimes 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.950
 hundred people to develop a game I 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.340
 I approached this old subject of mine video on 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.350
 generation this I left it to whoever has 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.330
 curiosity then what happens today in 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.180
 day these big companies ours can 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.040
 have the luxury of developing a game that 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.620
 will not render you got it accurate 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.750
 sell not only to cover him with punches 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.480
 development such as generating a profit and 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.320
 pro staff who developed the gifts of 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.420
 12 7 sure investment company is touring 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.640
 lots of money and all this then 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.100
 formerly because it is a lower cost 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.310
 companies have a certain freedom to 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.100
 power scratching our quiz create new 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.410
 franchise different game styles is 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.630
 Certain cases of closed 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.710
 the loss 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.780
 nowadays is why basically 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.450
 large companies no preference 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.390
 make a sequel to a franchise already 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.790
 known of the crial so that nokia which 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.110
 is to create a new franchise she tends to 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.830
 create a genre that is already well accepted by 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.450
 majority 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.520
 say so and then that finally comes 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.800
 the importance of these studies 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.320
 independent of them as it has less 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.520
 resources in their investments are 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.230
 minors 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.000
 they have to stand out from some 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.340
 way if an independent company that 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.110
 is an fps never managed to hit front 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:40.500
 with the coffee of a few months with the kingdoms 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.990
 with butterfields 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.300
 has no space to innovate in 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.640
 something or draw a little path 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.060
 exploited by large companies 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.130
 need an example of inactivation 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.440
 someone that both get 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.620
 right on wall who should pay the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.310
 millionaire warning that affords 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.470
 There, he decided to make a fps game. 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.570
 precisely because it will invest a lot 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.090
 more in your game than until then who 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.910
 she will be much more resources 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.040
 this game she obviously needs 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.100
 with the safest way then make a 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.530
 fps that is a specialty of her chance 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.630
 to get crazy and it's gigantic for 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.000
 other side telltale games that do not have 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.280
 these resources have to 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.090
 different then she eventually developed 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.300
 a game of a style there very little 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.270
 explored in this general generation, no more 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.930
 it's just another good time since it would be the 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.880
 contain adventure happy content clips 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.230
 this solves such games have a party 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.750
 walking Dead 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.490
 never could she beat 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.500
 in front of the television 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.990
 only now fortunately with this 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.090
 recognition of these studies 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.820
 independent with these game geniuses 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.860
 little explored who knows the 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.900
 big companies look at these new 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.900
 geniuses explored and have there 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:06.309
 was thought and four with this 

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:09.039
 recognition of these studies 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:11.229
 have the chance to grow and 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.599
 Who knows again to create new 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.119
 franchises have more features 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.389

 I do not know how to test google docs google joe 

00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:40.929
 danger because of these studios 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:43.239
 independent 

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:46.089
 there is a movie called in the game of 

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:49.119
