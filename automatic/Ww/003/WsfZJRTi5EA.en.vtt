device brought to a different form

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.970 
device brought to a different form
factor<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.489> iPad<00:00:38.910> had<00:00:39.059> changed<00:00:39.540> all<00:00:39.719> that

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
factor but the iPad had changed all that

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.069 
factor but the iPad had changed all that
what<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.070> did<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.760> introduced<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.690> new

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
what it did was it introduced a new

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.479 
what it did was it introduced a new
design<00:00:43.649> point<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.969> IT<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.320> new<00:00:46.829> design<00:00:47.160> point

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
design point for IT a new design point

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.940 
design point for IT a new design point
for<00:00:47.730> applications<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.170> opened<00:00:49.590> up<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
for applications and it's opened up a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.520 
for applications and it's opened up a
lot<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.430> new<00:00:50.640> areas<00:00:51.120> where<00:00:51.300> computing<00:00:52.230> was

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
lot of new areas where computing was

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.670 
lot of new areas where computing was
just<00:00:52.770> impractical<00:00:53.160> before<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.840> tablet<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.440> an

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
just impractical before the tablet is an

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
just impractical before the tablet is an
interesting<00:00:56.129> media<00:00:56.820> consumption<00:00:57.600> device

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
interesting media consumption device

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.619 
interesting media consumption device
that's<00:00:58.350> bringing<00:00:58.649> computing<00:00:59.340> into<00:01:00.000> new<00:01:00.329> areas

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that's bringing computing into new areas

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
that's bringing computing into new areas
so<00:01:01.079> rather<00:01:01.230> than<00:01:01.500> sitting<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.399> desk<00:01:02.430> top

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so rather than sitting at a desk top

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.179 
so rather than sitting at a desk top
people<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:03.960> walking<00:01:04.559> around<00:01:04.680> or

need<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.310> about<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:06.420> tablet<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> new

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
need to think about the tablet as a new

need to think about the tablet as a new
design<00:02:08.340> point<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:09.060> your<00:02:09.179> applications<00:02:10.050> so

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
design point for your applications so

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.229 
design point for your applications so
you're<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> design<00:02:11.039> with<00:02:11.700> new<00:02:11.940> tools

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
you're going to design with new tools

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.340 
you're going to design with new tools
will<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> different<00:02:13.080> set<00:02:13.200> of

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
will be a different set of

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.750 
will be a different set of
tools<00:02:13.530> for<00:02:13.890> building<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.310> delivering<00:02:14.670> these

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
tools for building and delivering these

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000 
tools for building and delivering these
applications<00:02:15.540> there'll<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.170> different<00:02:16.710> user

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
applications there'll be different user

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.760 
applications there'll be different user
interface<00:02:17.820> models<00:02:18.420> using<00:02:18.780> touch<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.620> other

natural user interface elements that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.680 
natural user interface elements that
need<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.020> be<00:02:22.080> built<00:02:22.380> into<00:02:22.740> this<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.540> new

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
need to be built into this so the new

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.720 
need to be built into this so the new

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
design point around the tablets is going

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.310 
design point around the tablets is going
to<00:02:26.820> be<00:02:26.910> important<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.840> fact<00:02:28.050> there<00:02:28.290> are

productivity tools i'm going to use a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.000 
productivity tools i'm going to use a
lot<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.300> same<00:03:42.480> tools<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:43.170> find<00:03:43.440> out

in<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.550> open<00:03:44.640> marketplace<00:03:45.210> but<00:03:46.080> one<00:03:46.290> thing

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
in the open marketplace but one thing

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.350 
in the open marketplace but one thing
you<00:03:46.590> need<00:03:46.740> to<00:03:46.770> think<00:03:46.860> about<00:03:47.160> here<00:03:47.490> is<00:03:47.670> what<00:03:48.030> new

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
you need to think about here is what new

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.980 
you need to think about here is what new
applications<00:03:49.200> would<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.460> platform<00:03:51.000> enable

and<00:03:52.950> once<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.340> do<00:03:53.550> that<00:03:53.580> you'll<00:03:54.060> realize<00:03:54.510> that

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
and once you do that you'll realize that

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.410 
and once you do that you'll realize that
you'll<00:03:54.960> need<00:03:55.080> a<00:03:55.140> new<00:03:55.230> set<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.710> tools<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.490> new<00:03:57.090> set
