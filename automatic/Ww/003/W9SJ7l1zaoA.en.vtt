00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.590 
panel okay I was gonna try to remove the
side<00:06:09.039> panel<00:06:09.070> which<00:06:09.700> you<00:06:09.729> can<00:06:10.120> move<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:10.539> would

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
side panel which you can move I would

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.879 
side panel which you can move I would
not<00:06:10.870> suggest<00:06:11.050> it<00:06:11.410> I<00:06:11.560> don't<00:06:11.680> know<00:06:11.770> if<00:06:11.830> the

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
not suggest it I don't know if the

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.409 
not suggest it I don't know if the
camera<00:06:12.250> can<00:06:12.340> get<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.610> camera<00:06:12.940> inside<00:06:13.210> there

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
camera can get the camera inside there

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.029 
camera can get the camera inside there
and<00:06:13.570> see<00:06:13.720> this<00:06:13.900> but<00:06:14.080> you<00:06:14.110> can<00:06:14.320> see<00:06:14.349> that<00:06:14.710> all

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
and see this but you can see that all

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.670 
and see this but you can see that all
those<00:06:15.370> connections<00:06:15.700> are<00:06:15.940> wired<00:06:16.210> in<00:06:16.450> there<00:06:16.680> so

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
those connections are wired in there so

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.719 
those connections are wired in there so
at<00:06:17.740> this<00:06:17.860> point<00:06:18.099> there's<00:06:18.280> really<00:06:18.310> no<00:06:18.550> reason

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
at this point there's really no reason

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:19.770 
at this point there's really no reason
for<00:06:18.880> you<00:06:18.970> to<00:06:19.000> just<00:06:19.180> pull<00:06:19.360> this<00:06:19.450> off<00:06:19.630> I<00:06:19.720> don't

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
for you to just pull this off I don't

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.029 
for you to just pull this off I don't
want<00:06:19.960> to<00:06:20.020> take<00:06:20.139> a<00:06:20.169> chance<00:06:20.380> of<00:06:20.560> taking<00:06:20.770> the

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
want to take a chance of taking the

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.070 
want to take a chance of taking the
wires<00:06:21.220> out<00:06:21.430> but<00:06:22.210> at<00:06:22.300> least<00:06:22.360> you<00:06:22.510> guys<00:06:22.630> can<00:06:22.690> see

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
wires out but at least you guys can see

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.460 
wires out but at least you guys can see
that<00:06:24.450> it's<00:06:25.450> kind<00:06:25.570> of<00:06:25.690> a<00:06:25.750> strange<00:06:26.020> design<00:06:26.289> to<00:06:26.380> be

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
that it's kind of a strange design to be

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.659 
that it's kind of a strange design to be
on<00:06:26.560> the<00:06:26.620> side<00:06:26.800> like<00:06:27.010> that<00:06:27.190> maybe<00:06:27.430> it<00:06:27.580> won't

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
on the side like that maybe it won't

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.060 
on the side like that maybe it won't
hurt<00:06:27.880> anything<00:06:28.000> later<00:06:28.389> on<00:06:28.599> so<00:06:28.960> last<00:06:29.860> but<00:06:30.010> not

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
hurt anything later on so last but not

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.240 
hurt anything later on so last but not
least<00:06:30.340> let's<00:06:31.090> flip<00:06:31.330> it<00:06:31.479> around<00:06:32.039> now<00:06:33.039> let's

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
least let's flip it around now let's

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.589 
least let's flip it around now let's
talk<00:06:33.400> about<00:06:33.460> the<00:06:33.820> features<00:06:34.000> of<00:06:34.240> this<00:06:34.539> new
