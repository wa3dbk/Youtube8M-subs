today<00:00:01.500> I'm<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.949> try<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.610> get<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:03.060> stove

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
today I'm going to try to get this stove

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.579 
today I'm going to try to get this stove
into<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.990> back<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.490> this<00:00:05.490> truck<00:00:06.410> without<00:00:07.410> any

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
into the back of this truck without any

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.690 
into the back of this truck without any
help<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.040> without<00:00:08.700> killing<00:00:09.059> myself<00:00:10.370> my<00:00:11.370> idea

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
help and without killing myself my idea

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.120 
help and without killing myself my idea
is<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.360> move<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.559> stove

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
is to move the stove

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.849 
is to move the stove
right<00:00:14.670> up<00:00:14.820> against<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> tailgate<00:00:15.710> so<00:00:16.710> that

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
right up against the tailgate so that

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.769 
right up against the tailgate so that
the<00:00:16.949> tailgate<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.490> right<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.510> side

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the tailgate is right here on the side

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.189 
the tailgate is right here on the side
and<00:00:19.070> then<00:00:20.070> I'll<00:00:20.189> try<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.570> just<00:00:21.570> lift<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.050> up

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
and then I'll try to just lift it up

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.400 
and then I'll try to just lift it up
into<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.740> truck<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.330> when<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.960> gets<00:00:25.140> into

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
into the truck so that when it gets into

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.519 
into the truck so that when it gets into
the<00:00:25.439> bed<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.300> laying<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.449> its<00:00:27.660> side<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:28.439> I

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the bed it's laying on its side then I

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.730 
the bed it's laying on its side then I
can<00:00:28.680> slide<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.510> tip<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.660> back<00:00:30.900> up<00:00:31.199> right

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
can slide it in and tip it back up right

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.380 
can slide it in and tip it back up right

do is remove this drawer to eliminate

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:12.490

excess<00:01:03.359> weight<00:01:07.430> every<00:01:08.430> little<00:01:08.670> bit<00:01:08.790> counts

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.080 

now<00:01:13.500> I'm<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.040> shimmy<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> stove<00:01:14.880> over

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
now I'm going to shimmy the stove over

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
now I'm going to shimmy the stove over
to<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> truck

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.220 

and<00:01:39.110> now<00:01:40.040> for<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.340> fun<00:01:40.550> part

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
and now for the fun part

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.860 
and now for the fun part
have<00:01:42.230> traditionally<00:01:42.800> stove<00:01:43.100> right<00:01:43.340> at<00:01:43.490> the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
have traditionally stove right at the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.450 
have traditionally stove right at the
tailgate<00:01:45.580> with<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.760> side<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.390> stove

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
tailgate with the side of the stove

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.190 
tailgate with the side of the stove
against<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.580> truck<00:01:49.850> because<00:01:50.090> this<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.170> a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
against the truck because this is a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.180 
against the truck because this is a
stronger<00:01:52.840> portion<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.050> stove<00:01:54.320> clip<00:01:55.040> in

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
stronger portion of the stove clip in

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.960 
stronger portion of the stove clip in
the<00:01:55.310> back<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.820> stove<00:01:56.120> so<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:56.570> will

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
the back of the stove so this will

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.340 
the back of the stove so this will
reduce<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.150> chance<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.510> any<00:01:59.630> damage<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.229> the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
reduce the chance of any damage to the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.219 
reduce the chance of any damage to the
stove<00:02:00.880> damage<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.030> me<00:02:02.210> I'm<00:02:02.630> not<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:02.960> sure<00:02:02.990> about

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
stove damage to me I'm not so sure about

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:19.080 
stove damage to me I'm not so sure about
that<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:05.440> I'll<00:02:06.440> give<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> try

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.490 

you'll<00:02:20.090> make<00:02:20.270> them<00:02:20.390> like<00:02:20.570> they<00:02:20.750> used<00:02:20.780> to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
you'll make them like they used to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:37.770 
you'll make them like they used to
ooh

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.300 

nevermind<00:02:38.780> why<00:02:38.960> my<00:02:39.170> cameraman<00:02:39.770> doesn't<00:02:40.160> just

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
nevermind why my cameraman doesn't just

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.030 
nevermind why my cameraman doesn't just
help<00:02:40.520> me<00:02:40.640> load<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.000> stove<00:02:41.650> they<00:02:42.650> can<00:02:42.860> actually

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
help me load the stove they can actually

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.190 
help me load the stove they can actually
see<00:02:43.490> my<00:02:43.670> picture<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.390> reflection<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:45.080> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
see my picture in the reflection of the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:03:04.390 
see my picture in the reflection of the
glass<00:03:00.790> now<00:03:01.790> I'll<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.350> tip<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.380> upright<00:03:04.070> again

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
glass now I'll just tip it upright again

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.420 
glass now I'll just tip it upright again
because<00:03:04.730> that's<00:03:04.850> probably<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:06.130> best<00:03:07.130> way<00:03:07.400> to

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
because that's probably the best way to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:37.429 
because that's probably the best way to
transport<00:03:08.420> it

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.110 

and<00:03:38.439> that's<00:03:38.650> how<00:03:38.829> you<00:03:38.920> load<00:03:39.189> a<00:03:39.250> stove<00:03:39.700> you're

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
and that's how you load a stove you're

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.200 
and that's how you load a stove you're
all<00:03:40.239> alone<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:41.650> me<00:03:42.689> thanks<00:03:43.689> for<00:03:43.840> watching
