episode so to kick off the episode I did

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.979 
episode so to kick off the episode I did
get<00:00:50.340> an<00:00:50.579> item<00:00:50.940> pretty<00:00:51.149> early<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
get an item pretty early on and it was a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.810 
get an item pretty early on and it was a
tour<00:00:52.260> acts<00:00:52.440> plate<00:00:52.770> which<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.430> was<00:00:53.579> kind<00:00:53.760> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
tour acts plate which I was kind of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.400 
tour acts plate which I was kind of
surprised<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.750> my<00:00:54.780> most

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
surprised because that was my most

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.290 
surprised because that was my most
recent<00:00:55.649> unique<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.460> got<00:00:56.610> last<00:00:56.850> episode

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
recent unique that I got last episode

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.389 
recent unique that I got last episode
sadly<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.260> know<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.649> would<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> duplicate

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
sadly you know that would be a duplicate

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.610 
sadly you know that would be a duplicate
so<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> mean<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.090> only<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.420> 400<00:01:01.020> k<00:01:01.170> i<00:01:01.199> believe

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
so I mean it's only like 400 k i believe

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.369 
so I mean it's only like 400 k i believe
so<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> isn't<00:01:02.699> horrible<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.840> was<00:01:04.110> kind<00:01:04.320> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
so it isn't horrible but it was kind of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
so it isn't horrible but it was kind of
weird<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.369> get<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.670> drop<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.689> too

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
weird to get that drop and then not too

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
weird to get that drop and then not too
long<00:01:06.960> after<00:01:07.020> i<00:01:07.350> did<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> guns<00:01:08.430> plate<00:01:08.790> body

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
long after i did get a guns plate body

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.510 
long after i did get a guns plate body
which<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.360> pretty<00:01:09.720> nice<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.260> 560<00:01:11.130> k<00:01:11.310> i

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
which is pretty nice it's like 560 k i

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.920 
which is pretty nice it's like 560 k i
was<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.000> pretty<00:01:12.240> excited<00:01:12.420> about<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
was actually pretty excited about that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.649 
was actually pretty excited about that
one<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.890> 600<00:01:14.369> k<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.820> into<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.150> tab<00:01:15.420> and

broke loose and they were pretty shitty

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.740

I<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.290> hate<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> curse<00:01:34.740> i<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.430> um<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.939> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
I really hate a curse i but um it is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.210 
I really hate a curse i but um it is
worth<00:01:36.240> killing<00:01:36.630> him<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.380> extra<00:01:37.890> chance

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
worth killing him for the extra chance

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.700 
worth killing him for the extra chance
of<00:01:38.400> getting<00:01:38.640> barrels<00:01:38.909> equipment<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:40.500> guess

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
of getting barrels equipment so I guess

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
of getting barrels equipment so I guess
oh<00:01:41.070> well<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.360> hope<00:01:42.570> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
oh well it's just I really hope that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.899 
oh well it's just I really hope that
they<00:01:42.840> actually<00:01:43.140> sell<00:01:43.380> when<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> actually<00:01:44.520> go

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
they actually sell when I actually go

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.819 
they actually sell when I actually go
sell<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> items<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.960> far<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.409> only<00:01:46.649> one

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
sell the items so far it was only one

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.440 
sell the items so far it was only one
exercise<00:01:47.130> item<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> thought<00:01:47.880> probably<00:01:48.210> was

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
exercise item so I thought probably was

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.149 
exercise item so I thought probably was
a<00:01:48.509> fluke<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.960> probably<00:01:49.439> won't<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.740> another<00:01:49.950> one

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
a fluke I probably won't get another one

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.910 
a fluke I probably won't get another one
and<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:50.750> truth<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.930> told<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.439> got<00:01:52.649> another

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and then truth be told I got another

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.380 
and then truth be told I got another
exercise<00:01:53.310> hood<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:54.030> kind<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.240> stupid

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
exercise hood so that was kind of stupid

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.630 
exercise hood so that was kind of stupid
back-to-back<00:01:54.990> hoods<00:01:55.229> pretty<00:01:55.799> depressing<00:01:56.219> but

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
back-to-back hoods pretty depressing but

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.819

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
really can't do anything about that so I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.770 
really can't do anything about that so I
just<00:01:59.280> kept<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.549> going<00:01:59.850> try<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.210> finish<00:02:00.390> these

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
point eight which is also really nice

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.620 
point eight which is also really nice
almost<00:05:01.770> 50<00:05:02.220> mil<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.640> just<00:05:02.880> bears<00:05:03.150> equipment

almost 50 mil and just bears equipment
that's<00:05:03.780> so<00:05:04.170> let's<00:05:04.320> round<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.950> around

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
that's so let's round this to around

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.240 
that's so let's round this to around
forty<00:05:05.580> seven<00:05:05.970> mil<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.390> then<00:05:06.930> add<00:05:07.140> that<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.470> 67

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
forty seven mil and then add that to 67

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.070 
forty seven mil and then add that to 67
and<00:05:08.460> then<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:08.760> get<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.940> hundred<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.480> fourteen

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
and then you get a hundred and fourteen

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.770 
and then you get a hundred and fourteen
mil<00:05:10.350> tab<00:05:10.650> for<00:05:10.920> barrows<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.460> is<00:05:12.390> really<00:05:12.660> nice

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
mil tab for barrows that is really nice

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.570 
mil tab for barrows that is really nice
I<00:05:13.050> think<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.350> increase<00:05:13.680> like<00:05:13.860> seven<00:05:14.190> mil<00:05:14.340> since

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
I think I increase like seven mil since

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.940 
I think I increase like seven mil since
last<00:05:14.760> episode<00:05:15.210> which<00:05:15.390> is<00:05:15.510> pretty<00:05:15.690> average<00:05:15.990> I'm

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
last episode which is pretty average I'm

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.340 
last episode which is pretty average I'm
pretty<00:05:17.280> happy<00:05:17.490> with<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:17.700> increase

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
pretty happy with that increase

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.020 
pretty happy with that increase
hopefully<00:05:19.350> i<00:05:19.410> can<00:05:19.440> hit<00:05:19.800> 150<00:05:20.490> ml<00:05:20.640> pretty<00:05:20.880> damn

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
hopefully i can hit 150 ml pretty damn

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.200 
hopefully i can hit 150 ml pretty damn
soon<00:05:21.270> that's<00:05:21.750> only<00:05:21.870> 36<00:05:22.590> mil<00:05:22.800> away<00:05:23.180> so<00:05:24.180> that

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
soon that's only 36 mil away so that

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.400 
soon that's only 36 mil away so that
seems<00:05:24.570> it's<00:05:24.750> probably<00:05:25.020> going<00:05:25.140> to<00:05:25.200> be<00:05:25.260> like

seems it's probably going to be like
four<00:05:25.740> or<00:05:25.860> five<00:05:25.920> episodes<00:05:26.490> before<00:05:26.850> I<00:05:27.030> reached
