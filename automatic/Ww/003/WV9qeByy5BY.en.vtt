00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:02.570 
so what I've basically done is I've

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.750 
so what I've basically done is I've
taken<00:00:03.570> an<00:00:03.810> old<00:00:04.049> 15<00:00:04.830> liter<00:00:05.040> tank<00:00:05.660> here<00:00:07.760> just

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
taken an old 15 liter tank here just

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.509 
taken an old 15 liter tank here just
clean<00:00:08.970> all<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.330> aquarium<00:00:10.080> like<00:00:10.370> normal<00:00:11.370> fish

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
clean all the aquarium like normal fish

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.280 
clean all the aquarium like normal fish
tank<00:00:11.790> which<00:00:12.059> used<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> be<00:00:12.420> useful<00:00:12.780> goldfish<00:00:13.139> I

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
tank which used to be useful goldfish I

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.150 
tank which used to be useful goldfish I
believe<00:00:13.530> know<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:13.980> had<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> turtle<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.700> one

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
believe know we had a turtle in that one

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.929 
believe know we had a turtle in that one
and<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.310> basically<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.090> put<00:00:19.490> 15<00:00:20.490> liters<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and I basically just put 15 liters of

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.580 
and I basically just put 15 liters of
water<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.300> there<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:21.869> every<00:00:22.050> liter<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.380> water

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
water in there for every liter of water

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.279 
water in there for every liter of water
so<00:00:22.740> I've<00:00:22.830> put<00:00:23.070> one<00:00:23.400> teaspoon<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:24.289> aquarium

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
so I've put one teaspoon of aquarium

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.140 
so I've put one teaspoon of aquarium
salt<00:00:27.380> measures<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:29.369> exact<00:00:29.849> with

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
salt measures have to be exact with

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.080 
salt measures have to be exact with
brine<00:00:30.689> shrimp<00:00:30.720> they<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.669> they<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.700> be

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
brine shrimp they can be they can be

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.049 
brine shrimp they can be they can be
they<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.170> approximate<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.430> basically<00:00:35.910> for

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
they can be approximate so basically for

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.729 
they can be approximate so basically for
every<00:00:36.270> liter<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.600> put<00:00:36.930> 1<00:00:37.079> tablespoon<00:00:37.860> of

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
every liter I put 1 tablespoon of

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.900 
every liter I put 1 tablespoon of
acquiring<00:00:40.739> salt<00:00:43.309> right<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> rack<00:00:44.760> them

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
acquiring salt right so I rack them

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.860 
acquiring salt right so I rack them
straight<00:00:45.180> into<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.510> aquarium<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:48.420> brine

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
straight into the aquarium the brine

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.130 
straight into the aquarium the brine
shrimp<00:00:48.899> eggs<00:00:49.550> put<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:53.030> an<00:00:54.030> air<00:00:54.239> pump<00:00:54.449> straight

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
shrimp eggs put a an air pump straight

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.389 
shrimp eggs put a an air pump straight
into<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:56.910> waited<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.360> 48<00:00:58.170> hours

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
into it and I just waited for 48 hours

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.139 
into it and I just waited for 48 hours
I've<00:00:59.399> got<00:00:59.550> my<00:00:59.719> heater<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.730> stays

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
I've got my heater there and it stays

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.170 
I've got my heater there and it stays
around<00:01:03.690> 28<00:01:04.320> degrees<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.000> here

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
around 28 degrees what you can see here

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.600 
around 28 degrees what you can see here
it's<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.479> 28<00:01:06.930> degrees

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
it's about 28 degrees

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.719 
it's about 28 degrees
I<00:01:08.930> left<00:01:09.930> them<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.200> two<00:01:10.350> days<00:01:10.530> send<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.369> off<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
I left them for two days send it off and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.719 
I left them for two days send it off and
then<00:01:12.360> collected<00:01:13.100> all<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.340> crap<00:01:14.549> off<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
then collected all of the crap off the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.410 
then collected all of the crap off the
bottom<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> simple<00:01:16.409> stroke<00:01:17.090> using<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
bottom with a simple stroke using the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.480 
bottom with a simple stroke using the
finger<00:01:19.409> technique<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:22.229> moved<00:01:22.979> all<00:01:23.310> of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
finger technique you know I moved all of

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.069 
finger technique you know I moved all of
that<00:01:23.640> sediment<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.810> glass<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> side<00:01:26.520> I

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.990 

let<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.920> sediment<00:01:32.130> settle<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
let all of the sediment settle to the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.770 
let all of the sediment settle to the
bottom<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:34.100> then<00:01:35.100> poured<00:01:35.490> all<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> forum

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
bottom and then poured all of the forum

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.740 
bottom and then poured all of the forum
that<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.960> caught<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.159> straw<00:01:38.540> which<00:01:39.540> was

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
that I caught with the straw which was

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.289 
that I caught with the straw which was
about<00:01:41.540> this<00:01:42.540> much<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
about this much it was about here to the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
about this much it was about here to the
top<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> glass<00:01:45.720> more<00:01:46.079> or<00:01:46.200> less<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> had<00:01:47.369> a

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
top of the glass more or less so I had a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.010 
top of the glass more or less so I had a
couple<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.909> hundred<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> just

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
couple of hundred in there and I just

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780 
couple of hundred in there and I just
put<00:01:49.350> them<00:01:49.439> straight<00:01:49.560> back<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.920> leaving<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
put them straight back in leaving the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
put them straight back in leaving the
sediment<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> bottom<00:01:51.540> I'm<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> keep

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
sediment on the bottom I'm going to keep

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.940 
sediment on the bottom I'm going to keep
those<00:01:52.920> eggs<00:01:53.630> because<00:01:54.630> I've<00:01:55.290> heard<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
those eggs because I've heard that the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
those eggs because I've heard that the
ones<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.579> sink<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> bottom<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> ones

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
ones that sink to the bottom of the ones

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.899 
ones that sink to the bottom of the ones
that<00:01:57.930> aren't<00:01:58.170> hatched<00:01:58.710> yet<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.579> as<00:01:59.670> soon<00:01:59.820> as

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that aren't hatched yet so as soon as

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.639 
that aren't hatched yet so as soon as
the<00:02:00.030> evaporation<00:02:00.600> takes<00:02:00.810> place<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.259> I'll<00:02:01.500> keep

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the evaporation takes place so I'll keep

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.770 
the evaporation takes place so I'll keep
those<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.009> glass<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.490> probably<00:02:02.790> try

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
those in the glass and probably try

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.780 
those in the glass and probably try
again<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> whack<00:02:04.259> them<00:02:04.380> back<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.920> maybe

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
again to whack them back in and maybe

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490 
again to whack them back in and maybe
hatch<00:02:06.270> them<00:02:06.479> again<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.049> not<00:02:07.229> just

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
hatch them again and it's not just

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.229 
hatch them again and it's not just
Citadel<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.520> saw<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.670> process<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.209> over

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
Citadel just saw the process all over

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.010 
Citadel just saw the process all over
again

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
again

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.280 
again
have<00:02:10.170> mind<00:02:10.380> right<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:11.850> here<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.630> 15

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
have mind right so here here it is 15

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.170 
have mind right so here here it is 15
litre<00:02:13.440> tank<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.490> just<00:02:14.670> put<00:02:14.790> them<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.030> there

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
litre tank and I just put them in there

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690 
litre tank and I just put them in there
as<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.330> said<00:02:15.360> with<00:02:15.660> an<00:02:15.750> at<00:02:15.900> home<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.290> 2<00:02:16.410> days<00:02:16.700> 30

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700

I'm full for sea fish so you're gonna
have<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:27.959> whack<00:03:28.170> them<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.380> never

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
have to just whack them in never

have to just whack them in never
themselves<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.010> think<00:03:30.920> so<00:03:31.920> there<00:03:32.040> we<00:03:32.130> go<00:03:32.160> that's

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
guys we're ready to feed my fish and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.780 
guys we're ready to feed my fish and
I'll<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.680> an<00:03:40.740> adult<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.459> they'll<00:03:41.670> be

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
I'll be an adult and they'll be

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.430 
I'll be an adult and they'll be
reproducing<00:03:42.390> by<00:03:42.480> themselves<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.230> won't

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
reproducing by themselves and I won't

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.010 
reproducing by themselves and I won't
ever<00:03:43.620> need<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.670> reproduce<00:03:44.910> them<00:03:45.300> as<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.540> ever

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
ever need to reproduce them as a ever

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.840 
ever need to reproduce them as a ever
again<00:03:46.560> or<00:03:46.800> hatch<00:03:46.980> them<00:03:47.160> ever<00:03:47.430> again

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
again or hatch them ever again

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.090 
again or hatch them ever again
so<00:03:48.810> then<00:03:48.959> again<00:03:49.140> minimal<00:03:49.530> effort<00:03:49.830> maximum

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
so then again minimal effort maximum

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.180 
so then again minimal effort maximum
outcome<00:03:51.170> right<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.320> there<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.620> my<00:03:52.890> brine

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
outcome right so there is my brine

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.699 
outcome right so there is my brine

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
shrimp grab right the light on there is

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.110 
shrimp grab right the light on there is
just<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:56.100> like<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.400> an<00:03:56.490> old<00:03:56.610> aquarium<00:03:57.000> which
