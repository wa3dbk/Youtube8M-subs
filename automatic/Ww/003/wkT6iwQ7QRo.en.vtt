enjoy<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.720> gameplay<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:32.470> thought<00:02:33.370> this

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
enjoy this gameplay I thought this

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.710 
enjoy this gameplay I thought this
gameplay<00:02:33.940> was<00:02:34.060> pretty<00:02:34.330> unique<00:02:34.599> and

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
gameplay was pretty unique and

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.390 
gameplay was pretty unique and
impressive<00:02:35.319> because<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.890> know<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.010> tried

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
impressive because you know I tried

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.820 
impressive because you know I tried
going<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.880> this<00:02:37.000> for<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.270> bit<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.720> at<00:02:38.380> first<00:02:38.650> I

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
going for this for a bit and at first I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.900 
going for this for a bit and at first I
thought<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.069> was<00:02:39.099> going<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.400> pretty<00:02:39.700> easy

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
thought it was going to be pretty easy

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.880 
thought it was going to be pretty easy
because<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.450> start<00:02:40.720> off<00:02:40.810> with<00:02:40.840> your<00:02:40.989> two<00:02:41.319> LMGs

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
because you start off with your two LMGs

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.800 
because you start off with your two LMGs
and<00:02:42.099> that'll<00:02:42.760> give<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.000> quite<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.270> bit<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.450> ammo

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and that'll give you quite a bit of ammo

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.660 
and that'll give you quite a bit of ammo
but<00:02:44.319> then<00:02:44.470> after<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.890> can't<00:02:45.220> reload<00:02:45.520> it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
but then after that you can't reload it

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.920 
but then after that you can't reload it
so<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:45.910> have<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.120> go<00:02:46.239> around<00:02:46.360> picking<00:02:46.660> up

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
so you have to go around picking up

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.990 
so you have to go around picking up
different<00:02:47.110> guns<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.860> as<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.610> can<00:02:48.760> see<00:02:48.940> in

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
different guns and as you can see in

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.309 
different guns and as you can see in
this<00:02:49.090> gameplay<00:02:49.569> he<00:02:49.690> picks<00:02:49.870> up<00:02:49.989> some<00:02:50.200> weird

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
this gameplay he picks up some weird

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.410 
this gameplay he picks up some weird
guns<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.920> believe<00:02:51.160> he<00:02:51.280> uses<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.700> sniper<00:02:52.030> for<00:02:52.330> a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
guns I believe he uses a sniper for a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.750 
guns I believe he uses a sniper for a
bit<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.470> know<00:02:53.560> just<00:02:53.800> comes<00:02:54.220> with<00:02:54.400> funky

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
bit and you know just comes with funky

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.790 
bit and you know just comes with funky
sights<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.420> after<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.080> basically<00:02:56.440> luck

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
sights so after that it's basically luck

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.650 
sights so after that it's basically luck
and<00:02:57.069> you<00:02:57.130> have<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.370> pray<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:58.180> get<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.540> know<00:02:58.630> a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
and you have to pray to get you know a

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.449 
and you have to pray to get you know a
decent<00:02:58.989> gun<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.620> can<00:02:59.739> kill<00:02:59.980> people<00:03:00.010> with

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
decent gun that you can kill people with

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.309 
decent gun that you can kill people with
and<00:03:00.730> then<00:03:01.060> even<00:03:01.330> when<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.660> get<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.200> can

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
and then even when you get that you can

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.590 
and then even when you get that you can
only<00:03:02.440> use<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:03.190> know<00:03:03.310> one<00:03:03.790> clip<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.360> and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
only use you know one clip in that and

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
only use you know one clip in that and
then<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.780> have<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.989> switch<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.410> different

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
then you have to switch to a different

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.370 
then you have to switch to a different
gun<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.670> know<00:03:06.910> it's<00:03:07.150> all<00:03:07.330> chance<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.019> I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
gun so you know it's all chance and I

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.900 
gun so you know it's all chance and I
guess<00:03:08.830> it's<00:03:09.040> pretty<00:03:09.280> good<00:03:09.400> for<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.730> guys<00:03:09.850> to

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
really tough and violent because I don't

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.830 
really tough and violent because I don't
really<00:03:45.549> think<00:03:45.609> that's<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.030> case<00:03:46.209> at<00:03:46.269> all<00:03:46.540> and

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
really think that's the case at all and

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.720 
really think that's the case at all and
I<00:03:47.320> can<00:03:47.500> see<00:03:47.650> from<00:03:47.769> their<00:03:47.980> standpoint<00:03:48.250> if<00:03:48.609> they

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
I can see from their standpoint if they

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.949 
I can see from their standpoint if they
don't<00:03:48.880> want<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.060> buy<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.209> game<00:03:49.480> because<00:03:49.840> they

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
don't want to buy the game because they

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.960 
don't want to buy the game because they
don't<00:03:50.109> want<00:03:50.290> their<00:03:50.470> child<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.829> be<00:03:50.859> exposed<00:03:51.790> to

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
don't want their child to be exposed to

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.030 
don't want their child to be exposed to
like<00:03:52.090> blood<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.480> guts<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.290> violence<00:03:53.799> and

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
like blood and guts and violence and

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.530 
like blood and guts and violence and
swearing<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:54.820> all<00:03:54.910> that<00:03:55.060> because<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:55.359> know

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
swearing and all that because you know

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.140 
swearing and all that because you know
young<00:03:55.780> children<00:03:56.230> can<00:03:56.500> be<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:57.400> know<00:03:57.519> kind<00:03:57.970> of

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
young children can be you know kind of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.900 
young children can be you know kind of
influenced<00:03:58.840> by<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.140> but<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.680> think<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.519> say<00:04:00.820> it

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
influenced by that but I think I say it

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.280 
influenced by that but I think I say it
wouldn't<00:04:01.120> really<00:04:01.329> go<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.720> extent<00:04:02.200> that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
wouldn't really go to the extent that

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.740 
wouldn't really go to the extent that
you<00:04:02.950> know<00:04:03.070> if<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.489> play<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.760> shooter<00:04:04.000> game<00:04:04.299> and

to see um and that's perfectly fine but

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.020 
to see um and that's perfectly fine but
I<00:04:47.530> don't<00:04:47.590> think<00:04:47.980> that<00:04:48.250> it's<00:04:48.430> gonna<00:04:48.610> go<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:48.850> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
I don't think that it's gonna go to the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.270 
I don't think that it's gonna go to the
extent<00:04:49.420> of<00:04:49.570> them<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:50.440> know<00:04:50.560> going<00:04:51.010> out<00:04:51.160> of

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
extent of them you know going out of

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.540 
extent of them you know going out of
their<00:04:51.400> way<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.640> like<00:04:52.770> kill<00:04:53.770> somebody<00:04:54.100> if<00:04:54.430> you

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
their way to like kill somebody if you

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.130 
their way to like kill somebody if you
know<00:04:54.640> what<00:04:54.730> I<00:04:54.820> mean<00:04:54.970> I<00:04:55.030> like<00:04:55.270> I<00:04:55.390> think<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.870> it

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
know what I mean I like I think that it

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.170 
know what I mean I like I think that it
might<00:04:56.350> influence<00:04:56.980> them<00:04:57.280> in<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.430> small<00:04:57.730> way<00:04:57.910> like

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
might influence them in a small way like

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.170 
might influence them in a small way like
they<00:04:58.330> might<00:04:58.650> you<00:04:59.650> know<00:04:59.730> have<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.760> little<00:05:01.030> bit<00:05:01.150> of

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
they might you know have a little bit of

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.330 
they might you know have a little bit of
attitude<00:05:01.840> but<00:05:02.170> I<00:05:02.440> don't<00:05:02.620> think<00:05:02.770> that'll<00:05:03.100> go

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
attitude but I don't think that'll go

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.840 
attitude but I don't think that'll go
like<00:05:03.580> super<00:05:04.260> intense<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:05.650> escalate<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.760> know

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
like super intense and escalate you know

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.940 
like super intense and escalate you know
as<00:05:06.970> much<00:05:07.210> as<00:05:07.270> older<00:05:08.080> people<00:05:08.380> think<00:05:08.650> that<00:05:08.770> it

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
as much as older people think that it

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.010 
as much as older people think that it
will<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.880> is<00:05:09.910> mainly<00:05:10.420> older<00:05:10.690> people<00:05:10.990> that

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
will and it is mainly older people that

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.090 
will and it is mainly older people that
think<00:05:11.320> that<00:05:11.500> you<00:05:11.680> know<00:05:11.800> video<00:05:12.070> games

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
think that you know video games

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.010 
think that you know video games
influence<00:05:13.060> you<00:05:13.180> in<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.360> negative<00:05:13.660> way<00:05:13.810> and

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
influence you in a negative way and

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.680 
influence you in a negative way and
that's<00:05:14.590> probably<00:05:14.920> not<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.550> good<00:05:15.640> idea<00:05:16.060> for<00:05:16.570> me

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
that's probably not a good idea for me

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.020 
that's probably not a good idea for me
