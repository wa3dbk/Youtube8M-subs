00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:19.705
We must be firm,

00:01:19.706 --> 00:01:22.392
but we can't be firm only,
we must be consistent as well,

00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:24.559
it doesn't help to be firm
when shooting for the first time,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.955
and then miss ten other shoots,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.016
it doesn't help to be firm when
tackling someone for the first time,

00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:32.256
and then lack consistency
when doing it again.

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:34.830
We must be firm and consistent.

00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:36.421
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:45.149
Santos!

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.214
I'd like to say just one thing:
congratulations!

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.021
It was a great match,

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.863
you did exactly
what the coach told you to,

00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:47.351
we had a wonderful second half,

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.327
which showed,
once again,

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:54.602
that we can make it,
that we have potential,

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:55.708
that's crystal clear!

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:58.837
We might hear bad things
now and then,

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.796
but we are here to work hard,

00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:05.629
it was a great match,
especially the second half,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.578
it was great.

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.907
Congratulations to our coach,

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.457
and to everyone else,
obviously,

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:14.084
you did exactly
what you were told to do,

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:15.951
I said we needed
to play with guts,

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:19.787
and that's what we did here today!

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.772
Congratulations to everyone,

00:04:21.773 --> 00:04:23.943
it's great to be able
to go back home feeling this way,

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.465
enjoy this moment,

00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:31.429
and tomorrow, as Rubinho said,
we must get back to work,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.413
we must work hard.

00:04:33.686 --> 00:04:34.989
We can make it happen...

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.605
if we show that we're committed,

00:04:37.606 --> 00:04:40.885
we can certainly achieve the things
Modesto has just mentioned.

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:43.715
We must believe in ourselves,
we must work hard,

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.729
we need to support each other,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.044
and, eventually,
we'll be the winners.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.212
A team wins matches,

00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:51.528
but a group wins titles.

00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:53.579
That's true,

00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:55.359
let's keep moving forward!

00:04:55.922 --> 00:04:56.462
Let's do it!

00:04:58.178 --> 00:04:59.412
Santos!

00:04:59.824 --> 00:05:01.780
Today's victory
gave us more confidence.

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:04.708
Basically,

00:05:04.923 --> 00:05:07.296
we managed to keep
possession of the ball,

00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:09.173
we didn't miss many passes,

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:11.971
we reached their goal box
several times,

00:05:11.972 --> 00:05:13.724
and we managed to score.

00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:15.332
We are happy...

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:16.972
and reassured,
we'll keep our feet on the ground,

00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:19.602
it's a long and tough journey,
and we need to improve ourselves.

00:05:20.276 --> 00:05:22.209
We had a good week of training,

00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:24.577
we talked a lot to each other,

00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:28.154
and this victory gives us
some peace of mind...

00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:30.433
before the match against Portuguesa.

00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:33.724
I asked them to be
firm and consistent,

00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:35.438
and that's what I saw.

00:05:35.695 --> 00:05:37.898
Although we didn't manage
to score in the first half,

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:39.494
we were consistent
in the second half,

00:05:39.495 --> 00:05:41.546
we remained firm,
we kept trying...

00:05:41.752 --> 00:05:43.807
until we started to score.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.736
It was my debut
playing for Santos FC,

00:05:47.737 --> 00:05:49.218
I am back,

00:05:49.387 --> 00:05:50.852
the Club reopened its doors to me,

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.371
and I'm extremely happy,
because...

00:05:53.372 --> 00:05:55.767
I've been training hard,

00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:59.809
and I really wanted
to honor this jersey.
