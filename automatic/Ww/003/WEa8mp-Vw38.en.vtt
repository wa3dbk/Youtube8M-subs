see that little symbol on the inside

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.370 
see that little symbol on the inside
looks<00:01:41.820> really<00:01:42.119> awesome<00:01:42.299> looks<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.229> it's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
looks really awesome looks like it's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.230 
looks really awesome looks like it's
floating<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> middle<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> did<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
floating in the middle so I did get the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.770 
floating in the middle so I did get the
black<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.960> only<00:01:46.890> has<00:01:47.240> black<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.270> silver

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
black one and only has black and silver

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410 
black one and only has black and silver
on<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.409> think<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> paint<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.549> okay<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.299> looks

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
on it I think the paint is okay it looks

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.630 
on it I think the paint is okay it looks
kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> bland<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.829> child's<00:01:53.189> toy<00:01:53.369> so

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
kind of bland but it's a child's toy so

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300 
kind of bland but it's a child's toy so
it<00:01:53.790> doesn't<00:01:54.060> really<00:01:54.149> matter<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.159> here's<00:01:56.159> the
