00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 youtube people are talking to their friend 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.759
 Miguel Ángel Rocha on this occasion 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.350
 I'm going to teach how we can manipulate the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.450
 brightness intensity of our 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.389
 Android device regardless of the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.849
 version or the model that we have this is 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.160
 based on a bar is very easy to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.619
 use this helps us like for example 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.170
 many times we are watching a movie 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.930
 or we are in a game and we can not move 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.369
 the brightness intensity without going out to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.380
 my criteria is one of the best 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.750
 applications that I have found and I want 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.009
 share them with you to begin 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.690
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.000
 download an application from the projector 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.600
 it's completely free we're going to go to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.670
 play store 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 and we are going to look for the next application 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.910
 call brightness display 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.270
 is to this application with the foquito 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.880
 yellow we select it 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.540
 and we give you install the app weighs 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.310
 only 171 kilobytes is very light 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.880
 truth does not even occupy resources of the 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.880
 phone 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.890
 Closer has installed we give in April 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.060
 and this is the interface of the explanation 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.560
 as you can notice in the top 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.320
 from the notification bar here I 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.759
 a bar appears with this we are going to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.680
 be able to manipulate the brightness of the phone 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.540
 you are not going to notice because this 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.229
 I'm doing with emulator but when 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.479
 have it 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.330
 on your phone by simply sliding 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.840
 about the bar and the brightness start at 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.509
 manipulating is the truth is very simple 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.290
 use the brightness works perfect 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.290
 never give you error 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.119
 As you can see, it also marks you 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.890
 percentage of the screen so you know 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.579
 in what are you letting it boil leave 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.579
 let's expose 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.789
 in 50% 51 he stayed 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.930
 once explained how the 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.580
 brightness 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.200
 we left 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.730
 and we are going to do the test with a 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.050
 application 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.050
 we are going to open in rivers 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.780
 and we are going to 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.800
 see how the bar still appears in a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.320
 game we can lower and raise the brightness is 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.940
 one of the best options that I have 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.380
 found for this since many times 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.720
 I'm playing either at night 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.150
 and the light half and have not 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.730
 I can reduce it until I have to 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.800
 leave the game go to the settings and 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.450
 move nothing if it has been me that I have done 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.600
 one of the best options that I have 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.210
 found very practical to increase or 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.300
 reduce the brightness this function in 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.870
 any side either here in peace in 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.599
 the start screen 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.090
 in the applications drawer where 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.480
 you want can use it and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.840
 here either watching some video or something 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.849
 let's go try on video 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.319
 let's select quick pick that does not 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.319
 has the option to control the brightness 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.790
 as you can see by manipulating the brightness 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.790
 perfectly 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.940
 that would be everything anything does not hurt 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.450
 in asking and have an excellent 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.450
 day
