00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:29.499 
something different with the gameplay

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.309 
something different with the gameplay
but<00:02:29.560> I'm<00:02:29.680> not<00:02:29.769> really<00:02:29.859> sure<00:02:30.239> what<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.629> how

they're going to go about doing that

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.789 
they're going to go about doing that
