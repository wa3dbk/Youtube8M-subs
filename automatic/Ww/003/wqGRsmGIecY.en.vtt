00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.320
 Go 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.290
 well guys we are back here with the 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.310
 second episode of mysteries in the abyss 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.080
 this time as you can see I have 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.290
 changed to ridicule because with the 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.810
 it would have taken 40 minutes for the submarine 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.720
 to go to make half a meter 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.059
 we are here in the company of a virus such as 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.880
 said quite interesting that 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.850
 honestly he has already shaken my balls 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.950
 now we will provide the greatest 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.020
 our very dear friend Michael with a 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.720
 nice sniper rifle i want to do it 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.050
 out to avoid having problems where 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.530
 six 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.770
 no wedding we called greenpeace 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.040
 Otherwise those years, thank god I 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:29.050
 even now we are here not much second 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.960
 according to let 's say it 's a poor one here 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.720
 under another wreck 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:40.660
 I can even fly you down a plane 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.159
 via mongitore we hope this by di 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.500
 he does not leave for facts of mind either 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.440
 wife literally fucked now 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.240
 we must find it again 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.260
 because I don't remember where the fuck is 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.280
 there I have prepared a point but 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.650
 sincerely a clear good memory 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.930
 more so the good would not have ended but 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.850
 here it is we found it fatah that 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.520
 power 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.420
 this is another plane of those that are 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.240
 they find out that I discovered by going around 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.930
 to retrieve useful objects a 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.930
 complete the game 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.800
 and here we find another one this 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:26.290
 it looks like seeing from the cart you shit with 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.870
 the shadow and mine but scared seeing 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.600
 from the size trolley should 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.450
 be perhaps a c 130 those who do 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.300
 finds a force zanchu do o di 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.120
 maybe even better 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:46.770
 it would look like I will go but by a reported name 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.920
 I can't find the boat we could not 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.230
 reported to gta san andreas 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.110
 in the mission I'm incredible huawei 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.840
 however, this andromache is nothing 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.650
 second crime 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.959
 you can see them here there is a 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.840
 hidden package not offering because 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.370
 with maicon or come back to get it 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.260
 comparisons with frank lee are 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.780
 enough money court since I have 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.570
 bought quite a few properties including 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.640
 the airport and so on 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.019
 now we hope the ship does not believe the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.239
 devteam and disappear otherwise we are 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:27.299

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:32.880

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:37.560

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.560
 now that's done 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.459

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:50.390

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:56.030

 however, now I will try to get there 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.450
 to the ship before meeting a few 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.670
 little sharks know that many friends also 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.760
 anyway friends are not if I see 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.190
