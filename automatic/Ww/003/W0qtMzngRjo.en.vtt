no problem with any sticking of the
wheel<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> hub<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.899> we'll<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.980> installing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
wheel to the hub so we'll be installing

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910 
wheel to the hub so we'll be installing
these<00:00:50.579> will<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.149> new<00:00:51.360> clean<00:00:51.989> discs<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.379> later

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
these will have new clean discs on later

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.760 
these will have new clean discs on later
on<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> day<00:00:53.989> I'll<00:00:54.989> show<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.289> them<00:00:55.379> at<00:00:55.500> how

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
much effort it takes to get rid off

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:45.830 
much effort it takes to get rid off
without<00:00:57.510> these<00:00:58.520> being<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> wheel

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

okay<00:01:46.840> we<00:01:46.990> finally<00:01:47.320> managed<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.590> get<00:01:47.740> that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
okay we finally managed to get that

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.720 
okay we finally managed to get that
wheel<00:01:47.980> off<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.130> Audi<00:01:49.800> basically<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:51.010> clean

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
wheel off the Audi basically the clean

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.810 
wheel off the Audi basically the clean
wheel<00:01:51.940> is<00:01:52.180> an<00:01:52.510> American<00:01:53.050> product<00:01:53.440> so<00:01:54.070> there's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
wheel is an American product so there's

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.680 
wheel is an American product so there's
no<00:01:55.090> UK<00:01:55.750> or<00:01:56.050> European<00:01:56.710> fitting<00:01:57.190> list<00:01:57.400> for<00:01:57.940> it<00:01:58.060> so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
no UK or European fitting list for it so

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.130 
no UK or European fitting list for it so
the<00:01:58.870> only<00:01:58.990> way<00:01:59.260> we<00:01:59.890> can<00:02:00.040> sort<00:02:00.460> out<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:01.140> clean

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
the only way we can sort out a clean

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.230 
the only way we can sort out a clean
wheel<00:02:02.320> fitment<00:02:02.740> for<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.010> car<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.090> actually

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
wheel fitment for the car is to actually

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.930 
wheel fitment for the car is to actually
do<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.690> measurement<00:02:05.580> obviously<00:02:06.580> people<00:02:06.760> can

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
do a measurement obviously people can

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.970 
do a measurement obviously people can
come<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.510> premises<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:08.470> do<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.740> but

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
come to the premises and do that but

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.610 
come to the premises and do that but
most<00:02:09.310> people<00:02:09.670> are<00:02:09.730> too<00:02:09.880> far<00:02:10.119> away<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:10.620> we're

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
most people are too far away so we're

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.100 
most people are too far away so we're
doing<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:11.980> measuring<00:02:12.460> video<00:02:12.820> so<00:02:13.270> you've<00:02:13.990> got

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
doing this measuring video so you've got

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.840 
doing this measuring video so you've got
a<00:02:14.140> hope<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.620> getting<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:15.100> clean<00:02:15.370> wheel<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:15.790> a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
a hope of getting a clean wheel for a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.690 
a hope of getting a clean wheel for a
car<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.390> isn't<00:02:16.660> listed<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.320> website<00:02:17.740> so

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
car that isn't listed on the website so

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.880 
car that isn't listed on the website so
basically<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.300> need<00:02:19.450> three<00:02:20.260> basic

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
basically we need three basic

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.280 
basically we need three basic
measurements<00:02:21.520> firstly<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:22.600> need<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.810> know<00:02:23.020> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
measurements firstly we need to know the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.030 
measurements firstly we need to know the
hub<00:02:23.530> width<00:02:24.090> which<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.420> case<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.260> ever

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
hub width which in this case you ever

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.300 
hub width which in this case you ever
say<00:02:27.310> 155<00:02:28.300> mil<00:02:29.880> secondly<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:32.110> need<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.350> know<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
say 155 mil secondly we need to know the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.630 
say 155 mil secondly we need to know the
actual<00:02:34.200> dick

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
actual dick

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.000 
actual dick
or<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.420> call<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:37.630> half<00:02:37.960> height<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.650> height<00:02:38.830> of

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
or we call it half height the height of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.490 
or we call it half height the height of
the<00:02:39.130> harp<00:02:39.370> against<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.940> back<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.300> wheel

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the harp against the back of the wheel

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:50.090 
the harp against the back of the wheel
which<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.710> this<00:02:41.830> case<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:43.090> 33<00:02:44.020> millimeters

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.750 

across<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.580> wheel<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:53.620> has<00:02:53.710> to<00:02:53.920> go<00:02:54.070> right

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
across the wheel it has to go right

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.900 
across the wheel it has to go right
across<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.240> center<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.710> this<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.250> very<00:02:57.730> very

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
across the center and this is very very

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.080 
across the center and this is very very
crucial<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.870> it's<00:02:59.020> lit<00:02:59.410> right<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.240> case

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
crucial that it's lit right in this case

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.150 
crucial that it's lit right in this case
416<00:03:04.090> mill<00:03:05.010> across<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.370> wheel<00:03:07.770> we<00:03:08.770> will<00:03:08.980> also

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
416 mill across the wheel we will also

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.850 
416 mill across the wheel we will also
need<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.880> photo<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.900> wheel<00:03:11.110> front<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.680> back

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
need a photo of the wheel front and back

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.940 
need a photo of the wheel front and back
simply<00:03:12.790> because<00:03:12.910> we<00:03:13.420> can<00:03:13.630> see<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.110> sort<00:03:14.890> of

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
simply because we can see the sort of

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.130 
simply because we can see the sort of
profile<00:03:15.489> we're<00:03:15.910> talking<00:03:16.300> about<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.760> also<00:03:19.140> and

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
profile we're talking about and also and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.590 
profile we're talking about and also and
lots<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.500> cars<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.950> calipers<00:03:21.459> very<00:03:21.940> close<00:03:22.330> to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
lots of cars the calipers very close to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.930 
lots of cars the calipers very close to
the<00:03:22.750> wind<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.500> if<00:03:23.980> there<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.489> clearance

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
the wind so if there is a clearance

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.210 
the wind so if there is a clearance
problem<00:03:25.480> actually<00:03:25.810> less<00:03:26.260> than<00:03:26.290> as<00:03:26.650> well<00:03:29.220> and

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
problem actually less than as well and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.180 
problem actually less than as well and
we're<00:03:30.370> looking<00:03:30.700> for<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:32.190> 416<00:03:33.190> mil<00:03:33.489> width<00:03:34.140> with<00:03:35.140> a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
we're looking for a 416 mil width with a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.000 
we're looking for a 416 mil width with a
33<00:03:36.190> mil<00:03:36.550> dip<00:03:37.050> which<00:03:39.840> just<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.200> happens<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.709> come

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
33 mil dip which just so happens to come

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.240 
33 mil dip which just so happens to come
up<00:03:42.160> exactly<00:03:43.410> by<00:03:44.410> fluke<00:03:45.690> now<00:03:46.690> that's<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.920> part

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
up exactly by fluke now that's a part

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.690 
up exactly by fluke now that's a part
number<00:03:48.519> 10<00:03:48.760> 84<00:03:49.390> which<00:03:49.900> now<00:03:50.200> we've<00:03:51.190> got<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.430> very

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
number 10 84 which now we've got a very

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.570 
number 10 84 which now we've got a very
good<00:03:51.940> idea<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:52.660> trim<00:03:53.110> will<00:03:53.920> possibly

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
good idea that that trim will possibly

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.610 
good idea that that trim will possibly
fit<00:03:55.410> hopefully<00:03:56.410> fit<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:57.820> now<00:03:58.060> we<00:03:58.720> will<00:03:59.080> grab

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
fit hopefully fit but now we will grab

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.880 
fit hopefully fit but now we will grab
it<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.040> check<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:00.519> on<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.820> wheel<00:04:01.739> well<00:04:02.739> let

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
it and check it on the wheel well let

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.270 
it and check it on the wheel well let
you<00:04:02.950> know<00:04:03.510> here<00:04:04.510> we<00:04:04.600> have<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.100> clean<00:04:06.100> wheel

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
you know here we have the clean wheel

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.750 
you know here we have the clean wheel
I've<00:04:06.700> picked<00:04:07.030> out<00:04:07.180> from<00:04:07.420> our<00:04:07.540> stock<00:04:07.870> as<00:04:08.760> you

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
I've picked out from our stock as you

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.289 
I've picked out from our stock as you
can<00:04:09.940> see<00:04:10.239> it<00:04:10.690> has<00:04:11.019> roughly<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.799> same

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
can see it has roughly the same

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.449 
can see it has roughly the same
dimensions<00:04:13.299> and<00:04:13.510> back<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.900> wheel<00:04:14.459> so

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
dimensions and back of the wheel so

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.009 
dimensions and back of the wheel so
we're<00:04:15.640> hoping<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.239> this<00:04:16.419> is<00:04:16.720> going<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.930> be

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
we're hoping that this is going to be

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.130 
we're hoping that this is going to be
the<00:04:17.229> right<00:04:17.979> product<00:04:18.540> with<00:04:19.540> Queen<00:04:19.840> wheels

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
the right product with Queen wheels

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.130 
the right product with Queen wheels
because<00:04:21.040> of<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.340> cooling<00:04:21.850> effect<00:04:21.940> there<00:04:22.720> is<00:04:22.930> a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
because of the cooling effect there is a

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.680 
because of the cooling effect there is a
direction<00:04:23.890> of<00:04:23.979> rotation<00:04:24.270> which<00:04:25.270> is<00:04:25.390> obviously

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
direction of rotation which is obviously

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.770 
direction of rotation which is obviously
the<00:04:25.990> same<00:04:26.229> as<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.440> tire<00:04:26.790> very<00:04:27.790> easy<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.390> most

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
the same as the tire very easy to most

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.580 
the same as the tire very easy to most
ties<00:04:29.080> now<00:04:29.410> I've<00:04:30.190> got<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.490> rotation<00:04:31.440> marker<00:04:32.440> on

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
ties now I've got a rotation marker on

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.920 
ties now I've got a rotation marker on
them<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.070> you<00:04:33.130> can<00:04:33.340> easily<00:04:33.490> measure<00:04:33.820> adapt<00:04:34.240> so

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
them so you can easily measure adapt so

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:50.380 
them so you can easily measure adapt so
let's<00:04:35.590> try

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.100 

absolutely<00:04:51.390> perfect

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
absolutely perfect

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.530 
absolutely perfect
we<00:04:52.890> just<00:04:53.160> now<00:04:53.310> have<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.700> try<00:04:53.910> on<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.150> car<00:04:54.360> make

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
we just now have to try on the car make

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.030 
we just now have to try on the car make
sure<00:04:54.570> doesn't<00:04:54.840> fit<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.140> caliper<00:04:55.560> but<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.800> don't

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
sure doesn't fit the caliper but I don't

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.180 
sure doesn't fit the caliper but I don't
think<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.400> will<00:04:56.520> in<00:04:56.700> this<00:04:56.820> case<00:04:57.770> but<00:04:58.770> we'll<00:04:58.980> try

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
think it will in this case but we'll try

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.480 
think it will in this case but we'll try
and<00:04:59.550> now<00:04:59.880> who<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.390> in<00:05:00.870> on<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.260> video<00:05:01.500> don't

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
and now who you in on the video don't

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.960 
and now who you in on the video don't
just<00:05:03.000> show<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:04.640> consider<00:05:05.640> big

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
just show you that the consider big

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.670 
just show you that the consider big
customer<00:05:06.360> for<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.660> world<00:05:06.840> do<00:05:07.230> you<00:05:07.290> say<00:05:07.470> that

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
customer for the world do you say that

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.340 
customer for the world do you say that
the<00:05:07.800> wheel<00:05:07.950> clean<00:05:08.250> this<00:05:08.460> has<00:05:08.970> no<00:05:09.210> gaps<00:05:09.690> around

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
the wheel clean this has no gaps around

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.200 
the wheel clean this has no gaps around
it<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:10.890> that<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.250> brake<00:05:11.460> dust<00:05:11.700> in<00:05:11.910> future

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
it so that the brake dust in future

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.760 
it so that the brake dust in future
won't<00:05:12.540> be<00:05:12.720> able<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:12.930> escape<00:05:13.140> on<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.590> wheel

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
won't be able to escape on to the wheel

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.110 
won't be able to escape on to the wheel
and<00:05:14.750> obviously<00:05:15.750> caving<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.590> easier<00:05:16.980> and<00:05:17.220> no

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
and obviously caving is easier and no

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.780 
and obviously caving is easier and no
horrible<00:05:18.660> brightest<00:05:19.200> appearing<00:05:19.710> anymore

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.750 

you<00:05:23.790> must<00:05:24.180> however<00:05:24.780> check<00:05:25.200> that<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.250> wheel<00:05:26.490> is

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
you must however check that the wheel is

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.940 
you must however check that the wheel is
tight

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
tight

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:34.130 
tight
after<00:05:28.950> 25<00:05:29.400> miles<00:05:29.730> and<00:05:30.410> after<00:05:31.410> 100<00:05:31.530> miles
