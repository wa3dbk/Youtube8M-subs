to get searching pattern from a new late

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.240 
to get searching pattern from a new late
this<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.110> all<00:03:16.230> my<00:03:16.260> different<00:03:16.500> types<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.920> scut

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
this is all my different types of scut

again some more searching patterns these

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.830 
again some more searching patterns these
are<00:03:28.670> probably<00:03:28.970> one<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.210> the<00:03:29.330> best<00:03:29.480> searching

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
are probably one of the best searching

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.060 
are probably one of the best searching
patterns<00:03:30.170> you'll<00:03:30.380> ever<00:03:30.530> be<00:03:30.710> able<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.920> come

to do this one to become a better fly
fishing<00:05:24.210> at<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.690> beginning<00:05:25.170> you're<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.830> little

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
fishing at the beginning you're a little

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.900 
fishing at the beginning you're a little
bit<00:05:26.190> tough<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.400> fish

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
bit tough to fish

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.970 
bit tough to fish
it's<00:05:28.360> tough<00:05:28.600> to<00:05:28.780> figure<00:05:28.930> out<00:05:29.170> where<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.530> fish

it's tough to figure out where to fish
them<00:05:30.190> but<00:05:30.820> again<00:05:30.910> in<00:05:31.150> my<00:05:31.240> book<00:05:31.450> I<00:05:31.570> do<00:05:31.630> explain<00:05:32.080> a

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
lot of that and you know just just go do

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.510 
lot of that and you know just just go do
some<00:05:34.990> searches<00:05:35.380> if<00:05:35.500> you<00:05:35.830> really<00:05:36.160> want<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.430> get

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
some searches if you really want to get

Pacific Northwest this is I would say

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.140 
Pacific Northwest this is I would say
the<00:05:41.590> number<00:05:41.890> one<00:05:42.070> fly<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.400> have<00:05:42.700> to<00:05:42.850> get<00:05:42.970> good

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
the number one fly to have to get good

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.710 
the number one fly to have to get good
at<00:05:43.210> now<00:05:44.020> whether<00:05:44.230> you<00:05:44.410> do<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:44.740> under<00:05:44.950> a

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
at now whether you do that under a

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.360 
at now whether you do that under a
sinking<00:05:46.720> line<00:05:46.750> technique<00:05:47.500> or<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:47.770> floating<00:05:48.250> my

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
sinking line technique or a floating my

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.090 
sinking line technique or a floating my
technique<00:05:48.760> with<00:05:48.910> a<00:05:48.970> strike<00:05:49.180> indicator<00:05:50.100> it's

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
technique with a strike indicator it's

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.570 
technique with a strike indicator it's
really<00:05:51.580> up<00:05:51.790> to<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.480> person<00:05:53.220> for<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.340> beginner

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
really up to the person for the beginner

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.880 
really up to the person for the beginner
I<00:05:54.670> would<00:05:54.910> suggest<00:05:55.090> a<00:05:55.420> floating<00:05:56.200> line<00:05:56.350> with<00:05:56.620> a

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
I would suggest a floating line with a

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.070 
I would suggest a floating line with a
strike<00:05:57.400> indicator<00:05:57.880> easier<00:05:58.750> for<00:05:58.900> you<00:05:58.990> to<00:05:59.020> see

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
strike indicator easier for you to see

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.520 
strike indicator easier for you to see
it<00:05:59.700> but<00:06:00.700> get<00:06:01.090> good<00:06:01.300> at<00:06:01.450> this<00:06:01.600> get<00:06:02.050> really<00:06:02.410> good

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
it but get good at this get really good

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.840 
it but get good at this get really good
at<00:06:02.590> this<00:06:02.710> because<00:06:02.980> you'll<00:06:03.220> have<00:06:03.250> a<00:06:03.580> ton<00:06:03.820> of

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
at this because you'll have a ton of

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.720 
at this because you'll have a ton of
success<00:06:04.500> so<00:06:05.500> that's<00:06:05.680> just<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:06.100> way<00:06:06.430> I<00:06:06.460> said<00:06:06.700> I
