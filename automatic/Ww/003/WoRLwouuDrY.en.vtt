00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.799

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.840
 ah 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.060
 look at my 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:31.010
 to me 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.010
 your smile that without hurry you give me 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:45.740
 sit down and tell me slowly that everything 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.710
 bayly 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.710
 one 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.760
 Y 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.760
 the bus 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.040
 nobody is for you I am me 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.640
 all right 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.640
 Y 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.540
 before continuing 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.540
 is for me 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.880
 when I met her in a little something like that and 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.880
 now it 's going huge 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.329
 what I like about max is that it is 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.640
 very very lazy that is of the day lying down and 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.960
 which is like very cuddly and it's down 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.899
 over you and you're daytime licking 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.289
 and and that is like a little dog 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.289
 blanket 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:02.240
 we teach him how to do things 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:06.110
 sit and lie down to do tricks and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.369
 so that later he works with children with 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.760
 children with disabled children and with 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:19.150
 spots of many nonsense and a lot 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.150
 I wanted a lot with him and he changes your mood 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 in the history of gabriela is that it has 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.990
 a sacral tumor in the back started 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.370
 three years and when we've been three years 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:38.520
 with treatments of the typical chemo 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.000
 radio operations etcetera and now this 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.430
 year in June they did a transplant 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.760
 also from her brother for her from 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.830
 cells that is a clinical trial when 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.130
 it's been a long time since they're tired of 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.980
 so much medicine and some because they are 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.880
 strong or they leave them restless of des 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.370
 change to humor 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:06.540
 is more animated more happy and so 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.819
 it costs me less to take new pills and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.099
 eating gives me more appetite 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.379
 and it also forces me to go for a walk 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:19.010
 because when having to take it out and do 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.420
 exercise with him because I also do it 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.730
 the truth that takes it beautifully 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.489
 is waiting for the whole week to arrive 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.100
 on Wednesday to go out with the dog 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.520
 play with him 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.530
 and doing things does not have his friends here 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.510
 a normal life of school children 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.230
 the friends of the weekends the 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.819
 family does not have it then and its 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.030
 dogs also at home 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.519
 then to be able to give that to her because she 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.499
 comes from wonders had was almost 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.590
 three months entered without leaving the 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:56.220
 One-room hospital almost has 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.440
 a routine done then if you have a dog 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.990
 or any animal because I like that 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.900
 change the routine and it's something different or 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.900
 a motivation during the day 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.790
 well I wanted to make a letter to no 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.680
 doctor in particular and all doctors 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.870
 In general, when they are in 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.000
 worst moments of your life that is when 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.639
 they are in a hospital that they do not take away 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.880
 your pet or have a 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.860
 animal suitable for that job are not 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.050
 pet but as I say of a company 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.120
 corporation 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.400
 I'm sure that stress can be 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.990
 discount instead of days of bad 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.930
 with a dog 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.009
 and it would be done a lot psychologically 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.800
 even for the improvement of these children 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.199
 and he was in a dog in his room 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.849
 I might be thinking about who is going to 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.680
 enter through the door in the middle of a doctor 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.510

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.410
