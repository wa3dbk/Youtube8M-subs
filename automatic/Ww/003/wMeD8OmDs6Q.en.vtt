00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.380 
because even when the Titans run inside
zone<00:03:18.319> plays<00:03:18.650> they<00:03:19.130> still<00:03:19.400> have<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.790> speed<00:03:20.120> and

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
zone plays they still have the speed and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.390 
zone plays they still have the speed and
athleticism<00:03:20.870> in<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.319> backfield<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:22.160> pop

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
athleticism in the backfield to pop

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.580 
athleticism in the backfield to pop
those<00:03:22.579> long<00:03:22.849> runs<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.599> Chris<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.170> lot<00:03:24.319> of<00:03:24.410> chris

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
those long runs so Chris a lot of chris

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.949 
those long runs so Chris a lot of chris
johnson's<00:03:24.980> runs<00:03:25.250> come<00:03:25.549> from<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.269> inside<00:03:26.720> so

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
johnson's runs come from the inside so

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.120 
johnson's runs come from the inside so
you<00:03:27.019> have<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.319> make<00:03:27.440> sure<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.650> protect<00:03:27.799> the
