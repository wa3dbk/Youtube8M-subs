00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
beetles but um I kind of rearrange you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.320 
beetles but um I kind of rearrange you
know<00:00:19.140> I'll<00:00:19.260> get<00:00:19.470> into<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.710> later<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you start out it's gonna be the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.109 
you start out it's gonna be the
mealworms<00:00:27.769> with<00:00:28.769> some<00:00:29.010> Quaker<00:00:29.550> Oats<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
mealworms with some Quaker Oats in I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.730 
mealworms with some Quaker Oats in I
just<00:00:30.330> get<00:00:30.539> them<00:00:30.689> cuz<00:00:30.900> they're<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> cheapest

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
just get them cuz they're the cheapest

just get them cuz they're the cheapest
and<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.610> sort<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> carrots<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.290> their

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and I sort of carrots in for their

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.490 
and I sort of carrots in for their
moisture<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.250> they<00:00:35.730> eat<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.390> way<00:00:36.719> then

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
moisture and they eat that way then

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.229 
moisture and they eat that way then
they'll<00:00:37.860> start<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> shut<00:00:38.430> their<00:00:38.610> skin<00:00:39.000> and

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
they'll start to shut their skin and

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.060 
they'll start to shut their skin and
turn<00:00:40.200> into<00:00:40.530> pupae<00:00:41.239> which<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.510> put<00:00:42.960> down<00:00:43.469> here

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
turn into pupae which I put down here

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220 
turn into pupae which I put down here
but<00:00:44.610> once<00:00:44.969> again<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.960> first

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
but once again this is the one you first

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.510 
but once again this is the one you first
start<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.340> they'll<00:00:47.670> turn<00:00:47.940> into<00:00:48.120> beetles

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
start out then they'll turn into beetles

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.069 
start out then they'll turn into beetles
which<00:00:50.520> go<00:00:50.850> right<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> ton<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
which go right here and I have a ton of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.880 
which go right here and I have a ton of
beetles<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.280> um<00:00:53.690> since<00:00:54.690> pupae<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.469> start<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
beetles but um since pupae you start to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.270 
beetles but um since pupae you start to
not<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.340> many<00:00:56.930> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.170> small<00:00:58.620> me<00:00:58.829> ORMs

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
not get that many this is small me ORMs

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
not get that many this is small me ORMs
this<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> medium<00:01:00.329> mealworms<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.170> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
this is medium mealworms and then this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
this is medium mealworms and then this
is<00:01:01.530> beetles<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> keep<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.760> pupae<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.449> this

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
is beetles and I keep my pupae in this

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.789 
is beetles and I keep my pupae in this
container<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.409> they<00:01:04.619> turn<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.890> beetles<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.700> um

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
container so they turn to beetles so um

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.320 
container so they turn to beetles so um
yeah<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.560> put<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.580> carrots<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.090> they

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
yeah so you just put the carrots in they

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.679 
yeah so you just put the carrots in they
eat<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:14.430> Quaker<00:01:14.820> Oats<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.330> and

eat it up and you put Quaker Oats in and
they<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:16.650> start<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.250> bigger<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.729> bigger

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
they look start to get bigger and bigger

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
they look start to get bigger and bigger
until<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:19.020> finally<00:01:19.259> turn<00:01:19.619> into<00:01:19.860> pupae<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
until they finally turn into pupae and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.770 
until they finally turn into pupae and
you<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> bring<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> pupae<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:24.600> want

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780

you want to bring the pupae out you want
to<00:01:24.869> bring<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> pupae<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.740> before<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:27.360> as

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
weeks you you'll start to see the pupae

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.920 
weeks you you'll start to see the pupae
turn<00:01:49.710> brown<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:51.270> when<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.659> hatch
