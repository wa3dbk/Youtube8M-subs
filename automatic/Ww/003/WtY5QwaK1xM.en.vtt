there's also a dongle to go with the
backbone<00:01:26.460> themselves<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.479> they're<00:01:27.689> not

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
backbone themselves so they're not

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.319 
backbone themselves so they're not
pollutant<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.530> anything<00:01:28.909> they<00:01:29.909> use<00:01:30.150> this

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
pollutant or anything they use this

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.249

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
but we'll see how these work out um I

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.220 
but we'll see how these work out um I
guess<00:03:22.160> how<00:03:22.460> I<00:03:22.730> have<00:03:23.270> some<00:03:23.510> online<00:03:23.750> games

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
guess how I have some online games

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.500 
guess how I have some online games
though<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.710> can<00:03:24.740> let<00:03:25.520> you<00:03:25.550> guys<00:03:25.790> know<00:03:26.120> how<00:03:26.150> it

though so I can let you guys know how it

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.140 
though so I can let you guys know how it
sounds<00:03:26.960> when<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:28.010> guess<00:03:28.430> communicating<00:03:29.030> with

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
sounds when I guess communicating with

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.110 
sounds when I guess communicating with
others<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:30.610> definitely<00:03:31.610> think<00:03:31.700> we<00:03:31.820> got<00:03:31.970> some

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
others I definitely think we got some

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.380 
others I definitely think we got some
insight<00:03:32.510> on<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.750> once<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.260> can<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:34.100> know<00:03:34.390> once

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
insight on that once I can you know once

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.090 
insight on that once I can you know once
I<00:03:35.450> start<00:03:35.660> using<00:03:35.810> these<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.350> get<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.590> review<00:03:36.920> up

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
I start using these and get a review up

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.410 
I start using these and get a review up
as<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.150> can<00:03:38.270> see<00:03:38.450> here<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.710> have<00:03:39.980> your<00:03:40.250> volume

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
as you can see here you have your volume

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.930 
as you can see here you have your volume
control<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:41.770> can<00:03:42.770> just<00:03:42.980> slide<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.580> up<00:03:43.730> and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
control you can just slide it up and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.510 
control you can just slide it up and
down<00:03:44.300> so<00:03:45.140> that's<00:03:45.260> pretty<00:03:45.530> nice<00:03:45.710> it's<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.400> a

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
down so that's pretty nice it's in a

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.970 
down so that's pretty nice it's in a
pretty<00:03:46.700> good<00:03:46.880> spot<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.420> can<00:03:47.600> go<00:03:48.500> behind<00:03:48.710> the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
pretty good spot you can go behind the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.660 
pretty good spot you can go behind the
air<00:03:49.540> here<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.690> have<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.260> mic<00:03:52.100> as<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.430> said

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
air here you have the mic as I said

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.410 
air here you have the mic as I said
before<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:55.100> it<00:03:55.280> sounds<00:03:55.700> pretty<00:03:55.880> far-out

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
before and it sounds pretty far-out

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.660 
before and it sounds pretty far-out
which<00:03:56.930> is<00:03:57.140> I<00:03:57.350> guess<00:03:57.770> good<00:03:57.980> for<00:03:58.220> people<00:03:58.490> who<00:03:58.610> are

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
which is I guess good for people who are

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.150 
which is I guess good for people who are
gonna<00:03:58.820> be<00:03:58.910> using<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.590> and<00:04:00.590> here<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:00.980> have
