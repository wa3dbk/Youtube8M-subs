00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.750
 sbs started hours ago 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.039
 welcome to these first results 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.910
 the safety of the netherlands the tension was cut on the small editors of 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.690
 the brand new news section 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.029
 a handful of people in the arm when the first episode of 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.029
 heart of the Netherlands of hypocrisy so everything will come to pass 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.420
 get your new laundry to try in the news 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.510
 no longer the people who dared to officially have boats over in the book 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 to speak 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.790
 but the people who did the news about customers but not everyone was very 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.640
 enthusiastic about the new formula of heart of the netherlands 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.210
 the serious media in particular contributed to the reliability of the program 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.870
 discussion 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.380
 on the newspapers were not tender with their criticism 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.770
 we miss seeing a lot cheaper 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.260
 the sense of threat a sense of contempt for 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.590
 otherwise missing this is not too much on the knees on the neighbors that went 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.600
 sit in front of the citizens so that is possible, of course, this is already 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.960
 was engaged in 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.650
 what politics the hague 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.330
 but it is precisely this distinctive approach that now appears ten years after the start of it 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.630
 program to be the success of the program 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.340
 because in addition to paying attention to the major national news events so often 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 for the Netherlands always bad news that touches people 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040
 now take the death of meindert tjoelker in 97 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.310
 This example of senseless violence unleashed a wave of violence throughout the country 

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:40.999
 indignation the first silent trip in the netherlands is a fact the show tennis 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.450
 the sorrow i didn't know it was like that in a machine 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.700
 I have my wife my mother for a month earlier 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.700
 4 but the mariakerk is internet stores 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.360
 therefore not clear 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.550
 also the story of a 3d that is movie 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.220
 he suffers from a rare metabolic disease 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.149
 Only the operation in America will occur 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.270
 but the insurance of good news soon from his mother in heart 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.140
 of the netherlands the insurance company is still tackling 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.140
 our viewers also give money to help him 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.349
 that's he he put his arrested for riots 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.839
 a very good one 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.139
 provoke much attention to various cases of 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.300
 animal abuse 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.109
 as it looks now abdoul article 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.109
 chased the car to death they must be that spontaneous oscar 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.819
 very much against it 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.019
 why remarkable 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.419
 stories pass 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:42.539
 this is the home of tom leezer 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.699
 the neighbor's house stood here the police were concerned about everything 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.839
 his part 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:49.769
 we have to take a look 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.569
 for Dutch interests 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.859
 I'm not happy about it 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.859
 the fire department and training 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:11.079
 I think it's wonderful to watch Jacob van Dijk shooting each other 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.719
 he took a look 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.719
 the year the news and 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.960
 have the Dutch say 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.920
 I am curious 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.269
 our fellow countryman simone year 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.869
 to understand 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.869
 that has been the case for years recently, according to the ratings 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.539
 only 76,000 people watch the program on the first day 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.449
 that number has now increased more than tenfold 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.619
 every night no less than ten and six million people are glued to the tube 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.290
 and of course we are proud of that 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.419
 that says the order now seems to realize that it is now one step closer to the 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.449
 people is not that crazy 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:50.689
 therefor 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.049
 it was again with a very unpleasant opinion 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.730
 the heart of the netherlands beat in culture amsterdam or in politics the hague 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.659
 the heart of the netherlands in the twelve provinces among the ns people who are there 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.490
 live here and not see that once in the Randstad already happened 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.680
 across the full breadth of Dutch television journalism throughout it 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.320
 The prestigious ones came past the two today or as at network or pumping station or 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.090
 believe or rtl news 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.039
 those were reporters and desk editors 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.020
 the trees are at the heart of the Netherlands 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.419
 and those people who tackle it have acquired the profile and that they do 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.680
 now apply to those other programs 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.319
 that is natural 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.090
 a delight to be famous 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.810
 at least we are also planning for the next ten years, I have a lot 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.810
 enthusiasm and commitment to sit on top of the news 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.830
 everyone is fighting a contribution to the debate 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.539
 he got up last week 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.839
 in the heart of the netherlands close the first rush hour and then as your parents 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:17.769
 with, among other things, the death of Prince Bernard, a couple was appointed 

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:20.349
 days 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:21.839
 for our editors it is not childish
