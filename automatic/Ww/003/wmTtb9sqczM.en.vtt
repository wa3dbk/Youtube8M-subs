00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.960
 ah 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.180
 Y 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.970
 today I come to talk about freedom 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.650
 freedom that we give ourselves not the one that we 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.990
 we remove that I do not want to mention it 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.539
 the freedom that my mom and my 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.910
 Dad when I was little with curlers 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.390
 little ones what I can talk about 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.460
 write poems and draw freedom 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.920
 that is my lama every morning in my 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.230
 profession and it does not leave me out of bed 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 but I hug her and then I let her loose and 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.930
 I share freedom 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.199
 this year I had the opportunity to make a 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.210
 trip and I went to new york and filmed the 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.890
 modern art museum in the moma and a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.440
 sample of bjÃ¶rk the singer I do not know if 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 everyone knows her but I invite her to 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.170
 google to listen or listen with those 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.879
 songs and I saw it 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.410
 clearly do not drink a coffee with milk 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.500
 connection that I would have loved but 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.130
 the life the life in its letters in its 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.600
 melodies in his songs I saw her in her 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.030
 magic in her screams and it was like that she and I 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.729
 sitting at the polka dot tablecloth with 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.850
 his hands holding on to the cup he was making 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.860
 of horizon line for our eyes 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.740
 that floated like ships on 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.270
 york songs she shared with me her 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.920
 freedom 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.060
 in the world of a fixed sample 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.740
 incredible in thousand 880 thousand 990 molding 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.750
 good wagon chagall picasso 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.490
 I have to confess that I'm not a 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.799
 in love with picasso 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.299
 however when I see how wildly 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.939
 it is different from itself again and again 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.250
 we are he and I sitting at the table this 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.039
 Only me alone with both hands clasped 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.130
 to the cup he sitting on the chair 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.750
 reclined back swinging 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.090
 thinking that grabbed that I am me 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.090
 cup who shares his freedom 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.999
 The last time I traveled by taxi had 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.330
 a recurring situation so to speak 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:13.459
 somehow and that taxi drivers is me 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.019
 they commented that before they all spoke to them 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.660
 I told them their stories that they were 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.030
 the psychologists of the town but that 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.819
 apparently now nobody speaks to them 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.690
 that we are all with cell phones and not 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.330
 we speak to you 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.770
 and before the repetition they are and I spoke to them 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.540
 when there were no cell phones but 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.400
 before the repetition of this situation 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.150
 I said ok 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.890
 let's talk for a taxi good morning 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.390
 I'm going to advance and paraguay that cold 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.220
 It seems that in the afternoon it gets more 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.180
 I do not know if I hear something on the radio 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:51.490
 there the taxi driver turns around and looks at me 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.580
 silence tells me I am mute I do not speak 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.210
 but if I listen 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.160
 And so Elisha sat at the table the 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.320
 praised with both hands to the cup 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.410
 warm with both hands clasped 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.840
 the head thinking I speak I do not speak 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.760
 I decide to speak to him and he during all the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.790
 trip answers me with a fantastic 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.500
 say it with mime he shared me his 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.520
 freedom 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.950
 my grandmother 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.130
 my grandmother and I are always sitting 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.030
 to the tablecloth flower to two cups of 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:29.720
 porcelain of 1800 there is no color in the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.870
 nature that my grandmother does not you 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.490
 entrepreneur that she does not put on there is no 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.030
 no longer dare give 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.180
 she, with her 92 years old, shares her 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.390
 freedom 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.810
 and now now we are all of us 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.400
 sitting at the table each with his cup 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.260
 with his story with his daring 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.810
 I want to take advantage of that we are just 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.910

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.880

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.420
 deep I feel that I am thanks to the 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.700
 who dare 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.860
 thanks to those who smile at those who 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.040
 are attentive to those who applaud with 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.080
 excessiveness that the authentic 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.080
 that extend my hand to those who are 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.930
 open-mouthed to those who see the others 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.690
 to those who are dreaming of those who are 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.710
 awake to those who make things 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.060
 they are possible even though they are impossible 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.060
 thank you for sharing that freedom
