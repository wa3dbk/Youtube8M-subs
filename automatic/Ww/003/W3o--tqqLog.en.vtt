00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.430
 as head of the IT department 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.580
 It is my duty to ensure that all network services that are 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.669
 correctly configured 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:14.529
 so then the method for sharing 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.380
 in network files and folders 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.380
 which is very easy to carry out 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.130
 below on how to share with your folders 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.300
 this case 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.569
 the disk is we have a folder 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.240
 to share 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.790
 it's called shared fontes 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.100
 they are going to give 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.030
 right click 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.100
 he often tells me to share with 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 we are going to select specific users 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.620
 then 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.620
 posadas share it with everyone 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.040
 cyrus we create 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.110

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.810

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.360

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.230
 will show us that it has already been shared 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.800

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.930
 below we give you 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.150
 the minister 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.140
 by corroborating that in that folder 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.150
 yes 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.020
 well shared 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.380
 let's give it 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.830

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.940
 a menu 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.310
 pretty good 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.100

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.280
 all tools necessary to manage our 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 computer equipment 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.140
