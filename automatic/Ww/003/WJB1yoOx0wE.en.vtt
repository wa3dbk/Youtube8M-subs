00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.900
 good sounds to a new video as I already 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.320
 you know there is a news out there 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.090
 circulating of two remakes not one of 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.860
 they are final fantasy 12 and another of 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.719
 they are a resident, they know how to explain 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.169
 a little bit in the differences of each 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.999
 one basically in the final remake 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.489
 fantasy 12 good these ads 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:24.310
 basically the songwriter emotion in a 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:26.319
 concert in pittsburgh on saturday at the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.179
 night and good basically said that the 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:30.369
 another in the middle of the final fantasy 12 is 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.619
 on the way, I'm almost convinced 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.050
 that that meant remake month 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.140
 remastering because it would seem to me 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.429
 quite weird that square enix now 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.370
 put also with a final remake 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.679
 fantasy 12 I would like super mega mega 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.660
 weird and the final remastering 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.399
 fantasy 12 we have already spoken so many 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.690
 times they are interested that what 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.820
 want to do what is going to be the next 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.199
 step after 10 and I think it's going 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.570
 to leave but a remake I think it quite 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.670
 difficult and I think it has been an ally 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.949
 of the composer who will not know 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.780
 distinguish between a remake and a 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.339
 possibly remastering or there will be 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.720
 understood more and is a remake well 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.490
 you are welcome 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.310
 that is I guess people because 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.670
 will want us final fantasy before 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.590
 before and 12 possibly the 6 is very 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.090
 undervalued I do not understand I do not understand 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.640
 because I imagine because I do not play it 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.530
 many people but 6 is a final 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.470
 very good fantasy to make a 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.180
 remake the daily and good to update the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.340
 mechanical now just what you want 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.700
 see you in unforgettable history and some 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.050
 honestly sincerely and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.730
 Well people by popular demand 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.750
 after 7 , I get excited 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.119
 download 9 or 8 but good for 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.950
 now just in case today is announced 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.630
 the remake of final fantasy 12 for now 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.400
 it's the remake we can not call it 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.260
 remastering because this man then 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.570
 what he has said is this is that it is a 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.509
 remake then another resident 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.920
 evil 2 so it will be a remake like this 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.390
 thinking about doing it again one of the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.280
 workers of capcom because it contributed the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.050
 idea and other putting new mechanics 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.440
 changing some things and others to see 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.229
 how like as the board then 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.200
 it confirmed it denied it or they accept it 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.090
 or accepted it and it seems that yes it 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.740
 have accepted the acceptance of the project and 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.230
 It seems that inside Capcom, since 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.900
 they would be working at least very 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.030
 very early phase in a remake of 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.610
 Resident Evil 2 that we will see throughout 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.530
 of the years is quite possibly so 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.560
 nothing we do not know if they will have mechanical 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.660
 like the ones I had in the first network 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.840
 the resident of points of yesteryear or yes 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.040
 will have new or how it will be but what 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.050
 Clearly the people what they want is 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.580
 a survival horror and if you take the name 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.050
 recently you have to do it very 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.810
 well because it's one of the best in the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.210
 saga along with the 3 so they have to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.580
 do it perfectly in the case of 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.350
 Resident Evil 2 100% sure yes 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.000
 that would be a remake you know they are 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.080
 doing remastering of both 1 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.230
 like 0 and this yes that would be a remake 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.060
 completely does not do it from scratch and 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.640
 good to adapt it to the times that are 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.260
 or good to change some things and 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.850
 you also have to understand with a first and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.170
 an acceleration weapon are two things 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.970
 different the first is to return it to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.319
 do and a remastering is 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.090
 remastering the basics 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:20.969
 in polishing different things improve 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.159
 some video options and so on 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:26.670
 touch nothing of the original simply 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:29.159
 graphics sound and there is already a remake is 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.200
 Do it again from scratch 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.900
 even if you want to put some history of 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.359
 more then you can logically but when 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.969
 everything else then touch it to adapt it to 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.639
 the current situation so we'll see to 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.739
 see two remakes that are there pending 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.260
 one that seems more an explanation branch 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.090
 that one remake and another that is a remake 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.040
 remake that I imagine then that people 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.239
 is the version to know so nothing 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.500
 guys this has been everything and nothing we 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.769
 we see in the next video until the 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.769
 next
