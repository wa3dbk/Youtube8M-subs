one features like more guns and also

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.859 
one features like more guns and also
since<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.789> magtec<00:00:21.180> line<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.630> comes

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
since this is the magtec line it comes

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.820 
since this is the magtec line it comes
with<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.130> claw<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.550> gun<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:25.019> combination

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
with a claw and gun like combination

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.900 
with a claw and gun like combination
it's<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.609> thing<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> front<00:00:30.289> there<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.380> go

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
it's this thing in the front there we go

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.319 
it's this thing in the front there we go
so<00:00:33.710> this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> car<00:00:35.280> itself<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:35.969> actually

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
so this is a car itself it's actually

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.380 
so this is a car itself it's actually
modeled<00:00:36.750> after<00:00:36.870> our<00:00:37.170> NASCAR<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:38.010> 48<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> believe

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
modeled after our NASCAR a 48 I believe

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.420 
modeled after our NASCAR a 48 I believe
is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> Jimmie<00:00:40.110> Johnson's<00:00:40.739> car<00:00:42.020> it's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.430> Chevy

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
is a Jimmie Johnson's car it's a Chevy

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.900 
is a Jimmie Johnson's car it's a Chevy
Impala<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:46.340> that's<00:00:47.340> why<00:00:47.489> there's<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
Impala and that's why there's like the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.979 
Impala and that's why there's like the
NASCAR<00:00:48.360> logo<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> box<00:00:49.260> which<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.460> guy

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
right there anyway so going back to the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.080 
right there anyway so going back to the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
mech-tech so basically if you push if

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.280 
mech-tech so basically if you push if
you<00:03:36.980> pull<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.370> lever<00:03:37.579> right<00:03:37.880> here
