00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.780 
drill our trillion for your spike spike
it<00:01:02.530> in<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:02.920> then<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.159> third<00:01:03.309> rail<00:01:03.580> we've

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
it in and then the third rail we've

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.000 
it in and then the third rail we've
added<00:01:03.970> in<00:01:04.239> actually<00:01:04.659> with<00:01:04.780> brass<00:01:04.989> nails<00:01:05.680> put

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
added in actually with brass nails put

added in actually with brass nails put
them<00:01:06.189> in<00:01:06.369> and<00:01:06.580> soldered<00:01:06.939> our<00:01:07.090> third<00:01:07.299> rail<00:01:07.510> to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
them in and soldered our third rail to

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.920 
them in and soldered our third rail to
that<00:01:07.900> and<00:01:08.890> brought<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.220> around<00:01:09.510> okay<00:01:10.510> so<00:01:10.570> is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
that and brought it around okay so is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
the is the trolley are the elevated

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.149 
the is the trolley are the elevated
actually<00:01:13.840> running<00:01:14.049> off<00:01:14.289> of<00:01:14.320> third<00:01:14.649> rail<00:01:14.859> power

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
actually running off of third rail power

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.940 
actually running off of third rail power
it's<00:01:15.789> not<00:01:16.060> running<00:01:16.359> off<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.630> rail<00:01:17.049> power<00:01:17.380> here

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
it's not running off the rail power here

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.819 
it's not running off the rail power here
but<00:01:18.369> we<00:01:18.850> can<00:01:19.090> do<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.600> one<00:01:20.469> of<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.649> big

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
but we can do it and one of the big

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:21.959 
but we can do it and one of the big
reasons<00:01:20.859> of<00:01:21.250> course<00:01:21.369> we<00:01:21.520> have<00:01:21.609> to<00:01:21.700> bring<00:01:21.850> the

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
reasons of course we have to bring the

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.060 
reasons of course we have to bring the
stuff<00:01:22.149> here<00:01:22.359> when<00:01:22.479> a<00:01:22.509> trailer<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.289> with<00:01:23.439> 120

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
stuff here when a trailer and with 120

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.739 
stuff here when a trailer and with 120
degrees<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.549> temperature<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.149> trailer<00:01:25.390> I

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:25.749 
degrees the temperature in the trailer I

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:26.910 
degrees the temperature in the trailer I
think<00:01:25.929> bouncing<00:01:26.320> around<00:01:26.409> made<00:01:26.679> a<00:01:26.710> little

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
think bouncing around made a little

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.270 
think bouncing around made a little
trouble<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.929> stayed<00:01:29.170> together<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:29.799> we're

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
trouble but it stayed together so we're

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.109 
trouble but it stayed together so we're

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
to work with it's strong it sets fairly

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.770 
to work with it's strong it sets fairly
quick<00:04:58.490> so<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.670> can<00:04:58.760> hold<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.480> within<00:04:59.600> a

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
quick so you can hold it and within a

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.050 
quick so you can hold it and within a
couple<00:04:59.810> seconds<00:05:00.410> of<00:05:00.560> bezel<00:05:00.890> stay<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.790> stays<00:05:02.030> a

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
couple seconds of bezel stay it stays a

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.940 
couple seconds of bezel stay it stays a
little<00:05:02.270> rubbery<00:05:02.720> for<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.080> day<00:05:03.290> or<00:05:03.470> two<00:05:03.500> maybe

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
little rubbery for a day or two maybe

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.280 
little rubbery for a day or two maybe
and<00:05:04.700> then<00:05:04.790> she'll<00:05:05.090> set<00:05:05.360> up<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.720> lot<00:05:06.020> harder

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
and then she'll set up a lot harder

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.470 
and then she'll set up a lot harder
later<00:05:06.620> but<00:05:07.310> say<00:05:07.670> a<00:05:07.700> month<00:05:07.940> from<00:05:08.030> now<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.240> want

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
later but say a month from now you want

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.060 
later but say a month from now you want
to<00:05:08.570> go<00:05:08.660> back<00:05:08.810> and<00:05:08.870> take<00:05:09.200> that<00:05:09.380> apart<00:05:09.710> take<00:05:09.980> a

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
to go back and take that apart take a

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.070 
to go back and take that apart take a
heat<00:05:10.280> gun<00:05:10.460> heat<00:05:10.760> it<00:05:10.880> up<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.240> it'll<00:05:11.810> come<00:05:12.050> right

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
heat gun heat it up and it'll come right

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.700 
heat gun heat it up and it'll come right
apart<00:05:12.790> so<00:05:13.790> it<00:05:13.910> makes<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.150> really<00:05:14.450> great<00:05:14.980> okay

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
apart so it makes it really great okay

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.580 
apart so it makes it really great okay

we had prohibition period was very

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.020 
we had prohibition period was very
strong<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:39.800> throughout<00:05:40.220> our<00:05:40.430> area<00:05:40.460> a<00:05:40.760> lot<00:05:40.910> of

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
strong in throughout our area a lot of

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.150 
strong in throughout our area a lot of
rum<00:05:41.210> running<00:05:41.450> so<00:05:42.230> that's<00:05:42.560> kind<00:05:42.830> of<00:05:42.890> how<00:05:43.010> this

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
rum running so that's kind of how this

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.370 
rum running so that's kind of how this
all<00:05:43.340> started<00:05:43.540> evolved<00:05:44.540> to<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:44.840> Purple<00:05:45.200> Gang

Al<00:05:45.710> Capone<00:05:46.240> Chicago<00:05:47.240> which<00:05:47.540> create<00:05:48.230> got<00:05:48.530> this

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
Al Capone Chicago which create got this

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.710 
Al Capone Chicago which create got this
started<00:05:49.220> now<00:05:49.460> we're<00:05:50.000> carrying<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.420> even

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
started now we're carrying that even

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.330 
started now we're carrying that even
farther<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.320> that's<00:05:51.650> pretty<00:05:51.860> much<00:05:51.980> going<00:05:52.280> to

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
farther and that's pretty much going to

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.890 
farther and that's pretty much going to
be<00:05:52.400> my<00:05:52.670> heir<00:05:52.880> safe<00:05:53.270> 1902<00:05:55.090> 1945<00:05:56.090> but<00:05:56.630> a<00:05:56.660> lot<00:05:56.840> of

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
be my heir safe 1902 1945 but a lot of

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.480 
be my heir safe 1902 1945 but a lot of
these<00:05:57.110> structures<00:05:57.350> end<00:05:57.800> up<00:05:57.920> staying<00:05:58.160> a<00:05:58.340> lot

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
these structures end up staying a lot

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.730 
these structures end up staying a lot
longer<00:05:58.730> so<00:05:58.910> with<00:05:59.600> added<00:05:59.930> in<00:06:00.080> new<00:06:00.260> pieces<00:06:00.500> you

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
longer so with added in new pieces you

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.980 
longer so with added in new pieces you
cannot<00:06:01.010> come<00:06:01.220> up<00:06:01.340> a<00:06:01.430> lot<00:06:01.520> newer<00:06:01.820> than<00:06:01.850> that<00:06:02.180> so

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
cannot come up a lot newer than that so

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.400 
cannot come up a lot newer than that so
that's<00:06:03.110> where<00:06:03.380> we're<00:06:03.500> at<00:06:04.000> all<00:06:05.000> right<00:06:05.240> I<00:06:05.870> think

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
that's where we're at all right I think

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.750 
that's where we're at all right I think
that's<00:06:06.560> basically<00:06:06.920> all<00:06:07.040> the<00:06:07.250> questions<00:06:07.610> I've

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
that's basically all the questions I've

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.090
