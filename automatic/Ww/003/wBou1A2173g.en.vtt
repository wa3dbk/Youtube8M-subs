several chips that come with it as you
can<00:01:19.670> see<00:01:19.850> we'll<00:01:20.090> take<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.270> closer<00:01:20.540> look<00:01:20.690> at<00:01:20.990> one

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
specific name let me see what those

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.590 
specific name let me see what those
names<00:01:27.860> are<00:01:28.010> I<00:01:28.040> know<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.220> there's<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.729> turbo

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
names are I know that there's the turbo

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.390 
names are I know that there's the turbo
Turtles<00:01:30.080> that's<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.560> red<00:01:30.710> team<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.250> Auto

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
so we'll take a closer look at the turbo

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.040 
so we'll take a closer look at the turbo
Turtles<00:01:36.260> now<00:01:37.160> each<00:01:37.670> faction<00:01:38.360> comes<00:01:38.840> with<00:01:39.020> a

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
Turtles now each faction comes with a

that type three small pieces two

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.910 
that type three small pieces two
rectangular<00:01:46.940> pieces<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.810> then<00:01:48.320> your<00:01:48.500> shooter

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
rectangular pieces and then your shooter

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.540 
rectangular pieces and then your shooter
as<00:01:49.100> well<00:01:49.520> as<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.700> die<00:01:49.970> you<00:01:50.840> also<00:01:51.080> get<00:01:51.550> energy

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
as well as a die you also get energy

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.130 
as well as a die you also get energy
tokens<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.090> your<00:01:53.240> type<00:01:53.479> usually<00:01:53.750> you'll<00:01:54.020> play

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
tokens of your type usually you'll play

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.210 
tokens of your type usually you'll play
with<00:01:54.170> two<00:01:54.440> although<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.830> can<00:01:54.950> play<00:01:55.070> with

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
with two although you can play with

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.430 
with two although you can play with
three<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.850> then<00:01:56.390> perhaps<00:01:56.600> like<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.080> red<00:01:57.229> team

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
three and then perhaps like the red team

base and then you're ready to go on your
turn<00:02:16.130> you're<00:02:16.280> gonna<00:02:16.400> roll<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> die<00:02:16.940> if<00:02:17.299> you<00:02:18.080> roll

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
turn you're gonna roll a die if you roll

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.560 
turn you're gonna roll a die if you roll
something<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.610> shows<00:02:19.850> one<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.209> your<00:02:20.330> chips

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
something that shows one of your chips

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.509 
something that shows one of your chips
that's<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.019> chip<00:02:21.260> you'll<00:02:21.470> shoot<00:02:21.709> you'll<00:02:22.370> take

that's the chip you'll shoot you'll take

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.650 
that's the chip you'll shoot you'll take
your<00:02:22.640> shooter<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.150> shoot<00:02:23.299> it<00:02:23.390> just<00:02:23.480> like

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
your shooter and shoot it just like

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.770 
your shooter and shoot it just like
tiddlywinks<00:02:24.260> at<00:02:24.700> somebody<00:02:25.700> else<00:02:25.880> now<00:02:26.269> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
tiddlywinks at somebody else now the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.199 
tiddlywinks at somebody else now the
problem<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:27.620> have<00:02:27.920> with<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.700> game<00:02:29.030> is

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
problem that we have with this game is

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.400 
problem that we have with this game is
that<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:31.760> need<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> tablecloth<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:33.080> guess

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
that the you need a tablecloth I guess

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.539 
that the you need a tablecloth I guess
it's<00:02:33.530> not<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.650> prom<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.280> just<00:02:34.400> need

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
it's not a prom but you just need

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.220 
it's not a prom but you just need
something<00:02:34.790> because<00:02:35.209> as<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:35.930> see<00:02:35.989> it

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
something because as you can see it

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.890 
something because as you can see it
doesn't<00:02:36.380> jump<00:02:36.739> very<00:02:36.920> much<00:02:37.480> if<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.780> get

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
doesn't jump very much if you get

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.740 
doesn't jump very much if you get
something<00:02:39.110> that's<00:02:39.350> thicker<00:02:39.769> let's<00:02:40.700> show<00:02:41.180> a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
something that's thicker let's show a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.229 
something that's thicker let's show a
thicker<00:02:42.470> this<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.310> almost<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.580> blanket<00:02:44.000> here

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
thicker this is almost a blanket here

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.590 
thicker this is almost a blanket here
and<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:45.049> shoot<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.440> chip<00:02:45.650> here<00:02:46.610> you'll<00:02:47.360> see

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
and I shoot the chip here you'll see

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.920 
and I shoot the chip here you'll see
that<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:48.500> shoots<00:02:48.769> higher<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:50.360> also<00:02:50.480> farther

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
that it shoots higher and also farther

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.560 
that it shoots higher and also farther
but<00:02:51.670> sometimes<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.850> might<00:02:52.940> not<00:02:53.150> shoot<00:02:53.390> well

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
but sometimes it might not shoot well

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.780 
but sometimes it might not shoot well
enough<00:02:53.810> at<00:02:53.930> all<00:02:54.100> but<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.220> will<00:02:55.280> always<00:02:55.610> shoot

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
enough at all but it will always shoot

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.770 
enough at all but it will always shoot
higher<00:02:56.030> when<00:02:56.299> you<00:02:56.420> have<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.630> on<00:02:56.690> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
higher when you have it on the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.880 
higher when you have it on the
tablecloth<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.380> don't<00:02:57.590> know<00:02:57.650> what<00:02:57.799> the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
tablecloth I don't know what the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.100 
tablecloth I don't know what the
reasoning<00:02:58.280> for<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.730> is<00:02:58.880> but<00:02:59.810> what<00:02:59.959> you're

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
reasoning for that is but what you're

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.180 
reasoning for that is but what you're
trying<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.350> do<00:03:00.470> with<00:03:00.560> your<00:03:00.709> chips<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.100> you're

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
trying to do with your chips is you're

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.710 
trying to do with your chips is you're
trying<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.400> do<00:03:01.489> two<00:03:01.670> things<00:03:01.880> you're<00:03:02.450> trying<00:03:02.660> to

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
trying to do two things you're trying to

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.880 
trying to do two things you're trying to
get<00:03:02.780> them<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.019> land<00:03:03.200> on<00:03:03.350> your<00:03:03.500> opponent's

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
get them to land on your opponent's

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.920 
get them to land on your opponent's
chips<00:03:04.130> if<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.430> do<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:04.790> you've<00:03:04.970> squad<00:03:05.420> one<00:03:05.840> of

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
chips if you do that you've squad one of

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.509 
chips if you do that you've squad one of
your<00:03:06.049> opponents<00:03:06.410> or<00:03:06.680> killed<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.190> basically

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
your opponents or killed it basically

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.030 
your opponents or killed it basically
and<00:03:07.880> it's<00:03:08.209> removed<00:03:08.540> from<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.810> game<00:03:09.019> even<00:03:09.829> if

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
and it's removed from the game even if

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.630 
and it's removed from the game even if
you<00:03:10.100> land<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.519> just<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.790> tiny<00:03:10.910> bit<00:03:11.150> it's<00:03:11.450> out

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
you land on it just a tiny bit it's out

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.789 
you land on it just a tiny bit it's out
if<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.959> main<00:03:15.140> thing<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.410> want<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.680> do

your chip also comes back near your own
base<00:03:26.689> then<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.739> second<00:03:28.040> chip<00:03:28.220> then<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.909> base

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
base then the second chip then the base

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.059 
base then the second chip then the base
is<00:03:29.269> damaged<00:03:29.659> and<00:03:30.049> if<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:30.590> hit<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.739> damaged

the last person alive is the winner all
the<00:03:36.739> pieces<00:03:37.280> are<00:03:37.549> basically<00:03:38.180> sent<00:03:38.799> identical

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
the pieces are basically sent identical

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.880 
the pieces are basically sent identical
the<00:03:40.370> blue<00:03:41.120> large<00:03:41.720> piece<00:03:42.079> which<00:03:42.470> looks<00:03:42.680> kind<00:03:42.829> of

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
the blue large piece which looks kind of

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.740 
the blue large piece which looks kind of
go<00:03:42.980> away<00:03:43.040> Oh<00:03:43.159> on<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.489> red<00:03:43.640> turtle<00:03:43.849> same<00:03:44.510> thing

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
go away Oh on the red turtle same thing

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.839 
go away Oh on the red turtle same thing
the<00:03:44.989> only<00:03:45.170> difference<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.590> size<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:46.670> bigger

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
the only difference is size the bigger

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.399 
the only difference is size the bigger
ones<00:03:47.060> don't<00:03:47.180> shoot<00:03:47.450> as<00:03:47.599> far<00:03:47.810> but<00:03:48.079> then<00:03:48.230> they

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
ones don't shoot as far but then they

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.740 
ones don't shoot as far but then they
also<00:03:48.560> cover<00:03:48.890> more<00:03:49.159> area<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:50.480> only<00:03:50.659> thing

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
also cover more area the only thing

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.289 
also cover more area the only thing
that's<00:03:50.900> special<00:03:51.019> is<00:03:51.530> each<00:03:51.859> dye<00:03:52.159> has<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.459> side

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
that's special is each dye has a side
