00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.049
 new technology builds your video this time 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.269
 there is a very unusual video 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.620
 number one we have an unboxing here 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.889
 of a product that I ever had 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 unpacked and b of a product 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.230
 or from a package what almost three years 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.810
 had to wait again now 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.720
 to be unpacked and that is one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 Warning to you makes something directly available 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.189
 It's not like me on the long run 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.230
 the short story about three 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.130
 years, the technology woman has the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 assembled a gaming pc 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.719
 and then there was a really cool 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.180
 motor offer from alternate 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.180
 At that time there was the samsung syncmaster 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.309
 s-300 pi times thumb two pieces for the price 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.440
 of a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.809
 of course I struck and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.820
 actually only needed a monitor 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 that was this one I have 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.140
 Unpacked everything was closed 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.350
 foot then I am a shadow 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.729
 it should be noticed on the device 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 you should not do this here now 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.659
 a tip if you have a monitor 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.430
 you do not know how close the display is 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.470
 so it could be under the surface 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.990
 always cut very carefully 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.090
 well, the shadow I noticed 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 What has the technology you have built? 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.250
 sent a monitor cautious 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 the here and just has the other 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 unpacked and reused what I did 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.159
 now not know alternate has 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.810
 every monitor repairs with others 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.570
 I do not know I have 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.670
 because of alternate never anything more 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.110
 I've heard of the written 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.610
 said people with my monitor 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.320
 what is not right there is such a darker one 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.790
 spot 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.610
 I sent it back to you 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.079
 has arranged looks something makes it so 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.619
 send me the shipping sticker for dhl 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.210
 But then I got that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.100
 I just do not sing and sing 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.409
 sent back soundless and I have 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.290
 Now I do not know if they are simple 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.640
 Exchange monitor packed 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.280
 Optimize completely new monitor out 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.750
 have packed 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.880
 if I look at this on the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.870
 a page 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.459
 the manuals are yes again they are 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.300
 still gone 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.590
 at least not yet torn up 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.200
 I think I have you then too 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.550
 the thing completely wireless 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.110
 sent back there are still the nubs 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.420
 on which it could of course also 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.650
 his vga cable i did not know that 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.620
 the other one clearly has one 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.480
 vga-port and a dvi port what now 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.010
 against it again speaks that the new device 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.819
 is of course the power supply here what 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.700
 unwrapped's not even the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.090
 paper clips are drum and above all 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.670
 why i have the two power supplies now 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.920
 I am now with yogurt today 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.360
 to inquire and apply nowadays 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.099
 ask people what do you have to me 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.440
 they probably knew cleverly 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.660
 itself no longer which power connection 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.519
 the thing takes while I take everything 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.840
 back 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:05.090
 this is the one I am now 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.670
 But confused what the power plug 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.799
 once with adapter oh no now 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.680
 confusion is enlightened is quite a 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.170
 normal power supply puts in the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.640
 monitor what only amazes me 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.500
 why am I getting two of them now 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.299
 with clever there probably has one at 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.940
 out are not paying attention at all 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.510
 Well, we'll switch over now 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.530
 of course, throw up the monitor 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.780
 my desk 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.519
 look here is not synonymous 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.940
 Protective film more on the research 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.560
 disconnected here are also scratches in it 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.950
 means I have either original 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.319
 get my monitor back or stop 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.900
 get another return shipment 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.609
 which works perfectly, hopefully 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.920
 I throw the thing on everyone now 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.090
 still fall on my desk 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.090
 and we'll try it 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.840
 so and we have connected s 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.960
 get everything null problemo cable is 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.250
 turn on monitor works well that 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.680
 Anna also done that before 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.990
 Now I have to look because that was 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.810
 was about here in this area 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.090
 this dark shadow and no who 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.120
 Now, just tell Putz 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.130
 that did not matter but I have 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.220
 Try everything possible now 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.740
 I just white background 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.050
 so and I'm sitting right now 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.570
 and here nothing can recognize the 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.930
 my problem is it's gone I am 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.270
 happy have this unboxing 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.250
 almost three years now 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.900
 Of course, I'm happy to be pushed 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.270
 that I do not go to kite right now 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.310
 again with alternate alternate request 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.760
 or at samsung or so clear that would be 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.290
 then futile but now here me 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.700
 I am relieved that I am now 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.350
 not so now that I either 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.580
 others got on the monitor or 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.500
 they somehow got the mistake away 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.360
 I do not have any here 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.070
 black spot more of the illumination 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.750
 mistake or whatever it was 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.900
 I do not light up game again 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.810
 is gone now means for me i can 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.960
 my desk here again 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.450
 redesign and finished that 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.140
 is the setup with me in 2015 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:20.750
 left is the windows 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.760
 gaming pc with me but so too 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.590
 windows play around on it there is a 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.530
 of course no windows 8 I'm still 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.380
 not crazy windows 7 is easy 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.900
 the system of choice in the 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.229
 Windows world just out of it is then the 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.540
 Additional monitor for my trusted macbook 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.610
 air which also jacked up 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.040
 so that I thumb once every three 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.440
 have monitors on top of each other nicely 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.450
 and no i do not know why the camera 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.110
 Now flicker the left monitor 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.960
 captures 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.590
 both times it is the same samsung 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.560
 monitor 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.820
 both are operated at 60 hertz me 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.750
 I probably have no idea 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.280
 Something plays my old 560 Ti 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.660
 graphics card then a bit with 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.470
 the settings for the camera is not 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.630
 compatible 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.310
 why why why no idea 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.480
 In any case, that's the setup with that 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.060
 technology from here 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.150
 or start surfing in his 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.370
 free time you do not expect any 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.840
 traffic like deo resolution of me being 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.000
 Maybe there is something in there 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.560
 Do it, oh yes, and that's rightmost 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.300
 external of a 900 usb microphone I have 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.740
 yes at that time popstar also get here 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.420
 again surreptitiously what I for 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.430
 every now and then also for videos 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.890
 use many questions yes then always 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.930
 why do not you use one with me ? 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.670
 external sound card why do not you film 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.620
 still with a dslr why are you using 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.650
 not just higher mobi versions 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.750
 or why do not you use final cut 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.020
 pro ex just to the right 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:51.860
 the reason is new macbook air from 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.930
 2011 more than 1 1 movie 8.0 liquid 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.060
 Unfortunately , it does not succeed and quite honestly 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.010
 The channel is called technology four 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.600
 I'm glad if I like my videos 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.220
 a little bit cut together 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.430
 here and there times and 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:07.670
 transitions but for more sorry 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.950
 I prefer to play with people 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.560
 the technology rum still as brilliant 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.770
 even better kameraschwenks even better 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.450
 to take pictures and videos with videos 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.710
 rather a little more videos space the 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.130
 then maybe quick and dirty 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:24.020
 come over but fix for the high gloss 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.880
 There are other people in the channels 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.500
 Thanks for watching that should 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.330
 but now it has been done 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.330
 good and bye video bye
