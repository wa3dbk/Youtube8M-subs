I<00:00:26.000> would<00:00:27.000> suggest<00:00:27.810> buying<00:00:28.410> tomatoes<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.429> are

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
I would suggest buying tomatoes that are

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970 
I would suggest buying tomatoes that are
already<00:00:29.970> grown<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.570> tomatoes<00:00:31.529> they're<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
already grown and tomatoes they're a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.910 
already grown and tomatoes they're a
determinant<00:00:32.880> variety<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.440> they<00:00:34.680> are

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
determinant variety that is they are

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.729 
determinant variety that is they are
bushes<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> stay<00:00:36.090> small<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.960> they<00:00:37.500> don't

bushes that stay small and they don't

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.680 
bushes that stay small and they don't
take<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.370> long<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:39.059> mature

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the bottom leaves and you plant it very

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.869 
the bottom leaves and you plant it very
deep<00:00:50.340> because<00:00:51.120> each<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> these<00:00:52.170> hairs

growing up you want them to have very
strong<00:01:03.780> roots<00:01:04.110> take<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.280> plant<00:01:05.549> turn<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
strong roots take your plant turn it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
strong roots take your plant turn it
upside<00:01:06.420> down<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.900> plop<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.380> into<00:01:07.500> your

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
upside down and just plop it into your

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
upside down and just plop it into your
hands<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.549> roots<00:01:08.790> look<00:01:09.090> perfect<00:01:09.659> there's<00:01:10.170> no

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
hands the roots look perfect there's no

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560 
hands the roots look perfect there's no
need<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.860> anything<00:01:11.159> else<00:01:11.580> except<00:01:12.119> put<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
need to do anything else except put it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.060 
need to do anything else except put it
right<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> hole<00:01:13.580> very<00:01:14.580> deep<00:01:15.470> very<00:01:16.470> deep<00:01:16.860> so

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
right in the hole very deep very deep so

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.670 
right in the hole very deep very deep so
that<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> those<00:01:17.700> root<00:01:18.030> hairs<00:01:18.350> turn<00:01:19.350> into

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that all of those root hairs turn into

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.230 
that all of those root hairs turn into
strong<00:01:20.009> roots<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.689> make<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:23.240> basin

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
strong roots and I make a little basin

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.539 
strong roots and I make a little basin
around<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.740> water<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:27.470> suggest<00:01:28.549> some

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
around it for the water I suggest some

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.999 
around it for the water I suggest some
really<00:01:29.790> quick<00:01:30.030> crops<00:01:30.509> around<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.530> for

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
really quick crops around it for

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
really quick crops around it for
instance<00:01:32.369> radishes<00:01:32.970> only<00:01:33.900> take<00:01:34.579> 22<00:01:35.579> days<00:01:36.079> so

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
instance radishes only take 22 days so

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.410 
instance radishes only take 22 days so
what<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> would<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.189> make<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.729> circle<00:01:39.240> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
what I would do then is make a circle a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.719 
what I would do then is make a circle a
little<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.560> finger<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:41.070> around<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
little with your finger go around in a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.389 
little with your finger go around in a
circle<00:01:41.930> make<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> little<00:01:43.290> another<00:01:44.009> little

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
circle make a little another little

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.620 
circle make a little another little
basin<00:01:44.820> take<00:01:45.689> about<00:01:46.460> thirty<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:48.720> seeds

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
basin take about thirty of these seeds

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
basin take about thirty of these seeds
and<00:01:51.630> they're<00:01:51.780> pretty<00:01:52.409> big<00:01:52.680> pretty<00:01:53.040> easy<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and they're pretty big pretty easy to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.810 
and they're pretty big pretty easy to
handle<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:53.970> kids<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:55.009> drop<00:01:56.009> them<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.549> by

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
handle for kids and drop them in one by

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.920 
handle for kids and drop them in one by
one<00:01:57.140> about<00:01:58.140> two<00:01:58.439> inches<00:01:58.680> apart<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.780> can

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
one about two inches apart you can

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.389 
one about two inches apart you can
always<00:02:01.140> send<00:02:01.380> them<00:02:01.500> out<00:02:01.590> later<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> drop

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
always send them out later if you drop

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.069 
always send them out later if you drop
more<00:02:02.640> than<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.290> just<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.619> lightly<00:02:05.159> cover

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
more than one in just very lightly cover

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.279 
more than one in just very lightly cover
the<00:02:07.079> seeds<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:08.209> then<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.899> plant

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the seeds and then I like to plant

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.530 
the seeds and then I like to plant
something<00:02:10.979> that's<00:02:11.730> easy<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.569> reach<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
something that's easy to reach and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.319 
something that's easy to reach and
that<00:02:13.810> would<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:14.110> bush<00:02:14.890> beans<00:02:15.280> these<00:02:15.879> are<00:02:15.939> Blue

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
that would be bush beans these are Blue

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.990 
that would be bush beans these are Blue
Lake<00:02:16.569> bush<00:02:16.930> beans<00:02:17.400> these<00:02:18.400> also<00:02:18.760> say

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
Lake bush beans these also say

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.720 
Lake bush beans these also say
determinant<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.260> back<00:02:20.469> meaning<00:02:21.099> they're

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
determinant on the back meaning they're
