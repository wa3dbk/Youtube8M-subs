00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
charging but so the next step is to get

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.179 
charging but so the next step is to get
it<00:01:23.100> paired<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.390> Nexus<00:01:24.990> 7<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it paired with the Nexus 7 so here I

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.880 
it paired with the Nexus 7 so here I
have<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.369> Nexus<00:01:26.970> 7<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.380> reason<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.829> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
have my Nexus 7 and the reason that I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.370 
have my Nexus 7 and the reason that I
bought<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> headset<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> Nexus<00:01:30.869> 7<00:01:31.079> is

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
bought the headset for the Nexus 7 is

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.550 
bought the headset for the Nexus 7 is
because<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.549> ear<00:01:32.790> jack<00:01:33.170> doesn't<00:01:34.170> make<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> good

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
because the ear jack doesn't make a good

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.700 
because the ear jack doesn't make a good
connection<00:01:35.659> with<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> headphones<00:01:37.380> with

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
connection with the headphones with

connection with the headphones with
normal<00:01:38.070> headphones<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:40.049> wanted<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
normal headphones so I wanted to get a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.789 
normal headphones so I wanted to get a
bluetooth<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.840> also<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
