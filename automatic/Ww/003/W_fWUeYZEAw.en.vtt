00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
let's talk about the fingerings now it

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.100 
let's talk about the fingerings now it
would<00:02:00.910> be<00:02:01.030> better<00:02:01.210> for<00:02:01.300> me<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.690> talk<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:01.930> you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
would be better for me to talk to you

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.420 
would be better for me to talk to you
about<00:02:02.170> where<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.500> fingerings<00:02:02.920> come<00:02:03.190> from

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
about where the fingerings come from

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.560 
about where the fingerings come from
rather<00:02:03.640> than<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:04.030> run<00:02:04.210> down<00:02:04.420> these

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
rather than just run down these

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.080 
rather than just run down these
fingerings<00:02:05.020> for<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:05.620> for<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.580> B<00:02:06.790> minor

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
fingerings for you so for the B minor

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.080 
fingerings for you so for the B minor
I'm<00:02:07.600> looking<00:02:08.200> at<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.380> chord<00:02:08.649> first<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.820> then

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
I'm looking at the chord first and then

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.130 
I'm looking at the chord first and then
I'm<00:02:10.210> thinking<00:02:10.270> about<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.690> scale<00:02:10.840> that

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
I'm thinking about the scale that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.020 
I'm thinking about the scale that
unravels<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.250> will<00:02:12.430> really<00:02:12.820> determine

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
unravels and that will really determine

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.660 
unravels and that will really determine
most<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.870> fingerings<00:02:14.320> for<00:02:14.410> me<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.370> here's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
most of the fingerings for me so here's

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.290 
most of the fingerings for me so here's
the<00:02:16.000> chord<00:02:16.930> it's<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.740> form<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.340> B<00:02:18.850> minor<00:02:19.150> chord

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the chord it's a form to B minor chord

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.540 
the chord it's a form to B minor chord
and<00:02:19.750> we've<00:02:19.990> learned<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.470> in<00:02:20.740> our<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.280> form

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
and we've learned that in our to form

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
and we've learned that in our to form
theory<00:02:22.260> form<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.530> root<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.130> fifth<00:02:24.310> string

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
theory form to root on the fifth string

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:36.810 
theory form to root on the fifth string
the<00:02:25.570> scale<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.050> unravels<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.700> we

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
the scale it unravels is this and we

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.920 
the scale it unravels is this and we
learned<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.300> our<00:02:37.390> lessons<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:37.840> the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
learned that in our lessons in the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.660 
learned that in our lessons in the
arpeggio<00:02:40.380> we<00:02:41.380> can<00:02:41.530> hit<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.800> octave<00:02:42.160> here<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.640> I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
arpeggio we can hit the octave here so I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.300 
arpeggio we can hit the octave here so I
have<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.180> information<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.989> now<00:02:47.739> I'm<00:02:48.040> going

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
have that information and now I'm going

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.250 
have that information and now I'm going
to<00:02:48.370> choose<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.790> fingers<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.870> notes<00:02:50.110> that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
to choose the fingers for the notes that

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.960 
to choose the fingers for the notes that
are<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.650> tabs
