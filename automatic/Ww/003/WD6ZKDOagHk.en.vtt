route it we can't route it with these

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.349 
route it we can't route it with these
big<00:00:28.080> big<00:00:28.320> leaves<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> bottom<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:30.269> we're

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
big big leaves on the bottom so we're

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.659

going to cut those out and then since

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.900 
going to cut those out and then since
coleus<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.360> such<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.950> curvaceous<00:00:34.950> plant<00:00:35.309> we're

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
coleus is such a curvaceous plant we're

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.479 
coleus is such a curvaceous plant we're
even<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> trim<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.690> big<00:00:37.530> leaves<00:00:37.860> that

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
even going to trim these big leaves that

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.650 
even going to trim these big leaves that
way<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.760> won't<00:00:38.850> wilt<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> go<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.230> shock

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
way it won't wilt and go into shock

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.930 
way it won't wilt and go into shock
so<00:00:42.660> that's<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.050> we're<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
so that's what we're going to do to this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:54.040 
so that's what we're going to do to this
plant<00:00:46.820> several<00:00:47.820> pieces<00:00:48.110> trim<00:00:49.110> trim<00:00:49.940> trim<00:00:51.500> and

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
plant several pieces trim trim trim and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.979 
plant several pieces trim trim trim and
trim<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.260> some<00:00:55.559> more<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.820> get<00:00:56.969> much<00:00:57.180> much

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
trim these some more you get much much

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.880 
trim these some more you get much much
higher<00:00:58.469> success<00:00:58.829> rate<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.660> cuttings<00:01:01.050> when

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
higher success rate of the cuttings when

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.939 
higher success rate of the cuttings when
you<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.650> have<00:01:04.650> another

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
variety that I'm going to do is well

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.399 
variety that I'm going to do is well
over<00:01:07.590> here

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.800 

because<00:01:14.009> these<00:01:14.189> are<00:01:14.369> beautiful<00:01:14.880> coleus<00:01:15.329> and<00:01:15.600> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
because these are beautiful coleus and I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.389 
because these are beautiful coleus and I
don't<00:01:16.020> want<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> lose<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.590> plants<00:01:17.039> before<00:01:17.219> I

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
don't want to lose the plants before I

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.999 
don't want to lose the plants before I
get<00:01:17.640> lots<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.030> new<00:01:18.770> cuttings

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
get lots of new cuttings

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
get lots of new cuttings
successful<00:01:20.729> plants<00:01:21.119> grown<00:01:21.390> from<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> same

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
successful plants grown from the same

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
successful plants grown from the same
plant<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.829> I'm<00:01:25.829> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> plant<00:01:26.340> them<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
plant so I'm going to plant them in

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.630 
plant so I'm going to plant them in
community<00:01:27.179> pots<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.720> root<00:01:27.899> them<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.640> then

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
community pots to root them and then

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.039 
community pots to root them and then
decide<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.299> I'm<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:30.869> them

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
when I'm done now all these leaves here

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.190 
when I'm done now all these leaves here
that<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.310> pruned<00:01:35.610> off<00:01:35.880> we're<00:01:36.630> gonna<00:01:36.689> go<00:01:36.929> into

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that we pruned off we're gonna go into

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.580 
that we pruned off we're gonna go into
my<00:01:37.229> mulch<00:01:37.590> pile<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.729> over<00:01:38.970> there

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
my mulch pile right over there

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.279 
my mulch pile right over there
here<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:41.539> so<00:01:42.539> again<00:01:43.490> trim<00:01:44.490> trim<00:01:45.119> trim<00:01:45.840> now

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
here we go so again trim trim trim now

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.660 
here we go so again trim trim trim now
where<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> leaf<00:01:46.770> meets<00:01:47.069> the<00:01:47.250> stem<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
where the leaf meets the stem is the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
where the leaf meets the stem is the
node<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.330> that's<00:01:48.959> where<00:01:49.200> usually<00:01:49.349> get<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
node and that's where usually get the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.339 
node and that's where usually get the
root<00:01:50.069> so<00:01:50.429> you<00:01:51.000> want<00:01:51.209> to<00:01:51.299> cut<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:51.810> below<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
root so you want to cut right below the

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:58.240 
root so you want to cut right below the
node<00:01:53.509> there<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.720> go

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250
