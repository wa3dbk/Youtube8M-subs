00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.800
 Hello, you see the story again loshu 

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:09.040
 rings whom I went to the next movie 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.380
 Wright times were they become or 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.330
 era of altron 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.190
 pizza me you will call him constantly 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.869
 electrons, by the way , I immediately notice the past 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.820
 video in the comments they write it 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.730
 you constantly whistle it probably 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.680
 alternator belt I took the car sucks 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.570
 I understand in this case, I will say that no 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.289
 I'm right here right here 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.530
 close with speaker 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.830
 tablet on which I record video 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.690
 air outlet here 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.090
 condition and after all I unloaded here I now 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.100
 he was hooked by a whistle and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.230
 and so while we sit in 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.010
 stuffy but for standish our plans 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.430
 whistled 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.440
 about the avengers what can I say film 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.899
 on comics 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.590
 It was honestly here's an adult uncle 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.780
 How do I 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.570
 but relatively adult minced them 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 childhood is still boring 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.390
 I will honestly say 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.870
 if you are a schoolboy and in the first courses 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.620
 Institute, we probably should go to 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.370
 cinema 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.900
 everything else 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.900
 it is worth waiting for 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.080
 digital storage media and already see at home 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.570
 there for such a good snack 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.690
 tongue rest 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.060
 that is, no film is absolutely not 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.050
 straining my brain is a constant search 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.050
 on huts 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.360
 it was boring and yawned even that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.510
 these ponies get enough sleep today but 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.940
 somehow but 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.440
 very much for the sophisticated viewer all so 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.410
 explained for 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 as if i am about 14 years old you know gig accurately 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:58.450
 drove well and especially watch big 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.689
 green people dudes with sledgehammers and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.820
 colorful trip with shields 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.979
 running around saving the world that they don't even 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.130
 bothers in this series next so 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.290
 how in chit all films are rigged 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.960
 they are cool dudes then suddenly 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.510
 there is a threat to the world and in the end not with 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.820
 they cope with it like years and this time they 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.490
 it's a threat even made themselves sorry for 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.100
 spoiler that is simply nothing 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.930
 do create a threat decide them themselves 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.590
 well in general 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.190
 general as something like this 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.140
 I would not say that a number of serious 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.150
 and start all sorts of pretentious speech there 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.180
 push this to understand their 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.610
 feelings is equal to understand their own 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.520
 fears rating city some fears 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.390
 It did not prove to be very afraid of the same 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.640
 they have a dull strife honestly 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.890
 people are killed and many villains 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.890
 fears might be worse 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.870
 but spent time off 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.150
 theater 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.840
 I do not regret the super spent 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.660
 of time 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.959
 Militant is a good thing that's always good 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.900
 the avengers is their self-deprecation humor with 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.940
 humor everything is fine there is everything rome 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.819
 was on this a film would have been built 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.930
 awesome at all when 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.159
 funnier than what we do in the shadows as well as that 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.340
 nevertheless the Federal Property Management Agency 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:29.540
 but this is my opinion I expressed you saw and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.189
 heard galoshki lyoshik on it all 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.189
 or package films
