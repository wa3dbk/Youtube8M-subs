no one can figure out why I've had a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
no one can figure out why I've had a
large<00:01:04.350> series<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.979> those<00:01:05.129> who<00:01:05.460> actually<00:01:05.670> were

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
large series of those who actually were

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.390 
large series of those who actually were
constipated<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.530> was<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> reason<00:01:07.920> why

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
constipated and that was the reason why

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.600 
constipated and that was the reason why
they<00:01:08.610> chose<00:01:09.650> relationship<00:01:10.650> with

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
they chose relationship with

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.090 
they chose relationship with
constipation<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.840> urinary<00:01:13.380> truck<00:01:13.799> because

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
constipation and urinary truck because

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.359 
constipation and urinary truck because
it<00:01:14.280> blocks<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.729> upload<00:01:15.320> well<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.619> probably

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it blocks the upload well it's probably

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.700 
it blocks the upload well it's probably
a<00:01:17.729> little<00:01:17.970> bit<00:01:18.180> more<00:01:18.420> complex<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.290> certainly

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
a little bit more complex but certainly

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.090 
a little bit more complex but certainly
there's<00:01:20.220> an<00:01:20.400> element<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.540> well<00:01:22.100> what

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
there's an element of that as well what

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.700 
there's an element of that as well what
probably<00:01:23.670> happens<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.869> urinary

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
probably happens is that the urinary

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.219 
probably happens is that the urinary
bladder<00:01:25.890> can't<00:01:26.790> fully<00:01:27.090> empty<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
bladder can't fully empty because the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.359 
bladder can't fully empty because the
pelvis<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.310> filled<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:31.340> lot<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
pelvis is filled up there is a lot of

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.319 
pelvis is filled up there is a lot of
discomfort<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.530> that<00:01:34.530> takes<00:01:34.799> place<00:01:35.329> in

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
discomfort that that takes place in

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.340 
discomfort that that takes place in
conjunction<00:01:37.020> with<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.950> abdominal

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
conjunction with the abdominal

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.899 
conjunction with the abdominal
distension<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:43.700> situation<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
distension and it's a situation that I

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.539 
distension and it's a situation that I
say<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.530> quite<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.860> long<00:01:46.950> period<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
say can go on for quite a long period of

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.819 
say can go on for quite a long period of
if<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.000> get<00:01:48.240> constipation<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.649> the

comes from a plant and that's called

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.500 
comes from a plant and that's called
senokot<00:03:20.350> so<00:03:21.220> either<00:03:21.549> of<00:03:21.700> those<00:03:22.000> they<00:03:22.299> work
