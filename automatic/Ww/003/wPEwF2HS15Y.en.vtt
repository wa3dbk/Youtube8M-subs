heat<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.600> then<00:02:32.600> you're<00:02:32.780> going<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:33.050> add<00:02:33.260> your

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
heat and then you're going to add your

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.260 
heat and then you're going to add your
vanilla<00:02:34.130> at<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:34.790> point<00:02:36.790> gently<00:02:37.790> stir<00:02:38.030> that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
vanilla at this point gently stir that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.150 
vanilla at this point gently stir that
together<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:43.150> when<00:02:44.150> that's<00:02:44.300> combined<00:02:45.160> you're

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
together and when that's combined you're

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.720 
together and when that's combined you're
going<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.520> add<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.970> rice<00:02:47.150> krispies<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.730> this

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
going to add the rice krispies and this

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.480 
going to add the rice krispies and this
is<00:02:49.940> when<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.270> gets<00:02:50.300> messy<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.410> this<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.340> why

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
is when it gets messy and this is why

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.570 
is when it gets messy and this is why
you<00:02:52.550> need<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.760> nice<00:02:53.000> big<00:02:53.270> bowl<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:55.340> you're<00:02:55.460> going

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
you need a nice big bowl so you're going

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.130 
you need a nice big bowl so you're going
to<00:02:55.640> put<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.880> whole<00:02:56.090> thing<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:58.720> you'll<00:02:59.720> find<00:02:59.930> it

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
to put the whole thing in you'll find it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.870 
to put the whole thing in you'll find it
starts<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.830> be<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> little<00:03:01.010> bit<00:03:01.310> difficult<00:03:01.520> to

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
starts to be a little bit difficult to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.170 
starts to be a little bit difficult to
turn<00:03:02.530> but<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:03.860> want<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.160> get<00:03:04.400> all<00:03:04.880> those

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
turn but you just want to get all those

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.110 
turn but you just want to get all those
rice<00:03:05.450> krispies<00:03:05.959> worked<00:03:06.260> in<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:07.040> get<00:03:07.880> some

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
rice krispies worked in and get some

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:18.759 
rice krispies worked in and get some
marshmallow<00:03:08.600> covering<00:03:09.170> most<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.590> them

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.229 

you<00:03:19.769> see<00:03:19.980> how<00:03:20.040> they<00:03:20.189> start<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.609> stick<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
you see how they start to stick to the

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.410 
you see how they start to stick to the
side<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.689> of<00:03:22.319> your<00:03:22.530> pot<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:22.829> it<00:03:23.159> is<00:03:23.280> quite<00:03:23.609> a<00:03:23.640> big

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
side of of your pot so it is quite a big

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:34.729 
side of of your pot so it is quite a big
cleanup<00:03:24.750> job<00:03:32.720> when<00:03:33.720> you've<00:03:33.870> got<00:03:34.079> most<00:03:34.379> of<00:03:34.560> them

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
cleanup job when you've got most of them

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.229 
cleanup job when you've got most of them
mixed<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:37.489> what<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.519> want<00:03:38.879> to<00:03:39.060> do

mixed in like this what you want to do

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.500 
mixed in like this what you want to do
is<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:40.019> set<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.879> the<00:03:41.879> side<00:03:42.000> those

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
is just set that to the side those

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.709 
is just set that to the side those
switch<00:03:42.810> spots<00:03:43.109> here<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.970> then<00:03:44.970> whenever<00:03:45.389> I'm

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:45.719 
switch spots here and then whenever I'm

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.099 
switch spots here and then whenever I'm
baking<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.519> I'm<00:03:47.519> using<00:03:47.790> up<00:03:48.030> butter<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.569> use<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
baking and I'm using up butter I use the

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.420 
baking and I'm using up butter I use the
leftover<00:03:49.799> butter<00:03:50.430> wrappers<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:52.560> grease<00:03:53.129> my

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
leftover butter wrappers to grease my

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.990 
leftover butter wrappers to grease my
pan<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.450> this<00:03:54.599> will<00:03:54.750> come<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.019> very<00:03:55.049> handy<00:03:56.000> for

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
pan and this will come in very handy for

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.970 
pan and this will come in very handy for
stuff<00:03:57.450> like<00:03:57.569> this<00:03:57.900> because<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.590> do<00:03:58.739> need<00:03:58.950> a

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
stuff like this because you do need a

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.099 
stuff like this because you do need a
lot<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.280> grease<00:04:00.060> on<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.359> outside<00:04:00.689> of<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.900> pan

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
lot of grease on the outside of the pan

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.750 
lot of grease on the outside of the pan
because<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.530> these<00:04:01.680> rice<00:04:02.370> krispie<00:04:02.730> squares

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
because of these rice krispie squares

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.539 
because of these rice krispie squares
being<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.540> sticky<00:04:04.069> don't<00:04:05.069> throw<00:04:05.250> this<00:04:05.370> away

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
being so sticky don't throw this away

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.330 
being so sticky don't throw this away
yet<00:04:05.879> you're<00:04:06.090> gonna<00:04:06.239> need<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.629> again<00:04:06.870> or<00:04:07.799> if<00:04:08.250> you

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
yet you're gonna need it again or if you

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.830 
yet you're gonna need it again or if you
don't<00:04:08.459> have<00:04:08.579> that<00:04:08.849> you<00:04:09.329> can<00:04:09.359> just<00:04:09.659> put<00:04:09.810> a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
don't have that you can just put a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.229 
don't have that you can just put a
little<00:04:10.049> bit<00:04:10.169> of<00:04:10.349> butter<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.769> wax<00:04:11.639> paper<00:04:12.030> that

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
little bit of butter on wax paper that

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.159 
little bit of butter on wax paper that
works<00:04:12.659> too

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
works too

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.909 
works too
so<00:04:13.620> now<00:04:13.939> sometimes<00:04:14.939> it<00:04:15.090> takes<00:04:15.359> two<00:04:16.169> people<00:04:16.199> but

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
so now sometimes it takes two people but

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.170 
so now sometimes it takes two people but
I've<00:04:17.070> kind<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.340> learned<00:04:17.489> how<00:04:17.729> to<00:04:17.820> do<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.060> by

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
I've kind of learned how to do it by

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.129 
I've kind of learned how to do it by
myself<00:04:18.389> you<00:04:19.019> just<00:04:19.739> want<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.949> dump<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.930> rice

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
myself you just want to dump the rice

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:33.350 
myself you just want to dump the rice
krispie<00:04:22.710> squares<00:04:23.120> into<00:04:24.320> your<00:04:25.320> pan<00:04:32.090> get<00:04:33.090> most

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
krispie squares into your pan get most

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.830 
krispie squares into your pan get most
of<00:04:33.599> them<00:04:33.750> out<00:04:36.289> and<00:04:38.030> then<00:04:39.030> set<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.300> in<00:04:39.659> some

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
of them out and then set that in some

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.820 
of them out and then set that in some
water<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:41.250> soak<00:04:41.840> now<00:04:42.840> you're<00:04:43.050> left<00:04:43.229> with<00:04:43.800> a

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
water to soak now you're left with a

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.680 
water to soak now you're left with a
very<00:04:43.949> sticky<00:04:44.550> mess<00:04:44.849> I've<00:04:45.120> tried<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:45.539> with<00:04:45.659> a

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
very sticky mess I've tried it with a

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.379 
very sticky mess I've tried it with a
knife<00:04:46.050> I've<00:04:46.740> tried<00:04:47.010> it<00:04:47.159> with<00:04:47.190> everything<00:04:47.820> that

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
knife I've tried it with everything that

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.149 
knife I've tried it with everything that
you<00:04:48.599> can<00:04:48.840> make<00:04:49.229> sure<00:04:49.260> whatever<00:04:49.650> you're<00:04:49.949> going

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
you can make sure whatever you're going

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.820 
you can make sure whatever you're going
to<00:04:50.280> use<00:04:50.490> is<00:04:50.820> really<00:04:51.210> well<00:04:51.570> buttered<00:04:52.409> or

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
to use is really well buttered or

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.290 
to use is really well buttered or
greased

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
greased

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.939 
greased
I've<00:04:54.539> tried<00:04:54.750> Pam<00:04:55.139> that<00:04:55.440> doesn't<00:04:55.680> work<00:04:55.800> it

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
I've tried Pam that doesn't work it

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.200 
I've tried Pam that doesn't work it
doesn't<00:04:55.979> taste<00:04:56.280> very<00:04:56.400> good<00:04:56.669> so<00:04:56.820> I<00:04:56.849> really

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
doesn't taste very good so I really

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.270 
doesn't taste very good so I really
don't<00:04:57.360> recommend<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.810> I'm<00:04:58.770> just<00:04:58.919> gonna<00:04:59.010> come

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
don't recommend that I'm just gonna come

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.680 
don't recommend that I'm just gonna come
back<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.820> your<00:05:00.229> butter<00:05:01.310> wrapper<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.940> this

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
back to your butter wrapper and this

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.370 
back to your butter wrapper and this
works<00:05:03.960> absolute<00:05:04.530> marvel<00:05:04.970> marvelously<00:05:06.380> and

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
works absolute marvel marvelously and

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.560
