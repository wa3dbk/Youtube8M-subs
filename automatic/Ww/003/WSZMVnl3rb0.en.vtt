all right another the four is in place
next<00:00:03.080> step<00:00:03.379> is<00:00:03.530> designing<00:00:03.830> the<00:00:03.979> corridors<00:00:04.370> for

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
next step is designing the corridors for

next step is designing the corridors for
our<00:00:04.640> deck<00:00:05.020> we<00:00:06.020> used<00:00:06.170> to<00:00:06.230> do<00:00:06.350> that<00:00:06.380> our<00:00:06.650> walls

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:06.860 
our deck we used to do that our walls

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.999 
our deck we used to do that our walls
which<00:00:07.400> you<00:00:07.490> can<00:00:07.580> find<00:00:07.640> in<00:00:07.880> the<00:00:08.000> detail<00:00:08.360> objects

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:09.009 
which you can find in the detail objects

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.379 
which you can find in the detail objects
about<00:00:10.009> six<00:00:10.249> different<00:00:10.400> walls<00:00:10.759> listed<00:00:11.179> there

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
about six different walls listed there

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.749 
about six different walls listed there
in<00:00:11.749> addition<00:00:11.959> to<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.259> door<00:00:12.440> walls<00:00:12.709> but<00:00:13.639> the

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
in addition to the door walls but the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.430 
in addition to the door walls but the
truth<00:00:13.940> is<00:00:14.119> a<00:00:14.360> lot<00:00:14.869> of<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.049> walls<00:00:15.230> aren't

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
truth is a lot of the walls aren't

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.839 
truth is a lot of the walls aren't
really<00:00:15.650> practical<00:00:16.010> to<00:00:16.190> use<00:00:16.250> to<00:00:16.550> create<00:00:16.730> a

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
really practical to use to create a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.970 
really practical to use to create a
corridor<00:00:17.179> the<00:00:18.080> trouble<00:00:18.410> is<00:00:18.439> they<00:00:18.590> have<00:00:18.679> weird

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
corridor the trouble is they have weird

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.740 
corridor the trouble is they have weird
shapes<00:00:19.250> they<00:00:19.789> just<00:00:19.970> don't<00:00:20.119> fit<00:00:20.240> together<00:00:20.359> that

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
shapes they just don't fit together that

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.349 
shapes they just don't fit together that
well<00:00:21.369> there<00:00:22.369> are<00:00:22.490> basically<00:00:22.849> only<00:00:23.089> three

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
well there are basically only three

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.550 
well there are basically only three
types<00:00:23.599> of<00:00:23.720> walls<00:00:23.960> now<00:00:24.349> we're<00:00:24.500> actually

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
types of walls now we're actually

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.880 
types of walls now we're actually
interested<00:00:25.160> in<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:26.000> first<00:00:26.269> as<00:00:26.539> well<00:00:27.349> generic

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
interested in the first as well generic

ship<00:00:28.130> 03<00:00:28.929> this<00:00:29.929> is<00:00:30.050> a<00:00:30.080> good<00:00:30.289> basic<00:00:30.710> wall<00:00:30.890> for<00:00:31.189> a

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
ship 03 this is a good basic wall for a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.220 
ship 03 this is a good basic wall for a
corridor<00:00:31.580> it<00:00:32.360> serves<00:00:32.719> as<00:00:32.870> your<00:00:32.960> bread<00:00:33.200> and

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
corridor it serves as your bread and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.990 
corridor it serves as your bread and
butter<00:00:33.379> for<00:00:33.739> creating<00:00:34.190> a<00:00:34.219> custom<00:00:34.550> interior

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
butter for creating a custom interior

butter for creating a custom interior
the<00:00:35.870> next<00:00:36.140> type<00:00:36.260> of<00:00:36.410> wall<00:00:36.590> is<00:00:36.829> actually<00:00:37.190> set<00:00:37.370> up

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
the next type of wall is actually set up

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.520 
the next type of wall is actually set up
several<00:00:37.700> different<00:00:38.180> walls<00:00:38.329> all<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.260> which<00:00:39.410> are

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
several different walls all of which are

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.069 
several different walls all of which are
nearly<00:00:39.710> identical<00:00:40.239> this<00:00:41.239> is<00:00:41.360> wild<00:00:41.570> or<00:00:41.899> 02

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
nearly identical this is wild or 02

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.619 
nearly identical this is wild or 02
through<00:00:42.620> wall<00:00:42.829> door<00:00:43.070> oh<00:00:43.100> wait<00:00:43.460> all<00:00:44.390> these

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
through wall door oh wait all these

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.090 
through wall door oh wait all these
walls<00:00:44.960> have<00:00:45.230> a<00:00:45.260> door<00:00:45.500> in<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.710> center<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:45.949> them

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
walls have a door in the center of them

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.010 
walls have a door in the center of them
the<00:00:46.820> only<00:00:47.059> difference<00:00:47.239> between<00:00:47.480> them<00:00:47.780> is<00:00:47.840> the

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
the only difference between them is the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.779 
the only difference between them is the
color<00:00:48.199> of<00:00:48.289> that<00:00:48.379> door<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:48.949> was<00:00:49.160> written<00:00:49.430> on<00:00:49.579> it

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
color of that door and was written on it

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.910 
color of that door and was written on it
I<00:00:50.050> listed<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.170> differences<00:00:51.559> between<00:00:51.590> the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
I listed the differences between the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.520 
I listed the differences between the
doors<00:00:52.129> here<00:00:52.399> as<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.359> can<00:00:53.390> see<00:00:53.510> most<00:00:54.109> doors<00:00:54.350> are

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
doors here as you can see most doors are

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.990 
doors here as you can see most doors are
a<00:00:54.559> standard<00:00:54.859> orange<00:00:55.100> color<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.609> there<00:00:55.910> are<00:00:55.969> a

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
a standard orange color and there are a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.450 
a standard orange color and there are a
few<00:00:56.090> different<00:00:56.210> locations<00:00:56.809> written<00:00:57.079> on<00:00:57.199> them

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
few different locations written on them

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.310 
few different locations written on them
now<00:00:58.460> practically<00:00:59.149> speaking<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.960> text<00:01:00.230> on<00:01:00.289> the

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
now practically speaking the text on the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.229 
now practically speaking the text on the
doors<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:00.679> so<00:01:00.859> small<00:01:01.219> that<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:01.670> can<00:01:01.850> barely

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
doors is so small that you can barely

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.030 
doors is so small that you can barely
even<00:01:02.420> read<00:01:02.719> it<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.559> doors<00:01:03.739> open

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
even read it the doors open

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.499 
even read it the doors open
automatically<00:01:04.489> as<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.699> get<00:01:04.850> close<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.330> the

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
automatically as you get close and the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:06.850 
automatically as you get close and the
camera<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:05.990> game<00:01:06.170> is<00:01:06.350> located<00:01:06.710> behind

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
camera and the game is located behind

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.590 
camera and the game is located behind
the<00:01:07.070> character<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.090> it's<00:01:08.180> really<00:01:08.299> hard<00:01:08.509> to

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
the character so it's really hard to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.170 
the character so it's really hard to
even<00:01:08.750> see<00:01:09.020> what<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.259> text<00:01:09.530> says<00:01:09.970> just<00:01:10.970> to<00:01:11.060> give

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
even see what the text says just to give

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.359 
even see what the text says just to give
an<00:01:11.270> example<00:01:11.509> of<00:01:11.659> how<00:01:11.810> hard<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:12.590> have

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
an example of how hard it is I have

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.920 
an example of how hard it is I have
trouble<00:01:13.549> reading<00:01:13.729> some<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.090> doors<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:14.869> I

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
trouble reading some of the doors and I

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.539 
trouble reading some of the doors and I
was<00:01:15.049> actually<00:01:15.170> trying<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.770> read<00:01:15.979> them<00:01:16.159> in

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
was actually trying to read them in

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:17.560 
was actually trying to read them in
order<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.820> figure<00:01:16.939> out<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.210> differences

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
order to figure out the differences

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.770 
order to figure out the differences
between<00:01:17.630> them<00:01:19.000> realistically<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:20.090> would<00:01:20.600> say

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
between them realistically I would say

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.090 
between them realistically I would say
almost<00:01:20.930> no<00:01:21.200> players<00:01:21.500> are<00:01:21.680> going<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:21.860> read<00:01:21.979> the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
almost no players are going to read the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.130 
almost no players are going to read the
writing<00:01:22.369> on<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.490> door<00:01:22.790> I<00:01:23.030> guess<00:01:23.960> probably

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
writing on the door I guess probably

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.620 
writing on the door I guess probably
less<00:01:24.409> than<00:01:24.439> 1%<00:01:25.009> of<00:01:25.040> most<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:26.270> being<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.540> case

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
less than 1% of most that being the case

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.359 
less than 1% of most that being the case
you<00:01:27.409> really<00:01:27.650> only<00:01:27.680> need<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.070> worry<00:01:28.250> about

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
you really only need to worry about

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.789 
you really only need to worry about
three<00:01:28.670> different<00:01:28.790> doors<00:01:29.210> door<00:01:30.170> OH<00:01:30.200> 3<00:01:30.619> which<00:01:30.770> is

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
three different doors door OH 3 which is

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.789 
three different doors door OH 3 which is
blue<00:01:31.130> noro<00:01:32.000> six<00:01:32.390> which<00:01:32.540> is<00:01:32.570> yellowish<00:01:32.960> indoor

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
blue noro six which is yellowish indoor

it's<00:02:35.900> great<00:02:36.140> fake<00:02:36.409> doors<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.760> reason<00:02:38.000> you

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
it's great fake doors the reason you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.610 
it's great fake doors the reason you

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
want to do that is to make it seem like

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.619 
want to do that is to make it seem like
there<00:02:39.859> are<00:02:39.950> more<00:02:39.980> rooms<00:02:40.370> or<00:02:40.730> corridors<00:02:41.420> on

there are more rooms or corridors on
your<00:02:41.780> map<00:02:42.189> that<00:02:43.189> the<00:02:43.310> player<00:02:43.489> just<00:02:43.609> doesn't

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
your map that the player just doesn't

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.390 
your map that the player just doesn't
have<00:02:43.970> access<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.540> at<00:02:44.659> the<00:02:44.780> moment<00:02:45.159> this<00:02:46.159> little

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
have access to at the moment this little

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.649 
have access to at the moment this little
trick<00:02:46.579> that<00:02:46.609> can<00:02:46.730> help<00:02:46.940> your<00:02:47.060> map<00:02:47.239> feel<00:02:47.450> larger

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
and more realistic there's a reason this

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.059 
and more realistic there's a reason this
wall<00:02:50.900> isn't<00:02:51.109> listed<00:02:51.319> with<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.709> other<00:02:51.829> door

wall isn't listed with the other door
walls<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.639> I'll<00:02:53.120> explain<00:02:53.359> why<00:02:53.569> in<00:02:53.599> just<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
walls and I'll explain why in just a

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.050 
walls and I'll explain why in just a
second<00:02:54.319> before<00:02:55.159> you<00:02:55.400> can<00:02:55.519> actually<00:02:55.639> use<00:02:55.879> these

second before you can actually use these

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.940 
second before you can actually use these
walls<00:02:56.359> then<00:02:57.109> one<00:02:57.260> more<00:02:57.409> piece<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.590> information

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
you need to know that's what Y value

you need to know that's what Y value
need<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.560> set<00:03:00.739> them<00:03:00.889> to<00:03:01.150> if<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.269> want<00:03:02.480> the

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
walls to look right need to line them up

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
each section you just have to keep

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.650

have an entire corridor now this might

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.000 
have an entire corridor now this might
be<00:05:04.419> a<00:05:04.449> little<00:05:04.539> bit<00:05:04.690> confusing<00:05:05.110> so<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.620> want<00:05:05.949> to

be a little bit confusing so I want to

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.529 
be a little bit confusing so I want to
bring<00:05:06.100> up<00:05:06.220> another<00:05:06.340> graphic<00:05:06.729> in<00:05:07.090> order<00:05:07.449> to

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
screen you would change the Z value

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.510 
screen you would change the Z value
instead<00:05:34.720> of<00:05:34.930> X<00:05:35.080> weather<00:05:35.979> wise<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:36.370> work

instead of X weather wise it work

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.420 
instead of X weather wise it work
exactly<00:05:36.729> the<00:05:37.030> same<00:05:37.710> you<00:05:38.710> might<00:05:38.889> remember<00:05:39.070> with

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
exactly the same you might remember with

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.129 
exactly the same you might remember with
the<00:05:39.520> platforms<00:05:40.120> there<00:05:40.630> was<00:05:40.720> a<00:05:40.780> problem<00:05:41.020> with

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
the platforms there was a problem with

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.589 
the platforms there was a problem with
texture<00:05:41.530> fighting<00:05:42.300> unfortunately<00:05:43.300> there's

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
texture fighting unfortunately there's

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.779 
texture fighting unfortunately there's
also<00:05:43.750> a<00:05:43.870> problem<00:05:44.199> with<00:05:44.289> these<00:05:44.380> walls<00:05:44.789> have

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
also a problem with these walls have

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.850 
also a problem with these walls have
these<00:05:46.000> two<00:05:46.240> circled<00:05:46.750> points<00:05:47.169> the<00:05:47.650> walls

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
these two circled points the walls

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.770 
these two circled points the walls
overlap<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.669> there<00:05:49.270> will<00:05:49.360> be<00:05:49.389> texture

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
overlap and there will be texture

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.350 
overlap and there will be texture
fighting<00:05:50.110> there

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.749 

to<00:05:55.259> solve<00:05:55.469> this<00:05:55.590> problem<00:05:56.159> you<00:05:56.400> need<00:05:56.550> to<00:05:56.639> add

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
to solve this problem you need to add

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.459 
to solve this problem you need to add
point<00:05:57.090> zero<00:05:57.330> zero<00:05:57.360> one<00:05:57.750> just<00:05:58.110> like<00:05:58.229> with<00:05:58.349> the

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
point zero zero one just like with the

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.649 
point zero zero one just like with the
platform's<00:05:59.060> except<00:06:00.060> this<00:06:00.120> time<00:06:00.300> instead<00:06:00.479> of

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
platform's except this time instead of

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.119 
platform's except this time instead of
ending<00:06:00.810> point<00:06:01.139> zero<00:06:01.349> zero<00:06:01.409> one<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:01.979> y

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:02.129 
ending point zero zero one to the y

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.249 
ending point zero zero one to the y
value<00:06:02.610> you<00:06:03.210> need<00:06:03.389> to<00:06:03.509> add<00:06:03.599> point<00:06:03.960> zero<00:06:04.199> zero

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
value you need to add point zero zero

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.920 
value you need to add point zero zero
one<00:06:04.620> to<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:05.400> opposite<00:06:05.969> direction<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.719> walls

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
one to the opposite direction the walls

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.439 
one to the opposite direction the walls
running<00:06:07.550> and<00:06:08.550> what<00:06:08.669> that<00:06:08.699> means<00:06:09.060> is<00:06:09.180> if<00:06:09.330> you're

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
running and what that means is if you're

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.080 
running and what that means is if you're
running<00:06:09.569> a<00:06:09.780> wall<00:06:09.960> of<00:06:10.229> plumbing<00:06:10.650> X<00:06:10.830> access<00:06:11.340> you

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
running a wall of plumbing X access you

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.480 
running a wall of plumbing X access you
would<00:06:12.270> adjust<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.810> Z<00:06:12.990> value<00:06:13.020> x<00:06:13.560> 0<00:06:13.590> point<00:06:13.800> 0<00:06:13.860> 0<00:06:14.069> 1

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
would adjust the Z value x 0 point 0 0 1

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.270 
would adjust the Z value x 0 point 0 0 1
and<00:06:14.699> you<00:06:15.599> change<00:06:15.900> it<00:06:16.020> for<00:06:16.110> every<00:06:16.469> other<00:06:16.620> wall

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
and you change it for every other wall

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.490 
and you change it for every other wall
piece<00:06:17.610> so<00:06:18.479> the<00:06:18.599> first<00:06:18.750> wall<00:06:19.020> piece<00:06:19.259> would<00:06:19.469> be

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
piece so the first wall piece would be

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.740 
piece so the first wall piece would be
set<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.800> 0<00:06:20.189> the<00:06:20.969> next<00:06:21.090> one<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.389> be<00:06:21.419> set<00:06:21.629> to<00:06:21.659> 0

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
set to 0 the next one to be set to 0

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.439 
set to 0 the next one to be set to 0
point<00:06:21.930> 0<00:06:22.020> 0<00:06:22.259> 1<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:23.400> third<00:06:23.580> would<00:06:23.699> be<00:06:23.759> 0<00:06:24.060> and<00:06:24.300> so

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
point 0 0 1 the third would be 0 and so

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.480 
point 0 0 1 the third would be 0 and so
on<00:06:24.479> if<00:06:25.379> the<00:06:25.650> wall<00:06:25.800> is<00:06:25.830> running<00:06:26.159> from<00:06:26.219> top<00:06:26.460> to

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
on if the wall is running from top to

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.240 
on if the wall is running from top to
bottom<00:06:26.639> you<00:06:27.539> would<00:06:27.689> change<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:28.740> x<00:06:28.860> value

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
bottom you would change the x value

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.700 
bottom you would change the x value
instead<00:06:29.750> you<00:06:30.750> basically<00:06:31.050> just<00:06:31.169> change<00:06:31.500> the

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
instead you basically just change the

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.529 
instead you basically just change the
value<00:06:32.129> of<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.550> access<00:06:32.939> that's<00:06:33.120> on<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.300> side

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
value of the access that's on the side

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.399 
value of the access that's on the side
of<00:06:33.569> the<00:06:33.810> wall<00:06:34.219> this<00:06:35.219> value<00:06:35.460> of<00:06:35.639> 9.2<00:06:36.240> is<00:06:36.659> derived

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
of the wall this value of 9.2 is derived

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.800 
of the wall this value of 9.2 is derived
from<00:06:37.529> wal<00:06:37.800> generic<00:06:38.159> ship<00:06:38.340> ball<00:06:38.550> three<00:06:38.849> it's

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
from wal generic ship ball three it's

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.800 
from wal generic ship ball three it's
what<00:06:39.990> makes<00:06:40.139> them<00:06:40.229> fit<00:06:40.560> together<00:06:40.830> perfectly

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
what makes them fit together perfectly

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.969
