coastal dune lakes along the coastline

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.450 
coastal dune lakes along the coastline
of<00:00:37.640> Walton<00:00:37.940> County<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:39.040> what<00:00:40.040> makes<00:00:40.280> them

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
of Walton County and what makes them

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.250 
of Walton County and what makes them
special<00:00:40.580> is<00:00:40.940> that<00:00:40.970> they<00:00:41.360> actually<00:00:41.540> connect<00:00:42.140> to

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
special is that they actually connect to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.320 
special is that they actually connect to
the<00:00:42.350> Gulf<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:42.830> Mexico<00:00:43.310> to<00:00:43.550> a<00:00:43.580> larger<00:00:44.030> body<00:00:44.239> of

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
the Gulf of Mexico to a larger body of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.210 
the Gulf of Mexico to a larger body of
water<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.050> when<00:00:45.200> they<00:00:45.320> reach<00:00:45.470> flood<00:00:45.860> level

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
water so when they reach flood level

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.130 
water so when they reach flood level
they<00:00:46.820> make<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.059> channel<00:00:47.570> through<00:00:47.720> the<00:00:47.870> sand

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
they make a channel through the sand

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.780 
they make a channel through the sand
they<00:00:48.380> break<00:00:48.620> through<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.890> sand<00:00:49.220> and<00:00:49.520> they

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
they break through the sand and they

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.520 
they break through the sand and they
exchange<00:00:50.270> water<00:00:50.540> with<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.809> Gulf<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:51.260> they<00:00:51.410> end

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
exchange water with the Gulf so they end

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.110 
exchange water with the Gulf so they end

caught bonita barracuda and octopus and

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.490 
caught bonita barracuda and octopus and
the<00:01:27.560> lake<00:01:27.710> after<00:01:27.920> storms<00:01:28.870> it's<00:01:29.870> just<00:01:30.230> it's

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the lake after storms it's just it's

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.400 
the lake after storms it's just it's
just<00:01:30.710> amazing<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.820> variety<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.750> fish<00:01:33.140> it's

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
just amazing the variety of fish it's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.580 
just amazing the variety of fish it's
just<00:01:34.180> fascinating<00:01:35.180> ecosystem<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.440> I've

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
just fascinating ecosystem and I've

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.110 
just fascinating ecosystem and I've
never<00:01:36.830> seen<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.190> anywhere<00:01:37.700> else<00:01:37.910> I've<00:01:38.090> ever

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
never seen that anywhere else I've ever

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.830 
never seen that anywhere else I've ever
lived

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
lived

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.590 
lived
they<00:01:39.470> each<00:01:39.680> have<00:01:40.010> varying<00:01:40.730> salinity<00:01:41.390> and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
they each have varying salinity and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.940 
they each have varying salinity and
that's<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.200> thing<00:01:42.410> I<00:01:42.560> think<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.800> really

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
that's the thing I think that really

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.670 
that's the thing I think that really
makes<00:01:43.460> them<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.420> rare<00:01:44.720> too<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.290> that<00:01:45.470> they're

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
makes them so rare too is that they're

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.210 
makes them so rare too is that they're
constantly<00:01:45.980> changing<00:01:46.400> each<00:01:47.210> one<00:01:47.660> is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
constantly changing each one is

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.280 
constantly changing each one is
different<00:01:49.220> than<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.790> others<00:01:50.120> but<00:01:50.870> they<00:01:50.930> also

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
different than the others but they also

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.460 
different than the others but they also
are<00:01:51.920> constantly<00:01:52.670> ebbing<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.330> flowing<00:01:53.470> with

be so such a natural thing and the
system<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.540> creates<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.980> dunes<00:02:42.579> builds

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
system that creates the the dunes builds

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.039 
system that creates the the dunes builds
up<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.540> berm<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:45.129> know<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.420> rain<00:02:46.720> comes

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
up the berm and you know the rain comes

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.530 
up the berm and you know the rain comes
down<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.349> it<00:02:47.860> flushes<00:02:48.310> out<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.700> lake<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.450> it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
down and it flushes out the lake and it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.920 
down and it flushes out the lake and it
connects<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.290> Gulf<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:51.670> still<00:02:52.359> happens<00:02:52.780> it

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
connects to the Gulf it still happens it

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.410 
connects to the Gulf it still happens it
hasn't<00:02:53.290> been<00:02:53.349> obstructed<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.700> think

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
hasn't been obstructed and I think

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.199 
hasn't been obstructed and I think
that's<00:02:55.660> that's<00:02:56.170> just<00:02:56.700> incredible<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:58.000> it's

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
that's that's just incredible that it's

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.150 
that's that's just incredible that it's
still<00:02:58.510> here
