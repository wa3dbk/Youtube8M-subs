00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:26.709 
buffer it'll come right back it's not
going<00:05:15.389> to<00:05:15.450> harm<00:05:15.660> their<00:05:15.870> nails

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.629 

that's<00:05:27.529> why<00:05:27.679> the<00:05:27.739> scissors<00:05:28.129> need<00:05:28.279> to<00:05:28.339> be<00:05:28.429> good

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
that's why the scissors need to be good

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.399 
that's why the scissors need to be good
and<00:05:28.759> sharp<00:05:28.939> because<00:05:29.629> then<00:05:29.809> most<00:05:30.139> people's

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
and sharp because then most people's

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:38.139 
and sharp because then most people's
nails<00:05:30.619> are<00:05:30.769> pretty<00:05:31.099> tough<00:05:36.489> and<00:05:37.489> you<00:05:37.999> can

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:38.149 
nails are pretty tough and you can

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:40.659 
nails are pretty tough and you can
scrape<00:05:38.389> one<00:05:38.719> nail<00:05:38.929> at<00:05:38.959> a<00:05:39.110> time<00:05:39.319> and<00:05:39.709> then<00:05:40.009> go

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
scrape one nail at a time and then go

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.389 
scrape one nail at a time and then go
back<00:05:40.909> to<00:05:40.939> the<00:05:41.269> other<00:05:41.419> nails<00:05:41.719> and<00:05:42.169> if<00:05:43.099> you<00:05:43.219> don't

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:43.399 
back to the other nails and if you don't

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:45.069 
back to the other nails and if you don't
think<00:05:43.549> you<00:05:43.610> have<00:05:43.759> enough<00:05:44.029> and<00:05:44.179> do<00:05:44.659> some<00:05:44.869> more

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:45.079 
think you have enough and do some more

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:47.049 
think you have enough and do some more
that<00:05:45.559> way<00:05:45.709> you<00:05:45.769> don't<00:05:45.949> scrape<00:05:46.489> too<00:05:46.699> much<00:05:46.879> off

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:47.059 
that way you don't scrape too much off

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:55.059 
that way you don't scrape too much off
of<00:05:47.179> one<00:05:47.329> now<00:05:53.439> I'm<00:05:54.439> trying<00:05:54.679> to<00:05:54.769> angle<00:05:55.039> my

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
of one now I'm trying to angle my

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:56.799 
of one now I'm trying to angle my
fingers<00:05:55.489> down<00:05:55.669> for<00:05:55.969> so<00:05:56.179> it<00:05:56.269> does<00:05:56.419> fall<00:05:56.629> on<00:05:56.659> the

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:56.809 
fingers down for so it does fall on the

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:58.779 
fingers down for so it does fall on the
paper<00:05:57.019> you<00:05:57.949> might<00:05:58.069> want<00:05:58.219> to<00:05:58.279> remind<00:05:58.459> people<00:05:58.549> to

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
paper you might want to remind people to

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.929 
paper you might want to remind people to
do<00:05:58.969> that<00:06:00.219> okay<00:06:01.249> once<00:06:01.610> you've<00:06:01.759> collected

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:01.939 
do that okay once you've collected

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:04.689 
do that okay once you've collected
enough<00:06:02.479> enough<00:06:02.959> scrapings<00:06:03.469> and<00:06:03.649> nails<00:06:03.889> from

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
enough enough scrapings and nails from

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.399 
enough enough scrapings and nails from
their<00:06:04.879> hands<00:06:05.329> you're<00:06:05.839> going<00:06:05.989> to<00:06:06.079> take<00:06:06.259> your

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
their hands you're going to take your

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.049 
their hands you're going to take your
paper<00:06:06.589> a<00:06:08.979> little<00:06:09.979> funnel<00:06:10.369> out<00:06:10.489> of<00:06:10.699> it<00:06:10.849> and

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:11.059 
paper a little funnel out of it and

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:15.399 
paper a little funnel out of it and
funnel<00:06:11.989> the<00:06:12.110> scrapings<00:06:12.589> on<00:06:12.739> to<00:06:12.979> the<00:06:13.069> foil<00:06:14.409> we

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
funnel the scrapings on to the foil we

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:16.809 
funnel the scrapings on to the foil we
didn't<00:06:15.589> get<00:06:15.679> very<00:06:15.919> much<00:06:16.099> so<00:06:16.339> you<00:06:16.399> can't<00:06:16.699> really

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
didn't get very much so you can't really

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.609 
didn't get very much so you can't really
see<00:06:17.089> it<00:06:17.209> probably<00:06:17.509> on<00:06:17.569> the<00:06:17.659> video<00:06:17.929> but<00:06:18.559> anyway

00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:18.619 
see it probably on the video but anyway

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:19.779 
see it probably on the video but anyway
that's<00:06:18.919> what<00:06:19.039> you<00:06:19.129> do<00:06:19.279> you<00:06:19.399> put<00:06:19.429> it<00:06:19.639> on<00:06:19.699> the

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
that's what you do you put it on the

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.309 
that's what you do you put it on the
floor<00:06:19.999> and<00:06:20.300> you're<00:06:20.449> going<00:06:20.659> to<00:06:20.689> wrap<00:06:21.079> it<00:06:21.229> up

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
floor and you're going to wrap it up

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.259 
floor and you're going to wrap it up
just<00:06:21.559> like<00:06:21.679> you<00:06:21.800> do<00:06:21.919> a<00:06:21.949> hair<00:06:22.189> specimen<00:06:22.699> you're

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:23.269 
just like you do a hair specimen you're

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:25.749 
just like you do a hair specimen you're
gonna<00:06:23.389> fold<00:06:23.629> your<00:06:23.779> foil<00:06:24.249> only<00:06:25.249> thing<00:06:25.429> is<00:06:25.549> with

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
gonna fold your foil only thing is with

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.100 
gonna fold your foil only thing is with
nails<00:06:25.999> and<00:06:26.239> straight<00:06:26.539> things<00:06:26.749> you<00:06:26.869> need<00:06:27.019> to

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
nails and straight things you need to

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.079 
nails and straight things you need to
really<00:06:27.439> fold<00:06:27.769> it<00:06:28.009> because<00:06:28.369> those<00:06:28.610> scrapings

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:29.089 
really fold it because those scrapings

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.629 
really fold it because those scrapings
can<00:06:29.329> get<00:06:29.479> loose<00:06:29.689> very<00:06:30.139> easily<00:06:30.489> so<00:06:31.489> you're

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
can get loose very easily so you're

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.979 
can get loose very easily so you're
going<00:06:31.759> to<00:06:31.819> seal<00:06:32.389> it<00:06:32.539> up<00:06:32.599> very<00:06:32.959> well<00:06:33.079> very<00:06:33.529> tight

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:34.989 
going to seal it up very well very tight

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:38.409 
going to seal it up very well very tight
so<00:06:35.989> that<00:06:36.019> nothing's<00:06:36.559> going<00:06:36.769> to<00:06:36.800> come<00:06:36.979> out<00:06:37.419> can

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
so that nothing's going to come out can

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.059 
so that nothing's going to come out can
you<00:06:38.479> make<00:06:38.629> a<00:06:38.659> little<00:06:38.959> rectangle<00:06:39.499> or<00:06:39.619> a<00:06:39.649> square

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:40.069 
you make a little rectangle or a square

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:41.919 
you make a little rectangle or a square
you'll<00:06:40.639> everybody<00:06:41.269> have<00:06:41.509> their<00:06:41.629> own<00:06:41.779> little

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:41.929 
you'll everybody have their own little

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:43.419 
you'll everybody have their own little
method<00:06:42.349> but<00:06:42.469> this<00:06:42.619> is<00:06:42.739> the<00:06:42.829> one<00:06:42.949> I<00:06:42.979> like<00:06:43.249> to<00:06:43.399> use
