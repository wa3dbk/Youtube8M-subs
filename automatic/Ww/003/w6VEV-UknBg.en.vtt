00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
and until I started taking some infrared

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.089

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
star Space Command

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.860 
star Space Command
taken<00:04:10.890> infrared<00:04:11.340> photography<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.420> got<00:04:12.659> these

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
taken infrared photography and got these

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.619 
taken infrared photography and got these
invisible<00:04:13.560> flying<00:04:14.010> sources<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.390> thought

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
invisible flying sources so I thought

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.569 
invisible flying sources so I thought
well<00:04:15.750> as<00:04:15.840> these<00:04:16.079> entities<00:04:16.680> were<00:04:17.250> invisible

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
well as these entities were invisible

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.789 
well as these entities were invisible
now<00:04:18.060> bothering<00:04:18.329> me<00:04:18.570> I'd<00:04:18.870> try<00:04:19.169> some<00:04:19.380> infrared

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
now bothering me I'd try some infrared

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:20.690 
now bothering me I'd try some infrared
film<00:04:20.100> to

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
film to

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.490 
film to
and<00:04:21.180> that's<00:04:21.360> where<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.570> got<00:04:21.780> these<00:04:21.900> pictures<00:04:22.350> of

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
and that's where I got these pictures of

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.640 
and that's where I got these pictures of
these<00:04:22.590> entities<00:04:24.260> and<00:04:25.910> after<00:04:26.910> those<00:04:27.060> nights

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
these entities and after those nights
