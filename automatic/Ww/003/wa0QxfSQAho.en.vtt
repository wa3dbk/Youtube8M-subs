we<00:01:34.439> knew<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> once<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.130> turned<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> key<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
we knew that once we turned the key to

we knew that once we turned the key to
switch<00:01:35.909> everything<00:01:36.119> off<00:01:36.450> all<00:01:36.719> that<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.140> lost

and when that information was invaluable

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.010 
and when that information was invaluable
in<00:01:40.439> trying<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.369> determine<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.539> cause<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
in trying to determine what the cause of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.560 
in trying to determine what the cause of
the<00:01:43.289> incident<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.700> hardest<00:01:45.030> decision

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the incident was the hardest decision

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.480 
the incident was the hardest decision
was<00:01:45.990> em<00:01:47.149> when<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.719> had<00:01:48.899> 19<00:01:49.350> people<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.799> board<00:01:50.009> we

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
was em when we had 19 people on board we

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.310 
was em when we had 19 people on board we
had<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> call<00:01:51.240> whether<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.780> had<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> go

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
had to make a call whether we had to go

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.880 
had to make a call whether we had to go
so<00:01:53.189> far<00:01:53.219> we<00:01:53.549> had<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.820> stay<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.719> and<00:01:55.200> making

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so far we had to stay and and making

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.700 
so far we had to stay and and making
that<00:01:56.039> decision<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.729> definitely<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.539> hardest

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
that decision was definitely the hardest

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
that decision was definitely the hardest
once<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> decision<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.249> made<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.359> was<00:02:00.420> quite

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
once the decision was made it was quite

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.749 
once the decision was made it was quite
easy<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.409> once<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.039> was<00:02:02.130> made<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.579> knew

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
easy and once it was made we knew

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.819 
easy and once it was made we knew
exactly<00:02:02.909> what<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.450> were<00:02:03.539> going<00:02:03.749> to<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.049> but

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
exactly what we were going to do but

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.800 
exactly what we were going to do but
here<00:02:05.159> making<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.820> call<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> Bastille

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
here making that call for the Bastille

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.410 
here making that call for the Bastille
or<00:02:07.049> whether<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.499> go<00:02:08.030> certainly<00:02:09.030> was<00:02:09.179> tough

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
or whether to go certainly was tough

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.240 
or whether to go certainly was tough
tough<00:02:09.899> decision<00:02:10.289> once<00:02:10.590> we'd<00:02:10.770> properly

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
tough decision once we'd properly

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.520 
tough decision once we'd properly
evaluate<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.909> situation<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:13.110> there<00:02:13.290> anything

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
evaluate the situation is there anything

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.050 
evaluate the situation is there anything
we<00:02:13.800> could<00:02:13.950> do<00:02:14.159> to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
we could do to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.660 
we could do to
to<00:02:15.450> improve<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.110> situation<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:17.340> became

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
to improve the situation that became

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.300 
to improve the situation that became
clear<00:02:18.450> quite<00:02:19.200> early<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.739> wasn't<00:02:20.130> going<00:02:20.220> to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
clear quite early that wasn't going to

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.580 
clear quite early that wasn't going to
happen<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.630> what<00:02:21.810> we<00:02:21.930> were<00:02:22.050> doing<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.440> we

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
happen and so what we were doing is we

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.460 
happen and so what we were doing is we
were<00:02:22.709> maintaining<00:02:23.250> life<00:02:23.489> support<00:02:23.940> system

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
were maintaining life support system

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.140 
were maintaining life support system
maintaining<00:02:25.470> filing<00:02:25.860> gas<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.400> when<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
maintaining filing gas and when the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.910 
maintaining filing gas and when the
systems<00:02:27.510> are<00:02:27.630> all<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.930> running<00:02:27.989> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
systems are all up and running the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.120 
systems are all up and running the
communication<00:02:29.849> goes<00:02:30.660> back<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.200> beach<00:02:31.380> so

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
communication goes back to the beach so

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.440 
communication goes back to the beach so
the<00:02:32.220> people<00:02:32.519> on<00:02:32.640> shore<00:02:32.819> could<00:02:33.120> see<00:02:33.269> that

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the people on shore could see that

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.640 
the people on shore could see that
communication<00:02:34.110> they<00:02:34.260> could<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
communication they could see the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.990 
communication they could see the
pressures<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.280> temperatures<00:02:35.700> what<00:02:35.880> was

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
pressures the temperatures what was

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.330 
pressures the temperatures what was
happening<00:02:36.300> with<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.630> well<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:38.130> give

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
happening with the well and not give

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.100 
happening with the well and not give
them<00:02:38.580> good<00:02:38.790> information<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:39.599> try<00:02:39.870> and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
them good information to try and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.140 
them good information to try and
evaluate<00:02:40.290> what<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.069> cause<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.060> incident

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
evaluate what the cause of the incident

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.380 
evaluate what the cause of the incident
was<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.610> was<00:02:44.730> really<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.030> main

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
was and so that was really the main

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.479 
was and so that was really the main
reasons<00:02:45.870> why<00:02:46.170> we<00:02:46.440> why<00:02:46.769> we<00:02:46.800> stayed<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.310> board

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
reasons why we why we stayed on board

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.199 
reasons why we why we stayed on board
and<00:02:48.299> while<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:49.200> Tim<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.730> had<00:02:50.910> any

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
and while that Tim if we had any

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.410 
and while that Tim if we had any
escalation<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:52.230> all<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.160> platform<00:02:53.640> we

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
escalation at all on the platform we

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.110 
escalation at all on the platform we
were<00:02:54.600> confident<00:02:55.290> absolutely<00:02:56.010> confident<00:02:56.459> that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
were confident absolutely confident that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.460 
were confident absolutely confident that
we<00:02:57.269> could<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:57.540> been<00:02:57.630> off<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> platform<00:02:58.140> in

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
we could have been off the platform in

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.800 
we could have been off the platform in
five<00:02:58.650> minutes<00:02:58.890> by<00:02:59.160> life<00:02:59.370> board<00:02:59.640> one<00:03:00.599> of<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
five minutes by life board one of the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.300 
five minutes by life board one of the
things<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.349> 19<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.769> us<00:03:01.830> did<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.220> all

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
things that the 19 of us did we all

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.759 
things that the 19 of us did we all
practiced<00:03:02.790> our<00:03:02.940> lifeboat<00:03:03.360> drill<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.080> we

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
practiced our lifeboat drill and we

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.990 
practiced our lifeboat drill and we
checked<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.160> lifeboat<00:03:05.580> was<00:03:05.730> trapped

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
checked the lifeboat was trapped

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.759 
checked the lifeboat was trapped
ourselves<00:03:06.090> into<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.080> just<00:03:07.410> got<00:03:07.590> familiar

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
ourselves into it and just got familiar

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.960 
ourselves into it and just got familiar
with<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.250> harnesses<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.260> if<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:11.250> system<00:03:11.730> if

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
with the harnesses and if the system if

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.420 
with the harnesses and if the system if
they're<00:03:12.239> well<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.319> incident<00:03:13.709> escalated<00:03:14.250> and

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
they're well the incident escalated and

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.970 
they're well the incident escalated and
we<00:03:15.000> couldn't<00:03:15.269> get<00:03:15.450> helicopter<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.860> were

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
we couldn't get helicopter and we were

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.009 
we couldn't get helicopter and we were
confident<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.330> could<00:03:18.450> get<00:03:18.599> off<00:03:18.750> in<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
confident that we could get off in the

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.810 
confident that we could get off in the
lifeboat<00:03:19.200> within<00:03:19.650> five<00:03:19.859> minutes<00:03:20.100> break

lifeboat within five minutes break

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.340 
lifeboat within five minutes break
easily<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.299> weather<00:03:21.480> was<00:03:21.690> fine<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.109> way<00:03:22.230> that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
easily the weather was fine the way that

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.770 
easily the weather was fine the way that
was<00:03:22.440> good<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.829> sea<00:03:23.010> state<00:03:23.250> was<00:03:23.400> calm<00:03:23.670> him<00:03:24.450> so

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
was good the sea state was calm him so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.500 
was good the sea state was calm him so
it<00:03:24.900> really<00:03:25.140> didn't<00:03:25.500> him<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:25.950> didn't<00:03:26.820> impose

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
but should I see it wasn't an

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.130 
but should I see it wasn't an
unacceptable<00:03:31.620> risk<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:32.340> go<00:03:32.459> by<00:03:32.640> boat<00:03:32.989> thing<00:03:33.989> is

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
unacceptable risk to go by boat thing is

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.630 
unacceptable risk to go by boat thing is
demonstrated<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.950> whole<00:03:35.280> thing<00:03:35.519> is

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
demonstrated the whole thing is

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.670 
demonstrated the whole thing is

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
demonstrated that our procedures are

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.759 
demonstrated that our procedures are
good<00:03:37.859> our<00:03:38.190> process<00:03:38.549> is<00:03:38.790> good<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.739> although<00:03:40.739> we

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
good our process is good and although we

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.710 
good our process is good and although we
never<00:03:41.010> want<00:03:41.310> these<00:03:41.549> things<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.850> happen<00:03:42.030> when

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
it does have and this clearly
