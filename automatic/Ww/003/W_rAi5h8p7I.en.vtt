will they fight now I did a video on

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.020 
will they fight now I did a video on
will<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.679> velociraptors<00:00:14.460> fight<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
Diabolus Rex and that got really a

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.790 
Diabolus Rex and that got really a
pretty<00:00:18.480> good<00:00:18.630> response<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> figured<00:00:19.710> I

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
pretty good response so I figured I

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.060 
pretty good response so I figured I
would<00:00:19.949> do<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> t-rex<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.630> there's<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.650> shot

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
would do a t-rex one so there's one shot

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.950 
would do a t-rex one so there's one shot
in<00:00:23.279> particular<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.539> new<00:00:24.720> trailer<00:00:25.199> that

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
in particular in this new trailer that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.820 
in particular in this new trailer that
makes<00:00:27.960> me<00:00:28.199> believe<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:31.140> t-rex<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
makes me believe that the t-rex and the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.799 
makes me believe that the t-rex and the
DRX<00:00:32.189> are<00:00:32.399> headed<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> fight<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.390> it's

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
DRX are headed for a fight and it's

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.709 
DRX are headed for a fight and it's
really<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.200> big<00:00:34.710> homage<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:36.630> original

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
really a big homage to the original

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
cars that the kids were in so what I

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
cars that the kids were in so what I
think<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> happen<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.430> movie

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

think is going to happen in this movie
is<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:01.170> t-rex<00:01:01.620> will<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.399> section<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
is the t-rex will be on one section and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.820 
is the t-rex will be on one section and
the<00:01:03.210> diabolis<00:01:03.750> Rex<00:01:03.960> will<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.350> another

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
like that and she gets a flare she

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.179 
like that and she gets a flare she
lights<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.140> t-rex

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
lights it and then the t-rex

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.740 
lights it and then the t-rex
automatically<00:01:29.189> sees<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.640> flare<00:01:29.939> because<00:01:30.509> as

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
automatically sees the flare because as

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.539 
automatically sees the flare because as
we<00:01:30.960> saw<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.290> first<00:01:31.470> movie<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:31.979> attracted

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
we saw in the first movie it's attracted

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.300 
we saw in the first movie it's attracted
to that<00:01:32.820> step<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.329> then<00:01:33.990> she<00:01:34.229> would<00:01:34.439> run<00:01:35.100> with

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to that step and then she would run with

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.370 
to that step and then she would run with
the<00:01:35.490> flare<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.030> throw<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.720> where<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> dyad

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the flare and throw it to where the dyad

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.710 
the flare and throw it to where the dyad
less<00:01:37.590> Rex's<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> t-rex<00:01:38.970> will<00:01:39.210> go

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
less Rex's and then the t-rex will go

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.240 
less Rex's and then the t-rex will go
after<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.229> flare<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.829> see<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.250> dyad<00:01:41.610> listen

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
after the flare and see the dyad listen

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.640 
after the flare and see the dyad listen
Avila<00:01:42.640> succeeded<00:01:43.150> Rex<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.990> then<00:01:44.170> that<00:01:44.410> could

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
Avila succeeded Rex and then that could

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.460 
Avila succeeded Rex and then that could
lead<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.220> big<00:01:45.580> old<00:01:45.790> Dino<00:01:46.150> battle<00:01:46.660> which<00:01:47.230> were

totally<00:01:55.660> different<00:01:56.370> attire<00:01:57.370> than<00:01:57.790> she<00:01:58.060> was<00:01:58.360> in

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
totally different attire than she was in

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.380 
totally different attire than she was in
the<00:01:58.869> rest<00:01:59.680> of<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.100> trailer<00:02:00.640> what<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.150> seems

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
the rest of the trailer what it seems

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.060 
the rest of the trailer what it seems
she<00:02:01.600> looks<00:02:01.810> rugged<00:02:02.080> she<00:02:02.500> looks<00:02:02.710> like<00:02:02.830> she's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
she looks rugged she looks like she's

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.480 
she looks rugged she looks like she's
been<00:02:03.100> running<00:02:03.430> again<00:02:04.420> really<00:02:04.900> tired<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:06.070> I

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
been running again really tired so I

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.230 
been running again really tired so I
really<00:02:07.240> think<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:09.160> could<00:02:09.220> be<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.789> sign

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
really think that this could be a sign

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.699 
really think that this could be a sign
that<00:02:10.270> there<00:02:10.660> will<00:02:10.810> be<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.990> showdown<00:02:11.290> between

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
that there will be a showdown between

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.850 
that there will be a showdown between
these<00:02:12.580> two<00:02:12.820> Titans<00:02:13.150> as<00:02:13.600> far<00:02:14.320> as<00:02:14.440> who<00:02:14.620> will<00:02:14.800> win

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
these two Titans as far as who will win

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.940 
these two Titans as far as who will win
I<00:02:15.430> think<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.660> straight-up<00:02:17.170> fight<00:02:17.709> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
I think in a straight-up fight the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.760 
I think in a straight-up fight the
Diabolus<00:02:18.520> might<00:02:19.330> win<00:02:19.600> or<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.200> could<00:02:20.380> really<00:02:20.530> go

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
Diabolus might win or it could really go

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.300 
Diabolus might win or it could really go
either<00:02:20.800> way<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.280> be<00:02:21.580> honest<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:23.310> it's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
either way to be honest so it it's

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.130 
either way to be honest so it it's
really<00:02:24.640> up<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:24.970> air<00:02:25.060> whoever<00:02:25.600> gets<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.959> hold

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
really up in the air whoever gets a hold

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.680 
really up in the air whoever gets a hold
of<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.440> other<00:02:26.620> one<00:02:26.830> first<00:02:27.100> in<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:28.030> fight<00:02:28.330> as<00:02:28.540> who

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
of the other one first in a fight as who

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.479 
of the other one first in a fight as who
would<00:02:28.840> win<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:30.010> isn't<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.700> story<00:02:31.170> kind<00:02:32.170> of

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
would win but isn't a story kind of

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.729 
would win but isn't a story kind of
setting<00:02:33.489> if<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.150> were<00:02:34.480> directing<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.440> story

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
setting if I were directing the story

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.740 
setting if I were directing the story
and<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.610> final<00:02:36.880> showdown<00:02:37.300> I

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
and this is like the final showdown I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.080 
and this is like the final showdown I
would<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.770> velociraptors<00:02:39.520> chasing<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
would have the velociraptors chasing the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.699 
would have the velociraptors chasing the
humans<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.470> could<00:02:41.650> see<00:02:41.709> the

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
humans and then we could see the

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.170 
humans and then we could see the
dielectrics<00:02:44.709> on<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.010> t-rex<00:02:45.430> fighting<00:02:46.030> with

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
dielectrics on the t-rex fighting with

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.120 
dielectrics on the t-rex fighting with
each<00:02:46.209> other<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> end<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.860> would<00:02:47.920> have

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
each other and in the end I would have

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.180 
each other and in the end I would have
the<00:02:48.280> t-rex<00:02:48.870> kill<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.049> dialysis<00:02:50.680> if<00:02:50.769> I<00:02:50.980> were

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
the t-rex kill the dialysis if I were

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.180 
the t-rex kill the dialysis if I were
making

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
making

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.910 
making
because<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.210> kind<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.540> like<00:02:53.690> okay<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
because it's kind of like okay it's the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.490 
because it's kind of like okay it's the
devil<00:02:55.250> king<00:02:55.460> vs.<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.150> original<00:02:56.780> tyrant<00:02:57.320> king

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
devil king vs. the original tyrant king

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.490 
devil king vs. the original tyrant king
and<00:02:57.770> in<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.640> end<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.660> tyrant<00:03:00.080> king<00:03:00.230> would

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
and in the end the tyrant king would

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.180 
and in the end the tyrant king would
kill<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.220> dye<00:03:01.400> bliss<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.770> he<00:03:03.770> would<00:03:03.950> be<00:03:04.070> the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
kill the dye bliss and he would be the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.040 
kill the dye bliss and he would be the
King<00:03:04.400> again<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.850> that's<00:03:04.970> basically<00:03:05.270> where<00:03:05.990> I

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
King again and that's basically where I

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.170 
King again and that's basically where I
think<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.650> going<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.550> will<00:03:07.940> they<00:03:08.120> be

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
think it's going so will they be

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.570 
think it's going so will they be
fighting<00:03:08.750> it's<00:03:08.930> definitely<00:03:09.560> it's<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:10.130> definite

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
fighting it's definitely it's a definite

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.330 
fighting it's definitely it's a definite
possibility<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:11.540> my<00:03:12.260> opinion<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.220> it

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
possibility in my opinion and I think it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.270 
possibility in my opinion and I think it
will<00:03:13.460> be<00:03:13.520> cool<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:15.080> see<00:03:15.230> them<00:03:15.410> fight<00:03:15.830> because

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
will be cool to see them fight because

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.570 
will be cool to see them fight because
of<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.550> Claire<00:03:17.020> Claire<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.620> flare<00:03:19.040> because

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
of the Claire Claire the flare because

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.380 
of the Claire Claire the flare because
of<00:03:19.820> course<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.780> original<00:03:21.370> movie<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.580> they

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
of course in the original movie it they

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.480 
of course in the original movie it they
used<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.900> flare<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.380> attract<00:03:24.770> the<00:03:24.920> t-rex<00:03:25.310> like

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
used the flare to attract the t-rex like

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.790 
used the flare to attract the t-rex like
I<00:03:25.640> said<00:03:25.880> earlier<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.480> if<00:03:27.140> she<00:03:27.320> were<00:03:27.440> just<00:03:27.470> to

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
I said earlier and if she were just to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.890 
I said earlier and if she were just to
throw<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.340> flare<00:03:29.120> over<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.630> where<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
throw the flare over to where the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.930 
throw the flare over to where the
diverse<00:03:30.380> Rex<00:03:30.740> was<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.220> then<00:03:31.340> they<00:03:31.490> would<00:03:31.670> meet

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
diverse Rex was and then they would meet

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.340 
diverse Rex was and then they would meet
up<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.300> fight<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.660> think<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.170> would<00:03:33.230> be

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
up and fight I think that would be

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.470 
up and fight I think that would be
really<00:03:33.380> cool<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.460> think<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.880> t-rex<00:03:35.300> is

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
really cool so I think the t-rex is

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.680 
really cool so I think the t-rex is
definitely<00:03:35.960> gonna<00:03:36.140> walk<00:03:36.980> out<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:38.120> winner<00:03:38.360> not

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
definitely gonna walk out the winner not

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.390 
definitely gonna walk out the winner not
because<00:03:39.080> he's<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.320> better<00:03:39.620> fighter<00:03:39.980> just

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
because he's a better fighter just

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.670 
because he's a better fighter just
because<00:03:40.790> that's<00:03:41.060> how<00:03:41.210> the<00:03:41.270> story<00:03:41.420> in<00:03:42.020> my

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
because that's how the story in my

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.830 
because that's how the story in my
opinion<00:03:43.010> would<00:03:43.520> look<00:03:43.790> like<00:03:43.970> it's<00:03:44.210> going<00:03:44.450> or

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
opinion would look like it's going or

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.530 
opinion would look like it's going or
him<00:03:45.440> being<00:03:45.740> like<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.160> new<00:03:46.310> king<00:03:46.610> again<00:03:46.970> well

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
him being like the new king again well

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.720 
him being like the new king again well
not<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.810> new<00:03:47.960> king<00:03:48.200> him<00:03:48.830> showing<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.550> he<00:03:49.700> is

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
not the new king him showing that he is

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.160
