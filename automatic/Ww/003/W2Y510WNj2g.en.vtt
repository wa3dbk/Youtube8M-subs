kind<00:04:33.040> of<00:04:33.640> really<00:04:33.910> hard<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.540> go<00:04:34.720> against<00:04:35.020> that

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
kind of really hard to go against that

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.300 
kind of really hard to go against that
um<00:04:36.060> but<00:04:37.060> honestly<00:04:37.720> at<00:04:37.930> year's<00:04:38.260> end<00:04:38.380> I<00:04:38.860> had<00:04:39.130> this

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
um but honestly at year's end I had this

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.970 
um but honestly at year's end I had this
game<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:39.760> not<00:04:39.940> game<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.450> year<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.980> highly

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
doubt it's gonna be in a lot of people's

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.159 
doubt it's gonna be in a lot of people's
top<00:04:44.200> three<00:04:44.590> with<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.700> being<00:04:45.940> said<00:04:46.030> if<00:04:46.720> like

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
top three with that being said if like

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.500 
top three with that being said if like

know what it may be in your top three

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.730 
know what it may be in your top three
but<00:04:52.030> honestly<00:04:52.570> if<00:04:52.750> all<00:04:53.020> those<00:04:53.169> games<00:04:53.470> gonna

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
but honestly if all those games gonna

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.040 
but honestly if all those games gonna
get<00:04:53.890> delayed<00:04:54.130> which<00:04:54.430> they<00:04:54.610> did<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:55.060> I'm<00:04:55.810> just
