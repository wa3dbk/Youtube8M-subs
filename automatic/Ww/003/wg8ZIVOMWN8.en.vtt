there<00:03:37.639> if<00:03:37.879> you<00:03:38.000> had<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.540> giants<00:03:39.259> winning<00:03:39.470> and

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
there if you had the giants winning and

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.589 
there if you had the giants winning and
tampa<00:03:40.159> bay<00:03:40.310> winning<00:03:40.729> as<00:03:40.879> they<00:03:41.150> did<00:03:41.359> they'd

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
tampa bay winning as they did they'd

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.960 
tampa bay winning as they did they'd
still<00:03:41.930> be<00:03:41.959> lying<00:03:42.259> ten<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.739> eleven<00:03:42.790> seven<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:43.909> a

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
still be lying ten to eleven seven and a

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.520 
still be lying ten to eleven seven and a
half<00:03:44.000> that's<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.449> bargain<00:03:44.629> basement<00:03:45.139> price<00:03:45.319> for

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
half that's a bargain basement price for

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.990 
half that's a bargain basement price for
the<00:03:45.620> defending<00:03:45.979> super<00:03:46.250> bowl<00:03:46.280> champs<00:03:46.699> and<00:03:46.879> i'll

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
the defending super bowl champs and i'll

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.909 
the defending super bowl champs and i'll
take<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.299> one<00:03:47.449> step<00:03:47.479> further<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:48.290> think<00:03:48.590> if<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
take it one step further I think if the

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.369 
take it one step further I think if the
Giants<00:03:49.549> had<00:03:49.759> beat<00:03:50.060> Dallas<00:03:50.659> there'd<00:03:51.199> be<00:03:51.349> a

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
Giants had beat Dallas there'd be a

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.140 
Giants had beat Dallas there'd be a
chance<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.889> they<00:03:52.040> would<00:03:52.189> overlook<00:03:52.699> Tampa

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
chance that they would overlook Tampa

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.399 
chance that they would overlook Tampa
Bay<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.419> they<00:03:53.509> would<00:03:53.659> come<00:03:53.870> into<00:03:54.169> this<00:03:54.290> game

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
Bay that they would come into this game

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.289 
Bay that they would come into this game
and<00:03:54.829> they<00:03:55.220> would<00:03:55.370> kind<00:03:55.609> of<00:03:55.669> like<00:03:55.819> not<00:03:56.090> be

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
and they would kind of like not be

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.509 
and they would kind of like not be
pumped<00:03:56.689> up<00:03:56.810> for<00:03:57.079> it<00:03:57.199> however<00:03:57.349> going<00:03:58.219> in<00:03:58.310> front

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.490 
week I think that definitely is going to
change<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.209> week<00:04:17.419> against<00:04:17.750> Tampa's<00:04:18.079> defense

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:22.279 
and the Giants defense shredded for 433

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.730 
and the Giants defense shredded for 433
yards<00:04:22.550> last<00:04:22.909> week<00:04:23.090> by<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.389> Cowboys<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.409> Tampa

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
yards last week by the Cowboys but Tampa

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.200 
yards last week by the Cowboys but Tampa
doesn't<00:04:25.039> have<00:04:25.159> that<00:04:25.279> type<00:04:25.490> of<00:04:25.520> offensive

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210

to cam newton so I think Eli Manning's
going<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.539> be<00:04:32.630> able<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.900> shred<00:04:33.139> them<00:04:33.229> too<00:04:33.410> I
