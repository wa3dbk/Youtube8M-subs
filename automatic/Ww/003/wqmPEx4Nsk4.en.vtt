00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.690
 hello friends welcome to cook real 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.930
 free for those who can not cook 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.420
 today we are going to prepare french fries in 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.350
 three steps and it's also the third part 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.920
 from our series of potato chips 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.940
 let's use to pasaban was 0 that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.210
 it's the big potato 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.850
 the we are going very well with the help of a 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.460
 knife we remove all the earth and 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.500
 we drag them back to wash we go to 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.600
 peel half and the other half the 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.730
 We leave with a letter placed in a pot 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.920
 water to heat 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.190
 let's divide the lid 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.469
 in half we leave aside the one 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.650
 has another side of the corner and 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.960
 we cut it into slices in half moons 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.630
 we do the same with the potato that 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.630
 have the shell we reserve 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.579
 here we had thick croissants 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.010
 so what do you like 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.860
 add the potatoes to the water when 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.310
 boiling 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.500
 and we let them cook for about five 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.300
 minutes we test with the tip of a 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.480
 knife if they are already Softer 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.360
 we remove the water and take it to water 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.660
 with abundant ice we leave them there 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.479
 about two minutes then we take out this water 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.150
 with ice and we are going to place the potatoes 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 on a towel wipes a cloth 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.750
 absorbent kitchen 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.530
 we dry them very well we remove all the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.530
 excess of water 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.850
 we put them then on a table to 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.500
 chop or on a plate and we're going to add 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.500
 over wheat flour 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.480
 We passed the potatoes very well for the flour 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.850
 that we are smeared everywhere 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.090
 after that we put them in a 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.109
 strainer 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.859
 we move them so that we can remove everything 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:08.959
 the excess flour this is done to 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.030
 that we are more crispy potatoes 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.500
 we already have our oil heating up 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.299
 abundant oil and we test if it bubbles 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.760
 when we put the potato means 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.950
 which it is already so hot if we put 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.030
 all potatoes well distributed in the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.410
 oil and let them go cooking 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.530
 and golden 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.550
 we move them 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.480
 and we leave them until they are golden, not 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.480
 there was too much 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.470
 and obviously we do not let them burn 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.840
 when they are at this point 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.950
 with the help of a slotted spoon we are going to 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.950
 withdraw from the oil 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.050
 we approach well we take with the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.650
 skimmer on the wall of the pan 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.480
 drain the oil and take them to a 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.569
 dish with napkins or absorbent paper 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.670
 immediately we add salt 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.769
 and in this case if you want to 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.189
 You can add a little bit of 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.579
 turmeric or curry or you can add it 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.709
 paprika that is golden powder paprika 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.400
 and crispy on the outside and cooked and 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.400
 soft because
