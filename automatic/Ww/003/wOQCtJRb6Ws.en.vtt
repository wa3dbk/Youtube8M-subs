00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
that I get that nice little bit true to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.580 
that I get that nice little bit true to
sort<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.450> his<00:03:14.570> shape<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.080> bottom<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
sort of his shape to the bottom of it

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.070 
sort of his shape to the bottom of it
and<00:03:15.800> then<00:03:16.220> we'll<00:03:16.340> take<00:03:16.490> a<00:03:16.550> toothpick<00:03:17.060> drive<00:03:18.050> a

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
and then we'll take a toothpick drive a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.930 
and then we'll take a toothpick drive a
nice<00:03:18.380> little<00:03:18.620> hole<00:03:18.890> into<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.340> top<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.790> you

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
nice little hole into the top and you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.490 
nice little hole into the top and you
want<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.209> choose<00:03:20.480> your<00:03:20.870> little<00:03:21.110> mint<00:03:21.320> leaves

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
small pieces I found the smaller pieces

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.729 
small pieces I found the smaller pieces
best<00:03:28.880> for<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.150> carrots<00:03:29.570> ones<00:03:30.170> with<00:03:30.350> longer

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
best for the carrots ones with longer

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.050 
best for the carrots ones with longer
stems<00:03:30.980> are<00:03:31.130> really<00:03:31.310> good<00:03:31.459> for<00:03:31.610> our<00:03:31.670> radishes

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
stems are really good for our radishes

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.210 
stems are really good for our radishes
and<00:03:32.390> this<00:03:32.900> be<00:03:33.260> true<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:33.650> kind<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.010> want<00:03:34.160> to

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
relatively sort of I guess a long bushy

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.110 
relatively sort of I guess a long bushy
one<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:36.890> one<00:03:37.130> looks<00:03:37.489> just<00:03:37.760> about<00:03:37.970> perfect

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
one that one looks just about perfect

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.900 
one that one looks just about perfect
I'm<00:03:38.690> happy<00:03:38.989> with<00:03:39.200> him<00:03:39.489> now<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.550> want<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.790> make

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
I'm happy with him now you want to make

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.250 
I'm happy with him now you want to make
sure<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.239> snip<00:03:41.540> off<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.840> very<00:03:42.050> very

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
sure that you snip off the very very

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.020 
sure that you snip off the very very
bottom<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:42.830> that<00:03:42.950> all<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.190> can<00:03:43.340> see<00:03:43.489> is<00:03:43.519> green

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
bottom so that all you can see is green

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.390 
bottom so that all you can see is green
and<00:03:44.480> then<00:03:45.410> you're<00:03:45.739> just<00:03:45.890> going<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.130> slide<00:03:46.370> that

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
and then you're just going to slide that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.920 
and then you're just going to slide that
straight<00:03:46.850> into<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.150> little<00:03:47.269> toothpick<00:03:47.720> hole

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
straight into that little toothpick hole

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.630 
straight into that little toothpick hole
and<00:03:49.540> just<00:03:50.540> pinch<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.230> very<00:03:51.620> top<00:03:51.980> nice<00:03:52.370> and

and just pinch the very top nice and
tight<00:03:52.760> together<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.480> just<00:03:53.690> traps

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
tight together so that it just traps

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.509 
tight together so that it just traps
