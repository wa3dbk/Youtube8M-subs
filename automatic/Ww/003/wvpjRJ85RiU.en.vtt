00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.319
 I want to appeal to those who have not yet decided 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.849
 buy this year next 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.630
 acquire and generally 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.710
 greenhouse simple logical thinking 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.500
 led to merck thought that the four elements 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.880
 we know fire water earth and air 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 I told the previous videos that I 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.470
 for more in the greenhouse 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.070
 air so the height of my greenhouse 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.780
 the view must be above two meters 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.790
 somewhat taller than you and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.820
 approach the height of your apartment 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.620
 fire I think it's sun and good 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.420
 polycarbonate which will protect your 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.969
 the plant from burning will allow to achieve 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.820
 optimum air quality and not 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.110
 microclimate in the greenhouse this investment in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.860
 good polycarbonate means 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.900
 water is drip irrigation we will tell in 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.960
 the next series how to organize it 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.300
 he will be passive or just gravity 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.110
 from a kidney or with a little us 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.300
 acute but all even drainage systems 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.380
 hoses with holes that form 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:23.550
 watering to certain crops and the most 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.410
 important is the land we not only came out of 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.390
 land but in all the tales there warriors 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.440
 used the land carried with them 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.000
 so that it gives them strength to work the earth 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.760
 allows you to give some of your 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.480
 charge possibly negative accumulated 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.740
 in city life in the land and get 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.770
 on the contrary, well, by their work of creation 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.440
 exchange negative energy for charge 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.470
 positive physically arrived 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.210
 tired perhaps resigning but rested 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.190
 morally 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.460
 also if you don't want in huge 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.520
 squares 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.130
 grow crops look it up for you 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.570
 something new unusual you prefer 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.610
 buy in the store then it seems to me that 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.950
 greenhouses is that little oasis that 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.160
 you can arrange 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.610
 planting all grass 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.470
 trim it and in the greenhouse this is yours 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.800
 your little child 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.470
 and you can start up about it here are our 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.940
 the works you are trying to put all these 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.820
 single whole and so in the background 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.300
 we produce a two-liter greenhouse 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.250
 2 meters high and 2 meters step that is 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.480
 you must understand that the greenhouse is always 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.940
 will be 4 6 8 10 12 who is 12 better 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.120
 put two possibly different greenhouse or 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.330
 uniquely septum and then 3 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.250
 meter width and 2 meters height 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.670
 4 meters wide and two and a half 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.530
 meter height in the previous video we 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.350
 told about the greenhouse 3 meters wide 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.560
 and two and a half meters high and here 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.200
 there is a piece of a piece of rectangles 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.330
 pliz and gable three and a half meters 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.480
 at 280 our work seems to us that 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.940
 maybe it's time to change the approach in 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.360
 you can improve your life 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.040
 life at any moment for investment 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.010
 it takes money but you don't care 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.390
 buy some greenhouse if you already 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.700
 decide and save a little more to enter 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.270
 I now ask you to think about it 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.030
 the moment that you eventually want to get something 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.770
 Is it something that you will have and just you 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.690
 You will grow a crop that will 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.000
 enough please have that option 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.550
 you have little space and 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.330
 but you want to be engaged with cultural 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.460
 plants 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.550
 there is such an option you want to you 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.730
 it was nice interesting how you used to 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.350
 big apartment a lot of air more 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.269
 freedom of plants such an option 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.769
 offer any options that you 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:24.580
 can satisfy come on the ride 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.070
 Apple 6 on the back of the house ideas 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.040
 which with escalators samples cost 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.770
 around the clock you can contact us we 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.710

 many years and you will be constantly at her
