connections<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:54.740> would<00:01:54.860> work<00:01:55.040> in

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
connections so this would work in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.790 
connections so this would work in
different<00:01:55.820> countries<00:01:56.170> but<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.350> just<00:01:57.560> need

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
this tip is a lot more clunky than

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.540 
this tip is a lot more clunky than
otherwise<00:02:17.780> would<00:02:17.900> be<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.950> goes<00:02:19.100> from<00:02:19.630> USB

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
otherwise would be and it goes from USB

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:30.390 
otherwise would be and it goes from USB
to<00:02:22.550> your<00:02:22.670> Galaxy<00:02:23.239> Tab<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.770> here's<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.980> USB<00:02:26.170> to

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
this is this in the Samsung adaptor I'll

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.500 
this is this in the Samsung adaptor I'll
i<00:02:33.290> don't<00:02:33.530> know<00:02:33.620> if<00:02:33.739> it's<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.040> 30-pin<00:02:34.730> adapter<00:02:34.970> or

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
proprietary connection so you can get

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.340 
proprietary connection so you can get
replacement<00:02:41.570> cables<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.020> too<00:02:42.170> much<00:02:42.290> a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
check it out it is it's a nice device

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.039 
check it out it is it's a nice device
it's<00:03:17.269> kind<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:19.670> all<00:03:19.820> plastic<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.930> get

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
it's kind of it's all plastic so you get

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.630 
it's kind of it's all plastic so you get
a<00:03:21.110> plastic<00:03:21.380> kite<00:03:21.739> feel<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.160> but<00:03:22.370> it's<00:03:22.489> not

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
a plastic kite feel to it but it's not

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.430 
a plastic kite feel to it but it's not
not<00:03:23.299> really<00:03:23.480> in<00:03:23.570> a<00:03:23.630> bad<00:03:23.750> way<00:03:23.810> it's<00:03:24.260> got<00:03:24.410> a

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
not really in a bad way it's got a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.640 
not really in a bad way it's got a
little<00:03:24.530> bit<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.799> heft<00:03:24.950> feel<00:03:25.820> solid<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:27.350> is

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
little bit of heft feel solid I it is

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.949 
little bit of heft feel solid I it is
slippery<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:30.459> could<00:03:31.459> see<00:03:31.850> maybe<00:03:32.720> not

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
slippery so I could see maybe not

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.420 
slippery so I could see maybe not
dropping<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:33.830> having<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.310> few<00:03:34.549> scares<00:03:36.430> so

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
dropping it but having a few scares so

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.280 
dropping it but having a few scares so
the<00:03:37.670> glass<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.390> little<00:03:38.630> bit<00:03:38.720> more<00:03:38.840> grippy

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
the glass is a little bit more grippy

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.410 
the glass is a little bit more grippy
but<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.220> plastic<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:40.910> back<00:03:41.180> is

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
but the plastic on the back is

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.270 
but the plastic on the back is
definitely<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.440> could<00:03:42.560> see<00:03:42.709> from<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.010> glare

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
definitely you could see from the glare
