tried to douche a Dory and he completely

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.140 
tried to douche a Dory and he completely
freaked<00:02:22.250> out<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.610> because<00:02:22.700> he<00:02:22.970> started

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
freaked out it's because he started

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.580 
freaked out it's because he started
thinking<00:02:23.569> of<00:02:23.630> renting<00:02:23.870> he<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.349> started

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
thinking of renting he just started

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.170 
thinking of renting he just started
shaking<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.069> time<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.459> ventilating<00:02:25.849> stuff

like<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:26.840> makes<00:02:27.050> me<00:02:27.170> think<00:02:27.230> was<00:02:27.709> him

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
like that so this makes me think was him

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
like that so this makes me think was him
copying<00:02:28.700> other<00:02:28.880> people's<00:02:29.090> jutsu<00:02:29.900> away<00:02:30.470> the

copying other people's jutsu away the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.160 
copying other people's jutsu away the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
substitute from his own was the way

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.440 
substitute from his own was the way
that's<00:02:33.380> up<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.800> his<00:02:34.010> skills<00:02:34.310> from<00:02:34.610> his<00:02:35.180> own

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
that's up to to his skills from his own

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.809
