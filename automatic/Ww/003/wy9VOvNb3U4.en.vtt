00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.879
 remember that materials and everything 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.160
 that we occupy, I leave them below in the 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.599
 description of the video and good for this 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.849
 craft where I will be using 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.459
 good plastic bottles we 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:20.230
 we worry is the bottle that is 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:23.760
 clean and dry then let's cut a 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.760
 little more than half 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.750
 as up to here 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.720
 and cut it out 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.820
 and you have to stay like this 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.570
 it matters if the cut is half ugly 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.300
 it does not matter then we are going to occupy a 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.390
 down that is preferably a color 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.180
 What else I regret a lot and we will go 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.699
 marking the outline or to where 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.809
 we want it to come cheaper and very 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.420
 important 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.590
 these two here are going to be the legs of 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.200
 opposite and the one that is here that forms 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.840
 like a triangle in this part of here 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.540
 here is going to be the tail the two legs 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.370
 and the load queue on this side then 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.370
 here draw 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.950
 ear with a drawing space to the other 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.720
 ear does not have to look perfect 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.370
 right now later on , you're going to 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.690
 have as more time to give more 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.500
 detail and after 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.500
 the outline 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.890
 and it's better that you go as 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.380
 bits you needed a flip up 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.460
 there it is going to stay then crooked and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.990
 I needed to stay more 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.890
 right 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.490
 since you have this done now if you go to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.920
 give as more perfection to the ears 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.470
 of the cat 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.159
 and what they are going to do is cut out of this 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.040
 way to take your scissors I was going to 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.460
 go cutting sections to the line that 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.460
 we have 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.460
 the line that we mark 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.750
 here 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.640
 and here all around and here 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.069
 up to the little ears where we mark them 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.940
 then you go and cut section by 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.180
 section 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.530
 in this way 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.660
 so that you have more right than 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.730
 already cut you will be this way 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.670
 I forgot to mark the tail on the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.380
 back but before you cut it 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.170
 you have to mark the tail in that part 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.980
 from here the way you want and the 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.680
 you cut m the unused tail put it but 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.620
 it's also nice like that but 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.170
 only thing that is missing is to take paint 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.330
 Acrylic a brush and paint it by the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.239
 part of inside let's give it more or 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.790
 minus about 4 layers of paint you will leave 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.680
 assumes let it dry and the others and 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.750
 so that he will not be seen as very 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.750
 transparent the color 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.130
 and after you paint it and let it 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.490
 dry nothing but what is missing is 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.590
 put of the face 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.330
 and it depends on how to give the face 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.660
 have the base draw with down 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.480
 indelible if you're wrong or something else 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.540
 you take a piece of cotton with acetone 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.500
 or alcohol and what is it and we are going to 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.600
 paint and good you look like this 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.330
 I tell them that when they put the tail 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.950
 pleasantly beautiful also with ccoo the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.950
 Headquarters in this way 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.069
