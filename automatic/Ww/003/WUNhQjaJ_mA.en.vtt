00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.830
 management of 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.760
 remember that the birds more hard 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.440
 the thermoregulatory system does not develop 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.100
 and for this reason the environment in which they will be during the 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.819
 first days of life 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.649
 when the chicks are raised in very narrow spaces 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.519
 they lower their food consumption 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.759
 they lose uniformity and gain weight very slowly 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.650
 so as not to limit your living space 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.480
 It is recommended to adapt a kind of tunnel and for this they are used 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.520
 the external curtains the side curtains the ceiling or curtains 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.230
 higher 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.500
 and the curtain in the butt of the reception area 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.230
 this practice helps to keep the desired temperature in the breeding area 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.230
 and represents a significant gas saving 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.610
 the installation of curtains in the empty space of the house also 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.740
 Helps maintain a constant temperature in the breeding area 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.970
 lateral openings must be available for the exit of harmful gases such as 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.420
 carbon dioxide 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.829
 ammonia or carbon monoxide and that is at the same time allow the entry 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.300
 of air for internal replacement 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.630
 providing the oxygen that the points need 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.650
 In summary 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.700
 the goal is to maintain a constant temperature 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.160
 eliminating harmful gases and allowing the entry of oxygen 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.000
 preventing sudden changes in temperature and relative humidity 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.310
 and the entrance of drafts 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.770
 this is why it is vital to constantly monitor the temperature and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.770
 humidity through an environmental thermo hydrometer 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.230
 When the environmental temperature is very high, the house loses relative humidity 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.440
 and the baby food dehydrates 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.440
 the creators must be turned off and the side curtain opened 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.830
 If the temperature continues to increase, the external curtain of the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.270
 shed in half 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.880
 retaining the same level of the side kitchen 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.050
 to prevent drafts' from directly impacting the public 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.470
 food handling 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.310
 the supply of food is of vital importance 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.120
 before unloading army 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.100
 the food must be served either in trays baby feeders 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.919
 the tower of the count eros and on paper 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.749
 must be done in small quantities to guarantee freshness 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.749
 stimulate consumption and reduce environmental pollution 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.910
 it is very important to always keep in mind 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.630
 that you should serve many times small amount and often a lot of quantity 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.189
 of food 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.599
 the daily practice of food supply 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.019
 must ensure that the chick has access to fresh food 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:33.869
 for that reason 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:37.909
 you should never serve fresh food on old weapons from the previous day 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.470
 in each day when the food is going to be supplied 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.589
 the old food must be collected 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.609
 and then pass it through a server 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.179
 that allows the food particle passion 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.159
 and garbage is retained 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.809
 this solid food 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:55.739
 must be supplied again in the feeders without mixing with the new 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.330
 it is important to scrape the coca fund daily, grant scholarships 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.230
 and flip the impacts in order to keep the food clean and fresh 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.880
 the broiler in Colombia in its first three weeks of life 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.949
 consume two different diets 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.969
 once pere initiation 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.509
 indicated for the first days of life 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.689
 and another initiation for the remaining fifteen days 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:24.339
 during the first ten days of life, master project is supplied 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:25.190
 food 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.520
 micro pelletized at a rate of 200 grams per chicken 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.690
 then we continued with the second diet our support as 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.759
 until the end of the initiation period 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.549
 master collection is the indicated food for newborn purito 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.499
 its presentation in micro pl 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.789
 ensures high and uniform food consumption 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.979
 its red color attracts the attention of the chick and stimulates its consumption 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.779
 contains special formula 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.290
 with reinforcements in mineral salts and proteins 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.349
 to ensure optimal development of vital organs in the brochure as 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.660
 heart basso irago 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.029
 immune system and digestive system 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.089
 which have their greatest development during the first week of life 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:10.279
 as it is the first food of the project has a higher amount of protein 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.229
 that the initiator 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.619
 Other objectives of the chick master supply are 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:17.689
 improve the immunity of the poyo 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:20.389
 facilitate the absorption of the yolk sac 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.190
 and improve the results obtained and the economic returns at the end of 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:26.370
 north 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.129
 reception of the chick 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.889
 the birds of a day are very delicate 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.770
 for this reason it should be handled gently 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.520
 more slowly and with much affection 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.900
 the boxes in which the chicks arrive are entered into the house and the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.740
 to do a count of these 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.190
 to proceed to verify quantities 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.840
 and open the north register 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.940
 To encourage the uniform development of the lots, it is recommended to receive the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.919
 jars separated by sexes ie 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.900
 an area for males kilometers for females 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.789
 then we proceed to weigh the project at home 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.419
 subtracting the weight of the box from the initial weight and finally calculating the average 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.580
 of weight upon arrival 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.600
 the discarding of the chick must be done in the shortest possible time 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.240
 allowing them to have easy access to food and water 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.400
 It is best to download it on the trays with the area covered with paper 

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:25.469
 polypropylene which contain food since the chick first 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.229
 who commented what he thinks 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.569
 when the chicks are on the floor, they are taught to locate the water 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:33.409
 of drink 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.849
 well be gmt but of bell covered eroski poniente 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.020
 for this it is practical to take them to introduce their beak in the cauldron or 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.059
 Activate with your finger the nipples of the miter sprue 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.270
 in a short time the chick adapts and is distributed in the whole area of ​​the circle 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.830
 this is a sample that confirms that the temperature is comfortable indicating 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.360
 When opening the records, you must take into account 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.480
 keep a record for each house and and a general record of the lot with the 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.889
 Following data 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.339
 name of the farm 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:07.749
 Lot Number 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:09.029

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:10.169
 number of birds 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.460
 in fairy house 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.809
 initial weight 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:14.169
 start date 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.569
 and sex 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.589
 to optimize the relative humidity inside the reception area 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.040
 it is very important not to let rise the environmental temperature of the levels 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.039
 recommended 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.610
 and when it is less than 50% 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.270
 it turns out putin put the girls with water 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.539
 to achieve evaporation and maintain humidity indicates
