to get six point five which is really

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.789 
to get six point five which is really
really<00:01:50.939> decent<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.170> I'd<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
really decent that's the one I'd have it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.530 
really decent that's the one I'd have it
is<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.369> bit<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:53.670> expensive<00:01:53.970> though<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
is a little bit more expensive though a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.380 
is a little bit more expensive though a
big<00:01:55.470> part<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> appeal<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.909> atom<00:01:57.240> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
big part of the appeal of the atom is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.899 
big part of the appeal of the atom is
that<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.810> much<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.469> customizable<00:01:59.460> in

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that so much of it is customizable in

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.929 
that so much of it is customizable in
fact<00:02:00.329> Opel<00:02:00.930> says<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.860> options<00:02:02.369> are<00:02:02.640> infinite

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
fact Opel says that options are infinite

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.719 
fact Opel says that options are infinite

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
so go into the dealership and test them

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.850 
so go into the dealership and test them
tell<00:02:06.090> them<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.360> want<00:02:06.509> pink<00:02:07.079> wheels<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.740> a

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
can even get a starry roof now you might

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.560 
can even get a starry roof now you might
be<00:03:14.800> thinking<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.580> is<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> very<00:03:16.060> small

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
be thinking that this is a very small

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.560 
be thinking that this is a very small
car<00:03:16.930> with<00:03:16.959> only<00:03:17.890> two<00:03:18.370> doors<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.150> must<00:03:19.390> have

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
car with only two doors so it must have

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.380 
car with only two doors so it must have
a<00:03:19.600> very<00:03:19.840> tiny<00:03:20.410> boot<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.070> well<00:03:21.220> you'd<00:03:21.550> be<00:03:21.820> sort

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
a very tiny boot and well you'd be sort

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.140 
a very tiny boot and well you'd be sort
of<00:03:22.540> correct<00:03:22.840> but<00:03:23.530> it's<00:03:24.040> actually<00:03:24.489> quite<00:03:24.760> deep

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
of correct but it's actually quite deep

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.300 
of correct but it's actually quite deep
so<00:03:25.420> it's<00:03:25.570> quite<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.750> useful<00:03:26.410> space<00:03:26.709> as<00:03:26.920> you'll

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
so it's quite a useful space as you'll

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.949 
so it's quite a useful space as you'll
see<00:03:27.580> we<00:03:28.180> managed<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.480> get<00:03:29.010> pretty<00:03:30.010> hefty

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
see we managed to get pretty hefty

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.840 
see we managed to get pretty hefty
toolbox<00:03:31.959> into<00:03:32.290> there<00:03:32.520> but<00:03:33.520> very<00:03:33.840> quickly<00:03:35.850> you

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
toolbox into there but very quickly you

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.370 
toolbox into there but very quickly you
can<00:03:37.060> drop<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.600> rear<00:03:37.780> seats<00:03:38.160> completely<00:03:39.160> flat
