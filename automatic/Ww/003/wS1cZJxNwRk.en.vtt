on some of the more modern type strats
that<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.660> make<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.050> not<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.290> much<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> vintage

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that we make and not so much the vintage

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320 
that we make and not so much the vintage
stuff<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.160> has<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> nice<00:02:14.640> vintage<00:02:15.060> look<00:02:15.300> to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
stuff but it has a nice vintage look to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.500 
stuff but it has a nice vintage look to
it<00:02:16.040> we<00:02:17.040> put<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.250> transition<00:02:17.850> logo<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.270> here

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
it we put the transition logo on here

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.550 
it we put the transition logo on here
because<00:02:18.810> we<00:02:18.930> thought<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.350> would<00:02:19.500> be

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
because we thought that that would be

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.430 
because we thought that that would be
fun<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.890> put<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.570> on<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:22.050> guitar<00:02:22.410> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
fun to put on a on on this guitar and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.640 
fun to put on a on on this guitar and
and<00:02:23.990> it's<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.230> 22<00:02:26.060> 22<00:02:27.060> fret<00:02:27.420> what<00:02:28.200> we<00:02:28.260> call<00:02:28.410> but

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
and it's a 22 22 fret what we call but

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.350 
and it's a 22 22 fret what we call but
adjust<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.730> trust<00:02:30.060> rather<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
adjust so the the trust rather the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.990 
adjust so the the trust rather the
jested<00:02:30.690> here<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.050> not<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.730> kind<00:02:32.940> of

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
jested here and not here so it kind of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.940 
jested here and not here so it kind of
looks<00:02:33.240> more<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.959> like<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> traditional<00:02:36.950> 50

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950

really cool lamination the way that we

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.390 
really cool lamination the way that we
have<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.840> build<00:02:57.959> strap<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.830> have<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.040> pay<00:02:59.130> tele

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
have to build strap we have to pay tele

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.910 
have to build strap we have to pay tele
bodies<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.970> from<00:03:00.930> with<00:03:01.440> this<00:03:01.530> hundred<00:03:01.800> year

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
bodies is from with this hundred year

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.100 
bodies is from with this hundred year
old<00:03:01.950> pine<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.989> have

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
old pine that we have is that you have

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.710 
old pine that we have is that you have
to<00:03:04.200> kind<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.410> sandwich<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:04.860> together<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.720> this

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
to kind of sandwich it together so this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.000 
to kind of sandwich it together so this
side<00:03:06.959> would<00:03:07.140> be<00:03:07.230> two<00:03:07.410> pieces<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.890> glue

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
side would be two pieces to glue

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.500 
side would be two pieces to glue
together<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.520> side<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.820> two<00:03:08.970> pieces<00:03:09.150> glued

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
together this side is two pieces glued

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.420 
together this side is two pieces glued
together<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:10.019> then<00:03:10.410> those<00:03:10.680> four<00:03:11.010> pieces<00:03:11.190> are

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
together and then those four pieces are

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.640 
together and then those four pieces are
glued<00:03:11.610> together<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.200> when<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.290> look<00:03:13.470> at<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
glued together and when you look at the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.110 
glued together and when you look at the
guitar<00:03:13.769> on<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.100> light<00:03:14.280> there's<00:03:14.549> gonna<00:03:14.640> be<00:03:14.820> you

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.259 
pickups that we kind of miss is on a
traditional<00:03:58.620> staggered<00:03:59.100> strat<00:03:59.370> pick<00:03:59.610> up<00:03:59.790> the

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
traditional staggered strat pick up the

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.270 
traditional staggered strat pick up the
pole<00:04:00.600> piece<00:04:00.810> for<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.170> B<00:04:01.350> string<00:04:01.739> is<00:04:01.920> really

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
pole piece for the B string is really

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.420 
pole piece for the B string is really
sunk<00:04:02.850> way<00:04:03.209> way<00:04:03.959> down<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.739> it's<00:04:04.890> not<00:04:04.980> very<00:04:05.130> loud

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
sunk way way down so it's not very loud

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.220 
sunk way way down so it's not very loud
but<00:04:05.760> we<00:04:05.880> kind<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.180> like<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.510> way<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.750> B<00:04:06.900> string

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
but we kind of like the way the B string

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.340 
but we kind of like the way the B string
sounds<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:07.950> cords<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.579> so<00:04:09.209> we<00:04:09.420> raised<00:04:09.690> the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
sounds in the cords and so we raised the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.170 
sounds in the cords and so we raised the
B<00:04:10.530> string<00:04:10.829> up<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.130> we<00:04:11.220> just<00:04:11.430> we<00:04:11.730> mess<00:04:11.940> with<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
B string up and we just we mess with the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.550 
B string up and we just we mess with the
stagger<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.630> little<00:04:12.840> bit<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:13.020> these<00:04:13.110> pickups

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
stagger a little bit on these pickups

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.740 
stagger a little bit on these pickups
and<00:04:13.760> they're<00:04:14.760> they're<00:04:15.599> wound<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:16.049> little

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
and they're they're wound a little

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.319 
and they're they're wound a little
little<00:04:17.650> hotter<00:04:17.860> than<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:18.160> stock<00:04:18.400> pickup<00:04:18.790> so

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
little hotter than a stock pickup so

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.880 
little hotter than a stock pickup so
