00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.759
 there is nothing else 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.309
 again 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.320
 therefore 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.090
 9 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:38.090
 there is the passion to win 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.090
 two 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.200
 and it's competing in another side it's called 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.140
 back as that yes clear this apart 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.510
 I think that at another time I'm a little 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.430
 largest cava is not the first time 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.520
 they knew if mere had 18 to 10 17 now 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.920
 Now I'm about 30 years old, do not be 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.910
 good is another thing is another thing that 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.910
 changed from that era 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.970
 to groups and is the same someone always 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.550
 always puts a group what knows what 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.000
 that he likes and I think he's 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.900
 within what one does not like or is 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.850
 is in the set or is competing 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.110
 with the set one knows what I 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.290
 I wanted the die for the whole what 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.490
 put and a boyfriend does not like it we're 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 going according becomes more 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.490
 responsibility or the other way around gives more 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.170
 quiet because yes always good 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.960
 some is no more responsibility if you are 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.450
 good because you saw that sometimes people 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.790
 before seeing how they level the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.800
 show before seeing it then as 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.229
 harder you saw it gets complicated always 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.090
 complicate but but we do not take 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.000

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.610

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.830

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.040
 beyond when they explode if acs is 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.810

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.060

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.810

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.810

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:03.180

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.300

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.600
 a category we will do 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.770

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.560

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.000

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.330

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.290
 more acute environments for example 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:45.750
