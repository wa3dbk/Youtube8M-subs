00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
getting a lot of negative and very

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.050 
getting a lot of negative and very
little<00:00:24.930> positive<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.400> reason<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.670> feel<00:00:26.910> this

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
little positive the reason I feel this

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 
little positive the reason I feel this
way<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.539> kind<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.050> feel<00:00:28.199> Sony's<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.980> blame<00:00:29.310> for

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
way I kind of feel Sony's the blame for

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.980 
way I kind of feel Sony's the blame for
this<00:00:29.730> negative<00:00:30.240> feedback<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.810> they're

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this negative feedback that they're

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.130 
this negative feedback that they're
getting<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.769> reason<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.600> every<00:00:33.600> time<00:00:33.809> Sony

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
getting the reason is every time Sony

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.870 
getting the reason is every time Sony
made<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> new<00:00:34.620> console<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.370> never<00:00:35.610> really

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
made a new console they never really

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
made a new console they never really
changed<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> controller<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.710> being<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
changed the controller and being that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.010 
changed the controller and being that
there<00:00:38.370> never<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.940> any<00:00:39.270> change<00:00:39.660> now<00:00:39.989> that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.470 
there never was any change now that
there<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.469> change<00:00:40.890> people<00:00:41.579> don't<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.300> know

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.049 
there is change people don't really know
how<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> adjust<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.920> myself<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.610> really

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
how to adjust to it like myself I really

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.819

something<00:00:47.039> different<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> don't<00:00:48.539> like

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
something different I kind of don't like

it<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.260> kind<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.649> feel<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> way<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
it and I kind of feel that's the way the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.029 
it and I kind of feel that's the way the
public<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.390> reacting<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.469> because

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
public is reacting to this and because

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.709 
public is reacting to this and because
Sony<00:00:53.309> never<00:00:53.520> changed<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.000> controller<00:00:54.390> they're

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
Sony never changed a controller they're

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.479 
Sony never changed a controller they're
like<00:00:54.870> oh<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.230> god<00:00:55.469> they're<00:00:55.710> finally<00:00:56.039> changing

like oh my god they're finally changing

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.310 
like oh my god they're finally changing
it<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> they're<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.570> liking<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.140> too

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
actually copying the Dreamcast once

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.730 
actually copying the Dreamcast once
again<00:01:17.729> Sega<00:01:18.240> pretty<00:01:18.630> much<00:01:18.810> showed<00:01:19.170> how<00:01:19.439> ahead

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
again Sega pretty much showed how ahead

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.940 
again Sega pretty much showed how ahead
of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> game<00:01:20.130> Lee<00:01:20.369> work<00:01:20.900> in<00:01:21.900> gaming<00:01:22.530> period

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
of the game Lee work in gaming period

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
of the game Lee work in gaming period
how<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.280> pretty<00:01:23.549> much<00:01:23.640> were<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.240> future<00:01:24.509> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
how they pretty much were the future of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.320 
how they pretty much were the future of
gaming<00:01:24.930> unfortunately<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.640> Dreamcast<00:01:27.150> has

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
gaming unfortunately the Dreamcast has

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.359 
gaming unfortunately the Dreamcast has
died<00:01:27.600> too<00:01:27.900> quickly<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.829> Dreamcast

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
died too quickly because the Dreamcast

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.450 
died too quickly because the Dreamcast
did<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> screen<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.860> its<00:01:32.009> controller

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460

mark that every controller should have a
screen<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.520> every<00:02:00.090> controller<00:02:00.509> should

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
screen in it every controller should

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.649 
screen in it every controller should
have<00:02:01.469> hey<00:02:02.130> even<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.549> touch<00:02:02.729> screen<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.479> once

again<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.049> isn't<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.530> tablet<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.520> this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
again this isn't a tablet it's just this

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.010 
again this isn't a tablet it's just this
looks<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.360> something<00:02:06.869> completely

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
looks to be something completely

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
looks to be something completely
different<00:02:07.649> than<00:02:07.860> what<00:02:07.979> Nintendo's<00:02:08.610> doing

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
different than what Nintendo's doing

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.999 
different than what Nintendo's doing
let's<00:02:09.539> be<00:02:09.690> honest<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> screen<00:02:10.530> looks<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.860> be

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
let's be honest the screen looks to be

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.760 
let's be honest the screen looks to be
about<00:02:11.099> two<00:02:11.580> inches<00:02:11.940> big<00:02:12.209> if<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.510> I

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
about two inches big if that I

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.960 
about two inches big if that I
doubt<00:02:13.920> there's<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.670> game

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
doubt there's going to be like game

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.720 
doubt there's going to be like game
playing<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.600> screen<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.430> honestly<00:02:17.430> think

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
playing on the screen I honestly think

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.910 
playing on the screen I honestly think
it's<00:02:18.240> just<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.630> be<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:19.020> select<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.740> start

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
it's just going to be a select and start

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.190 
it's just going to be a select and start
button<00:02:20.460> screen<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:21.000> may<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.240> their<00:02:21.450> time<00:02:21.780> for

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
button screen it may be their time for

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.900 
button screen it may be their time for
what<00:02:22.350> these<00:02:22.500> images<00:02:22.920> are<00:02:23.010> showing<00:02:23.400> this

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
what these images are showing this

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.700 
what these images are showing this
really<00:02:24.420> isn't<00:02:24.600> going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:25.020> nothing<00:02:25.230> huge

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
really isn't going to be nothing huge

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.010 
really isn't going to be nothing huge
and<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.950> honestly<00:02:26.280> cannot<00:02:26.610> compare<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.900> the
