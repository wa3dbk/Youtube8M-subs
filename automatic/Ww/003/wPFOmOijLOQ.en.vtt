00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.490 
need so far no one has come for us like
I<00:02:43.400> think<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:44.120> best<00:02:44.330> tactic<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.959> for<00:02:45.200> wait<00:02:45.319> for

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
I think the best tactic is for wait for

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.199 
I think the best tactic is for wait for
people<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.769> come<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.160> that's<00:02:46.670> also<00:02:46.940> boring

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
people to come to you that's also boring

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
though I don't like doing that because I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.520 
though I don't like doing that because I
get<00:02:48.799> bored<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.360> hope<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.630> run<00:02:50.870> at<00:02:51.049> people<00:02:51.410> and

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.259 
the middle that is bad if you're in the
middle<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:58.580> have<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.730> massive<00:02:59.180> advantage

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
middle you have a massive advantage

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.970 
middle you have a massive advantage
because<00:02:59.959> you<00:02:59.989> can<00:03:00.110> see<00:03:00.410> where<00:03:00.620> people<00:03:00.650> are

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
because you can see where people are

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.430 
because you can see where people are
coming<00:03:01.160> from<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:02.299> guy's<00:03:03.019> a<00:03:03.049> massive

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
coming from and that guy's a massive

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.960 
coming from and that guy's a massive
advantage<00:03:03.739> if<00:03:03.890> he's<00:03:04.099> like<00:03:04.430> if<00:03:04.549> I<00:03:04.640> want<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.910> get

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
advantage if he's like if I want to get

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.400 
advantage if he's like if I want to get
across<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.390> him<00:03:05.540> it's<00:03:05.690> gonna<00:03:05.780> be<00:03:05.870> very<00:03:06.140> tricky

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
across to him it's gonna be very tricky

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.620 
across to him it's gonna be very tricky
and<00:03:07.160> he<00:03:07.310> may<00:03:07.459> shoot<00:03:07.519> an<00:03:07.849> arrow<00:03:08.000> at<00:03:08.209> me<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.450> just

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
can sort of start making our way across

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.400 
can sort of start making our way across
the<00:03:20.150> platforms<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.780> stuff<00:03:20.959> we've<00:03:21.079> got<00:03:21.200> all

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
over here now if I go over here there's

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.740 
over here now if I go over here there's
less<00:03:34.609> chance<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:35.030> them<00:03:35.180> hitting<00:03:35.420> me<00:03:35.600> because

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
less chance of them hitting me because

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.059 
less chance of them hitting me because
I'm<00:03:35.810> getting<00:03:35.930> further<00:03:36.260> away<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.650> I'm<00:03:36.920> gonna

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
dig all the way over here okay we're

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.129 
dig all the way over here okay we're
nearly<00:03:39.950> there<00:03:40.120> yes<00:03:41.150> okay<00:03:41.569> we're<00:03:41.720> cross<00:03:41.900> here's

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
nearly there yes okay we're cross here's

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.509 
nearly there yes okay we're cross here's
anything<00:03:42.530> in<00:03:42.650> these<00:03:42.739> chests<00:03:43.010> oh<00:03:43.069> my<00:03:43.190> god<00:03:43.340> there

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
anything in these chests oh my god there

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.460 
anything in these chests oh my god there
is<00:03:43.639> we<00:03:43.760> got<00:03:43.850> some<00:03:43.940> arrows<00:03:44.329> and<00:03:44.690> axe<00:03:45.139> that's

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
is we got some arrows and axe that's

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.550 
is we got some arrows and axe that's
useful<00:03:45.889> or<00:03:46.850> what<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.389> also<00:03:47.569> very<00:03:47.780> useful<00:03:48.139> I

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
useful or what is also very useful I

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.740 
useful or what is also very useful I
think<00:03:49.400> if<00:03:49.579> I<00:03:49.730> make<00:03:49.940> my<00:03:50.090> way<00:03:50.239> across<00:03:50.359> that

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
think if I make my way across that

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.509 
think if I make my way across that
platform<00:03:51.260> then<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.560> should<00:03:51.829> be<00:03:51.980> able<00:03:52.069> to<00:03:52.190> get<00:03:52.400> to

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
platform then I should be able to get to

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.580 
platform then I should be able to get to
the<00:03:52.609> middle<00:03:52.819> without<00:03:53.810> with<00:03:54.019> a<00:03:54.049> bit<00:03:54.260> more<00:03:54.440> ease

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
the middle without with a bit more ease

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.830 
the middle without with a bit more ease
so<00:03:54.829> if<00:03:54.950> I<00:03:55.040> head<00:03:55.250> across<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.700> there<00:03:55.940> actually

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
so if I head across to there actually

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.059 
so if I head across to there actually
I'm<00:03:56.900> gonna<00:03:57.019> chop<00:03:57.260> down<00:03:57.380> this<00:03:57.500> tree<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.920> gather

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
I'm gonna chop down this tree and gather

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.420 
I'm gonna chop down this tree and gather
all<00:03:58.160> this<00:03:58.370> wood<00:03:58.609> it<00:03:59.299> could<00:03:59.510> be<00:03:59.600> very<00:03:59.750> useful

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
all this wood it could be very useful

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.800 
all this wood it could be very useful
I'm<00:04:01.430> excited<00:04:01.880> this<00:04:02.000> could<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.329> we<00:04:02.510> could<00:04:02.540> win

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
I'm excited this could be we could win

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.449 
I'm excited this could be we could win
this<00:04:02.959> one<00:04:03.170> there<00:04:03.769> are<00:04:03.920> not<00:04:04.100> that<00:04:04.220> many<00:04:04.280> people

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
this one there are not that many people

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.400 
this one there are not that many people
left<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.150> there's<00:04:05.329> a<00:04:05.389> high<00:04:05.750> possibility<00:04:05.959> that

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
left so there's a high possibility that

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.379 
left so there's a high possibility that
I<00:04:06.470> could<00:04:06.709> win<00:04:06.889> this<00:04:07.069> can't<00:04:07.700> see<00:04:07.910> anyone<00:04:08.180> right

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
I could win this can't see anyone right

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.550 
I could win this can't see anyone right
now<00:04:08.420> it's<00:04:08.690> just<00:04:08.780> kind<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.079> scary

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
now it's just kind of scary

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.500 
now it's just kind of scary
I<00:04:09.709> think<00:04:10.160> they<00:04:10.310> might<00:04:10.549> be<00:04:10.609> underground<00:04:11.120> in<00:04:11.420> the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
I think they might be underground in the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.750 
I think they might be underground in the
middle<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.200> may<00:04:12.350> have<00:04:12.440> digging<00:04:12.769> down<00:04:12.920> dig<00:04:13.489> dig

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
middle and may have digging down dig dig

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.180 
middle and may have digging down dig dig
and<00:04:13.940> down<00:04:14.060> dug<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.660> dug<00:04:14.720> down<00:04:15.260> where<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.950> heck
