00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.550 
started I guess after a night of
champions<00:02:34.760> when<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.880> wasn't<00:02:36.120> clear<00:02:36.530> when<00:02:37.530> we

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
champions when it wasn't clear when we

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.130

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
rematch I'd held myself I mean it would

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.240 
rematch I'd held myself I mean it would
make<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.810> would<00:02:52.079> make<00:02:52.260> sense<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:53.010> match

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
make it would make sense to have a match
