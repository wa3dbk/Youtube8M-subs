00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.480
 [Music] 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.710
 hi little family clothe fly 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.599
 today we find ourselves for a yaoi 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.800
 first on my channel so I hope 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.719
 you will like how 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.370
 transform a simple worthy into a 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 a little bit of destroy it's very much 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.970
 fashion right now and I think that's 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.689
 dialogue could be helpful to many 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.490
 of them sink the first thing to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.070
 to do is simply trace the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.599
 where you want textron and I 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.420
 do not know if it exists but it's for 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.550
 destroyer the dinh so it's up to you to see this 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.520
 you want a big winch driss 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 or a little destroy age so he will you 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.610
 need scissors and pliers to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.989
 tweeze 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.730
 you'll see it's simple as 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:49.489
 Hello 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:49.489
 [Music] 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.990
 there you have drawn your vote you are going 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.970
 start by making bands in the lead 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.440
 according to your desire to make small 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.720
 bands to start to see what 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.989
 it gives and then lie down the band 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.900
 to be able to do 1-1 destroy more 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.670
 important so I'm doing a species of 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.380
 triangle for the first who goes to 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.070
 the low story that it makes a species 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:26.090
 natural tearing 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:26.090
 [Music] 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.400
 so then it's really simple 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.460
 you just have to remove the wire 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.750
 blue between the bands so you will see 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.000
 that it's a little bit 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.080
 complicated a bit hard but as a result 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.060
 will really go alone so sorry 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.350
 really for the brightness but I have to 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.710
 big worries with my reflex in this 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.900
 moment it does indeed only to itself 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.460
 he does it himself so suddenly 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.229
 I have to adjust the brightness 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.050
 the contrast and it does not really give 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.880
 really top but now you see pretty 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.880
 by what I'm trying to show you 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.159
 [Music] 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.900
 for corners everything that is in 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.220
 outside do not hesitate to pull threads 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.880
 white for its more worn phase more 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.210
 natural 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.280
 try to make enough destroy jeans 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.280
 natural even if it does not exist 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.450
 then he wanted to add small 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.370
 holes here and there and you just 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.230
 to make a small hole with the chisel is 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.240
 same to remove the small white threads 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.060
 he takes out that it makes a measurement a 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.180
 little bit natural 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.159
