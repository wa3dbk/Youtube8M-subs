00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
let's consider this coming full circle

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.410 
let's consider this coming full circle
as<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.990> borrow<00:00:37.230> back<00:00:37.680> let's<00:00:38.489> launch<00:00:38.760> zero<00:00:39.090> goes

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
as we borrow back let's launch zero goes

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
as we borrow back let's launch zero goes
for<00:00:39.600> 99<00:00:39.930> cents<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.290> marketplace<00:00:40.710> there<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.250> a

done<00:02:19.440> automatically<00:02:20.040> based<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.520> like

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
done automatically based on like

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.380 
done automatically based on like
alphabetical<00:02:21.690> or<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.860> date<00:02:23.040> entered<00:02:24.800> and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that would go back out go back in same

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.580 
that would go back out go back in same
thing<00:02:31.500> we<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.340> also<00:02:32.690> go<00:02:33.690> into<00:02:33.960> settings<00:02:34.470> and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
thing we can also go into settings and

see automatic backup that's not a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.970 
see automatic backup that's not a
feature<00:02:45.210> yet<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.870> presume<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:46.800> going<00:02:46.920> to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
feature yet but I presume it's going to

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.710 
feature yet but I presume it's going to
be<00:02:47.070> tied<00:02:47.520> into<00:02:47.670> SkyDrive<00:02:48.240> at<00:02:48.360> some<00:02:48.510> point

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
be tied into SkyDrive at some point

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.970 
be tied into SkyDrive at some point
it'll<00:02:48.960> save<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.380> your<00:02:49.410> SkyDrive<00:02:49.950> account

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
app itself so every time you add stuff

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.910 
app itself so every time you add stuff
it<00:03:09.390> gets<00:03:09.510> automatically<00:03:10.020> updated<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.590> your

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
tile counter right there and basically

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.440 
tile counter right there and basically
that's<00:03:13.920> your<00:03:14.130> reminder<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.150> course<00:03:15.180> it
