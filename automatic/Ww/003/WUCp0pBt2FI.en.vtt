00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.310
 We regret the segment with a news that has surprised everyone 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.219
 the young woman who said that a stranger had attacked her by throwing acid at her 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.039
 face with breastplate that were lying as they will remember she was disfigured 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.980
 root of this attack and now admitted that she herself threw the acid in 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.730
 face 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.720
 the camera follow this case from the beginning ncn the information question 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.710
 the vancouver police spent hundreds of hours trying to find 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.489
 the woman 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.370
 that supposedly had thrown acid in his face sometimes seen 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.470
 a few days ago the 28-year-old girl covered with bandages spoke 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.590
 bravely with the press of the horrible acid attack of which he was victim 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.580
 supposedly an African-American woman had approached him and told him 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.890
 cute girl you get to see this before throwing a glass full of acid 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.370
 and he blames them for exhorting orange trees, but according to researchers, the attack 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 it happened like this 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.790
 it was not a stranger who attacked this 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.820
 fine that she herself burned her face with acid but few managed 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.380
 discover that the case was a farce 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.330
 the authorities say that during the investigation they realized that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.190
 there were details that did not fit first if he had altered acid to the face of 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.190
 the young woman because nothing had fallen on her neck 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.470
 the sunglasses that he supposedly wore 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.490
 everything had declared that it was a miracle and I had just bought them and that this 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.380
 he had saved his sight 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.789
 I was going to sentence the course we looked at the time of the attack 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:38.799
 it was night 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.160
 because day or night I was wearing sunglasses 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.130
 for that reason but for many the main key was when stoner decided 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.640
 cancel at the last minute his presentation of the program 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.110
 oprah television 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.040
 the young woman had apparently realized that she would have to respond to 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.870
 some questions 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.570
 For their part, the researchers carried out an inspection of the house of 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.100
 study and although they did not reveal details 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.300
 and they announced that they found objects that took them when questioning the young woman 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.559
 it was then when tennis everything concept that is welcome from the attack and 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.039
 that she herself had spilled the acid 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.679
 Jose M 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.479
 according to the police they feel very sorry for what they did but the 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.109
 question is why 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.969
 because a young cd would figure herself in such a horrible way 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.670
 so far there is no answer what is clear is that this is not a 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.899
 victim a victim of herself 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.419
