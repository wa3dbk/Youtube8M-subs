hey<00:00:01.829> everyone<00:00:02.720> went<00:00:03.720> ahead<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.080> picked<00:00:04.830> up

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
hey everyone went ahead and picked up

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.740 
hey everyone went ahead and picked up
one<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.190> these<00:00:05.370> little

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:07.750 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:15.180 

butane<00:00:08.620> canisters<00:00:13.320> try<00:00:14.320> to<00:00:14.379> experiment<00:00:15.100> with

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
butane canisters try to experiment with

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.100 
butane canisters try to experiment with
using<00:00:15.400> it<00:00:15.670> as<00:00:15.849> a<00:00:15.880> fuel<00:00:16.209> source<00:00:16.240> instead<00:00:16.990> of

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
using it as a fuel source instead of

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.460 
using it as a fuel source instead of
that<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:19.270> I<00:00:19.330> went<00:00:19.450> ahead<00:00:19.599> and<00:00:19.840> bought<00:00:20.020> one<00:00:20.050> even

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
that so I went ahead and bought one even

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.990 
that so I went ahead and bought one even
though<00:00:20.560> I<00:00:20.590> don't<00:00:20.710> have<00:00:21.099> anything<00:00:21.430> that<00:00:21.730> uses

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
though I don't have anything that uses

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.529 
though I don't have anything that uses
them<00:00:22.360> because<00:00:23.609> well<00:00:24.609> I<00:00:24.640> had<00:00:24.850> to<00:00:24.970> get<00:00:25.119> one<00:00:25.180> in<00:00:25.420> my

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
them because well I had to get one in my

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.849 
them because well I had to get one in my
hands<00:00:26.020> and<00:00:27.960> try<00:00:28.960> to<00:00:29.020> figure<00:00:29.260> out<00:00:29.410> how<00:00:29.650> I<00:00:29.680> can

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
hands and try to figure out how I can

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.270 
hands and try to figure out how I can
tap<00:00:30.220> into<00:00:30.460> this<00:00:30.640> thing<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:34.379> valve<00:00:35.379> the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
tap into this thing this valve the

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.020 
tap into this thing this valve the
Lyndell<00:00:36.730> valve<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.280> threads<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:41.010> 7/16

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
Lyndell valve with the threads the 7/16

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.819 
Lyndell valve with the threads the 7/16
by<00:00:43.110> 28<00:00:44.640> extra<00:00:45.640> fine<00:00:45.879> I<00:00:49.350> started<00:00:50.350> thinking<00:00:50.800> that

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
by 28 extra fine I started thinking that

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.729 
by 28 extra fine I started thinking that
this<00:00:51.190> was<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.489> very<00:00:52.800> proprietary<00:00:54.840> design<00:00:55.840> but

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
this was a very proprietary design but

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.450 
this was a very proprietary design but
it<00:00:56.860> isn't<00:00:57.539> at<00:00:58.539> least<00:00:58.809> not<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.829> extent<00:01:00.399> that

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
it isn't at least not to the extent that

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.010 
it isn't at least not to the extent that
I<00:01:00.640> previously<00:01:01.180> thought

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
I previously thought

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.380 
I previously thought
and<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:04.180> was<00:01:04.330> a<00:01:04.360> Walmart<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.640> hit<00:01:06.880> me<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:07.240> have

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
and I was a Walmart and it hit me I have

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.520 
and I was a Walmart and it hit me I have
seen<00:01:07.780> this<00:01:08.050> exact<00:01:08.649> thing<00:01:08.800> before<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:11.380> is

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
seen this exact thing before and it is

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:20.100 
seen this exact thing before and it is
for<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:15.960> these<00:01:16.960> little<00:01:17.170> air<00:01:17.979> horns<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
for this these little air horns the

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.039 
for this these little air horns the
little<00:01:20.380> tank<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.770> propellant<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.570> screws<00:01:22.869> on

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
little tank of propellant this screws on

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:34.249 
little tank of propellant this screws on
to<00:01:23.290> has<00:01:24.189> this<00:01:24.460> identical<00:01:25.030> set<00:01:25.840> up<00:01:25.990> on<00:01:26.170> top

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.130 

there<00:01:35.259> it<00:01:35.380> is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.810 

headphone<00:01:42.140> users<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:44.300> know<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.630> deal

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
headphone users you know the deal

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.870 
headphone users you know the deal
hey<00:01:46.820> wasn't<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.990> loud<00:01:48.230> wasn't<00:01:48.820> wonder<00:01:49.820> if

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
hey wasn't that loud wasn't wonder if

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.340 
hey wasn't that loud wasn't wonder if
there's<00:01:50.030> something<00:01:50.270> up<00:01:50.510> with<00:01:50.660> this<00:01:50.780> diagram

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
there's something up with this diagram

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:03.150 
there's something up with this diagram
in<00:01:51.650> here<00:01:56.830> huh<00:01:57.860> that's<00:01:58.460> okay

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.760 

woo<00:02:04.570> there<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.660> goes

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.470 

so<00:02:09.770> maybe<00:02:10.310> if<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:10.580> got<00:02:10.759> one<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:10.940> these<00:02:11.060> horns

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
so maybe if you got one of these horns

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.540 
so maybe if you got one of these horns
you<00:02:14.480> can<00:02:14.630> use<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.989> on<00:02:15.050> this<00:02:15.230> butane<00:02:15.650> bottle<00:02:17.500> and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
you can use it on this butane bottle and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.229 
you can use it on this butane bottle and
so<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.580> took<00:02:21.700> one<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.730> these<00:02:22.910> horns<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.660> I

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
so I took one of these horns and I

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.930 
so I took one of these horns and I
yanked<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.300> brass<00:02:26.750> piece<00:02:27.110> out<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:30.940> I

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
yanked that brass piece out and I

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.729 
yanked that brass piece out and I
soldered<00:02:32.510> it

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.059 

-<00:02:39.739> this<00:02:40.840> here<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.989> see<00:02:42.200> I've<00:02:42.379> got<00:02:42.409> a<00:02:42.590> little

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
- this here you see I've got a little

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.000 
- this here you see I've got a little
piece<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.459> stainless<00:02:43.760> steel<00:02:43.970> pipe<00:02:44.829> tube<00:02:48.010> with

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
piece of stainless steel pipe tube with

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.080 
piece of stainless steel pipe tube with
a<00:02:49.040> notch<00:02:49.340> cut<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.849> it<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.590> as<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:52.430> screw<00:02:52.939> this

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
a notch cut in it and as you screw this

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.809 
a notch cut in it and as you screw this
thing<00:02:53.150> onto<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.750> tank<00:02:57.129> there<00:02:58.129> is<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> little

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
thing onto the tank there is a little

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.500 
thing onto the tank there is a little
rubber<00:02:59.120> seal<00:03:00.700> inside<00:03:01.700> here<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:05.450> you

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
rubber seal inside here and so you

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.119 
rubber seal inside here and so you
notice<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.140> here<00:03:06.379> there's<00:03:06.590> no<00:03:06.859> other<00:03:08.980> overing

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.140 

because<00:03:13.239> once<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:15.040> tube<00:03:16.040> gets<00:03:16.700> squashed

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
because once that tube gets squashed

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.020 
because once that tube gets squashed
down<00:03:17.540> inside<00:03:17.930> here<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.950> seal<00:03:19.280> inside<00:03:19.700> here

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
down inside here the seal inside here

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.680 
down inside here the seal inside here
seals<00:03:20.480> around<00:03:20.629> that<00:03:21.019> little<00:03:21.170> tube

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
seals around that little tube

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.319 
seals around that little tube
and<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:24.950> brass<00:03:25.250> piece<00:03:25.609> out<00:03:25.909> of<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.150> air

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
and so that brass piece out of that air

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:35.530 
and so that brass piece out of that air
horn<00:03:26.950> gave<00:03:27.950> me<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.220> way<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:33.739> attach<00:03:34.540> something

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
horn gave me a way to attach something

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:47.729 
horn gave me a way to attach something
to<00:03:35.720> this<00:03:35.930> tank

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:55.860 

there<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.830> is<00:03:49.569> and<00:03:51.340> then<00:03:52.390> attached<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:54.280> this

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
there it is and then attached to it this

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.400 
there it is and then attached to it this
needle<00:03:56.870> valve<00:03:58.180> this<00:03:59.180> needle<00:03:59.599> valve<00:03:59.840> is<00:04:00.110> off<00:04:00.380> of

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
needle valve this needle valve is off of

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.860 
needle valve this needle valve is off of
a<00:04:02.200> radio-controlled<00:04:03.910> model<00:04:04.910> truck<00:04:05.239> that<00:04:05.480> uses

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
a radio-controlled model truck that uses

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.960 
a radio-controlled model truck that uses
the<00:04:07.330> methanol<00:04:08.330> fueled<00:04:08.739> engine<00:04:09.739> this<00:04:10.640> is<00:04:10.940> the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
the methanol fueled engine this is the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.680 
the methanol fueled engine this is the
fuel<00:04:11.720> mixture<00:04:12.580> needle<00:04:13.580> valve<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:17.389> allows

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
fuel mixture needle valve and it allows

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:40.620 
fuel mixture needle valve and it allows

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.690 

there<00:04:41.290> are<00:04:41.410> some<00:04:41.800> things<00:04:42.100> that<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.340> don't<00:04:42.460> like

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
there are some things that I don't like

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.230 
there are some things that I don't like
about<00:04:43.150> this<00:04:43.390> design<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.850> this<00:04:45.850> needle

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
about this design and that this needle

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.970 
about this design and that this needle
valve<00:04:46.480> I<00:04:46.660> had<00:04:46.870> an<00:04:47.050> extra<00:04:47.410> one<00:04:47.440> laying<00:04:47.590> around

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
valve I had an extra one laying around

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.730 
valve I had an extra one laying around
because<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.670> had<00:04:49.330> replaced<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:50.020> engine<00:04:50.590> in

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
because I had replaced the engine in

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.470 
because I had replaced the engine in
that<00:04:50.820> truck<00:04:51.820> of<00:04:52.000> mine<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:54.550> so<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:54.910> salvaged

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
that truck of mine and and so I salvaged

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.440 
that truck of mine and and so I salvaged
the<00:04:55.630> needle<00:04:55.930> valve<00:04:56.140> off<00:04:56.350> of<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:57.150> you<00:04:58.150> should

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
the needle valve off of that you should

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.240 
the needle valve off of that you should
be<00:04:58.630> able<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:58.900> get<00:04:59.080> one<00:04:59.290> fairly<00:04:59.680> easily<00:04:59.920> but

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
be able to get one fairly easily but

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.540 
be able to get one fairly easily but
it's<00:05:00.930> it's<00:05:01.930> still<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.500> little<00:05:02.980> more<00:05:05.190> obscure<00:05:06.190> of

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
it's it's still a little more obscure of

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.970 
it's it's still a little more obscure of
an<00:05:06.670> item<00:05:06.880> it's<00:05:07.840> not<00:05:08.050> something<00:05:08.470> you'd<00:05:08.590> find<00:05:08.620> at

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
an item it's not something you'd find at

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.250 
an item it's not something you'd find at
Walmart<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:10.120> still<00:05:10.390> requires<00:05:10.840> some

issue<00:05:27.850> with<00:05:28.270> this<00:05:28.420> needle<00:05:28.810> valve<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.230> it

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
issue with this needle valve and it

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.390 
issue with this needle valve and it
doesn't<00:05:29.830> really<00:05:30.070> have<00:05:30.400> a<00:05:30.430> closed<00:05:32.400> function

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
doesn't really have a closed function

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
doesn't really have a closed function
it's<00:05:34.240> not<00:05:34.420> designed<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:35.110> seal<00:05:35.440> shut<00:05:36.420> because

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
it's not designed to seal shut because

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.200 
it's not designed to seal shut because
this<00:05:37.750> is<00:05:37.900> supposed<00:05:38.260> to<00:05:38.380> adjust<00:05:38.880> very<00:05:39.880> very

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
this is supposed to adjust very very

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.450 
this is supposed to adjust very very
accurately<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.350> flow<00:05:41.680> of<00:05:41.710> liquid<00:05:42.280> through

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
accurately the flow of liquid through

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.960 
accurately the flow of liquid through
here<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:43.060> fuel<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:43.860> so<00:05:44.860> there's<00:05:45.040> no<00:05:45.400> need<00:05:45.430> to

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
here the fuel and so there's no need to

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.730 
here the fuel and so there's no need to
shut<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:47.050> fuel<00:05:47.380> off<00:05:48.510> and<00:05:49.510> so<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:49.990> can<00:05:50.410> run

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
shut the fuel off and so you can run

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.960 
shut the fuel off and so you can run
this<00:05:50.950> needle<00:05:51.340> all<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.550> way<00:05:51.700> in<00:05:52.000> until<00:05:52.990> it<00:05:53.350> it

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
this needle all the way in until it it

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.310 
this needle all the way in until it it
plugs<00:05:55.890> the<00:05:56.890> aperture<00:05:57.600> but<00:05:58.600> it's<00:05:58.750> not<00:05:58.930> really

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
plugs the aperture but it's not really

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.170 
plugs the aperture but it's not really
designed<00:05:59.860> to<00:05:59.950> do<00:06:00.130> that<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.520> I<00:06:00.640> find<00:06:01.000> it's

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
designed to do that and I find it's

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.090 
designed to do that and I find it's
difficult<00:06:01.780> sometimes<00:06:01.960> especially<00:06:02.500> when<00:06:02.950> this

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
difficult sometimes especially when this

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.590 
difficult sometimes especially when this
thing<00:06:03.310> is<00:06:03.340> cold<00:06:03.760> after<00:06:04.600> youth<00:06:05.040> I<00:06:06.040> can<00:06:06.760> turn<00:06:07.030> the

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
thing is cold after youth I can turn the

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:16.129 
thing is cold after youth I can turn the
gas<00:06:07.810> almost<00:06:08.440> off<00:06:08.710> but<00:06:09.520> not<00:06:09.700> completely<00:06:10.150> off

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:28.040 

but<00:06:17.139> then<00:06:17.320> I<00:06:17.440> got<00:06:17.620> to<00:06:17.800> thinking<00:06:20.070> if<00:06:21.070> this<00:06:25.230> isn't

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
but then I got to thinking if this isn't

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.620 
but then I got to thinking if this isn't
proprietary<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.760> it's<00:06:30.760> somewhat

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
proprietary and it's somewhat

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.159 
proprietary and it's somewhat
standardized<00:06:32.550> if<00:06:33.550> I<00:06:33.790> was<00:06:33.970> able<00:06:34.150> to<00:06:34.330> locate

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
standardized if I was able to locate

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:41.040 
standardized if I was able to locate
this<00:06:35.800> that<00:06:36.730> uses<00:06:37.120> the<00:06:37.300> exact<00:06:37.660> same<00:06:37.900> setup<00:06:40.050> what

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
this that uses the exact same setup what

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.670 
this that uses the exact same setup what
else<00:06:41.260> might<00:06:41.560> use<00:06:41.800> this<00:06:43.200> this<00:06:44.200> arrangement

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
else might use this this arrangement

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.140 
else might use this this arrangement
here<00:06:45.040> and<00:06:46.889> I<00:06:47.889> remembered<00:06:48.400> a<00:06:48.520> friend<00:06:48.760> of<00:06:48.940> mine

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
here and I remembered a friend of mine

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.310 
here and I remembered a friend of mine
had<00:06:49.570> this<00:06:49.810> little<00:06:50.080> airbrush<00:06:50.979> kit<00:06:52.080> that<00:06:53.080> rather

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
had this little airbrush kit that rather

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.120 
had this little airbrush kit that rather
than<00:06:53.650> using<00:06:53.889> the<00:06:54.190> expensive<00:06:54.850> compressor<00:06:55.840> just

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
than using the expensive compressor just

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.379 
than using the expensive compressor just
use<00:06:57.130> a<00:06:57.160> can<00:06:57.580> of<00:06:58.320> propellant<00:06:59.880> ways<00:07:00.880> I<00:07:01.090> went<00:07:01.300> to

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
use a can of propellant ways I went to

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.270
