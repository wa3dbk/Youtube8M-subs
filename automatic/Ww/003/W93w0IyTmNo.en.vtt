00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.240
 this mobility is fundamental and it 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.560
 It affects my work with in a way 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.370
 almost unconditional because nomadism is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.329
 a foreign state is a state in which 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.780
 you maintain a certain perception with 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.309
 with the world always with a high 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.309
 conscious of freshness 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.080
 during the summer, SÃ£o Paulo was in the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.730
 band 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.550
 what was agreed between me and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.700
 that I would send to them is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.350
 every kind of official gesture made in the 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.350
 inside that place 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.800
 there for a year and I sleep six 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.390
 nights per week except once 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.530
 you know and did not see that the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.690
 guiding control 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.570
 people believe that it could have 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.040
 but it has to be calculated 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.170
 by refrigerator the us is scarce of its 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.490
 Life enters into a cycle of labor 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.910
 which is very physically required but 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 either way once I do not have 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.850
 access to resources could do so with 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.770
 that all my daily activities 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.930
 could somehow be in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.190
 polluted by some type of 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:55.830
 poetic intentionality, it is clear that I 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.230
 I am an object producer the sound of 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.020
 producer but I am also a producer 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.930
 of meanings and meanings of postures 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.300
 in the world and in the end as 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.470
 important when producing these objects 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.420
 in being in art is to enable the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.330
 was what the teaching that end up me 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.769
 gave that any of my 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.800
 activities may be open is this 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.810
 kind of contact with something of mystery 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.630
 may know a little this Saturday the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.580
 mysticism but as it is not 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.239
 Truth is a posture of life I believe 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.239
 even this
