know from experience hanging my kids
photos<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.340> my<00:00:59.430> refrigerator<00:00:59.579> sometimes<00:01:00.420> even

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
so I want to go over this as you clay

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.469 
so I want to go over this as you clay
workflow<00:01:09.290> briefly<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.580> I<00:01:10.940> think<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:11.299> is<00:01:11.360> a

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
workflow briefly and I think this is a

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.780 
workflow briefly and I think this is a
good<00:01:11.690> way<00:01:11.869> of<00:01:11.900> leading<00:01:12.890> us<00:01:13.159> through<00:01:13.190> the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
good way of leading us through the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.850 
good way of leading us through the
presentation<00:01:14.680> criminology<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
presentation criminology and the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.440 
presentation criminology and the
information<00:01:16.220> we<00:01:16.550> want<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.820> go<00:01:16.940> through<00:01:17.150> today

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
information we want to go through today

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.990 
information we want to go through today
so<00:01:17.720> we're<00:01:18.680> basically<00:01:18.860> talking<00:01:19.280> about<00:01:19.610> artwork

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
so we're basically talking about artwork

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.380 
so we're basically talking about artwork
and<00:01:20.300> photography<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.860> that's<00:01:22.300> people<00:01:23.300> who

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
some means and so then that goes

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.060 
some means and so then that goes
directly<00:01:37.640> into<00:01:38.080> prep<00:01:39.080> where<00:01:39.470> we<00:01:39.590> get<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:39.950> on

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
directly into prep where we get it on

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.859 
directly into prep where we get it on
our<00:01:40.220> computer<00:01:40.700> or<00:01:40.820> we<00:01:40.970> look<00:01:41.179> at<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.570> we<00:01:41.660> try<00:01:41.840> to

that<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.969> get<00:02:04.119> it<00:02:04.270> into<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.600> computer<00:02:04.719> to<00:02:05.259> work

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
that to get it into the computer to work

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.580 
that to get it into the computer to work
with<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.460> printed<00:02:06.759> so<00:02:07.270> we<00:02:08.019> do<00:02:08.289> one<00:02:08.560> of

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
with it and the printed so we do one of

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.800 
with it and the printed so we do one of
two<00:02:08.679> things<00:02:08.860> we<00:02:09.310> do<00:02:09.459> a<00:02:09.489> digital<00:02:10.060> capture<00:02:10.330> using

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
two things we do a digital capture using

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.890 
two things we do a digital capture using
my<00:02:11.050> eye<00:02:11.080> n<00:02:11.530> digital<00:02:12.220> camera<00:02:12.780> putting<00:02:13.780> one

photos to us if they already added the
digital<00:03:07.050> format<00:03:07.440> then<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.160> can<00:03:08.310> bring<00:03:08.460> into

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
digital format then you can bring into

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.980 
digital format then you can bring into
something<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.000> bring<00:03:09.120> our<00:03:09.330> camera<00:03:09.480> into

something to bring our camera into

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.290 
something to bring our camera into
bringing<00:03:10.200> their<00:03:10.500> compact<00:03:11.280> flash<00:03:11.610> cards

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.910 

they're<00:03:14.660> quite<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.930> variety<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.350> ways<00:03:15.500> bringing

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
they're quite a variety of ways bringing

in is given from about iphones and ipad
i<00:03:18.440> guess<00:03:18.770> because<00:03:18.890> my<00:03:19.190> computer<00:03:19.640> and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
i guess because my computer and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.000 
i guess because my computer and
lightroom<00:03:20.660> i<00:03:20.750> can<00:03:20.930> pull<00:03:21.080> up<00:03:21.200> those<00:03:21.350> images<00:03:21.680> we

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
lightroom i can pull up those images we

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.100 
lightroom i can pull up those images we
can<00:03:22.760> use<00:03:22.910> them<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.970> here<00:03:26.270> we<00:03:26.300> are<00:03:26.570> prepping<00:03:27.020> the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
can use them so here we are prepping the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.630 
can use them so here we are prepping the
files<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:27.770> this<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.040> an<00:03:28.160> example<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.580> that

and I have a color band on slight next

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.060 
and I have a color band on slight next
to<00:03:39.980> my<00:03:40.100> computer<00:03:40.250> that's<00:03:41.210> a<00:03:41.360> hot<00:03:41.540> light

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
to my computer that's a hot light

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.460 
to my computer that's a hot light
matches<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:44.300> leg<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.780> know<00:03:44.870> coming<00:03:45.140> from<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
matches the leg you know coming from the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.470 
matches the leg you know coming from the
Sun<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:45.860> stay<00:03:46.070> light<00:03:46.250> balance<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.330> that's

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
Sun and stay light balance and that's

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.230 
Sun and stay light balance and that's
important<00:03:47.960> too<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.170> how<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.760> evaluate<00:03:49.760> color

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
important too and how you evaluate color

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.900 
important too and how you evaluate color
is<00:03:50.450> your<00:03:50.660> light<00:03:51.110> source<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:51.440> you're<00:03:51.680> using
