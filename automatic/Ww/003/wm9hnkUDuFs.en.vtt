with our theme of looking at some
traditional<00:00:10.309> origami<00:00:10.580> and<00:00:11.120> we're<00:00:11.389> going<00:00:11.570> to

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
traditional origami and we're going to

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.249 
traditional origami and we're going to
make<00:00:11.900> a<00:00:12.309> double<00:00:13.309> hole<00:00:13.700> boat<00:00:14.089> now<00:00:14.629> this<00:00:15.049> is

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:15.259 
make a double hole boat now this is

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.200 
make a double hole boat now this is
basically<00:00:15.740> just<00:00:15.860> the<00:00:17.020> double<00:00:18.020> hole<00:00:18.890> boat<00:00:19.220> the

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
basically just the double hole boat the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.759 
basically just the double hole boat the
double<00:00:20.510> boat<00:00:20.689> base<00:00:20.960> is<00:00:21.320> what<00:00:21.500> it's<00:00:21.619> called

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
double boat base is what it's called

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.950 
double boat base is what it's called
just<00:00:22.460> fold<00:00:22.640> it<00:00:22.760> in<00:00:22.789> half<00:00:22.910> so<00:00:23.269> it's<00:00:23.390> a<00:00:23.449> great<00:00:23.779> way

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
just fold it in half so it's a great way

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.290 
just fold it in half so it's a great way
to<00:00:23.990> practice<00:00:24.349> this<00:00:24.859> space<00:00:25.130> you<00:00:25.730> use<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.060> space

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
to practice this space you use the space

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.150 
to practice this space you use the space
for<00:00:26.510> lots<00:00:26.630> of<00:00:26.810> other<00:00:27.050> projects<00:00:27.650> so<00:00:27.920> it's<00:00:28.070> a

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
for lots of other projects so it's a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.769 
for lots of other projects so it's a
great<00:00:28.340> way<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:28.519> kind<00:00:28.820> of<00:00:28.880> practice<00:00:29.060> things<00:00:29.509> and

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
great way to kind of practice things and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.269 
great way to kind of practice things and
it<00:00:29.869> actually<00:00:30.019> leads<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.590> something<00:00:30.890> in<00:00:31.160> the

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
it actually leads to something in the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.430 
it actually leads to something in the
end<00:00:31.400> too<00:00:31.699> so<00:00:32.029> I'm<00:00:32.630> going<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:32.810> be<00:00:32.870> just<00:00:33.080> using

be using some green paper here and what
I<00:00:48.620> want<00:00:48.829> to<00:00:48.920> do<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.430> there's<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:49.879> many

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
I want to do and there's so many

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.490 
I want to do and there's so many
different<00:00:50.420> ways<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:50.750> get<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.899> this<00:00:51.140> double

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
different ways to get to this double

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.930 
different ways to get to this double
boat<00:00:51.680> base<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.190> this<00:00:52.340> is<00:00:52.489> not<00:00:52.670> like<00:00:52.820> the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
boat base so this is not like the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.180 
boat base so this is not like the
definitive<00:00:53.329> way<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.840> do<00:00:54.199> things<00:00:54.469> but<00:00:54.710> just<00:00:54.980> the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
definitive way to do things but just the

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.639 
definitive way to do things but just the
way<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.520> tend<00:00:55.879> to<00:00:55.969> do<00:00:56.149> stuff<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:56.719> start<00:00:57.530> with

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
way I tend to do stuff so start with

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.860 
way I tend to do stuff so start with
your<00:00:57.710> color<00:00:58.010> side<00:00:58.309> facing<00:00:58.789> down<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.300> go<00:00:59.690> ahead

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
your color side facing down and go ahead

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.110 
your color side facing down and go ahead
and<00:01:00.079> fold<00:01:00.410> your<00:01:00.620> paper<00:01:00.949> in<00:01:01.219> half<00:01:01.430> diagonally

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
and fold your paper in half diagonally

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.300 
and fold your paper in half diagonally
both<00:01:02.719> ways<00:01:08.350> once<00:01:09.350> I've<00:01:09.500> got<00:01:09.710> those<00:01:09.890> creases

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
both ways once I've got those creases

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.160 
both ways once I've got those creases
marked<00:01:10.850> off<00:01:11.000> I'm<00:01:11.330> going<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.600> go<00:01:11.690> ahead<00:01:11.840> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
marked off I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.110 
marked off I'm going to go ahead and
open<00:01:12.260> things<00:01:12.740> up<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.220> color<00:01:13.550> side<00:01:13.850> and

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
open things up to the color side and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.260 
open things up to the color side and
then<00:01:14.690> fold<00:01:15.230> each<00:01:15.620> of<00:01:15.920> my<00:01:16.160> four<00:01:16.430> corners<00:01:16.970> into

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
then fold each of my four corners into

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.590 
then fold each of my four corners into
the<00:01:17.860> center<00:01:18.860> here<00:01:21.940> we'll<00:01:22.940> just<00:01:22.970> go<00:01:23.240> around<00:01:23.330> and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
the center here we'll just go around and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:37.149 
the center here we'll just go around and
do<00:01:23.660> that<00:01:23.810> for<00:01:23.960> all<00:01:24.080> four<00:01:24.110> sides<00:01:24.650> here

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.859 

so<00:01:38.159> I've<00:01:38.250> gotten<00:01:38.670> all<00:01:38.789> four<00:01:39.119> corners<00:01:39.390> folded

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
so I've gotten all four corners folded

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.719 
so I've gotten all four corners folded
over<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.100> flip<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.430> over<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
over here I'm going to flip it over and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.669 
over here I'm going to flip it over and
I'm<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> fold<00:01:42.539> my<00:01:42.720> four<00:01:43.079> corners<00:01:43.530> in

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
I'm going to fold my four corners in

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.919 
I'm going to fold my four corners in
again<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.909> should<00:01:45.090> hopefully<00:01:45.240> give<00:01:45.570> us<00:01:45.689> some

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
again this should hopefully give us some

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.660 
again this should hopefully give us some
good<00:01:46.200> preliminary<00:01:46.860> creases<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> will<00:01:47.549> help

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
good preliminary creases that will help

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.249 
good preliminary creases that will help
us<00:01:47.939> through<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> steps<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
us through the steps to get to the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.429 
us through the steps to get to the
double<00:01:49.649> boat<00:01:49.799> base<00:01:50.840> get<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:51.929> four<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> these

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
double boat base get all four of these

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:02.149 
double boat base get all four of these
in<00:01:59.960> then<00:02:00.960> once<00:02:01.350> you've<00:02:01.500> got<00:02:01.649> everything<00:02:01.799> in

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
in then once you've got everything in

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.020 
in then once you've got everything in
open<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.700> all<00:02:02.819> up<00:02:02.849> here<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.700> want<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:08.030> look

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
open it all up here so we want to look

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.509 
open it all up here so we want to look
at<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.299> white<00:02:09.509> side<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.619> I'm<00:02:11.130> just<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
at the white side and I'm just going to

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.509 
at the white side and I'm just going to
fold<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.450> two<00:02:13.019> sides<00:02:13.290> now<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.709> middle<00:02:14.130> part<00:02:14.340> is

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
fold in two sides now the middle part is

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.580 
fold in two sides now the middle part is
already<00:02:14.730> going<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> right<00:02:15.299> way<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.989> ends

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
already going the right way the ends

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.410 
already going the right way the ends
need<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.160> reversed<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:18.000> they<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:18.269> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
need to be reversed so that they go the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.030 
need to be reversed so that they go the
right<00:02:18.540> way<00:02:18.599> so<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:19.080> get<00:02:19.380> them<00:02:19.500> folded<00:02:19.830> into

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
right way so just get them folded into

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.710 
right way so just get them folded into
the<00:02:20.190> center<00:02:20.580> making<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:21.030> nice<00:02:21.209> little<00:02:21.540> door

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the center making a nice little door

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.120 
the center making a nice little door
base<00:02:21.930> here<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:24.140> we've<00:02:25.140> got<00:02:25.319> these<00:02:25.470> nice<00:02:25.709> sets

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
base here and we've got these nice sets

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.800 
base here and we've got these nice sets
of<00:02:26.310> creases<00:02:26.640> here<00:02:26.849> that's<00:02:27.209> going<00:02:27.329> to<00:02:27.390> help<00:02:27.569> us

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
of creases here that's going to help us

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.690 
of creases here that's going to help us
collapse<00:02:28.319> everything<00:02:28.860> into<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.220> double<00:02:29.549> boat

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
collapse everything into the double boat

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.009 
collapse everything into the double boat
base<00:02:29.940> I'm<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.329> use<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.630> crisscross

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
base I'm going to use the crisscross

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.020 
base I'm going to use the crisscross
creases<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.769> see<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.190> by<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.549> opening

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
creases that I see here by just opening

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.620 
creases that I see here by just opening
up<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.680> can<00:02:34.829> do<00:02:34.950> both<00:02:35.100> sides<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.819> then

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
up and you can do both sides and then

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.240 
up and you can do both sides and then
just<00:02:36.840> get<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.140> part<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.500> lay<00:02:37.620> down<00:02:37.650> which<00:02:38.100> is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
just get this part to lay down which is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.860 
just get this part to lay down which is
already<00:02:38.519> going<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:38.970> right<00:02:39.060> direction<00:02:39.239> and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
already going in the right direction and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
already going in the right direction and
then<00:02:40.319> this<00:02:41.100> crease<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.519> already<00:02:42.060> marked<00:02:42.209> off

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
then this crease is already marked off

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.390 
then this crease is already marked off
on<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.930> these<00:02:43.109> sides<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.069> should<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.370> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
on all these sides so it should be a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.580 
on all these sides so it should be a
really<00:02:44.760> fairly<00:02:45.269> easy<00:02:45.510> collapse<00:02:46.019> because<00:02:46.440> of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
really fairly easy collapse because of

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.050 
really fairly easy collapse because of
the<00:02:46.650> way<00:02:46.739> we<00:02:46.859> did<00:02:47.010> our<00:02:47.130> preliminary<00:02:47.310> creases

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
the way we did our preliminary creases

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.640 
the way we did our preliminary creases
and<00:02:48.299> then<00:02:48.359> I'm<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.079> going<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> do<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.500> same

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
and then I'm just going to do the same

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.500 
and then I'm just going to do the same
thing<00:02:49.859> on<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.100> side<00:02:50.160> too<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:50.880> if<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.269> open

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
thing on this side too so if I just open

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.569 
thing on this side too so if I just open
up<00:02:51.780> again<00:02:52.109> on<00:02:52.319> those<00:02:52.470> creases<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.400> push

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
up again on those creases and just push

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.059 
up again on those creases and just push
down<00:02:53.609> on<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.000> back<00:02:54.350> then<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.620> should<00:02:55.889> give

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
down on that back then that should give

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.030 
down on that back then that should give
you<00:02:56.310> what's<00:02:56.700> called<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.329> double<00:02:57.750> boat<00:02:58.410> base

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
you what's called the double boat base

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.449 
you what's called the double boat base
and<00:02:59.510> then<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.959> get<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.440> double<00:03:01.829> hold<00:03:02.100> base

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
and then to get to the double hold base

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.610 
and then to get to the double hold base
all<00:03:02.730> we<00:03:02.880> have<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.120> do<00:03:03.269> is<00:03:03.859> fold<00:03:04.859> it<00:03:05.069> in<00:03:05.280> half<00:03:05.310> and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
all we have to do is fold it in half and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.140 
all we have to do is fold it in half and
kind<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.680> line<00:03:07.889> up<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.220> bottom<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.730> make

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
kind of line up the bottom there make

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.550 
kind of line up the bottom there make
sure<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.420> get<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.540> good<00:03:09.720> crease<00:03:10.019> on<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:13.500> you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
sure you get a good crease on it and you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.470 
sure you get a good crease on it and you
can<00:03:13.680> see<00:03:13.859> here<00:03:14.130> you've<00:03:14.280> got<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.459> nice<00:03:14.730> double

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
can see here you've got a nice double

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.340 
can see here you've got a nice double
hole<00:03:15.720> here<00:03:16.079> for<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.380> boat<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.109> make

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
hole here for the boat and you can make

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.170 
hole here for the boat and you can make
this<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.739> different<00:03:20.069> materials<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:20.819> play

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
this with different materials and play

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.110 
this with different materials and play
with<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:21.389> in<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:23.069> water<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.400> see<00:03:23.819> how<00:03:23.850> long

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
with it in the water to see how long

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.120 
with it in the water to see how long
which<00:03:24.389> one<00:03:24.569> whose<00:03:24.989> last<00:03:25.260> longer<00:03:25.530> those<00:03:25.829> kinds

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
which one whose last longer those kinds

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.949 
which one whose last longer those kinds
of<00:03:26.220> things<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.970> always<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> fun<00:03:27.510> kind<00:03:27.840> of

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
of things it's always a fun kind of

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.280 
of things it's always a fun kind of
challenge<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.299> gives<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.959> basic

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
challenge but that gives you the basic

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.740 
challenge but that gives you the basic
finished<00:03:31.590> piece<00:03:31.799> now<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.730> dimensions<00:03:33.540> for

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
finished piece now the dimensions for

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.009 
finished piece now the dimensions for
this<00:03:33.900> are<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.650> course<00:03:34.889> 15<00:03:35.430> centimeters<00:03:36.239> by

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.840 

3.75

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
3.75

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:53.770 
3.75
I'd<00:03:41.000> say

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.090 

but<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:54.960> is<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.140> fun<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.560> easy<00:03:55.650> way<00:03:55.920> to

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
but this is a fun and easy way to

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.490 
but this is a fun and easy way to
practice<00:03:56.670> those<00:03:57.000> creases<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:58.080> good<00:03:58.320> way<00:03:58.440> to

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
practice those creases so a good way to

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.560 
practice those creases so a good way to
work<00:03:59.010> on<00:03:59.220> your<00:03:59.280> technique<00:03:59.760> if<00:04:00.210> you're<00:04:00.330> trying

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
work on your technique if you're trying

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.240 
work on your technique if you're trying
to<00:04:00.660> improve<00:04:01.020> your<00:04:01.080> folding<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> good

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
to improve your folding this is a good

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.430 
to improve your folding this is a good
way<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.400> do<00:04:02.670> things<00:04:02.960> and<00:04:03.960> then<00:04:04.110> there's<00:04:04.320> so

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
way to do things and then there's so

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.750 
way to do things and then there's so
many<00:04:04.530> things<00:04:04.770> that<00:04:04.890> come<00:04:05.040> from<00:04:05.250> this<00:04:05.520> that<00:04:05.700> you

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
many things that come from this that you

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.880 
many things that come from this that you
go<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.030> other<00:04:06.330> stuff<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.170> good<00:04:07.320> good

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
go to other stuff so it's a good good
