00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
access to equipment this is a great

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.340 
access to equipment this is a great
exercise<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.130> work<00:01:32.790> those<00:01:33.060> hamstrings<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
exercise to work those hamstrings so you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
exercise to work those hamstrings so you
want<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> gently<00:01:34.920> pull<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.060> weight<00:01:36.270> right<00:01:36.659> in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
want to gently pull the weight right in

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.609 
want to gently pull the weight right in
towards<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.470> glutes<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.070> then<00:01:38.520> lower<00:01:39.299> down

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
exhale as you lift inhale as you lower

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.359 
exhale as you lift inhale as you lower
down<00:01:44.810> now<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:46.170> you're<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.560> isolating

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
down now here you're really isolating

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.289 
down now here you're really isolating
those<00:01:47.490> hamstring<00:01:48.210> muscles<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:50.159> you're<00:01:51.119> also

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
those hamstring muscles and you're also

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600 
those hamstring muscles and you're also
lengthening<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.140> quads<00:01:52.619> at<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> same<00:01:53.250> time

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
lengthening your quads at the same time

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.940 
lengthening your quads at the same time
so<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.960> worked<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.380> quads<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.829> get

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
so if you just worked your quads you get

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
so if you just worked your quads you get
a<00:01:55.979> nice<00:01:56.130> stretch<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.549> your<00:01:56.579> quads<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.210> you're

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
a nice stretch in your quads as you're

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.170 
a nice stretch in your quads as you're
working<00:01:57.810> those<00:01:57.930> hamstrings<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:59.700> again<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
working those hamstrings so again you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.060 
working those hamstrings so again you
want<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> perform<00:02:00.509> about<00:02:00.930> ten<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.560> fifteen

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
want to perform about ten to fifteen

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.440 
want to perform about ten to fifteen
reps<00:02:02.100> three<00:02:02.960> sets<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.770> then<00:02:05.670> relax

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.740 

and<00:02:09.770> those<00:02:10.770> are<00:02:10.980> some<00:02:11.220> great<00:02:11.550> quadricep<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and those are some great quadricep and
