00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.199
 one 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.849
 uu 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:19.789
 Hello friends 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.920
 it's me again I want misteris today I bring you the last part of this 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.419
 series of videos of urban legends of video games that were from San 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.259
 andreas' up paghman 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.630
 for this last part they accompany me to my assistant dog 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.270
 hello I am the assistant of santa inés refused to participate in this video until 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.570
 that you pay me the money you owe me from the previous videos 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.140
 to acquire dices 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.800
 since I paid for the videos 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.980
 I just did it a few minutes ago 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.980
 he's right the money was under my bed 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.430
 not after this confusion 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.980
 I was telling you that this is the last part of this series of videos 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.930
 after here of other series that will be of other themes 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.690
 although I think most will be related to good video games 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.539
 I'm sorry I took so long to take this video 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.530
 is that between exams school and other things I could not do this part 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.799
 likewise I thank my subscribers and the people who 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.970
 they wrote some legend in the comments 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.990
 after this now if we start with the video 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.670
 the first legend will be one written in a comment by a youtube hero the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.540
 legend is that of the pokémon 0 0 0 also known as my sign 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.890
 of this legend I had already heard rumors 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.680
 but he had not been able to investigate until a while ago this legend speaks 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.470
 about a pokémon which appeared in the pokémon games for game boy in 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.380
 the red blue versions and to a lesser extent the yellow one but I will tell you 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.760
 better the theme 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.660
 This legend emerges some time ago after being launched on the market 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.090
 the versions of because with in three colors 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.600
 the yellow blue and red soon began to run some rumors about 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.280
 weird things in this game 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.570
 but the ones that got the most out were those of capturing I'm leaving and those of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.670
 a weird Pokémon which had as a number 0 0 zero or simply not what 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.360
 I had 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.220
 this second rumor happened to be one of the best known since it granted the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.770
 possibility of being able to capture a pokémon which would have skills 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.989
 unique and whose levels would exceed those allowed on the other pokemones 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.819
 the power to capture it would be possible after the execution of certain steps the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.180
 which I would take you interviewed pokémon which would have generally 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.969
 shape of l with the appearance of a clear bar code that the shape 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.999
 could vary between circles 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.529
 semi-formed square or could even take parts of some 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:34.359
 pokemons and take an indefinite shape with a monster-like appearance 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.659
 60's movies 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.409
 although it could also take the form of some other pokémon or because you mones 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.329
 dead 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.790
 clear that the form that it would take would be defined by the name that the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.629
 player would have the name of ace in the game causes it to take the 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.950
 appearance of the image 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.529
 being the name of amazement of the most common used within the game 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:56.349
 caused this strange being to be remembered by this form since it was the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.739
 most common way in which it appeared 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.560
 note the one that could take the form of why dead mones is not confirmed 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.180
 but there are many rumors about what can be done but as I said 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.429
 rumors 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:11.329
 this british of the game was done in the following way we would have to fly towards 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.359
 Celadon city 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.930
 once there you would have to fly to green city after talking to the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.889
 old man who teaches you how to capture the immune pots and answers that it does not stop 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.669
 that the fight against the united 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.699
 once done this you would have to fly to cinnamon island idea and head towards 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.129
 the right coast and surf 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.859
 finished this you would have to move along the coast from top to bottom 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.249
 Once this is done, pokemon will start to appear that should not 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:34.629
 go out 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.319
 many of them will be at levels over 100 and sooner or later it will come out 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.349
 if not 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.339
 sure they will ask 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.709
 and why does this appear by rudder 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.469
 Well the reason is due to a programming error which is caused by the 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:51.429
 empty spaces within the game's memory the game by using 8 bits of 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:55.519
 memory allocated 256 spaces of available memory 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.030
 but the game only used 151 spaces since this is the number of why 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.480
 mones that contains the game 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.280
 the programmers decided to fill in these spaces with data, that is, with 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.969
 missing no 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.379
 so there would be a balance 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.999
 but the problem arises when the programmers decided that in some 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.590
 areas the data was over written to define what kind of because you mones 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.289
 would appear there but by confusing the game in such a way that it does not 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.949
 write the data of the areas causes the game does not know what kind of 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.460
 because mones must appear so he resorts to putting the pokemones of the 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.720
 last visited area 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.920
 also causes you to call the empty spaces within the 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.120
 memory by which they appear and yes no 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.180
 This pokémon when captured caused various effects in the departure of the 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.930
 player as the multiplication of items the malfunction of the 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.419
 game 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.000
 the appearance of junk graphics and even 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.919
 the deletion of the game 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.639
 although nintendo has denied the existence of this one because there monte issued a 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.169
 statement in which he said that my sign was a programming error and 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.889
 gave a way of how to solve the problems that this will cause if it was 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:56.569
 captured 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.650
 curiously my sign also appears in later releases of the game 

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:04.499
 each time with a more defined form, which concludes that nintendo lies 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.499
 more than a child to avoid getting into trouble 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.439
 good people who want to clarify that because I had many things that I 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.370
 they prevented further uploading videos 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.130
 I have been left to owe several parts which I will try to upload the next ones 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.820
 weeks on the other hand I apologize for this horrible delay and 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.730
 He also warned them that I will continue to get more videos of legends just like 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:29.770
 previous 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.500
 meanwhile I leave here this video of the legend of pokémon which 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.870
 I did that because I took a lot of space to talk about that, what are you reading 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.709
 greetings to all and soon I will release videos dedicated teresita 

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:43.189
 san andres 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.800
 see you soon
