the ways Subaru improved you economy the

continuously variable transmission that

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
continuously variable transmission that
helps<00:01:03.480> fuel<00:01:03.690> economy<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
helps fuel economy but one of the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
helps fuel economy but one of the
drawbacks<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.670> under<00:01:05.909> acceleration<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
drawbacks is that under acceleration it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
drawbacks is that under acceleration it
holds<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> engine<00:01:07.500> speed<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.010> high<00:01:08.189> rent<00:01:08.549> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
holds the engine speed at high rent that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
holds the engine speed at high rent that
could<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.210> noisy<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:10.530> also<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
could be noisy you can also get the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.260 
could be noisy you can also get the
