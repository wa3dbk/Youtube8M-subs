 Today I want to show you how 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.040
 I have lost the bluetooth 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.120
 I have retrofitted functionality 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.800
 I have separated from mine 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.509
 plug-and-play radio because me 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.639
 equipment and the sound just not 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.949
 I liked my old proven 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.960
 child is reinstated hp pays the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.410
 disadvantage that I am no longer that right 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.510
 good bluetooth functionality from media 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.650
 have to or plugin player radio 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.720
 I do not speak 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.880
 Handsfree more and can stop 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.279
 and that has been my big problem 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.390
 I can not use the phone on the phone 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.920
 stereo stream the music and me 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.540
 I just wanted to show you how I do it 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.730
 Changed basic requirement is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 stop or radio had additional 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.840
 have aux input and everything else 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.840
 I'll show you now 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.600
 Today I want to give you the bmw new 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.450
 bluetooth receiver introduce me 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.760
 I bought on Amazon I left link 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.800
 now a yes that is meanwhile 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.250
 the third one I've gained 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.160
 one runs on the tape recorder of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.290
 I have one daughter about me 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.180
 an additional change jack plug 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.530
 adapter with me in the living room to the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.110
 stereo system connected 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.220
 and because of the great work I have 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.490
 Give me this particle again enough 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.520
 brought to install this in the car 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:37.020
 not spectacularly delivered all 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.259
 becomes, so to speak, the bluetooth adapter and a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.390
 small adapter cable that is yes 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.860
 actually only to load the whole 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.860
 stupidly is a mini usb connection 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.380
 and no micro usb as well as one quite 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.659
 normal from the smartphone child then 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.330
 you would have to use it immediately 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.790
 According to the description you can do that 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.560
 Use device for four hours if you can 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.299
 it was one and a half hours before 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.869
 so it had worked 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.019
 also reliable one can in the car 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.979
 connect the corresponding 12 volt device 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.110
 and the socket I will 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.700
 probably that's how I do one 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.700
 have power distribution in the glove compartment 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.820
 the device goes down 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.520
 I do not need anything anymore 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.880
 take care there are not many 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.820
 as I said to load because 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.050
 she does not need a laptop or something 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.420
 you just make a plug in 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.420
 and then bring in the socket and 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.330
 The whole thing comes over the clinton 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.670
 plug to the three and a half millimeters 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.230
 jack on my radio I can 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.980
 handy when i hawks as a source 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.100
 select them 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.959
 Start the whole operation now 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.760
 to the vehicle collapsed the whole 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.030
 and then we look at how smoothly 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.130
 it is all in operation 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.840
 so that I can with heavier reconstructions 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.790
 not great the radio again 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.430
 I had to take it out before 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.980
 I have prepared for mine 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:13.680
 small monitor still in connection and 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:17.280
 also as for the against plug the on 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.400
 the aux connection from the radio trapped 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.400
 is 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.650
 and now I can already do that 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.290
 take into operation and after it will 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.290
 just disappear again 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.050
 I'm already in the run-up to the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.050
 source on ochs stelle am a radio 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.940
 I would now next next 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.480
 try me with the phone too 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.480
 connect 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:59.450
 Of course I have bluetooth 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:04:00.920
 switched on bluetooth and he has 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.209
 actually found that was already 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.709
 no big deal settings 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:11.660
 media playback everything i listen to music 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.780
 actually basically via the vlc 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.890
 player and now just want something 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.489
 from again to see if it 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.489
 is working 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:39.139
 and behold, I agree practically already 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:41.569
 on my mobile phone so the music 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.210
 works smoothly a very fine 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.900
 thing okay you can telephone there 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.889

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.300

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.669
 I'm also glad I still have my peace 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.800
 have and no phone rings because of that 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.949
