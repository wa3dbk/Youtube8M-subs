00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 yes 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.179
 do not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.020
 by the grace of God let's seek to be 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.919
 rekindled by prayer today we meditate 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.400
 about the importance of prayer 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.590
 intercessor 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.440
 there are those around you who 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.170
 suffer misfortunes that need words 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.989
 of sympathy of love of tenderness and 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.559
 our humble and compassionate prayers 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.910
 by calling God our father 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.890
 we recognize all your children as 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.880
 our brothers 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.010
 we are all members of a single family 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.110
 in our requests we have to include 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.379
 to our neighbor as much as to us 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.879
 no one now as is proper if 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.250
 he only asks for blessings for himself 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.340
 some are sick others have lost 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.729
 hope to give back sunlight 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.979
 there are souls that have lost their value 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.800
 speak to them orally there are some 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.080
 they need the bread of life read from the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.930
 word of God there is a disease of 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.310
 soul that no balm can reach and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 no healing medicine pray and bring them to 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.380
 Jesus 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.800
 or if it could be heard by all 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.100
 parts the fervent prayer of faith give me 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.700
 the souls buried now under the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.020
 mistake garbage if I do not die 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.070
 let's bring the knowledge of the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.110
 true as it is in Jesus Christ 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.080
 pray for the blessings in order to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.420
 to be able to bless others of ours 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.060
 prayers do not have to consist of 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.810
 selfish requests merely for 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.630
 our own benefit we have to ask 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.790
 to be able to give intercession for all 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.890
 for those who preach minister for the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.649
 young people by the students by the teachers 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.400
 for the brothers by our parents for 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.400
 our children 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.510
 these brief concepts are based on 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.750

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.200
