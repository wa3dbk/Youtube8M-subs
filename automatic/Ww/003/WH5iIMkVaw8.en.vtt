00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.990
 one of Latin America hello what do you think 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.540
 if we continue with the study of the process 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.670
 of socialization as we come 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.009
 doing it in the previous videos of 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.630
 civic education remember that when 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.820
 we talk about socialization 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.380
 we talk about that characteristic that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.779
 possesses the human being to be able 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 communicate with others is to say this 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.189
 socialization process refers to neither 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 more or less than those stages by the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.679
 which is going through the human being to 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.860
 to be able to relate to other men 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.660
 of course we repeat in society but 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.000
 clear throughout history this 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.489
 tendency to group ourselves and to live inside 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.719
 of a society was object of reflection 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.850
 from several authors and I tell you that there are 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.710
 a very important philosopher we see 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.399
 on screen that is neither more nor less than 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.079
 Aristóteles remember that we have videos 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.690
 corresponding to aristóteles in 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.640
 our list of philosophy within 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.109
 educa tina and good as I said 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.310
 Aristotle is also going to start 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.380
 study this 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.210
 kind of property they possessed 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.180
 the humans that were to understand them as 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.860
 social beings is to tell the man what 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.140
 we understand in 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.759
 society but let's concretely go to 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.970
 Aristóteles because I greece ancient 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.450
 aristóteles considered it held that the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.450
 man is 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.079
 x 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.920
 nature 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:36.350
 we repeat the man is by nature a 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.210
 social animal by nature then a 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.360
 animal 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.690
 socially that is to say I justified this 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.540
 affirmation according to him in the fact that 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:52.229
 a person naturally needed to 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.259
 other people to be able to live is to say 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.350
 but more than to be able to live for 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.060
 survive and of course this attracted 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.759
 the fact that every person as 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.979
 was born needed the others held 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.149
 Aristotle who is 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.420
 while dry is the community 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.390
 of society something necessary to be able 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.630
 live like this according to this philosopher 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.180
 then the social coexistence for the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.200
 we have to think like something humanly 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.530
 insurmountable is to say the greatest of 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.510
 achievements in society the community for 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.390
 aristóteles was the only area in the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.239
 which an individual could develop in 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.100
 all its fullness then we are going to 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.630
 understand this process of socialization 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.760
 in Aristotle as something natural in the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.130
 next video we will see how for the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.180
 contemporary sociologists remember that 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.370
 Ancient Greece does not speak 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.890
 sociologists sociology is a science 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.569
 contemporary let's see how the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.030
 sociologists are going to establish a 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.530
 difference with this thought 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.989
 Aristotelian and they're going to talk about the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.609
 socialization as something acquired by 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.340
 Then do not miss seeing our next 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.620
 video and review all the themes together 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.019
 previous we saw in civic education 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.939
 because the issue of standards of conduct 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.010
 the socialization processes are 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.569
 needed to understand issues that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.079
 let's develop next 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.400
 thanks for joining us here
