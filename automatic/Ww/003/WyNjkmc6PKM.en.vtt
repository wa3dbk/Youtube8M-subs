this<00:00:00.299> week's<00:00:00.570> farm<00:00:00.840> basics<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.439> brought<00:00:01.709> to

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
this week's farm basics is brought to

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.789 
this week's farm basics is brought to
you<00:00:01.949> by<00:00:02.360> SATCOM<00:00:03.360> satellites<00:00:04.140> aren't<00:00:04.410> just<00:00:04.650> for

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
you by SATCOM satellites aren't just for

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.130 
you by SATCOM satellites aren't just for
NASA<00:00:05.009> anymore<00:00:05.640> use<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.270> power<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.690> satellite

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
NASA anymore use the power of satellite

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.780 
NASA anymore use the power of satellite
imagery<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.740> create<00:00:07.770> variable<00:00:08.610> rate

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
imagery to create variable rate

imagery to create variable rate
management<00:00:09.059> zones<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.780> your<00:00:09.960> fields<00:00:10.380> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
management zones in your fields to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.470 
management zones in your fields to
reduce<00:00:11.010> input<00:00:11.250> costs<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:11.849> increase<00:00:12.150> yields

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
reduce input costs and increase yields

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.240 
reduce input costs and increase yields
on<00:00:12.570> your<00:00:12.750> farm<00:00:13.049> go<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.790> SATCOM<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:19.130> lot<00:00:20.130> of

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
on your farm go to SATCOM a lot of

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.040 
on your farm go to SATCOM a lot of
decisions<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.789> farmers<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.689> make<00:00:21.869> in

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
decisions that farmers have to make in

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.960 
decisions that farmers have to make in
today's<00:00:22.320> farm<00:00:22.619> basics<00:00:23.039> we'll<00:00:23.310> talk<00:00:23.490> about<00:00:23.789> one

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
today's farm basics we'll talk about one

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.609 
today's farm basics we'll talk about one
of<00:00:24.000> those<00:00:24.180> decisions<00:00:24.750> they<00:00:24.930> make<00:00:25.140> around<00:00:25.410> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
of those decisions they make around this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.589 
of those decisions they make around this
time<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> year<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.939> harvest<00:00:27.180> crops

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
time of year when do you harvest crops

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.029 
time of year when do you harvest crops
that's<00:00:28.019> pretty<00:00:28.230> easy<00:00:28.289> dear<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.890> just

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that's pretty easy dear and you just

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.710 
that's pretty easy dear and you just
wait<00:00:29.220> until<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> neighbors<00:00:29.730> get<00:00:30.090> started<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
wait until the neighbors get started and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.630 
wait until the neighbors get started and
then<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.080> go<00:00:31.230> oh<00:00:31.529> that's<00:00:31.769> always<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.369> good

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
then you go oh that's always a good

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.740 
then you go oh that's always a good
guide<00:00:34.190> no<00:00:35.190> seriously<00:00:35.790> when<00:00:36.059> we're<00:00:36.390> looking<00:00:36.660> at

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
guide no seriously when we're looking at

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.000 
guide no seriously when we're looking at
lots<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.079> different<00:00:37.380> crops<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> front

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
lots of different crops on the front

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.590 
lots of different crops on the front
like<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.370> example<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.910> our<00:00:39.030> farm<00:00:39.300> we're

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
like for example for our farm we're

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.780 
like for example for our farm we're
raising<00:00:39.750> corn<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.440> soybeans<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> wheat<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
raising corn and soybeans and wheat it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.490 
raising corn and soybeans and wheat it
is<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> tough<00:00:42.360> question<00:00:42.540> when<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.079> start<00:00:43.350> do

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.709 
Monday to start well how do you know
when<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> right<00:00:53.670> time<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.270> well<00:00:54.539> the

when it's the right time to go well the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
when it's the right time to go well the
most<00:00:55.110> important<00:00:55.710> thing<00:00:55.860> you're<00:00:56.010> looking<00:00:56.370> at

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
most important thing you're looking at

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.660 
most important thing you're looking at
is<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.300> seeds<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.469> fully<00:00:58.739> mature<00:00:58.859> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
is the seeds have to be fully mature so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
is the seeds have to be fully mature so
once<00:01:00.180> they're<00:01:00.449> fully<00:01:00.660> mature<00:01:01.109> you're<00:01:01.410> in

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
once they're fully mature you're in

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.209 
once they're fully mature you're in
pretty<00:01:01.710> good<00:01:01.829> shape

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
pretty good shape

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.189 
pretty good shape
except<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> fact<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.780> most<00:01:03.930> cases

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
except for the fact that in most cases

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.560 
except for the fact that in most cases
that<00:01:04.890> seed<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.240> stored

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that seed is going to have to be stored

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.870 
that seed is going to have to be stored
somewhere<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> grain<00:01:07.799> bin<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.340> an

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
somewhere like a grain bin or an

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120 
somewhere like a grain bin or an
elevator<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.080> you're<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> store<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
elevator so if you're going to store the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.429 
elevator so if you're going to store the
seed<00:01:11.520> whether<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.060> corn<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.600> soybeans<00:01:13.080> wheat

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
seed whether it's corn or soybeans wheat

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.260 
seed whether it's corn or soybeans wheat
any<00:01:13.770> crop<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.460> you're<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.850> store<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
any crop if you're going to store that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780 
any crop if you're going to store that
seed<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.930> most<00:01:16.259> likely<00:01:16.710> has<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.250> down<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
seed it most likely has to be down to a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.050 
seed it most likely has to be down to a
certain<00:01:18.240> level<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.780> moisture<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.520> example

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
certain level of moisture so for example

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.890 
certain level of moisture so for example
with<00:01:21.299> corn

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
with corn

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.200 
with corn
no<00:01:22.320> elevator<00:01:22.770> wants<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> take<00:01:23.670> corn<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
no elevator wants to take corn that is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.850 
no elevator wants to take corn that is
above<00:01:24.810> 15%<00:01:25.700> moisture<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.850> other<00:01:27.060> words<00:01:27.860> 85%

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
above 15% moisture in other words 85%

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.630 
above 15% moisture in other words 85%
dry<00:01:29.340> material<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.150> 15%<00:01:30.840> water<00:01:31.439> inside<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
dry material and 15% water inside that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120 
dry material and 15% water inside that
seed<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.659> ideally<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.650> they're<00:01:34.829> looking

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
seed that's ideally what they're looking

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
seed that's ideally what they're looking
for<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.670> they'd<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.570> even<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> little

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
for or they'd like to have even a little

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
for or they'd like to have even a little
more<00:01:37.229> dry<00:01:37.500> matter<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:38.280> less<00:01:38.520> water

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
more dry matter and a little less water

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.080 
more dry matter and a little less water
but<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.720> problem<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.070> seed<00:01:41.909> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
but the problem is if you have seed that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.039 
but the problem is if you have seed that
is<00:01:42.240> too<00:01:42.479> wet

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
is too wet

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.840 
is too wet
and<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> put<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.950> bin<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.430> store<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and you put that in a bin you store it

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
and you put that in a bin you store it
anywhere<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.960> end<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.140> spoiling

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
anywhere it's going to end up spoiling

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.499 
anywhere it's going to end up spoiling
and<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:46.979> obviously<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.549> bad<00:01:47.759> thing<00:01:47.970> well<00:01:48.270> if

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
and that's obviously a bad thing well if

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.690 
and that's obviously a bad thing well if
you<00:01:48.750> bring<00:01:49.079> grain<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.130> corn<00:01:50.460> for

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you bring grain that like corn for

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.340 
you bring grain that like corn for
example<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.299> brought<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.720> 17%

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
example so you brought it in with 17%

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.069 
example so you brought it in with 17%
water<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> grain<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:53.579> 17%<00:01:54.119> moisture<00:01:54.840> what

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
water in the grain or 17% moisture what

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.990 
water in the grain or 17% moisture what
the<00:01:55.200> elevator<00:01:55.530> would<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.189> typically<00:01:56.610> dock

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the elevator would do is typically dock

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.389 
the elevator would do is typically dock
you<00:01:57.270> they'll<00:01:57.509> say<00:01:57.750> okay<00:01:58.110> well<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.619> 17%

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you they'll say okay well it's 17%

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.209 
you they'll say okay well it's 17%
moisture<00:01:59.850> we're<00:02:00.450> only<00:02:00.600> paying<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.350> 15%

moisture we're only paying for 15%
moisture<00:02:02.880> corn<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.509> we're<00:02:03.780> gonna<00:02:03.869> dock<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.229> so

moisture corn so we're gonna dock you so

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.490 
moisture corn so we're gonna dock you so
many<00:02:04.950> cents<00:02:05.250> per<00:02:05.520> bushel<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.110> value

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
many cents per bushel to get that value

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380 
many cents per bushel to get that value
down<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:08.069> bit<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.729> we've<00:02:09.060> got<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
down a little bit because we've got to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.059 
down a little bit because we've got to
do<00:02:09.479> something<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.319> grain<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.709> be<00:02:10.800> able<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
do something to that grain to be able to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.710 
do something to that grain to be able to
store<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.489> plus<00:02:11.790> you've<00:02:12.120> brought<00:02:12.360> us<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> whole

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
store it plus you've brought us a whole

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
store it plus you've brought us a whole
bunch<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.959> extra<00:02:13.050> water

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
bunch of extra water

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.260 
bunch of extra water
that<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.190> don't<00:02:14.490> need<00:02:14.640> now<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.060> other

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that we really don't need now the other

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.000 
that we really don't need now the other
side<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:16.020> what<00:02:16.260> happens<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.890> gets

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
side of that is what happens if it gets

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.740 
side of that is what happens if it gets
too<00:02:17.280> dry<00:02:17.490> out<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.000> field<00:02:18.270> let's<00:02:18.420> say<00:02:18.510> that

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
too dry out in the field let's say that

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.290 
too dry out in the field let's say that
corn<00:02:19.020> gets<00:02:19.200> down<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.710> 12<00:02:20.130> or<00:02:20.340> 13<00:02:20.790> percent<00:02:21.000> in

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
corn gets down to 12 or 13 percent in

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.690 
corn gets down to 12 or 13 percent in
the<00:02:21.390> field<00:02:21.630> well<00:02:22.020> then<00:02:22.170> you're<00:02:22.320> hauling<00:02:22.700> 88%

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the field well then you're hauling 88%

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.000 
the field well then you're hauling 88%
dry<00:02:24.210> matter<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.960> elevator<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.530> elevators

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
dry matter to the elevator the elevators

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.770 
dry matter to the elevator the elevators
getting<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.370> great<00:02:26.640> deal<00:02:26.670> they<00:02:27.390> aren't<00:02:27.660> gonna

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
getting a great deal they aren't gonna

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.720 
getting a great deal they aren't gonna
pay<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.170> premium<00:02:28.470> because<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.490> didn't

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
pay you a premium because you didn't

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.460 
pay you a premium because you didn't
bring<00:02:29.880> them<00:02:30.000> water<00:02:30.270> they're<00:02:30.690> gonna<00:02:30.810> say<00:02:31.050> sure

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
bring them water they're gonna say sure

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.170 
bring them water they're gonna say sure
we'll<00:02:31.740> take<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.160> grain<00:02:32.400> that's<00:02:32.700> nice<00:02:32.940> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
we'll take that grain that's nice and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.750 
we'll take that grain that's nice and
dry<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.600> you've<00:02:34.260> lost<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.890> money<00:02:35.100> in<00:02:35.340> your

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
dry and you've lost the money in your

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.820 
dry and you've lost the money in your
field<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.270> there's<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.930> fine<00:02:37.230> point<00:02:37.620> where

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
field so there's that fine point where

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.170 
field so there's that fine point where
you<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.070> figure<00:02:38.490> out<00:02:38.670> what<00:02:39.030> your

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
you have to figure out what your

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.330 
you have to figure out what your
moisture<00:02:39.630> content<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.440> Grain<00:02:40.710> like<00:02:41.010> corn

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
moisture content is in Grain like corn

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.610 
moisture content is in Grain like corn
for<00:02:41.610> example<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.360> around<00:02:42.750> fifteen<00:02:43.230> percent

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
for example and around fifteen percent

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.560 
for example and around fifteen percent
you<00:02:43.830> want<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.100> bring<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.670> but<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.420> get

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
you want to bring that in but if you get

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.110 
you want to bring that in but if you get
down<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.900> 12%<00:02:46.230> you've<00:02:46.740> lost<00:02:47.100> money<00:02:47.520> by<00:02:47.820> leaving

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
down to 12% you've lost money by leaving

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.850 
down to 12% you've lost money by leaving
it<00:02:48.210> in<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.390> field<00:02:48.600> too<00:02:48.810> long<00:02:48.990> now<00:02:49.230> let's<00:02:49.620> just

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
it in the field too long now let's just

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.860 
it in the field too long now let's just
say<00:02:50.100> for<00:02:50.340> example<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.060> had<00:02:51.210> grain<00:02:51.540> that

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
say for example that you had grain that

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.680 
say for example that you had grain that
was<00:02:52.110> mostly<00:02:52.920> dry<00:02:53.250> matter<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.670> down<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.270> 12%

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
was mostly dry matter and down to 12%

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.170 
was mostly dry matter and down to 12%
moisture<00:02:55.170> like<00:02:55.320> Darin<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.709> saying

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
moisture like Darin is saying

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.490 
moisture like Darin is saying
theoretically<00:02:57.180> if<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.690> added<00:02:58.140> some<00:02:58.380> more

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
theoretically if you added some more

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.860 
theoretically if you added some more
water<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.370> gram<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.000> could<00:03:00.180> sell<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
water to this gram you could sell the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.380 
water to this gram you could sell the
elevator<00:03:01.350> more<00:03:01.830> water<00:03:02.250> for<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.940> same<00:03:03.180> price

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
elevator more water for the same price

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.310 
elevator more water for the same price
as<00:03:03.570> corn<00:03:04.760> really<00:03:05.760> legal<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.450> hose<00:03:06.690> down<00:03:07.020> that

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
as corn really legal to hose down that

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.410 
as corn really legal to hose down that
load<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.709> grain<00:03:07.950> with<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.370> hose<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.880> water<00:03:09.120> but

load of grain with the hose of water but

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.150 
load of grain with the hose of water but
what<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.690> could<00:03:09.930> do<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.350> let's<00:03:10.709> say<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:10.950> were

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
what you could do is let's say you were

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.980 
what you could do is let's say you were
storing<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.880> grain<00:03:12.120> bin<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.630> could<00:03:12.780> run

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
storing it in a grain bin you could run

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.740 
storing it in a grain bin you could run
some<00:03:13.170> aeration<00:03:13.410> fans<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> humid<00:03:14.940> day<00:03:14.970> let

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
some aeration fans on a humid day let

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.510 
some aeration fans on a humid day let
the<00:03:15.780> grain<00:03:16.110> accumulate<00:03:16.890> some<00:03:17.130> moisture

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
the grain accumulate some moisture

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.340 
the grain accumulate some moisture
naturally<00:03:18.120> through<00:03:18.630> humidity<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.260> air

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
naturally through humidity in the air

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.320 
naturally through humidity in the air
and<00:03:20.070> there's<00:03:20.190> nothing<00:03:20.519> wrong<00:03:20.670> with<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.060> that

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
and there's nothing wrong with that that

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.210 
and there's nothing wrong with that that
could<00:03:21.720> be<00:03:21.750> done<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.470> most<00:03:22.650> farmers<00:03:22.980> aren't

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
could be done but most farmers aren't

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.860 
could be done but most farmers aren't
going<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.489> do<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.640> they<00:03:23.970> want<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.269> store<00:03:24.540> grain

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
going to do that they want a store grain

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.320 
going to do that they want a store grain
that's<00:03:25.230> dry<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.010> grain<00:03:26.310> elevators<00:03:26.850> feel<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
that's dry and grain elevators feel the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.030 
that's dry and grain elevators feel the
same<00:03:27.570> way<00:03:27.780> okay<00:03:28.230> let's<00:03:28.500> take<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.769> different

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
same way okay let's take a different

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.340 
same way okay let's take a different
angle<00:03:29.370> here<00:03:29.790> with<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.239> wind<00:03:30.630> can<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.930> harvest

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
angle here with the wind can you harvest

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.710 
angle here with the wind can you harvest
thing<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.890> go<00:03:32.070> out<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.790> soybean<00:03:33.269> field

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
thing if you go out in a soybean field

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.690 
thing if you go out in a soybean field
for<00:03:34.019> example<00:03:34.470> early<00:03:34.830> in<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> morning<00:03:35.370> there's

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
for example early in the morning there's

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.400 
for example early in the morning there's
a<00:03:35.790> lot<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.120> moisture<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.630> even<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.170> morning

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
a lot of moisture like even this morning

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.020 
a lot of moisture like even this morning
when<00:03:37.769> we're<00:03:37.890> out<00:03:38.010> here<00:03:38.220> my<00:03:38.430> shoes<00:03:38.670> are<00:03:38.910> getting

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
when we're out here my shoes are getting

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.270 
when we're out here my shoes are getting
wet<00:03:39.330> there's<00:03:39.570> do<00:03:39.840> well<00:03:40.200> with<00:03:40.620> soybeans

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
wet there's do well with soybeans

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.340 
wet there's do well with soybeans
they're<00:03:41.700> very<00:03:42.150> particular<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:43.110> when<00:03:43.260> they

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
they're very particular and when they

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.840 
they're very particular and when they
can<00:03:43.500> be<00:03:43.620> harvested<00:03:43.860> because<00:03:44.250> you've<00:03:44.550> got<00:03:44.700> to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
can be harvested because you've got to

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.060 
can be harvested because you've got to
break<00:03:45.180> open<00:03:45.360> those<00:03:45.690> pods<00:03:46.050> and<00:03:46.470> get<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.800> seeds

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
break open those pods and get the seeds

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.130 
break open those pods and get the seeds
out<00:03:47.220> that's<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.000> purpose<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.540> combine<00:03:48.989> is

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
out that's the purpose of the combine is

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.990 
out that's the purpose of the combine is
to<00:03:49.260> break<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.560> pods<00:03:49.739> open<00:03:49.950> get<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> seeds<00:03:50.610> out

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
to break the pods open get the seeds out

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.580 
to break the pods open get the seeds out
you<00:03:51.120> can't<00:03:51.360> break<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.720> pods<00:03:51.989> very<00:03:52.350> well

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
you can't break the pods very well

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.710 
you can't break the pods very well
though<00:03:52.800> if<00:03:53.010> they're<00:03:53.220> damp<00:03:53.519> so<00:03:53.910> typically<00:03:54.450> with

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
though if they're damp so typically with

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.570 
though if they're damp so typically with
soybeans<00:03:55.170> on<00:03:55.350> our<00:03:55.470> farm<00:03:55.739> we<00:03:55.980> never<00:03:56.190> start

soybeans on our farm we never start

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.370 
soybeans on our farm we never start
harvesting<00:03:56.880> soybeans<00:03:57.540> tell<00:03:57.810> about<00:03:57.989> 11

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
harvesting soybeans tell about 11

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.780 
harvesting soybeans tell about 11
o'clock<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.920> morning<00:03:59.310> or<00:03:59.519> maybe<00:03:59.700> even

o'clock in the morning or maybe even

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.170 
o'clock in the morning or maybe even
noon<00:04:00.269> somedays<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.500> things<00:04:01.950> dry<00:04:02.400> out<00:04:02.670> the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
noon somedays so things dry out the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.570 
noon somedays so things dry out the
humidity<00:04:03.690> goes<00:04:04.140> down<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.920> we<00:04:05.070> can<00:04:05.220> actually

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
humidity goes down and we can actually

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.610 
humidity goes down and we can actually
split<00:04:05.880> open<00:04:06.239> those<00:04:06.390> bean<00:04:06.660> pods<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.440> bean

split open those bean pods and the bean

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.680 
split open those bean pods and the bean
seed<00:04:07.920> comes<00:04:08.310> out<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:08.760> very<00:04:09.000> often<00:04:09.390> in<00:04:09.570> the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
seed comes out and very often in the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.590 
seed comes out and very often in the
evening<00:04:10.049> we<00:04:10.200> have<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.530> shutdown<00:04:10.799> at<00:04:11.340> 8<00:04:11.700> 9<00:04:12.060> 10

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
evening we have to shutdown at 8 9 10

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.910 
evening we have to shutdown at 8 9 10
o'clock<00:04:12.840> at<00:04:13.080> night<00:04:13.110> something<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:13.769> that

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
o'clock at night something like that

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.800 
o'clock at night something like that
when<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.220> dew<00:04:14.400> starts<00:04:14.760> coming<00:04:15.060> back<00:04:15.239> on<00:04:15.450> so<00:04:15.720> it

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
when the dew starts coming back on so it

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.300 
when the dew starts coming back on so it
is<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> little<00:04:16.200> tricky<00:04:16.410> well<00:04:16.859> here's<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.250> other

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
is a little tricky well here's the other

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.030 
is a little tricky well here's the other
side<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.910> too<00:04:18.470> sometimes<00:04:19.470> we<00:04:19.709> like<00:04:19.890> the

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
side of that too sometimes we like the

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.070 
side of that too sometimes we like the
harvest<00:04:20.459> when<00:04:20.729> grain<00:04:21.030> is<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.359> little<00:04:21.720> bit<00:04:21.870> too

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
harvest when grain is a little bit too

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.260 
harvest when grain is a little bit too
wet<00:04:22.320> let's<00:04:22.740> take<00:04:22.919> soybeans<00:04:23.400> for<00:04:23.640> example<00:04:24.060> once

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
wet let's take soybeans for example once

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.440 
wet let's take soybeans for example once
they<00:04:24.479> get<00:04:24.690> down<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.930> about<00:04:25.350> 14%<00:04:25.919> moisture<00:04:26.880> for

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
they get down to about 14% moisture for

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.990 
they get down to about 14% moisture for
we<00:04:27.810> say<00:04:28.020> boy<00:04:28.230> soybeans<00:04:29.100> can<00:04:29.280> really<00:04:29.580> dry<00:04:29.820> down

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
we say boy soybeans can really dry down

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.390 
we say boy soybeans can really dry down
fast<00:04:30.390> in<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.720> field<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.110> could<00:04:31.230> be<00:04:31.380> 14%<00:04:31.830> in<00:04:32.310> the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
fast in the field it could be 14% in the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.710 
fast in the field it could be 14% in the
morning<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:32.880> by<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.060> end<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.390> the<00:04:33.450> day<00:04:33.600> it

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
morning and by the end of the day it

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.990 
morning and by the end of the day it
could<00:04:33.870> be<00:04:33.930> down<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.380> 10<00:04:34.590> or<00:04:34.620> 11%<00:04:35.100> on<00:04:35.670> a<00:04:35.700> hot

could be down to 10 or 11% on a hot
sunny<00:04:36.450> day<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.080> we<00:04:37.260> want<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.560> get<00:04:37.680> out<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.100> get

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
sunny day so we want to get out and get

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.190 
sunny day so we want to get out and get
started<00:04:38.520> even<00:04:38.940> if<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.300> beans<00:04:39.510> are<00:04:39.780> just<00:04:40.080> a

little<00:04:40.410> bit<00:04:40.620> too<00:04:40.950> moist<00:04:41.220> early<00:04:41.970> in<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.180> day<00:04:42.360> we

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
little bit too moist early in the day we

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.390 
little bit too moist early in the day we
know<00:04:43.080> we're<00:04:43.290> gonna<00:04:43.410> get<00:04:43.620> docked<00:04:43.920> when<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.280> go

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
know we're gonna get docked when you go

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.190 
know we're gonna get docked when you go
to<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.610> elevator<00:04:45.000> but<00:04:45.300> we'll<00:04:45.540> pencil<00:04:46.050> that

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
to the elevator but we'll pencil that

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.020 
to the elevator but we'll pencil that
out<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.560> figure<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.950> know<00:04:47.070> what<00:04:47.100> if<00:04:47.490> we<00:04:47.820> lose

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
out and figure you know what if we lose

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.690 
out and figure you know what if we lose
5<00:04:48.420> or<00:04:48.600> 6<00:04:48.840> cents<00:04:49.170> here<00:04:49.380> or<00:04:49.530> maybe<00:04:49.710> 10<00:04:50.010> cents<00:04:50.400> here

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
5 or 6 cents here or maybe 10 cents here

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.940 
5 or 6 cents here or maybe 10 cents here
I'm<00:04:50.910> gonna<00:04:51.150> pick<00:04:51.420> it<00:04:51.450> up<00:04:51.690> by<00:04:51.990> not<00:04:52.230> losing<00:04:52.680> that

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
I'm gonna pick it up by not losing that

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.590 
I'm gonna pick it up by not losing that
extra<00:04:53.310> moisture<00:04:53.460> later<00:04:53.880> in<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.150> day<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:54.330> I'm

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
extra moisture later in the day so I'm

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.000 
extra moisture later in the day so I'm
gonna<00:04:54.660> go<00:04:54.900> ahead<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.110> get<00:04:55.320> started<00:04:55.500> on<00:04:55.890> the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
gonna go ahead and get started on the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.640 
gonna go ahead and get started on the
early<00:04:56.340> side<00:04:56.370> just<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.390> don't<00:04:57.540> lose<00:04:58.170> too<00:04:58.500> much

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
early side just so I don't lose too much

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.650 
early side just so I don't lose too much
on<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.950> back<00:04:59.100> as<00:04:59.580> long<00:04:59.880> as<00:05:00.060> we<00:05:00.180> can<00:05:00.270> open<00:05:00.420> up

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
on the back as long as we can open up

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.240 
on the back as long as we can open up
those<00:05:00.870> pods<00:05:01.170> and<00:05:01.470> that's<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.830> whole<00:05:01.980> trick

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
those pods and that's the whole trick

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.400 
those pods and that's the whole trick
every<00:05:02.790> crop<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.330> little<00:05:03.660> bit<00:05:03.810> different<00:05:04.230> so

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
every crop is a little bit different so

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.020 
every crop is a little bit different so
when<00:05:04.620> we<00:05:04.740> talk<00:05:04.920> about<00:05:04.950> wind<00:05:05.430> harvest

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
when we talk about wind harvest

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.910 
when we talk about wind harvest
obviously<00:05:06.600> when<00:05:07.020> we<00:05:07.170> get<00:05:07.320> down<00:05:07.470> towards<00:05:07.830> the

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
obviously when we get down towards the

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.380 
obviously when we get down towards the
end<00:05:07.950> of<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.220> season<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.640> whole<00:05:08.820> plant<00:05:09.180> is

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
end of the season the whole plant is

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.120 
end of the season the whole plant is
going<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.690> be<00:05:09.870> dying<00:05:10.170> what's<00:05:10.530> happening<00:05:11.010> in

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
going to be dying what's happening in

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.280 
going to be dying what's happening in
that<00:05:11.160> plant<00:05:11.550> it's<00:05:11.760> maturing<00:05:12.420> every<00:05:12.720> plant<00:05:13.140> is

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
that plant it's maturing every plant is

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.320 
that plant it's maturing every plant is
cannibalistic<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.220> takes<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.580> energy<00:05:15.060> out<00:05:15.270> of

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
cannibalistic it takes the energy out of

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.780 
cannibalistic it takes the energy out of
the<00:05:15.720> stem<00:05:16.200> out<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.860> roots<00:05:17.190> out<00:05:17.520> of<00:05:17.610> the

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
the stem out of the roots out of the

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.900 
the stem out of the roots out of the
leaves<00:05:18.030> puts<00:05:18.750> it<00:05:18.960> into<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.530> seed<00:05:19.890> and<00:05:20.250> when

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
leaves puts it into the seed and when

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.880 
leaves puts it into the seed and when
it's<00:05:21.060> doing<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.900> rest<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.320> plant<00:05:22.620> is

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
it's doing that the rest of the plant is

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.550 
it's doing that the rest of the plant is
dying<00:05:23.250> its<00:05:23.790> shriveling<00:05:24.480> up<00:05:24.630> it's<00:05:24.900> shrinking

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
dying its shriveling up it's shrinking

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.620 
dying its shriveling up it's shrinking
and<00:05:25.770> then<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.640> just<00:05:26.850> have<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.120> get<00:05:27.270> out<00:05:27.390> there

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
and then you just have to get out there

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.810 
and then you just have to get out there
and<00:05:27.780> harvest<00:05:28.170> when<00:05:28.530> you<00:05:28.860> feel<00:05:29.190> it's<00:05:29.430> fit<00:05:29.640> on

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
and harvest when you feel it's fit on

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.550 
and harvest when you feel it's fit on
your<00:05:30.030> farm<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.570> every<00:05:30.780> farmer<00:05:31.110> has<00:05:31.290> to<00:05:31.320> go

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
your farm and every farmer has to go

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.020 
your farm and every farmer has to go
through<00:05:31.770> this<00:05:31.950> and<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.220> know<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.700> other<00:05:32.790> big

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
through this and you know the other big

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.640 
through this and you know the other big
issue<00:05:33.180> we've<00:05:33.420> got<00:05:33.600> is<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:33.990> can't<00:05:34.260> harvest

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
issue we've got is you can't harvest

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.770 
issue we've got is you can't harvest
everything<00:05:35.160> in<00:05:35.280> one<00:05:35.460> day<00:05:35.490> I<00:05:36.030> mean<00:05:36.480> unless<00:05:36.600> you

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
everything in one day I mean unless you

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.510 
everything in one day I mean unless you
only<00:05:36.900> have<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.140> few<00:05:37.380> acres<00:05:37.560> so<00:05:38.040> you've<00:05:38.280> got<00:05:38.430> to

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
only have a few acres so you've got to

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.830 
only have a few acres so you've got to
kind<00:05:38.700> of<00:05:38.760> pick<00:05:38.910> and<00:05:39.060> choose<00:05:39.120> in<00:05:39.450> other<00:05:39.600> words

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
kind of pick and choose in other words

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.020 
kind of pick and choose in other words
there's<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.350> lot<00:05:40.530> of<00:05:40.650> art<00:05:40.890> to<00:05:40.950> this<00:05:41.280> rather<00:05:41.820> than

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
there's a lot of art to this rather than

there's a lot of art to this rather than
science<00:05:42.660> and<00:05:42.900> there<00:05:43.740> are<00:05:43.860> a<00:05:43.890> lot<00:05:44.070> of<00:05:44.100> factors

science and there are a lot of factors
that<00:05:44.610> come<00:05:44.880> into<00:05:44.940> play<00:05:45.330> but<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.930> whole<00:05:46.110> thing

that come into play but the whole thing

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.200 
that come into play but the whole thing
is<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.950> farmer<00:05:47.280> wants<00:05:47.400> to<00:05:47.610> get<00:05:47.700> his<00:05:47.790> crop<00:05:48.000> off
