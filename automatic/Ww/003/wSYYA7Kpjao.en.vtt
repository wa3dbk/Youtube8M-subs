don't know what's up with that I wish
they<00:03:13.920> would<00:03:14.040> kind<00:03:14.159> of<00:03:14.310> fix<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.140> glitching<00:03:16.140> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
they would kind of fix the glitching the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.020 
they would kind of fix the glitching the
glitchyness<00:03:16.920> with<00:03:17.099> that<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:17.519> it's<00:03:17.730> whatever

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
glitchyness with that but it's whatever

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.059 
glitchyness with that but it's whatever
I<00:03:18.239> mean<00:03:18.419> it's<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.109> good<00:03:19.230> capture<00:03:19.590> device<00:03:19.829> still

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
I mean it's a good capture device still

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.640 
I mean it's a good capture device still
but<00:03:20.459> sometimes<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.810> software<00:03:22.319> kind<00:03:22.590> of

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
but sometimes the the software kind of

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.559 
but sometimes the the software kind of
messes<00:03:22.889> up<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.340> whatever<00:03:24.180> they<00:03:24.419> should

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
messes up on you whatever they should

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.860 
messes up on you whatever they should
fix<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:26.180> yeah<00:03:27.180> that's<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.450> video<00:03:27.569> guys
