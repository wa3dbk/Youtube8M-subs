 remove polyclinic conditions during 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.350
 teething lower wisdom teeth when 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.720
 visible only part of the tooth often occur 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.120
 purulent inflammations in the resulting 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.269
 Pocket hood between the gum and the tooth 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.400

 wisdom takes wrong 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.870
 position and growing with a slope or 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.910
 horizontally wisdom tooth 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.450
 leave alone if he takes 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.470
 correct position in other cases 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.100
 recommended it as early as possible 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.220
 remove
