00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:08.590
 Hello everyone, the topic is about 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:11.370
 variator slider why is behind them 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.720
 need to follow and as far as possible 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.750
 I decided to tell them to change because 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.550
 I also faced this problem by 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.390
 ignorance 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.770
 I thought I would ride on these 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.460
 what they are well, that is, and worn 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.470
 Well 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.469
 not here it was briefly tell 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.480
 I had backstory once honda 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.720
 lead from 06 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.530
 well that is 100 cubes Here's a well 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.750
 and I decided it so little podtyunit well 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.730
 there to make an entry on the variator 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.980
 but here you can see the tracks a little under 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.480
 the shroud and when I sawed these here 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.940
 tracks on the principle 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.760
 I noticed that I have a slider 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:03.790
 dangling in their seat and 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:06.130
 the bar so pretty worn decided they didn't 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.120
 change nothing with them for what and 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.490
 then I paid for it 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.909
 one same variator is also the same 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.500
 the story itself and that's what happens when 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.640
 breaks down the variator slide starts 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.990
 gnaw the variator guides 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:34.390
 pretty very fast and very 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:36.549
 strongly because there is no slider and all this 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.140
 business starts 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:45.280
 I have the same terrace 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.430
 happened but decided to go service in order 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.430
 me here these 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.189
 seasoned tracks like brewed but 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.990
 I will tell you that this is also not an option because 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:02.490
 how after I brewed the track 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.980
 Well, that is, those grooves that the spider did 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.250
 Well, as you can see such welding 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.460
 disputes let's say so if you are this thing 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.650
 fast kill slider butter mountain i 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.550
 of course also changed the original well, 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.390
 I could not get it and put the slider from 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.810
 chinese 150 key 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.450
 Well, as you can see from the slider too 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.600
 very decently devoured sliders in general 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.710
 no , my dad cracked 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.450
 this is one left alive it was already decided 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.580
 look for a new variator 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.370
 Well, I found a new online store 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.590
 CVT was written that this is jeff but 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.430
 Fortunately, everything is as it should be, but 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.410
 the size was much smaller and the belt he 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.170
 did not push the tracks to the end 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.080
 also there was no opportunity was not like 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.080
 then it was decided to install the variator from 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.840
 Chinese 150 ki variator called 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.470
 somehow dh the film would be more here 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.880
 such a ledge 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.050
 but he was not honed and he became shorter 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.020
 I installed this variator canteens perfectly 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.110
 he had a slightly different angle 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.920
 but as if the belt is not twisted all 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:25.180
 it was good so guys recommend 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.850
 pay attention to the slider because 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.380
 with the lace of this thing is not very 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.920
 nice here is such an original 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.930
 CVT is very hard to get if he 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.820
 he must as a rule have it too 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.370
 cars well , I have so far all hope 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.600
 This video was useful because 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.600
 always all bye
