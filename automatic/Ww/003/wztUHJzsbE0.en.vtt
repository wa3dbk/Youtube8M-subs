00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.480
 hello to all and get spartan and we get 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.230
 find for a new video tips 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.199
 on minecraft 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.390
 so I talked to you about how 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.009
 we repair our armor in mesh size 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.230
 so I showed you the trick to 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.589
 know how to repair it so we 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.239
 only returns to normal view so we 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:38.680
 you know there is already the technique of re 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.040
 to merge two weapons will be the same 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.080
 to fix it like this or care 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.250
 to go on the anvil 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.470
 in ten years but on his armor that has 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.440
 possibly to sing like this 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.340
 the one I am currently using 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.870
 to use the job better for the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.850
 fix it right it does not work like art 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.309
 because the armor and fused durability 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.710
 but otherwise it works if not for the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.719
 repair like that but there is also a 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.789
 another way to repair his is also 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.050
 his favorite armor that we speak for me 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.570
 that I ate used an army in hill 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.100
 mesh because those for the swag in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.259
 does even though it's true she's 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.240
 less effective than fully armor 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.640
 as you see on the numbers of 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.950
 armor protection but it's just 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.250
 for fun for the swag knows more where 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.140
 it's more classy so now it 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.569
 there is another way to repair it I 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.340
 will show you and a bus and 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.319
 techniques exist since 1.4.2 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.550
 since the appearance of the anvil so 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.830
 simply for the same stop 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.500
 foolishness and m because the party in the 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.119
 damaged wall and he used it for the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.849
 to fix ben is simply with 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.130
 iron simply want to repair to 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:46.440
 25% for an ingot 50% for 2 etc etc 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.270
 it's as simple as that to repair 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.550
 when you see I 10.3 the words and my 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.319
 armor and fused durability like that 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.349
 it's true that it's more 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:04.030
 easy to now to have armor 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:07.270
 in banco of evil than before because before 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.379
 is that it was more difficult because 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.190
 do you remember that the armies in 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.509
 mesh rating we can get them 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.190
 only through the features of 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.770
 villagers or be added by a 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.569
 zombie or by a skeleton 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.780
 so if you ever if you like you 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.190
 have an armor of a fetish well here 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.440
 the way how to fix it with 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.850
 only iron instead of using 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.500
 fire than normally 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.480
