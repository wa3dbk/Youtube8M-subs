00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.130 

the<00:00:00.240> favorites<00:00:00.690> are<00:00:00.810> obvious<00:00:01.170> with<00:00:01.829> Brazil<00:00:02.250> I

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.140 
the favorites are obvious with Brazil I

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.710 
the favorites are obvious with Brazil I
think<00:00:04.460> at<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.580> moment<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:06.089> Europe<00:00:06.359> it's<00:00:06.480> hard

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
think at the moment in Europe it's hard

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.810 
think at the moment in Europe it's hard
I<00:00:06.810> don't<00:00:06.960> think<00:00:07.109> there's<00:00:07.230> one<00:00:07.259> but<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.280> favorite

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
I don't think there's one but a favorite

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.190 
I don't think there's one but a favorite
team<00:00:08.970> but<00:00:09.120> there's<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.450> lot<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.599> great<00:00:09.900> teams

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
team but there's a lot of great teams

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.150 
team but there's a lot of great teams
but<00:00:10.500> none<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.429> them<00:00:11.610> are<00:00:12.590> probably<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.740> great

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
but none of them are probably in great

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.799 
but none of them are probably in great
form<00:00:14.519> right<00:00:14.670> now<00:00:14.849> but<00:00:15.089> you'd<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> say

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
form right now but you'd have to say

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.140 
form right now but you'd have to say
teams<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.410> England<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.550> France<00:00:17.730> and

teams like England and France and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.900 
teams like England and France and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
really believe I European teams gonna

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.179 
really believe I European teams gonna
wear<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.609> year<00:00:30.650> it's<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.740> bigger<00:00:31.949> advantage

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
wear this year it's a bigger advantage

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.450 
wear this year it's a bigger advantage
then<00:00:33.260> people<00:00:34.260> make<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
then people make it out to be with you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.049 
then people make it out to be with you
and<00:00:36.320> for<00:00:37.320> some<00:00:37.469> reason<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.890> time<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.730> know

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
and for some reason this time I know

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910 
and for some reason this time I know
Holland<00:00:39.600> always<00:00:39.960> seems<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.320> choke<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.770> big

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Holland always seems to choke in big

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.500 
Holland always seems to choke in big
tournaments<00:00:41.100> works<00:00:41.610> always<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.420> they

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
tournaments works always I think they

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.020 
tournaments works always I think they
have<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.160> consistency<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.399> time<00:00:44.610> around<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
have the consistency this time around to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.319 
have the consistency this time around to
do<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> no<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> Dutch<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.300> Czech<00:00:48.300> Republic

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
do it no the Dutch the Czech Republic

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.330 
do it no the Dutch the Czech Republic
qualifiers<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:49.649> they're<00:00:49.860> they're<00:00:50.219> gonna

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
qualifiers I think they're they're gonna

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.970 
qualifiers I think they're they're gonna
have<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> good<00:00:50.640> shot<00:00:50.879> obviously<00:00:51.390> brazil<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.800> i

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
have a good shot obviously brazil and i

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
have a good shot obviously brazil and i
think<00:00:53.250> those<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.449> Germans<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:54.989> gonna<00:00:55.079> do

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
think those the Germans are gonna do

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.619 
think those the Germans are gonna do
very<00:00:55.590> well<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.100> even<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.879> Germany's<00:00:57.239> chances

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
very well I even like Germany's chances

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.420 
very well I even like Germany's chances
for<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.320> reason<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.710> always<00:00:58.980> turn<00:00:59.129> around

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
for some reason they always turn around

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.650 
for some reason they always turn around
in<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.609> turn

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
in a turn

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
in a turn
and<00:01:00.810> they<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.340> more<00:01:02.340> luck<00:01:02.610> than<00:01:02.640> any<00:01:03.060> country

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and they have more luck than any country

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.479 
and they have more luck than any country
on<00:01:03.540> this<00:01:03.690> planet<00:01:03.780> when<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.800> comes<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.280> soccer

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
on this planet when it comes to soccer

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.480 
on this planet when it comes to soccer
tournament<00:01:06.080> hold<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.229> zoo<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
tournament hold on zoo and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.260 
tournament hold on zoo and
obviously<00:01:09.390> Brazil<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.549> think

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
obviously Brazil I see up there I think

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.810 
obviously Brazil I see up there I think
maybe<00:01:12.450> Italy<00:01:13.290> hasn't<00:01:13.680> shown<00:01:13.920> too<00:01:14.250> well<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
maybe Italy hasn't shown too well in the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.570 
maybe Italy hasn't shown too well in the
past<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:16.290> European<00:01:16.619> Championship<00:01:17.100> woke<00:01:17.310> up

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
past the European Championship woke up

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.940 
past the European Championship woke up
but<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.840> very<00:01:18.869> good<00:01:19.170> team<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.649> think

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
but they have very good team I think

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.830 
but they have very good team I think
they<00:01:20.100> should<00:01:20.420> they<00:01:21.420> should<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.659> very<00:01:21.750> well

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
they should they should do very well

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.870 
they should they should do very well
it's<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.799> same<00:01:23.039> list<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> would<00:01:23.729> always

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's the same list that you would always

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
it's the same list that you would always
have<00:01:24.149> I<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.450> your<00:01:24.600> Brazil's<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.259> Germany

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
have I think your Brazil's your Germany

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.810 
have I think your Brazil's your Germany
or<00:01:25.799> France<00:01:26.009> even<00:01:26.520> though<00:01:26.580> they<00:01:26.759> were

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
or France even though they were

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.109 
or France even though they were
lackluster<00:01:27.090> last<00:01:27.659> time<00:01:27.840> around<00:01:28.939> you'd<00:01:29.939> like

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
lackluster last time around you'd like

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.639 
lackluster last time around you'd like
to<00:01:30.270> probably<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> better<00:01:31.020> performance<00:01:31.500> out

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
to probably see a better performance out

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.810 
to probably see a better performance out
of<00:01:31.710> Argentina<00:01:32.039> but<00:01:34.039> in<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.250> end<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.580> think

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
of Argentina but in the end I think

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.880 
of Argentina but in the end I think
you've<00:01:36.330> got<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.689> staples<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.289> those<00:01:37.710> guys

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
you've got your staples and those guys

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.950 
you've got your staples and those guys
always<00:01:38.189> seem<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.610> hold<00:01:38.789> up<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.149> that's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
always seem to hold up because that's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.779

croatia<00:03:04.160> as<00:03:04.370> well<00:03:04.550> it<00:03:04.820> seems<00:03:05.030> like<00:03:05.120> there's<00:03:05.300> a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
croatia as well it seems like there's a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.550 
croatia as well it seems like there's a
lot<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.510> new<00:03:05.690> countries<00:03:06.140> in<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.380> this<00:03:06.500> time

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
lot of new countries in it this time

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.240 
lot of new countries in it this time
obviously<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.610> African<00:03:08.000> countries<00:03:08.390> are<00:03:08.540> are

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
obviously the African countries are are

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.710 
obviously the African countries are are
fairly<00:03:10.250> new<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.550> it<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.030> those<00:03:11.510> are<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:11.690> think

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
fairly new to it and those are I think

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.030 
fairly new to it and those are I think
of<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.020> ones<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.200> can<00:03:12.380> surprise<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.860> most

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
of the ones that can surprise the most

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.800 
of the ones that can surprise the most
because<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.430> never<00:03:13.550> know<00:03:13.670> what<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.210> get<00:03:14.420> what

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
because you never know what to get what

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.480 
because you never know what to get what
to<00:03:14.930> expect<00:03:15.230> sorry<00:03:15.800> about<00:03:15.890> today<00:03:16.100> your<00:03:16.310> head<00:03:16.460> I

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
to expect sorry about today your head I

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.670 
to expect sorry about today your head I
think<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:16.880> I'm<00:03:17.240> 33<00:03:17.870> goals<00:03:18.080> for<00:03:18.380> under<00:03:18.650> the

think that I'm 33 goals for under the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.290 
think that I'm 33 goals for under the
qualification<00:03:19.340> process<00:03:19.490> which<00:03:19.940> was<00:03:20.090> pretty

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
qualification process which was pretty

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.870 
qualification process which was pretty
amazing<00:03:20.890> very<00:03:21.890> strong<00:03:22.100> team<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.400> don't<00:03:22.640> think
