at<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.629> same<00:03:30.749> time<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:32.489> if<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.790> create

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
at the same time can you so if I create

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.539 
at the same time can you so if I create
suspicion<00:03:33.469> then<00:03:34.469> it<00:03:34.620> becomes<00:03:34.950> easy<00:03:35.159> to<00:03:35.280> talk

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
suspicion then it becomes easy to talk

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.920 
suspicion then it becomes easy to talk
you<00:03:35.670> out<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.819> this<00:03:35.939> yeah<00:03:36.689> but<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.349> know<00:03:37.469> what

you out of this yeah but you know what

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.880 
you out of this yeah but you know what
maybe<00:03:39.930> it's<00:03:40.140> not<00:03:40.200> sleight<00:03:40.439> of<00:03:40.469> hand<00:03:40.709> proof

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
maybe it's not sleight of hand proof

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.989 
maybe it's not sleight of hand proof
like<00:03:41.099> that<00:03:41.249> and<00:03:41.430> that's<00:03:41.549> what<00:03:41.670> you're<00:03:41.790> worried

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:41.999 
like that and that's what you're worried

like that and that's what you're worried
about

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
about

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.449 
about
right<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.109> was<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.290> cover<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.920> shell

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
right but if I was to cover that shell

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.640 
right but if I was to cover that shell
with<00:03:44.700> one<00:03:44.849> of<00:03:44.939> these<00:03:45.090> which<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.689> one<00:03:46.560> of

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
with one of these which is a one of

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.649 
with one of these which is a one of
these<00:03:46.769> cuantas<00:03:47.280> economy<00:03:47.909> trays<00:03:50.510> then<00:03:51.510> it's

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
these cuantas economy trays then it's

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.259 
these cuantas economy trays then it's
lighter<00:03:51.870> hand<00:03:52.049> proof<00:03:52.609> sleight<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.639> hand<00:03:54.030> proof

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
lighter hand proof sleight of hand proof

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.899 
lighter hand proof sleight of hand proof
can't<00:03:54.659> get<00:03:54.840> at<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.040> so<00:03:56.040> it's<00:03:56.159> impossible<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.760> be

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
can't get at it so it's impossible to be

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.449 
can't get at it so it's impossible to be
anywhere<00:03:57.299> else<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:57.959> there<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:58.769> this

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
anywhere else but there it's there this

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.550 
anywhere else but there it's there this
one<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.819> course<00:03:59.849> is<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.389> empty<00:04:00.689> one<00:04:00.840> right

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
one of course is the empty one right

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.580 
one of course is the empty one right
that's<00:04:02.249> a<00:04:02.540> matter<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.629> fact<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.930> can<00:04:04.079> see<00:04:04.349> that

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
that's a matter of fact you can see that

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.800 
that's a matter of fact you can see that
it's<00:04:04.739> empty<00:04:04.859> right<00:04:07.999> and<00:04:08.999> all<00:04:09.359> I<00:04:09.389> wants<00:04:09.629> you<00:04:09.719> to
