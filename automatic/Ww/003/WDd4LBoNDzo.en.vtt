00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.720

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.870
 almost at the end of the consultation and positive 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.380
 written questions 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.150
 that his father if he forgets some lost questions have been exposed and by 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.860

 to this mother 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.179
 the conditions of breastfeeding 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:16.319
 this mother can not breastfeed a baby on her lap answering the phone in another

 cleaning the house and doing the dishes and working 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.779
 someone needs to overcome 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.619
 this mother of conditions so that she has 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.209

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.299
 problem a child that this problem over time 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.799
 Let's support again, right? 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.379
 many grandparents have heard have spoken this phrase child who repudiates 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.329
 fattening 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.189
 then it means that the child makes us know that this healthy child 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.969
 She needs to grow up, she has to throw milk out. 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.820
 so there is one with a differential that this end is important 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.489
 one thing 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.700
 gastroesophageal reflux 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.139

 and there is another thing that is godfather indicted scrap South Asian sofas 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.639
 We have to try, it's no problem. 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.969
 what bush to dictate 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.289
 throwing some milk out is no problem until the eighth ninth month to 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.870
 kid 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.480
 can have this kind of attitude without it representing patients 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.859
 the medical consultation the monitoring of the height of this duty 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.760
 the Pope preventing other types of problems that may appear problems 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.989

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.229
 the presence of reflux disease 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:01.109
 once and suspected voice of the disease we will forward this debate some 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.749
 Renan examinations through these examinations will see if there is 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:10.329
 reflux or not in itself this reflux disease 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.549
 can only be taken care of with the club this feeding deposition 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.539
 expelled shortly after the baby sucks 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.289
 put the baby 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.770
 he does not lie down and then wait for the baby to put a tip 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.930
 interesting if you lost your baby on your lap 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.150
 two minutes to see if he comes back 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.360
 did not come back to the elite for a minute 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.349
 lift two more minutes 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.470
 5 minutes and not only stay one hour 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.639
 singing and the baby some abortion others not 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.580
 position to lie down then it is also clear that it is debatable that people who 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.570
 He says that he puts him upside down. 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.580
 To avoid certain risks, others put them downside down. 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.389
 that will happen to the deputy but to happen 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.499
 is the output of the dean should stay focused on it 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:57.389
 there is no weapon 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.610

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.590
 to all babies that reduces then each case will be the case 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.220
 in some situations medication is necessary in some situations until 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.099
 surgery 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.020
 then subtract 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.089
 this baby is born with a shield is not born born with that certainty 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.509
 before it will trigger or not 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.819

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.340
 the man in britain 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.500
 It's what's going to tell us to stop. 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.030
 The moment or not I swear I saw 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.909
 in this evolution
