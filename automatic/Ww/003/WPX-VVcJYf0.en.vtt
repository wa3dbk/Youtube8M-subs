this<00:02:10.030> review<00:02:10.270> I'm<00:02:10.390> going<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.570> do<00:02:10.690> XP<00:02:11.410> update

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
this review I'm going to do XP update

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.120 
this review I'm going to do XP update
but<00:02:13.060> now<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:13.480> very<00:02:13.600> important<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.920> do

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
but now it is very important that you do

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.560 
but now it is very important that you do
dot<00:02:15.610> R<00:02:16.170> eg<00:02:17.170> at<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.920> end<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.760> file<00:02:19.030> name<00:02:19.330> as

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
dot R eg at the end of the file name as

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.920 
dot R eg at the end of the file name as
this<00:02:20.410> will<00:02:20.710> transport<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.820> registry<00:02:22.270> key<00:02:22.600> to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
this will transport the registry key to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.050 
this will transport the registry key to
the<00:02:23.020> registry<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.710> if<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.610> don't<00:02:24.760> do<00:02:24.910> this

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
the registry and if you don't do this

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.810 
the registry and if you don't do this
properly<00:02:25.780> if<00:02:26.020> you<00:02:26.080> don't<00:02:26.230> add<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.410> dot<00:02:26.770> or<00:02:27.010> eg

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
properly if you don't add the dot or eg

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.720 
properly if you don't add the dot or eg
it<00:02:28.060> will<00:02:28.330> not<00:02:28.570> work<00:02:28.960> so<00:02:29.260> let's<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.460> make<00:02:30.700> sure

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730

little registry modification and they

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.470 
little registry modification and they

these updates to Windows XP machines

these updates to Windows XP machines
that<00:06:36.370> have<00:06:36.460> already<00:06:36.670> passed<00:06:37.030> their

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.990 
modification I haven't seen any problems
so<00:06:46.930> if<00:06:47.380> you<00:06:47.680> are<00:06:47.890> really<00:06:48.190> inclined<00:06:48.550> using

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
so if you are really inclined using

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.690 
so if you are really inclined using
Windows<00:06:49.270> XP<00:06:49.560> which<00:06:50.560> personally<00:06:51.100> from<00:06:51.520> a

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
Windows XP which personally from a

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.250 
Windows XP which personally from a
security<00:06:52.150> standpoint<00:06:52.390> I<00:06:52.690> want<00:06:52.900> to<00:06:52.990> recommend

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
security standpoint I want to recommend

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.830 
security standpoint I want to recommend
I<00:06:53.710> think<00:06:54.100> they're<00:06:54.190> safer<00:06:54.880> operating<00:06:55.480> systems

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
I think they're safer operating systems

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.190 
I think they're safer operating systems
out<00:06:56.020> there<00:06:56.250> but<00:06:57.250> I'm<00:06:57.520> not<00:06:57.580> trying<00:06:58.210> to<00:06:58.540> preach

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
out there but I'm not trying to preach

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.380 
out there but I'm not trying to preach
to<00:06:59.440> anybody<00:06:59.500> if<00:07:00.070> people<00:07:00.790> are<00:07:00.910> content<00:07:01.240> with

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.390 
to anybody if people are content with

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.540 
to anybody if people are content with
using<00:07:01.810> Windows<00:07:02.110> XP<00:07:02.290> I'm<00:07:02.800> not<00:07:03.010> going<00:07:03.220> to<00:07:03.280> try

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
using Windows XP I'm not going to try

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.510 
using Windows XP I'm not going to try
and<00:07:03.580> say<00:07:04.510> you<00:07:04.570> shouldn't<00:07:04.930> use<00:07:05.200> it<00:07:05.230> but<00:07:05.830> that's

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
and say you shouldn't use it but that's

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.760 
and say you shouldn't use it but that's
just<00:07:06.700> my<00:07:06.880> personal<00:07:07.510> opinion<00:07:07.600> but<00:07:08.260> a<00:07:08.530> lot<00:07:08.740> of

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
just my personal opinion but a lot of

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.520 
just my personal opinion but a lot of
Microsoft<00:07:09.370> patches<00:07:10.030> this<00:07:10.300> I<00:07:10.540> don't<00:07:11.170> see<00:07:11.350> why

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
Microsoft patches this I don't see why

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.320 
Microsoft patches this I don't see why
people<00:07:11.740> won't<00:07:12.040> be<00:07:12.190> receiving<00:07:12.610> updates<00:07:12.760> until

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
people won't be receiving updates until

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.250 
people won't be receiving updates until
2019

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260 
2019

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.410 
2019
and<00:07:14.470> also<00:07:14.890> make<00:07:15.190> sure<00:07:15.400> you<00:07:15.670> set<00:07:15.910> up<00:07:16.000> a<00:07:16.120> system

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.420 
and also make sure you set up a system

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.360 
and also make sure you set up a system
restore<00:07:16.570> point<00:07:17.050> before<00:07:17.140> you<00:07:17.530> make<00:07:17.980> this<00:07:18.130> bride

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
restore point before you make this bride

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.850 
restore point before you make this bride
registry<00:07:18.760> modification<00:07:19.510> it<00:07:19.660> is<00:07:20.290> a<00:07:20.320> little<00:07:20.710> bit

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
registry modification it is a little bit

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.310 
registry modification it is a little bit
tricky<00:07:21.130> to<00:07:21.280> remove<00:07:21.850> it<00:07:22.060> it's<00:07:22.780> not<00:07:23.020> impossible

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.320 
tricky to remove it it's not impossible

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.010 
tricky to remove it it's not impossible
but<00:07:23.710> I<00:07:24.040> would<00:07:24.430> highly<00:07:25.030> suggest<00:07:25.060> setting<00:07:25.780> up<00:07:25.900> a

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020 
but I would highly suggest setting up a

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.780 
but I would highly suggest setting up a
system<00:07:26.290> restore<00:07:26.410> point<00:07:26.920> before<00:07:27.340> doing<00:07:27.550> this

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:27.790 
system restore point before doing this

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.270 
system restore point before doing this
as<00:07:28.050> this<00:07:29.050> does<00:07:29.260> have<00:07:29.440> the<00:07:29.530> potential<00:07:29.830> to<00:07:30.040> break

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 
as this does have the potential to break

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.670 
as this does have the potential to break
your<00:07:30.610> computer<00:07:31.110> but<00:07:32.110> other<00:07:32.380> than<00:07:32.470> that<00:07:32.590> I

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
your computer but other than that I

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.360 
your computer but other than that I
think<00:07:32.920> it's<00:07:33.700> a<00:07:33.760> pretty<00:07:33.970> nice<00:07:34.270> little

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.370 
think it's a pretty nice little

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.400 
think it's a pretty nice little
modification<00:07:36.370> so<00:07:36.729> please<00:07:37.540> like<00:07:37.810> comment<00:07:38.110> and
