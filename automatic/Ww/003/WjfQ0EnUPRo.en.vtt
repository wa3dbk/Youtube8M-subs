00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.870 
are made of plastic this screw is a Torx
20<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.009> happen<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.399> screwing<00:00:32.759> it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
20 bit and you happen to be screwing it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.930 
20 bit and you happen to be screwing it
down<00:00:33.030> into<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.750> hole<00:00:33.809> there<00:00:34.309> well<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.700> you're

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
down into that hole there well if you're

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940 
down into that hole there well if you're
doing<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.390> then<00:00:36.690> all<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.899> sudden<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.680> doesn't

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
doing so then all of a sudden it doesn't

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.610 
doing so then all of a sudden it doesn't
seem<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.460> tight<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> sudden<00:00:39.620> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
seem to be so tight all of a sudden you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.260 
seem to be so tight all of a sudden you
may<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.950> stripped<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> or<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.000> may<00:00:42.149> have

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
may have stripped it or you may have

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.900 
may have stripped it or you may have
broken<00:00:42.600> your<00:00:42.690> screw<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.559> my<00:00:44.280> instance<00:00:44.670> I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
broken your screw off in my instance I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.930 
broken your screw off in my instance I
broke<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.899> screw<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.320> half<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.520> plastic

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
broke the screw in half in the plastic

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.130 
broke the screw in half in the plastic
so<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> had<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:50.149> drill<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:54.140> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
so I had to actually drill it out and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
so I had to actually drill it out and
then<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.469> course<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.860> broke<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> whole<00:00:56.399> piece

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
then of course it broke the whole piece

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.849 
then of course it broke the whole piece
of<00:00:57.030> plastic<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.680> doing

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
of plastic there so what are you doing

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.369 
of plastic there so what are you doing
that<00:00:58.980> instance<00:00:59.370> it's<00:01:00.149> either<00:01:00.329> by<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> whole

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that instance it's either by a whole

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.980 
that instance it's either by a whole
nother<00:01:01.760> distributor<00:01:02.760> which<00:01:03.830> to<00:01:04.830> me<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.159> around

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
nother distributor which to me is around

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.230 
nother distributor which to me is around
anywhere<00:01:06.990> between<00:01:07.850> $115<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.060> good

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
anywhere between $115 for a good

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.370 
anywhere between $115 for a good
distributor<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> 350<00:01:11.780> or<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.049> could<00:01:13.200> try

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
distributor for a 350 or you could try

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.330 
distributor for a 350 or you could try
doing<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:14.450> what<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.479> did<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.830> took<00:01:17.159> some

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.830 

the<00:01:37.660> other<00:01:37.780> side<00:01:38.020> was<00:01:38.170> fine<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.820> they<00:01:40.720> had<00:01:40.810> a

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
the other side was fine but they had a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.960 
the other side was fine but they had a
little<00:01:40.960> extra<00:01:41.380> grip<00:01:41.620> I<00:01:41.950> filled<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.790> little

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
little extra grip I filled in a little

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.580 
little extra grip I filled in a little
bit<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.150> extra<00:01:43.300> jb<00:01:43.690> weld<00:01:43.840> in<00:01:44.080> there<00:01:44.260> so<00:01:44.380> when<00:01:44.500> it

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
bit of extra jb weld in there so when it

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.740 
bit of extra jb weld in there so when it
hardens<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:45.220> would<00:01:45.370> be<00:01:45.460> like<00:01:45.610> new<00:01:45.790> steel<00:01:46.120> or

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
hardens it would be like new steel or

hardens it would be like new steel or
new<00:01:47.410> plastic<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.910> have<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.270> grip<00:01:49.450> again<00:01:49.750> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
new plastic so to have the grip again I

new plastic so to have the grip again I
did<00:01:51.820> just<00:01:52.060> test<00:01:52.270> this<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:53.050> let<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.860> sit

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070

through the threads of this one here it

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.160 
through the threads of this one here it
actually<00:02:15.220> bit<00:02:15.610> very<00:02:15.970> good<00:02:16.210> on<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.780> heart<00:02:16.990> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
actually bit very good on the heart and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.860 
actually bit very good on the heart and
jb<00:02:17.710> weld<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:19.030> know<00:02:19.180> tighten<00:02:19.600> all<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.780> way

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
jb weld you know tighten all the way

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.770 
jb weld you know tighten all the way
down<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.770> course<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.460> gonna<00:02:21.780> sink

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
down and of course it's not gonna sink
