the<00:04:49.960> mapping<00:04:50.350> then<00:04:51.100> click<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.730> data<00:04:51.910> object

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
the mapping then click the data object

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.010 
the mapping then click the data object
operation<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.320> drag<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.070> editor

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.529 

you<00:04:57.770> can<00:04:57.979> complete<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.580> mapping<00:04:59.000> by<00:04:59.180> adding

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
you can complete the mapping by adding

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.629 
you can complete the mapping by adding
additional<00:04:59.830> transformations<00:05:00.830> linking<00:05:01.520> the

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
additional transformations linking the

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.210 
additional transformations linking the
ports<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.300> validating<00:05:03.110> it<00:05:03.259> after<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:04.039> run

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
ports and validating it after you run

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.369 
ports and validating it after you run

our account and stream details then in
the<00:05:32.520> developer<00:05:33.000> tool<00:05:33.210> we<00:05:33.990> created<00:05:34.560> a<00:05:34.710> data

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
the developer tool we created a data

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.400 
the developer tool we created a data
sift<00:05:35.310> connection<00:05:35.910> then<00:05:36.270> we<00:05:36.449> created<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.169> data

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
sift connection then we created a data

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.070 
sift connection then we created a data
sift<00:05:37.770> data<00:05:38.190> object<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.240> data<00:05:39.449> sift<00:05:39.750> data

sift data object and a data sift data
object<00:05:40.530> operation<00:05:41.190> finally<00:05:41.669> we<00:05:42.240> added<00:05:42.419> the

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
object operation finally we added the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.110 
object operation finally we added the
