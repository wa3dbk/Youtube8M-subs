00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.570 
developed from the ground up to pitch
baseballs<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.590> know<00:03:07.709> we<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:08.010> put<00:03:08.370> spin

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
baseballs and you know we can put spin

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.130 
baseballs and you know we can put spin
on<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.850> ball<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.209> baseball<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.660> it's<00:03:09.870> very

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
on the ball for baseball and it's very

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.590 
on the ball for baseball and it's very
similar<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.620> cricket<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.670> having<00:03:12.570> that

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
similar to cricket so having that

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.360 
similar to cricket so having that
machine<00:03:13.049> be<00:03:13.230> able<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.470> throw<00:03:13.680> any<00:03:13.860> baseball

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
machine be able to throw any baseball

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.180 
machine be able to throw any baseball
pitch<00:03:14.810> was<00:03:15.810> an<00:03:15.959> easy<00:03:16.110> transformation<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:17.040> able

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
pitch was an easy transformation be able

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.340 
pitch was an easy transformation be able
to<00:03:17.250> throw<00:03:17.400> any<00:03:17.580> cricket<00:03:17.940> pitch<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.989> we're<00:03:19.170> able

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
to throw any cricket pitch so we're able

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.560 
to throw any cricket pitch so we're able
to<00:03:19.500> throw<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.220> slow<00:03:20.459> spin<00:03:20.760> balls<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.450> as

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
to throw the the slow spin balls and as

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.320 
to throw the the slow spin balls and as
well<00:03:21.750> as<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.200> fast-paced<00:03:23.040> balls<00:03:23.489> we<00:03:24.180> can

well as the fast-paced balls we can
swing<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.630> we<00:03:25.440> can<00:03:25.620> bounce<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:26.010> short<00:03:26.310> we<00:03:26.519> can

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
swing it we can bounce a short we can

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.300 
swing it we can bounce a short we can
