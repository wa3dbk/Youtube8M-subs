00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
which I'll probably actually make a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.139 
which I'll probably actually make a
separate<00:01:00.870> video<00:01:01.020> about<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.190> everybody<00:01:03.000> can

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
this not Japanese thank you okay we have

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.910 
this not Japanese thank you okay we have
the<00:01:30.270> black<00:01:30.780> cartridge<00:01:31.290> which<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.710> actually

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the black cartridge which is actually

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.219 
the black cartridge which is actually
black<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.909> has<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.329> our<00:01:33.540> capabilities

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
black because it has I our capabilities

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.280 
black because it has I our capabilities
not<00:01:35.009> poke<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> walker<00:01:35.520> compatible<00:01:36.119> though

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
not poke a walker compatible though

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.260 
not poke a walker compatible though
unfortunately<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.790> I<00:01:38.790> think<00:01:39.119> that's

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
unfortunately and I think that's

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.480 
unfortunately and I think that's
probably<00:01:39.450> because<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.049> shift<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.439> 3ds<00:01:40.829> being

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
probably because the shift of 3ds being

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.940 
probably because the shift of 3ds being
an<00:01:41.700> accelerometer<00:01:42.270> itself<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.170> feel<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
an accelerometer itself I feel like the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.550 
an accelerometer itself I feel like the
pokewalker<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> make<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> comeback

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
pokewalker is going to make a comeback

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.889 
pokewalker is going to make a comeback
that's<00:01:46.560> cool<00:01:46.770> saber<00:01:47.310> cycle<00:01:47.729> very<00:01:48.180> mindful<00:01:48.689> of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that's cool saber cycle very mindful of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600 
that's cool saber cycle very mindful of
Nintendo<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.560> i<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.100> pokewalker<00:01:50.369> is

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
Nintendo but i think the pokewalker is

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.880 
Nintendo but i think the pokewalker is
going<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.790> make<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> comeback<00:01:51.320> just<00:01:52.320> being<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
going to make a comeback just being a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.280 
going to make a comeback just being a
feature<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.909> 3ds<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.990> has<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
feature in the 3ds because it has the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.859 
feature in the 3ds because it has the
accelerometers<00:01:55.950> already<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.479> no<00:01:57.600> pokewalker

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
accelerometers already so no pokewalker

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.580 
accelerometers already so no pokewalker
