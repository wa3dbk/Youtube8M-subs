00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello, today I'll show you how 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.500
 It's easy with a pin-up flash 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.500
 Flashes indirectly on the camera 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.900
 everyone who has ever been with the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.460
 portrait photography had to do and as 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.800
 beginners maybe even 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.990
 has flashed and photographed with it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 has quickly noticed that the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.380
 Portraits pretty hard at the moment 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.669
 flash with to reveal and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.230
 do not look really nice 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.540
 it does not really flatter 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.210
 That's why I show you how today 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.430
 one with such a young lightning we 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.469
 also have the cost currently at 70 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.410
 the euro even has the giga 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.510
 photo stamp on amazon get like 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.059
 you can make a great portrait with it 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.760
 because what you actually need is 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.730
 the own camera the flash and one 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.730
 white wall in the back or on the ceiling 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.490
 We are just such an office 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.740
 handled and have the white walls 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.830
 used to flash you the indirect 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.690
 to show we have one here 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.950
 Slope it completely white there 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.200
 does not seem like a few days a day 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.390
 But what does not matter is because flashed 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.710
 yes anyway and the flash of a simple 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.930
 stronger than the light pass the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.090
 raumfeld we have on the other wall 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.640
 here on the other side also one 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.310
 white wall and the third white wall in the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.340
 Back has been used as it were 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.830
 Huge reflector as a softbox like 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.810
 the whole thing works now 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.090
 Aufsteckblitz is yes on the camera and 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.390
 in the normal case one photographs so yes 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:54.909
 that the flash on model or on 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.159
 objectively and it has unsightly 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.350
 shadow casts and and hard contrasts 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.600
 what we now bring to the picture completely 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.970
 simply turn it is the lightning turn he 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.630
 just did not have such a tiltable 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.310
 also a swiveling head and judge 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.280
 to the ceiling or still 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.010
 better on the wall behind us and if 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.220
 we now flash this serves us 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.860
 huge wall as a softbox you can 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.500
 say and the reflecting light what 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.340
 then on the model field is a lot much 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.410
 softer than that hard gaudy flashes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.209
 that comes from the front and through the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.470
 are this soft pressure arises 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.209
 completely different picture the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.540
 camera settings while doing the same 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.030
 take pictures with after iso 100 56 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.040
 Clock aperture and shutter speed of 12 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.040
 hundredth 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.950
 with the kit lens the 1835 so 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.109
 no portrait lens or something like that 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.940
 I put on 85 mm beautiful 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.549
 focal length for portraits the misses 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.290
 Clauss are what you have to do 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.380
 Of course, adjust the flash output 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.510
 Of course it has to be a bit different 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.299
 if you really stop frontal 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.710
 photographed or half the lightning 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.270
 Turned around and the wall is illuminated 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.360
 then it had to be much higher there 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.440
 you have to experiment a bit 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.060
 Of course we should take care of that 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.810
 that the band really starts here 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.670
 white so neutral light reflects 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.040
 as soon as there is a bit of color in the game 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.900
 is, of course, the color is back 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.360
 thrown and then it can 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.850
 color distortions on the model on the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.730
 Acting skin is usually not like that 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.260
 Positive then the picture blog of her 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.540
 So just take a look 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.160
 Aufsteckblitz which costs no 70 euro 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.800
 to get a great portrait 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.110
 and by this indirect flash has 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.490
 you also have a superb light if you 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.350
 I liked the video and I like you 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.330
 could help a great portrait 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.940
 then make the thumbs up 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.420
 subscribed to the channel on the sides there's 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.250
 the links to the other channels the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.930
 the most important information about the video is available 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.380
 again below in the video description 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.380
 See you
