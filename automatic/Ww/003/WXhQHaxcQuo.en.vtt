like this mascara it was really

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.019 
like this mascara it was really
different<00:00:23.980> to<00:00:24.190> work<00:00:24.340> with<00:00:24.490> that<00:00:24.610> first

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
different to work with that first

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.300 
different to work with that first

I'm just gonna be showing you how I am
applying<00:00:27.580> it<00:00:28.000> throughout<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.480> video<00:00:28.779> but<00:00:29.439> it

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
applying it throughout the video but it

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.060 
applying it throughout the video but it
is<00:00:29.710> a<00:00:30.189> gel<00:00:31.000> mousse<00:00:31.330> formula<00:00:31.660> I<00:00:32.200> believe<00:00:32.920> I'm

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
is a gel mousse formula I believe I'm

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.690 
is a gel mousse formula I believe I'm
correct<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:35.530> wand<00:00:35.770> just<00:00:35.950> kind<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.309> bendy

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
correct and the wand just kind of bendy

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.420 
correct and the wand just kind of bendy
as<00:00:36.790> you<00:00:36.970> saw<00:00:37.180> before<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:37.870> I<00:00:38.650> think<00:00:38.710> this<00:00:39.010> kind

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
as you saw before and I think this kind

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.970 
as you saw before and I think this kind
of<00:00:39.550> doesn't<00:00:40.449> really<00:00:40.629> allow<00:00:41.020> you<00:00:41.080> to<00:00:41.440> push<00:00:41.800> that

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
of doesn't really allow you to push that

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.439 
of doesn't really allow you to push that
hard<00:00:42.160> on<00:00:42.280> your<00:00:42.430> lashes<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:42.790> it<00:00:43.000> does<00:00:43.180> give<00:00:43.420> it

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
hard on your lashes so it does give it

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.479 
hard on your lashes so it does give it
more<00:00:43.750> of<00:00:43.809> a<00:00:43.989> feathery<00:00:44.320> look<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.800> them<00:00:44.949> so<00:00:45.250> I<00:00:45.280> do

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
more of a feathery look to them so I do

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.780 
more of a feathery look to them so I do
like<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:46.000> layer<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.449> more<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.890> brush<00:00:48.579> is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
like to layer it more the brush is

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.240 
like to layer it more the brush is
actually<00:00:49.030> quite<00:00:49.600> large<00:00:49.899> so<00:00:50.320> it's<00:00:50.890> kind<00:00:51.190> of

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
actually quite large so it's kind of

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.010 
actually quite large so it's kind of
difficult<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.850> use<00:00:52.030> for<00:00:52.060> bottom<00:00:52.540> lashes<00:00:52.750> as

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
difficult to use for bottom lashes as

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.750 
difficult to use for bottom lashes as
you<00:00:53.050> will<00:00:53.260> see<00:00:53.440> in<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.620> minute<00:00:53.920> but<00:00:54.460> I<00:00:54.640> do

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
you will see in a minute but I do

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.790 
you will see in a minute but I do
overall<00:00:55.420> really<00:00:55.780> like<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.079> mascara<00:00:56.290> it's

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
overall really like this mascara it's

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.319 
overall really like this mascara it's
really<00:00:57.010> good<00:00:57.160> for<00:00:57.340> layering<00:00:57.579> it<00:00:58.000> doesn't<00:00:58.239> make

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
really good for layering it doesn't make

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.060 
really good for layering it doesn't make
your<00:00:58.450> eyelashes<00:00:58.930> crust<00:00:59.290> you<00:00:59.440> anything<00:00:59.860> which

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
your eyelashes crust you anything which

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.069 
your eyelashes crust you anything which
is<00:01:00.220> what<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.610> gel<00:01:01.210> mousse<00:01:01.510> firm<00:01:01.809> what<00:01:01.989> it

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
is what the gel mousse firm what it

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.770 
is what the gel mousse firm what it
claims<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.500> do<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.820> I<00:01:03.850> can<00:01:04.119> feel<00:01:04.270> my<00:01:04.420> lashes

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
claims to do so I can feel my lashes

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.270 
claims to do so I can feel my lashes
right<00:01:04.930> now<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.320> I<00:01:05.380> have<00:01:05.560> full<00:01:05.830> coats<00:01:06.130> of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
right now and I have full coats of

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.580 
right now and I have full coats of
mascara<00:01:06.369> on<00:01:06.910> but<00:01:07.479> they<00:01:07.600> do<00:01:07.660> still<00:01:08.050> feel<00:01:08.290> like

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
mascara on but they do still feel like

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.100 
mascara on but they do still feel like
eyelashes<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.369> not<00:01:09.490> like<00:01:09.670> clumpy<00:01:09.970> mascara<00:01:10.119> as

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
eyelashes and not like clumpy mascara as

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.020 
eyelashes and not like clumpy mascara as
for<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.530> bottom<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:12.130> does<00:01:12.340> work<00:01:12.640> pretty<00:01:12.910> well

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
for the bottom it does work pretty well

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.420 
for the bottom it does work pretty well
with<00:01:13.540> them<00:01:13.780> like<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.410> finished<00:01:14.800> effect<00:01:15.039> of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
with them like the finished effect of

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.760 
with them like the finished effect of
the<00:01:15.550> lashes<00:01:15.789> after<00:01:16.180> but<00:01:16.899> it<00:01:17.020> does<00:01:17.259> leave<00:01:17.530> some

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
the lashes after but it does leave some

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.740 
the lashes after but it does leave some
underneath<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.430> eye<00:01:18.460> because<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.240> brush<00:01:19.720> is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
underneath the eye because the brush is

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.649 
underneath the eye because the brush is
so<00:01:19.990> large<00:01:20.590> it's<00:01:21.340> just<00:01:21.549> an<00:01:21.640> average<00:01:21.850> bristle

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
so large it's just an average bristle

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.109 
so large it's just an average bristle
brush<00:01:22.930> not<00:01:23.830> anything<00:01:24.310> plasticky<00:01:24.850> or<00:01:24.970> anything

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
brush not anything plasticky or anything

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.350 
brush not anything plasticky or anything
and<00:01:25.710> yeah<00:01:26.710> so<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.340> formula<00:01:27.760> is<00:01:27.970> overall

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
and yeah so the formula is overall

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.630 
and yeah so the formula is overall
pretty<00:01:28.690> wet<00:01:29.049> which<00:01:29.619> is<00:01:29.799> hard<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.130> get<00:01:30.220> used<00:01:30.430> to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
pretty wet which is hard to get used to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.010 
pretty wet which is hard to get used to
but<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.030> does<00:01:31.210> give<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.479> really<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.840> nice

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
but it does give a really a nice

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.280 
but it does give a really a nice
finishing<00:01:32.439> look<00:01:33.330> here<00:01:34.330> is<00:01:34.540> just<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.110> end

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
finishing look here is just the end

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.800 
finishing look here is just the end
result<00:01:35.710> of<00:01:35.860> me<00:01:36.130> kind<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.939> fixing<00:01:37.390> up<00:01:37.540> these

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
result of me kind of fixing up these

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.460 
result of me kind of fixing up these
lashes<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.189> do<00:01:42.250> really<00:01:42.549> like<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:43.030> curl<00:01:43.470> from

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
lashes and I do really like to curl from

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.320 
lashes and I do really like to curl from
the<00:01:44.619> behind<00:01:44.920> tube<00:01:45.280> because<00:01:45.640> my<00:01:45.850> lashes<00:01:46.090> are

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
the behind tube because my lashes are

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.580 
the behind tube because my lashes are
blonde<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.810> really<00:01:46.960> gets<00:01:47.110> some<00:01:47.320> blacker

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
blonde so it really gets some blacker

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.450 
blonde so it really gets some blacker
and<00:01:48.009> it<00:01:48.790> makes<00:01:49.210> them<00:01:49.570> show<00:01:49.840> up<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.140> lot<00:01:50.259> more<00:01:50.500> the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
and it makes them show up a lot more the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.880 
and it makes them show up a lot more the
mascara<00:01:51.909> formula<00:01:52.509> is<00:01:52.720> really<00:01:53.110> black<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.680> really

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
mascara formula is really black I really

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.620 
mascara formula is really black I really
do<00:01:54.070> like<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.280> because<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:54.820> like<00:01:55.000> my<00:01:55.119> mouth<00:01:55.330> or

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
do like that because I like my mouth or
