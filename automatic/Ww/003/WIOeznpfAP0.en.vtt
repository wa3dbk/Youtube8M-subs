 general manager of agris the auspices 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.080
 in the fair pond at the fair forumpiscine 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.570
 2013 we present all our news 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.190
 for the 2013 season 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.949
 in particular the swimming pool fitted 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.430
 which is a sweet country life of the line 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 above ground lake from the 25 m of height 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.150
 of water the pool here is a 35 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.699
 meters of water with a bordin e 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.489
 connect a steel structure and a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.579
 real roatan paneling 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.250
 the normally comprehensive pool kit 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.629
 of the safety ladder for 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.969
 access to the skimmer in the tub 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.690
 spillway that perfect allows the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.430
 perfect police of the water surface 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.760
 lighting a modular pool like 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.680
 all the pond products that can be 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.110
 therefore tailored to the needs 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.739
 of the customer with different of course 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.219
 types of finishes and colors and that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.100
 let's say it's a completely product 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.130
 made in italy that can be combined 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 quietly to any kind of 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.659
 external setting then with gods 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.869
 garden furniture or simply 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.000
 in a courtyard or wherever you want 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.130
 mount this pool this year 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.619
 it can be mounted not only on one 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.830
 audience but rather to concrete even on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.840
 land that is not normally debts 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 to a montage of this type of 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.240
 pool I'm talking about an example 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.720
 clay soil of a gravelly soil 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.030
 sandy or even rocky thanks to 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.579
 a novelty note 2013 pond that has a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.470
 panel a steel paneling 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.750
 or a real structure from 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.299
 mount below the pool that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 avoids the construction of an audience in 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.259
 concrete and which therefore allows for 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.060
 go even where this pool 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.670
 normally cannot be mounted for 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.829
 environmental problems or constraints or 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.079
 just impossible to achieve 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.100
 a fixed work that can be a 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.750
 concrete basement 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.250
 for more information you can 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.920
