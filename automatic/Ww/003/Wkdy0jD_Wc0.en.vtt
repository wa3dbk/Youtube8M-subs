00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 and so hello all those who are me 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.660
 hears this next creation video 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:14.219
 games on unity3d engine we create a game 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:19.460
 in si sharp and in this video we 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:22.289
 consider how you can withdraw points 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.180
 initially initially in the first part 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.390
 This video we will consider simply as 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.960
 create a points system and in the very next 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.710
 parts you can view them in 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.280
 the game itself, that is, you can display them 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.379
 On the screen for a start, let's see what we have 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.789
 there is that is, we have two objects our 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:52.199
 our player has which will be fulfilled in 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.110
 some time on screen and with more 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:00.000
 degrees of probability they acquire 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.550
 new color for now it's all let's 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.600
 go to our camera controller here 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.600
 do not create a new variable public 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 score meaning it will be a variable 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.840
 answer for our glasses why i will do 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:26.150
 public because i want to see 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:29.400
 abstract public class 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.680
 soon it will be change is equal to enter 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.270
 all these year integer variables 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.850
 because we don't need and real 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 value in our game score and we can 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 already see them in the escort session inspector 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.050
 and flat we can also increase 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.210
 reduce that is depending on our 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.430
 needs 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.670
 let us now increase when 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.880
 we click on some object 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.780
 we will just increase our score 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:09.450
 our points we go our world from 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:14.220
 update go to conditional conditional value 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:19.170
 and but get mouse button down that is if 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:23.850
 mouse button 0 is pressed i.e. left 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.610
 mouse button and let's go was a physicist of his caste 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.030
 and here we do not just add to our 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.030
 score 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.290
 affection 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.489
 save here we have updated and go 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.150
 let's go go to our project 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.610
 click and our soon equals 10 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.319
 will take place before we will soon 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.530
 increases when we click on our 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.530
 an object 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.140
 let's do now for everyone 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.810
 object for our player or different 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:12.950
 values by soon let's press 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:18.959
 push we make a plan score equal to 20 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.960
 but if you have to understand what our soon 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.320
 but 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.320
 mill 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.320
 if not then it is not our 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.150
 red object 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.360
 player is blue square now let's 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.360
 run 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:52.459
 and look at our dispute in the inspector 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:57.709
 if we click on our player then we 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:00.470
 still added 10 points but 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:05.709
 again it changes the value seams 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.709
 is there if we click on our anime 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:15.060
 who adds ready was soon 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.470
 there are hundreds left if we change if we 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.169
 click on our player 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.000
 the report will change to 20 soon but this 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:26.669
 happens with a cycle that is, we replace 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.229
 started by soon he adds past 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.180
 value of gender score and next time 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:38.880
 adds again the past pass value 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:43.430
 cattle are just new so we need it 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:48.240
 replace so you can use 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:54.630
 in the easiest way possible 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:56.750
 have add to every object every 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.100
 times skarpanoga 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:04.740
 then here let's first take 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:09.169
 you peel constantly 0 and see what 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:13.740
 we got click on our and they 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:16.330
 Soon you will soon become again soon with us 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.360
 there our 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.479
 player and soon we are 20 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.699
 soon equals 120 i.e. everything works 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:30.550
 cost 20 we are constantly changing 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.650
 changes the value of the skids that is in 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.189
 principle we have it all ready 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.919
 You can experiment with this, 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.539
 us with these ways i mean i 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.840
 introduced the easiest way 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.500
 where we just copy the code and grief plus 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.830
 floating 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.229
 every time you can try and 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.469
 write in the comments another way 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:59.849
 you can also put the value of pla soon 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:06:06.240
 array that is I will not show now 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:06.240
 just write start that is 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.770
 for example class 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.550
 ray that is if you watched the lessons on 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.760
 sisharpa you saw arrays there that is, we 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:26.020
 we can add to each cell of the array 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:31.720
 certain value of core layer and all 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:34.330
 will still work so i'm on 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.930
 finish it thanks for comment and 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:41.760
 give your estimates and see you soon 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.760
 see you in the next part of this video
