what's<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.150> on<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.510> his<00:01:45.600> channel<00:01:45.990> those

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
what's going on in his channel those

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.320 
what's going on in his channel those

parents<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.830> mostly<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.340> blame<00:01:50.460> for

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
parents I think are mostly to blame for

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.030 
parents I think are mostly to blame for
getting<00:01:51.300> these<00:01:51.510> animals<00:01:51.990> their<00:01:52.260> enablers<00:01:52.530> or

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
getting these animals their enablers or

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.520 
getting these animals their enablers or
enabling<00:01:53.400> them<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:55.080> then<00:01:55.320> when

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
enabling them to do this and then when

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.490 
enabling them to do this and then when
he<00:01:55.680> posts<00:01:56.250> them<00:01:56.280> ourselves<00:01:57.150> as<00:01:57.780> viewers<00:01:58.080> are

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
