00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
chris has a one-goal ever felt so good

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.190 
chris has a one-goal ever felt so good
as<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.939> manager<00:00:03.240> because<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.510> needed<00:00:03.899> that<00:00:04.110> one

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
as a manager because you needed that one

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.130 
as a manager because you needed that one
today<00:00:04.380> well<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:04.859> think<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:05.790> more<00:00:06.720> importantly

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
today well I think it more importantly

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.100 
today well I think it more importantly
and<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.379> deserved<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:08.069> because<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:09.150> thought<00:00:10.019> we

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
and we deserved it because I thought we

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.900 
and we deserved it because I thought we
had<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.260> support<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.010> was<00:00:11.099> very<00:00:11.250> good<00:00:11.400> right

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
had a support that was very good right

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.120 
had a support that was very good right
throughout<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> game<00:00:12.570> because<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.080> know<00:00:13.230> it's

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
throughout the game because we know it's

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.799 
throughout the game because we know it's
a<00:00:14.219> bit<00:00:14.400> frustrating<00:00:15.030> at<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> moment<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.660> we

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
a bit frustrating at the moment that we

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.540 
a bit frustrating at the moment that we
perhaps<00:00:16.440> not<00:00:16.740> getting<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> goals<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
perhaps not getting the goals and the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.660 
perhaps not getting the goals and the
breaks<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.970> we<00:00:18.570> want<00:00:19.160> but<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.220> thought<00:00:20.520> that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
breaks that we want but I thought that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.340 
breaks that we want but I thought that
we<00:00:20.910> had<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.060> group<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.330> players<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.840> kept

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
we had a group of players that kept

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.410 
we had a group of players that kept
going<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:23.400> know<00:00:23.519> right<00:00:23.760> right<00:00:23.910> through<00:00:24.330> it

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
going you know right right through it

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.929 
going you know right right through it
again<00:00:24.830> what<00:00:25.830> we've<00:00:25.980> got<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.550> able<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
again what we've got to be able to do is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.990 
again what we've got to be able to do is
we've<00:00:27.119> got<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.510> able<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.470> turn<00:00:29.310> that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
we've got to be able to to turn that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.970 
we've got to be able to to turn that
sort<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> dominance<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.349> times<00:00:31.650> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
sort of dominance of times of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.549 
sort of dominance of times of
performance<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.930> entries<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> final

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
performance and entries in the final

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.590 
performance and entries in the final
third<00:00:34.770> crosses<00:00:35.370> we've<00:00:35.940> got<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> bit<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.420> turn

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
third crosses we've got a bit of turn

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.720 
third crosses we've got a bit of turn
that<00:00:36.719> into<00:00:36.899> better<00:00:37.530> chances<00:00:38.129> bet<00:00:38.489> more

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that into better chances bet more

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.190 
that into better chances bet more
clear-cut<00:00:39.090> chances<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:39.809> probably<00:00:40.110> in

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
clear-cut chances because probably in

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.709 
clear-cut chances because probably in
the<00:00:40.260> game<00:00:40.440> where<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.969> threatened<00:00:42.360> an<00:00:42.420> awful

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the game where was threatened an awful

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.670 
the game where was threatened an awful
lot<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.960> probably<00:00:43.170> haven't<00:00:43.379> worked<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
lot we probably haven't worked a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.119 
lot we probably haven't worked a
goalkeeper<00:00:44.129> enough<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:46.129> result

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
goalkeeper enough but it was a result

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.790 
goalkeeper enough but it was a result
that<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.550> no<00:00:47.969> doubt<00:00:48.210> deserved<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.020> sometimes

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that we no doubt deserved and sometimes

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.049 
that we no doubt deserved and sometimes
you<00:00:49.920> need<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.219> bit<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.640> break<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
you need that little bit of a break and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.240 
you need that little bit of a break and
we<00:00:51.300> got<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.600> today<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> were<00:00:53.010> looking

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
we got that today if you were looking

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520 
we got that today if you were looking
for<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> response<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.270> your<00:00:54.449> players<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:55.410> lot

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
for a response from your players a lot

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.990 
for a response from your players a lot
of<00:00:55.710> people<00:00:55.920> called<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> must<00:00:56.370> win<00:00:56.550> game<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
of people called it a must win game and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.160 
of people called it a must win game and
they<00:00:57.329> were<00:00:57.449> certainly<00:00:57.690> willing<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> battle

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
they were certainly willing to battle

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.529 
they were certainly willing to battle
for<00:00:58.379> me<00:00:58.620> today<00:00:58.770> yeah<00:00:59.219> yeah<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> they<00:01:00.030> were<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
for me today yeah yeah and they were and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
for me today yeah yeah and they were and
I<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.930> you've<00:01:01.079> if<00:01:01.649> you've<00:01:01.859> got<00:01:02.039> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
I think if you've if you've got that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.609 
I think if you've if you've got that
you've<00:01:02.309> got<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> chance<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:03.719> course<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.229> line<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you've got a chance of course a line to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.710 
you've got a chance of course a line to
that<00:01:04.739> one<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.670> qualities<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.390> needed

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that one is the qualities that's needed

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.140 
that one is the qualities that's needed
to<00:01:06.750> create<00:01:07.650> make<00:01:08.430> sure<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.790> they're<00:01:08.939> good

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
to create make sure that they're good

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.570 
to create make sure that they're good
goalscoring<00:01:09.689> charges<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.340> take<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> little

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
goalscoring charges and take a little

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.440 
goalscoring charges and take a little
bit<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.850> pressure<00:01:12.150> off<00:01:12.299> yourself

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
bit of that pressure off yourself

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.870 
bit of that pressure off yourself
because<00:01:13.070> of<00:01:14.070> course<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> longer<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.700> game

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
because of course the longer the game

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.080 
because of course the longer the game
goes<00:01:15.119> without<00:01:15.390> scoring<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.930> goal<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:17.490> applying

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
goes without scoring a goal you applying

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.340 
goes without scoring a goal you applying
that<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:18.600> more<00:01:18.780> pressure<00:01:19.170> on

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that little bit more pressure on

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.679 
that little bit more pressure on
yourself<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:20.030> anything<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.479> play

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
yourself because anything that we play

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
yourself because anything that we play
against<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.590> even<00:01:22.950> today<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.460> thought

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
against and even today and I thought

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
against and even today and I thought
they<00:01:23.729> defended<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.509> well<00:01:24.659> whole<00:01:24.869> but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
they defended really well whole but

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
they defended really well whole but
they've<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:25.680> enough<00:01:25.799> quality<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.580> their<00:01:27.000> team

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
they've got enough quality in their team

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.140 
they've got enough quality in their team
to<00:01:27.860> catch<00:01:28.860> us<00:01:29.100> catch<00:01:29.250> us<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> brake<00:01:29.939> which

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
to catch us catch us on the brake which

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.240 
to catch us catch us on the brake which
I<00:01:30.240> felt<00:01:30.479> felt<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.869> was<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
I felt felt it was going to be and and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.210 
I felt felt it was going to be and and
then<00:01:32.460> you're<00:01:32.729> you're<00:01:33.180> kicking<00:01:33.659> yourself<00:01:34.220> 86

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
then you're you're kicking yourself 86

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
then you're you're kicking yourself 86
minutes<00:01:35.400> were<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.909> starting<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
minutes were you starting to think the
