00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.170 
notice it but it's not quite as
in-your-face<00:01:53.240> as<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:54.200> lot<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.250> what<00:01:55.790> we're<00:01:55.970> used

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
in-your-face as a lot of what we're used

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.000 
in-your-face as a lot of what we're used
to<00:01:56.270> seeing<00:01:56.650> this<00:01:57.650> vintage<00:01:58.070> mat<00:01:58.340> feel<00:01:58.790> um<00:02:00.010> gives

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
to seeing this vintage mat feel um gives

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.650 
to seeing this vintage mat feel um gives
a<00:02:01.130> softer<00:02:01.520> finish<00:02:01.790> if<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.030> look<00:02:02.150> at<00:02:02.270> kind<00:02:02.600> of

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
a softer finish if you look at kind of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.020 
a softer finish if you look at kind of
how<00:02:02.750> my<00:02:02.870> face<00:02:03.080> looks<00:02:03.260> right<00:02:03.620> now<00:02:03.770> on<00:02:04.070> camera<00:02:04.730> i

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
how my face looks right now on camera i

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.680 
how my face looks right now on camera i
think<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:06.140> i<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:06.440> get<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:06.680> slight<00:02:07.100> highlight

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
think that i do get a slight highlight

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.260 
think that i do get a slight highlight
but<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.989> just<00:02:09.229> get<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:09.379> much<00:02:09.590> softer<00:02:10.030> finish<00:02:11.030> and

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
but I just get a much softer finish and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.750 
but I just get a much softer finish and
it's<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.540> very<00:02:11.570> good<00:02:12.200> good<00:02:12.680> good<00:02:13.040> translucent

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
it's a very good good good translucent

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.140 
it's a very good good good translucent
powder

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
powder

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.229 
powder
so<00:02:14.689> it's<00:02:14.840> $22<00:02:15.500> 4.2<00:02:16.310> 1<00:02:16.340> ounce<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.000> I'm<00:02:17.060> going<00:02:17.180> to

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
so it's $22 4.2 1 ounce and I'm going to

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.089 
so it's $22 4.2 1 ounce and I'm going to
show<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.540> with<00:02:17.629> powder<00:02:17.930> itself<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.439> a<00:02:18.500> second<00:02:18.860> I

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
show it with powder itself in a second I

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.830 
show it with powder itself in a second I
would<00:02:19.879> compare<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.299> meteorites

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
would compare that to meteorites

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.660 
would compare that to meteorites
meteorites<00:02:21.409> have<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:22.129> little<00:02:22.310> Sheen<00:02:22.640> that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
meteorites have that little Sheen that

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.880 
meteorites have that little Sheen that
shimmer<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.540> illumination<00:02:23.959> they<00:02:24.470> are<00:02:24.530> not

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
shimmer that illumination they are not

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.229 
shimmer that illumination they are not
match<00:02:25.159> and<00:02:25.610> they're<00:02:25.760> also<00:02:25.909> a<00:02:26.000> different

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
match and they're also a different

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.699 
match and they're also a different
texture<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:26.750> that's<00:02:26.900> sixty<00:02:27.319> dollars<00:02:27.560> four

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
texture but that's sixty dollars four

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.500 
texture but that's sixty dollars four
point<00:02:27.890> eight<00:02:28.069> eight<00:02:28.340> ounces<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.329> is

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
point eight eight ounces so this is

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.440 
point eight eight ounces so this is
little<00:02:29.750> um<00:02:30.709> then<00:02:31.459> when<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.790> open<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.060> up<00:02:32.180> it

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
little um then when you open it up it

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.569 
little um then when you open it up it
you<00:02:32.689> get<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.930> little<00:02:33.079> puff<00:02:33.379> which<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.040> fine<00:02:34.250> I

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
you get the little puff which is fine I

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.619 
you get the little puff which is fine I
found<00:02:35.829> usually<00:02:36.829> I<00:02:36.859> use<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.549> brush<00:02:38.390> that

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
found usually I use a brush that

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.330 
found usually I use a brush that
diffuses<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.200> lot<00:02:39.439> more<00:02:39.560> because<00:02:39.859> I<00:02:39.890> don't<00:02:40.250> want

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
diffuses a lot more because I don't want

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.800 
diffuses a lot more because I don't want
too<00:02:40.579> much<00:02:40.670> shimmer<00:02:40.909> and<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.120> lot<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.269> my<00:02:41.480> powders

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
too much shimmer and a lot of my powders

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.440 
too much shimmer and a lot of my powders
have<00:02:41.989> shimmer<00:02:42.349> or<00:02:42.379> they<00:02:42.590> have<00:02:42.739> color<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.450> I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
have shimmer or they have color and I

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.180 
have shimmer or they have color and I
have<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.840> use<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.959> really<00:02:45.230> light<00:02:45.409> hand<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:46.040> get

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
have to use a really light hand to get

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.879 
have to use a really light hand to get
kind<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.549> soft<00:02:46.849> smooth<00:02:47.389> finish<00:02:47.680> otherwise<00:02:48.680> I

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
kind of a soft smooth finish otherwise I

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.030

that<00:03:07.670> have<00:03:07.909> the<00:03:08.060> opposite<00:03:08.359> problem<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:09.409> it

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
that have the opposite problem but it

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.809 
that have the opposite problem but it
comes<00:03:09.709> like<00:03:09.829> this<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.250> at<00:03:10.370> first<00:03:10.489> couldn't

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
comes like this I at first couldn't

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.619 
comes like this I at first couldn't
figure<00:03:10.939> out<00:03:11.739> what<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.769> is<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:14.209> anyways<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.510> use

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
figure out what that is so anyways I use

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.629 
figure out what that is so anyways I use
a<00:03:14.720> firmer<00:03:15.319> brush<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.859> just<00:03:16.099> dotted<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.549> on

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
a firmer brush and just dotted it on

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.110 
a firmer brush and just dotted it on
like<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:17.410> um<00:03:18.410> because<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.280> don't<00:03:19.489> get<00:03:19.730> kind

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
like that um because you don't get kind

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.750 
like that um because you don't get kind
of<00:03:20.290> heavy<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.709> was<00:03:22.010> not<00:03:22.099> able<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.340> build<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:22.669> up

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
of heavy I was not able to build it up

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.360 
of heavy I was not able to build it up
to<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.239> point<00:03:23.480> where<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.560> looked<00:03:24.799> heavy<00:03:25.040> or

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
to the point where it looked heavy or

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.119 
to the point where it looked heavy or
cakey<00:03:25.609> or<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.150> key<00:03:26.599> you<00:03:27.470> opened<00:03:27.769> up<00:03:27.829> its<00:03:27.980> like

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
cakey or a key you opened up its like

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.399 
cakey or a key you opened up its like
this<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.970> i'm<00:03:29.090> not<00:03:29.180> going<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.419> show<00:03:29.659> you<00:03:30.199> now

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
this and i'm not going to show you now

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:31.830 
this and i'm not going to show you now
because<00:03:30.680> now<00:03:31.069> it<00:03:31.220> will<00:03:31.340> spill<00:03:31.549> everywhere

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
because now it will spill everywhere

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.559 
because now it will spill everywhere
it's<00:03:32.840> packed<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.220> i<00:03:34.699> actually<00:03:35.000> had<00:03:35.359> a<00:03:35.389> hard

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
it's packed in so i actually had a hard

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.759 
it's packed in so i actually had a hard
time<00:03:35.599> initially<00:03:35.930> getting<00:03:36.319> it<00:03:36.409> out<00:03:36.530> because

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
time initially getting it out because

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.250 
time initially getting it out because
with<00:03:37.099> this<00:03:37.250> little<00:03:37.459> plastic<00:03:37.760> film<00:03:38.209> on<00:03:38.480> top<00:03:38.720> you

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
with this little plastic film on top you

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.259 
with this little plastic film on top you
don't<00:03:39.409> have<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.739> space<00:03:40.129> here<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.879> shake<00:03:41.090> it

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
don't have that space here to shake it

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.479 
don't have that space here to shake it
up<00:03:41.389> and<00:03:41.540> have<00:03:41.659> it<00:03:41.720> come<00:03:41.810> out<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.500> since<00:03:43.340> it's

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
up and have it come out and since it's

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.059 
up and have it come out and since it's
really<00:03:43.669> packed<00:03:44.319> it's<00:03:45.319> not<00:03:45.440> that<00:03:45.560> easy<00:03:45.709> just<00:03:45.949> to

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
really packed it's not that easy just to

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.500 
really packed it's not that easy just to
shake<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.280> even<00:03:46.549> sideways<00:03:46.879> and<00:03:47.000> get<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.209> out<00:03:47.269> so

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
shake it even sideways and get it out so

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.289 
shake it even sideways and get it out so
what<00:03:47.629> I<00:03:47.659> had<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:47.930> do<00:03:48.199> is<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:49.819> had<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.030> shake<00:03:50.180> it

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
what I had to do is I had to shake it

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.180 
what I had to do is I had to shake it
upside<00:03:50.510> down<00:03:50.569> like<00:03:51.079> this<00:03:51.229> into<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.739> lid<00:03:51.889> and

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
upside down like this into the lid and

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.729 
upside down like this into the lid and
then<00:03:52.449> get<00:03:53.449> it<00:03:53.540> from<00:03:53.690> there<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.079> because<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.680> is

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
then get it from there and because it is

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.349 
then get it from there and because it is
so<00:03:54.919> packed<00:03:55.129> in<00:03:55.370> only<00:03:55.669> a<00:03:55.760> little<00:03:55.879> bit<00:03:56.060> comes<00:03:56.239> out

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
so packed in only a little bit comes out

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.360 
so packed in only a little bit comes out
at<00:03:56.479> a<00:03:56.569> time<00:03:56.780> which<00:03:57.319> is<00:03:57.349> fine<00:03:57.650> it's<00:03:58.250> not<00:03:58.310> a

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
at a time which is fine it's not a

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.069 
at a time which is fine it's not a
problem<00:03:58.459> it<00:03:58.970> kind<00:03:59.299> of<00:03:59.329> gave<00:03:59.540> me<00:03:59.720> more<00:03:59.930> control

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
problem it kind of gave me more control

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.920 
problem it kind of gave me more control
so<00:04:00.349> going<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:00.500> put<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.680> little<00:04:00.859> bit<00:04:01.099> on<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.750> see

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
so going to put a little bit on and see

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.210 
so going to put a little bit on and see
how<00:04:06.049> it<00:04:06.169> blends<00:04:06.470> in

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.570 

just<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.180> very<00:04:10.390> smooth<00:04:10.690> finish<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.310> me<00:04:12.310> spill

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
so anyway what do I think overall I

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.960 
so anyway what do I think overall I
really<00:04:23.260> like<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.890> i<00:04:24.010> like<00:04:24.040> i<00:04:24.520> don't<00:04:24.760> know<00:04:24.820> it's

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
really like it i like i don't know it's

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.760 
really like it i like i don't know it's
kind<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.150> like<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.300> soft<00:04:25.660> focus<00:04:25.990> on<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.290> camera<00:04:26.560> if

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
kind of like a soft focus on a camera if

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.980 
kind of like a soft focus on a camera if
that<00:04:26.920> makes<00:04:27.100> sense<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.610> like<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.330> I<00:04:28.810> think

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
that makes sense I like that I think

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.680 
that makes sense I like that I think
it's<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.170> really<00:04:29.200> pretty<00:04:29.860> look<00:04:30.850> as<00:04:31.060> I<00:04:31.180> did<00:04:31.420> a<00:04:31.450> lot

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
it's a really pretty look as I did a lot

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.410 
it's a really pretty look as I did a lot
of<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.930> different<00:04:33.270> blush<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:35.850> lips<00:04:36.850> all<00:04:37.180> of

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420

of the different blush and lips all of
which<00:04:37.540> are<00:04:37.750> more<00:04:37.960> on<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.140> mat<00:04:38.440> side<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:39.580> can

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
which are more on the mat side you can

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.280 
which are more on the mat side you can
see<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:40.120> just<00:04:40.150> gives<00:04:40.480> a<00:04:40.570> different<00:04:40.720> look<00:04:40.990> to
