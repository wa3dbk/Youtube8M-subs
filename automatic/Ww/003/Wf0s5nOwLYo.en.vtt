00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
you know this will happen the tooth has

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.780 
you know this will happen the tooth has
broken<00:00:38.100> off<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.079> pulp<00:00:40.350> cavity

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
broken off and here is the pulp cavity

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
broken off and here is the pulp cavity
right<00:00:41.790> there<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.480> where<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.469> nerve<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
right there that is where the nerve and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.459 
right there that is where the nerve and
the<00:00:44.100> blood<00:00:44.309> vessel<00:00:44.700> come<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.660> nourish

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the blood vessel come in just to nourish

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.920 
the blood vessel come in just to nourish
the<00:00:46.680> tooth<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.879> part<00:00:48.149> easy<00:00:48.329> over<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the tooth so this part easy over to the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.029 
the tooth so this part easy over to the
third<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.860> premolar<00:00:50.430> has<00:00:51.059> been<00:00:51.300> broken<00:00:51.710> if<00:00:52.710> we

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
third or premolar has been broken if we

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.790 
third or premolar has been broken if we
leave<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.550> sometimes<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.230> infection

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
leave it in sometimes they the infection

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.160 
leave it in sometimes they the infection
will<00:00:55.890> go<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.219> into<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> root<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.270> then<00:00:57.870> we

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
will go up into the root and then we

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.920 
will go up into the root and then we
have<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> rooted<00:00:59.730> root<00:00:59.969> abscess<00:01:00.480> called<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
have a rooted root abscess called the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.799 
have a rooted root abscess called the
carne<00:01:01.260> Co<00:01:01.500> mm<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:03.059> make<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.390> abscess

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
carne Co mm and it will make an abscess

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.230 
carne Co mm and it will make an abscess

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
I'm going to use this to loosen it up

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.070 
I'm going to use this to loosen it up
and<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.890> see<00:02:18.100> if<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.400> first<00:02:18.970> segment<00:02:19.780> will

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
and to see if that first segment will

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.089 
and to see if that first segment will
come<00:02:20.200> out

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.070 

after<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:24.130> cut<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.489> tooth<00:02:24.819> into<00:02:25.120> sections<00:02:25.900> I

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
after I cut the tooth into sections I

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.850 
after I cut the tooth into sections I
try<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.620> use<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.040> elevator<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:28.770> loosen<00:02:29.770> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
try to use the elevator to loosen the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.190 
try to use the elevator to loosen the
tooth<00:02:30.069> by<00:02:30.340> putting<00:02:30.700> pressure<00:02:30.940> on<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.510> teeth

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
tooth by putting pressure on the teeth

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.900 
tooth by putting pressure on the teeth
which<00:02:32.440> into<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.890> crack<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.370> loosen<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
which into the crack and loosen the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.900 
which into the crack and loosen the
attachment<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.840> can<00:02:35.080> pull<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.349> out

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.360 

so<00:02:42.910> I've<00:02:43.060> put<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.480> first<00:02:43.720> root<00:02:44.020> out<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:45.250> how

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
so I've put the first root out see how

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.910 
so I've put the first root out see how
nice<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.270> rounded<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.020> tip<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.410> means<00:02:47.800> I

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
nice and rounded the tip is that means I

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.130 
nice and rounded the tip is that means I
got<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.280> whole<00:02:48.400> thing<00:02:48.600> that's<00:02:49.600> what<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:49.900> want

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
got the whole thing that's what we want

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.060 
got the whole thing that's what we want
right<00:02:54.420> down<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.600> middle<00:02:55.630> because<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.740> front

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
right down the middle because the front

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.010 
right down the middle because the front
half<00:02:57.310> has<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.790> loose<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.420> they<00:02:58.480> have<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.840> get

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
half has to loose and they have to get

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.360 
half has to loose and they have to get
simple<00:02:59.410> just<00:03:04.230> then<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.260> used<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> elevator<00:03:06.130> to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
simple just then I used the elevator to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.160 
simple just then I used the elevator to
slide<00:03:06.640> down<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.030> crack<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.780> just<00:03:07.990> made

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
slide down the crack that I just made

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.980 
slide down the crack that I just made
with<00:03:08.380> my<00:03:08.500> drill<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.190> then<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:09.790> use<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.270> tool<00:03:10.810> to

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
with my drill and then I use the tool to

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.320 
with my drill and then I use the tool to
grab<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.530> section<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.490> pull<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.850> out<00:03:12.940> root

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
grab that section and pull it out root

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.160 
grab that section and pull it out root
it<00:03:13.480> all<00:03:13.770> comes<00:03:14.770> out<00:03:14.890> pretty<00:03:15.070> neat<00:03:15.460> doesn't

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
it all comes out pretty neat doesn't

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.340 
it all comes out pretty neat doesn't
here's<00:03:18.170> number<00:03:18.440> three<00:03:19.720> three<00:03:20.720> strikes<00:03:21.110> you're

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
here's number three three strikes you're

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.970 
here's number three three strikes you're
out<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:23.540> can<00:03:23.720> see<00:03:23.960> the<00:03:23.990> big<00:03:24.350> hole<00:03:24.560> on<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.770> back

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
out you can see the big hole on the back

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.220 
out you can see the big hole on the back
and<00:03:25.250> two<00:03:25.430> holes<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:25.970> front<00:03:26.360> where<00:03:27.050> the

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
and two holes in the front where the

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.100 
and two holes in the front where the
roots<00:03:27.470> went<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.520> big<00:03:28.790> primo<00:03:29.450> or<00:03:29.660> carne

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
roots went in in that big primo or carne

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.960 
roots went in in that big primo or carne
zo2

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.340 

so<00:03:33.150> now<00:03:33.360> what<00:03:33.600> we're<00:03:33.720> going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.900> do<00:03:34.080> is<00:03:34.200> we're

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
so now what we're going to do is we're

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.170 
so now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.500> sew<00:03:34.830> up<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.580> if<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.790> comes<00:03:35.970> together

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
going to sew up so if it comes together

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.300 
going to sew up so if it comes together
best<00:03:36.600> we<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:36.960> because<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:37.800> dog<00:03:38.040> eats

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
best we can because this a dog eats

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.160 
best we can because this a dog eats
it'll<00:03:38.580> Jam<00:03:38.850> food<00:03:39.240> up<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:39.510> those<00:03:39.630> holes<00:03:39.870> and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
it'll Jam food up in those holes and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.870 
it'll Jam food up in those holes and
that's<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.770> not<00:03:40.950> that's<00:03:41.220> not<00:03:41.490> a<00:03:41.520> very<00:03:41.730> good

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
that's a not that's not a very good

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.850 
that's a not that's not a very good
thing<00:03:42.360> because<00:03:42.540> it'll<00:03:42.900> start<00:03:43.140> infection

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.770 

after<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:46.890> take<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.310> tooth<00:03:47.610> out<00:03:48.150> there's<00:03:48.330> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
after I take the tooth out there's the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.700 
after I take the tooth out there's the
holes<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.590> were<00:03:49.770> left<00:03:50.900> for<00:03:51.900> where<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.380> roots

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
holes that were left for where the roots

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.790 
holes that were left for where the roots
went<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.460> and<00:03:53.700> what<00:03:54.450> we<00:03:54.630> want<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.930> do<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.260> suture

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
went in and what we want to do is suture

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.550 
went in and what we want to do is suture
the<00:03:55.950> gums<00:03:56.220> together<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:57.810> infection

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
the gums together so that infection

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.190 
the gums together so that infection
can't<00:03:58.920> get<00:03:59.160> in<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.630> so<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.780> holes<00:04:00.990> are

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
can't get in and so the holes are

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.700 
can't get in and so the holes are
covered<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:02.490> use<00:04:02.700> absorbable<00:04:03.540> sutures<00:04:04.050> which

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
covered we use absorbable sutures which

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.070 
covered we use absorbable sutures which
will<00:04:04.980> stay<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.640> wound<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.510> few<00:04:06.810> weeks

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
will stay in the wound for a few weeks

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.230 
will stay in the wound for a few weeks
until<00:04:07.380> they<00:04:07.710> dissolve<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.940> will<00:04:09.060> keep

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
until they dissolve and it will keep

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.200 
until they dissolve and it will keep
everything<00:04:09.480> all<00:04:09.960> together<00:04:10.670> so<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.030> will

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
everything all together so that it will

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.510 
everything all together so that it will
make<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.510> nice<00:04:12.780> little<00:04:13.050> barrier<00:04:13.470> so<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.190> put

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
make a nice little barrier so I put

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.150 
make a nice little barrier so I put
several<00:04:14.910> sutures<00:04:15.120> in<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.620> can<00:04:16.799> see<00:04:16.980> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
several sutures in and you can see the
