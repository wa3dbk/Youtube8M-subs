00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello, I'm preparing to move now 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560
 and sorting out the next far box in 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.760
 the closet I stumbled upon in this box with 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.920
 residues from beads 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.210
 of course I said the rest of it now 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.600
 here actually 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.220
 two million beads or how much they 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.200
 just plucked from me from different 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.460
 bags of friends did not buy immediately on 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.710
 portions but 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.180
 I just bought different in my childhood 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.700
 beaded bags 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.010
 the remnants poured into this box 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.740
 and today I found them and want to use 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.660
 in order to make a bracelet right away 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.900
 I want to warn you I work with 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.020
 ordinary cotton thread but it's bad 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.540
 idea because it is unstable 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.190
 and especially when meeting with water and she 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.290
 quickly deteriorate and fall apart 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.170
 These bracelets are best done with 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.640
 fishing line 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.830
 but I have now was not there and and under 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.150
 hand in general the more stable your thread 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.760
 threads will last you a bracelet i 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.540
 took a needle to make it easier to wear 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.390
 because it would be a big torment 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.270
 string every little bead 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.510
 On a thread without needles this of course perhaps 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 then it will be a very long time I took 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.040
 icon 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.710
 and at first I don't take the strings off the potatoes 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.250
 I will wear so much 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.250
 bead to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.610
 in one layer deception of deception 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.720
 the chain could wrap my wrist 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.090
 and now i'm cropped too 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.009
 I will not measure the thread here 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.130
 ahead from the side where the player is and I 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.080
 I will measure about the same twice 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.440
 more than 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:48.900
 then as I am now, and gained more and 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:52.940
 a bit of a reserve and now i'm missing 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:56.510
 three beads and food in the fourth back 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.510
 to turn around 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.900
 now I dress 5 more beads 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.209
 now I will scribble 5 and go to the sixth 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.780
 there is a bead where I don't have to 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.709
 she does not count and from her I consider 1 2 3 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.650
 4 5 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.650
 and in the sixth I pass through with a new race 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:13.920
 I missed this white 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.310
 measured carried it here 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.100
 I'll call 6 I went in now again 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.860
 I also wear 5 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.180
 on it we deserve 6 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.180
 and so i will do here 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:44.689
 having come to the end I'll just tie a bundle 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.879
 and the bracelet will tie for 5 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.409
 so we tie investigate the handle 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.330
 although not 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.240
 even simpler that is just 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.129
 stopped 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.309
 a piece of thread on both sides and I will 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:59.689
 tie there are other options 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:03.559
 sold a special combination with 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:05.479
 hooks and circles then here here 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:09.130
 this little yellow one could wear 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:12.670
 circle on the green 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.850
 hook then you bracelet was buttoned 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:20.150
 if you work with fishing line then usually 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.190
 tying a strong knot and the end is still 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.190
 under the lighter as well as we 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.710
 do with paracord 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.260
 about the picture 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.750
 I want to add that 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.020
 I like motley happened because 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:40.449
 I worked with the remnants 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.449
 you will work with bead sets 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.250
 on 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.650
 let's say you will have only two when 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:50.449
 colors at your disposal then you can 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:55.490
 come up with some kind of pattern i 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:57.020
 here these bows of 5 thousand 5 beads 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.509
 make one color 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:04.219
 the sixth bead is always a different color or 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:07.120
 make like two waves that tango 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:10.070
 cross 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.490
 1st let's say black is another white 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:18.230
 found in the middle of 6 beads 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.230
 3 colors in total and 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.540
