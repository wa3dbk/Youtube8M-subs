00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
all right although I've seen much more

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.490 
all right although I've seen much more
complicated<00:00:22.820> skill<00:00:23.820> trees<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.660> it's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
complicated skill trees but it's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.839 
complicated skill trees but it's
probably<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.920> best<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.460> not<00:00:26.640> too
