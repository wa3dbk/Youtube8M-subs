00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.520
 in this fleeting video I will teach you how to do 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.340
 your own cellophane bags and 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.110
 which is sometimes difficult to achieve and 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.779
 It is easier to get pure paper 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.820
 cellophane in the stationeries so what 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.840
 let's make it fast and easy 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.270
 the materials are cellophane 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.240
 we are also going to need plates of 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.400
 hair we are also going to need some 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.730
 scissors and it's all we're going to 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.559
 need we are going to start unwinding 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.559
 the cellophane paper in this way 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.699
 and from there what follows will be to take one 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.940
 of the ends and put it like this fold it 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.840
 until we get thick what we're going to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.660
 want me to measure in our bag 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.449
 in this case I made a measure of 10 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.689
 centimeters 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.810
 and in the bottom of the long I'm going 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.850
 to make a measure of plus or minus 20 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.850
 centimeters and I'm going to cut out 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.130
 to make a rectangle 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.660
 if they realize the moment of unfolding 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.990
 a bigger rectangle is made now 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.610
 yes we are going to unite it like this and already 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.070
 from there we will take our iron for the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.470
 hair and the only thing we will do is like 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.800
 if we considered the hair we are going to 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.110
 put it in the bag so let's say that 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.530
 let's iron our our paper 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.530
 cellophane 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.649
 you have to give more or less two passes 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.570
 so that it is well attached and does not 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.229
 worry they will not see or burn or 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.229
 nothing like that 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.330
 since we gave our our 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.420
 past we're going to take our scissors and 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.360
 let's cut the excess of the paper 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.740
 stuck just a little remember that not only 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.050
 you're going to remove everything because then you 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.660
 is going to take off again and the only thing that 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.330
 it will be 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.930
 unfold the bag or put it on the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.550
 Turn the other side 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.400
 so it does not look 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.190
 do not look ugly and that part is left 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.130
 inside and we can help from a pen 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.740
 to get this bag right and 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.470
 unfold the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.900
 and with that we finished our bag of 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.900
 cellophane paper very easy to make 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.100
