00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.270
 count 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.790
 this challenge then to download the network back 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.850
 good place just download everything with another 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.810
 file and it's right and left 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.640
 inside another good folder after 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.280
 when they finish compressing all 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:10.670
 folders all the folders and 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.780
 open the report in part 1 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.340
 then they open everything and wash it to open 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.349
 The installer 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.790
