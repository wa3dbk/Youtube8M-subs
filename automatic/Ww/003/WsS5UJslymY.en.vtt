00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.109
 Hello everyone, let's make a point today 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.219
 always with a Tunisian crochet hook a stitch 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.530
 fabric this is the front and this 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.450
 will be the back 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.730
 and beautiful on both sides depends 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
 what we want to do this too 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.170
 very simple 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 then we begin to recognize the point 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.000
 that will be there will be a point with the no's 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.880
 in the background is a point without a knot a 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 colmotino point and a point without knot 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.030
 alternate and 11 our work will begin 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.610
 normally with a chain that one 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.610
 crochet base stitch line 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.850
 Tunisian when we start a 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.190
 do the real point, and our own 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.690
 work will be done in this way where 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.160
 we find the point with the grandfather 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.100
 we have to do over a point without 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.830
 nodino so vice versa where we find a 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.229
 point without anodine we have to do above 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.630
 a point with the knot so now 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.290
 we have the point with dinho 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.770
 so we have to start by taking the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.170
 vertical bar and at the same time 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.330
 also the bar and the front bar of the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.240
 horizontal chain 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.970
 so these two points throw out the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:37.280
 thread and I make the point where instead I find 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.159
 the point without the knot start doing 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.100
 I take the thread I do the same point as 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.399
 first under the vertical bar and behind 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.710
 the chain bar pull out the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:56.250
 point and step the two points I have 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.700
 on the crochet, let's start again 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.579
 here is the little grandmother then I take 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.560
 directly the vertical bar la 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.530
 chain a strand of the cat 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.910
 is the shot out the point is ours 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.130
 point is made 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.380
 here there is no reason why we have to 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.849
 do that with knots 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:26.069
 take the vertical bar wire 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:26.069
 Chain shot off the point and nonino 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.819
 then this of course you will do it 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.739
 from the beginning on a basis point basis a 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.010
 of the Tunisian crochet therefore you will be 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.160
 making the first line below not 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.830
 you will find this situation important 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.690
 it's starting to make them alternate and then 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.160
 from the second line onwards of course 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.110
 work this way 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.670
 we try to do as this is a 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.130
 video test and listen with and directly 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.200
 even just listening once that 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.200
 you have seen the point in such a way that 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.230
 it is easier to continue with the work 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.280
 then he sees a sheep then directly 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.380
 in the vertical bar in the chain 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.370
 took out the point and stop 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:19.140
 I don't see a knot I take the bar thread 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.350
 vertical chain pull out the stitch 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.160
 and nodino see dino so I go 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.299
 directly vertical chain bar 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.940
 shot out point and stop 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:39.760
 I don't see until I make wine then 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:45.090
 I take the thread vertical chain bars 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.090
 throw out the stitch and knot 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.350
 vertical chain bar pulled out the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:00.630
 point I take the vertical bar thread 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:04.989
 chain stitch out point and knot 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.340
 vertical chain bar pull out the 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:12.090
 point 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:19.389
 I take the vertical bar chain thread 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:24.930
 shot out point and knot bar 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:29.470
 vertical chain pull out the stitch 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:35.760
 I take the vertical bar chain thread 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.760
 he pulled out the dot and nudino 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.210
 vertical bar chain pull out the 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.840
 point 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:55.680
 I take the vertical bar chain thread 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:05:00.830
 throw off the point and knot bar 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:06.750
 vertical chain pull out the stitch 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:09.510
 I take the thread at the last point as at 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:16.680
 usually with the 2 point with the two bars 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:23.490
 vertical of the last point shot out 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:32.400
 the point is knot at this usual point 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:36.240
 return line a point and sorry and two 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.810
 points at a time until the end in 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.810
 our work 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:50.550
 this is also a simple point here 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:55.380
 I'm doing it with a very thick blade 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:58.440
 with a 12 crochet hook and I'm getting ready 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.550
 a pillow is a point that fits 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:07.230
 certainly for a processing of a 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.930
 certain relief but was made to 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.230
 example also with a lot of yarn 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:18.690
 thin for a very fluffy scarf 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:23.850
 very nice so a bit is indicated 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:27.360
 everything is enough to like it then with 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.540
 this we ended up useless that 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.310
 continue with the usual reiterated that the 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.570
 usual return line that much now 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.600
 we all know well 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:41.570
 I'll show you the front of the 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.570
 work the back 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.640
 and this is our new point today 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.090
 in the series listen and try hi to all 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.090
 good job
