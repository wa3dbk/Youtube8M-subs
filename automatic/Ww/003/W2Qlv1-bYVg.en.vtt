00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
tab so all right now what I find about

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.830 
tab so all right now what I find about
this<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.040> pretty<00:01:17.250> annoying<00:01:17.430> because

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
this is it's pretty annoying because

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.060 
this is it's pretty annoying because
every<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.590> access<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
every time you want to get access to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.030 
every time you want to get access to
that<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.520> you'll<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.090> scroll<00:01:21.780> down

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
that is you'll have to scroll down

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.800 
that is you'll have to scroll down
instead<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.430> tapping<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:24.540> perhaps

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
instead of just tapping it or perhaps

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.130 
instead of just tapping it or perhaps
just<00:01:25.110> may<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:25.860> permanent<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.729> there<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.780> you

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
just may be permanent in there so you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
just may be permanent in there so you
have<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.439> access<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.100> you'll<00:01:29.310> have

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
have to get access with that you'll have

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
have to get access with that you'll have
to<00:01:29.640> scroll<00:01:30.420> down<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:32.390> go<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> tabs<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.110> or

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
to scroll down just to go to tabs or or

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
to scroll down just to go to tabs or or
you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> menu<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:35.790> well<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.180> as

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.300 

and<00:03:18.270> here's<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.810> text<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.620> don't<00:03:19.830> really<00:03:20.010> see

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
and here's the text you don't really see

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.290 
and here's the text you don't really see
that<00:03:20.550> much<00:03:20.930> pixelated<00:03:21.930> or<00:03:22.470> much<00:03:23.040> pixels<00:03:23.580> so

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
that much pixelated or much pixels so

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.940 
that much pixelated or much pixels so
that's<00:03:24.660> what<00:03:25.170> other<00:03:25.380> thing<00:03:25.650> that's<00:03:25.830> really

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
that's what other thing that's really

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.020 
that's what other thing that's really
nice<00:03:26.670> about<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:28.160> what<00:03:29.160> absol<00:03:29.520> said<00:03:29.730> when<00:03:30.000> you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
nice about it what absol said when you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.990 
nice about it what absol said when you
zoom<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.959> zoom<00:03:30.990> out<00:03:31.520> it<00:03:32.520> takes<00:03:32.760> time<00:03:32.970> to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
zoom in and zoom out it takes time to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.680 
zoom in and zoom out it takes time to
render<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.990> find<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.500> be<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:35.180> downside<00:03:36.180> on

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
render so I find it to be a downside on

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.440 
render so I find it to be a downside on
the<00:03:36.900> browser<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.490> I'm<00:03:39.209> pretty<00:03:39.360> sure

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
the browser of this and I'm pretty sure

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.430 
the browser of this and I'm pretty sure
that's<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.750> same<00:03:39.930> as<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.440> one<00:03:41.100> nexus<00:03:41.400> wall<00:03:41.700> so

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
that's the same as the one nexus wall so

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.090 
that's the same as the one nexus wall so
with<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.820> samsung<00:03:44.820> galaxy<00:03:44.850> s3<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:46.110> even<00:03:46.980> the
