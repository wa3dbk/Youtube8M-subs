00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
well like look at Mudkip stats are like

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.690 
well like look at Mudkip stats are like
not<00:03:23.830> even<00:03:23.920> half<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.340> bratli

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
not even half of bratli

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.190 
not even half of bratli
Mudkip<00:03:25.060> starts<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.360> rob<00:03:25.510> like<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.720> third<00:03:25.989> of

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
Mudkip starts to rob like a third of

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.680 
Mudkip starts to rob like a third of
what<00:03:26.290> grinds<00:03:26.709> are<00:03:26.920> but<00:03:27.130> it's<00:03:28.000> it's<00:03:28.510> really

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
what grinds are but it's it's really

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.630 
what grinds are but it's it's really
silly<00:03:28.989> but<00:03:29.230> yeah<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:29.800> I<00:03:29.860> made<00:03:30.010> sure<00:03:30.040> nobody<00:03:30.400> can

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
silly but yeah so I made sure nobody can

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.479 
silly but yeah so I made sure nobody can
get<00:03:30.730> any<00:03:30.760> Legendary's<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:32.310> yeah<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.370> just

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
get any Legendary's and yeah I just

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.860 
get any Legendary's and yeah I just
think<00:03:33.910> Legendary's<00:03:34.480> are<00:03:34.570> pretty<00:03:34.720> much<00:03:34.810> just

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
think Legendary's are pretty much just

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.070 
think Legendary's are pretty much just
banned<00:03:35.200> period<00:03:35.709> except<00:03:36.640> maybe<00:03:37.510> static

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
banned period except maybe static

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.840 
banned period except maybe static
Pokemon<00:03:38.530> I'm<00:03:38.680> not<00:03:38.830> too<00:03:38.950> sure<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.370> think<00:03:39.760> I

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
Pokemon I'm not too sure I think I

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.250 
Pokemon I'm not too sure I think I
randomized<00:03:40.269> that<00:03:40.480> completely<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.050> you<00:03:41.080> can

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
randomized that completely so you can

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.680 
randomized that completely so you can
have<00:03:41.350> anything<00:03:41.860> I'm<00:03:42.280> not<00:03:42.459> entirely<00:03:42.760> sure<00:03:42.940> I'll

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
have anything I'm not entirely sure I'll

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.229 
have anything I'm not entirely sure I'll
exactly<00:03:44.080> remember<00:03:44.530> but<00:03:44.580> look<00:03:45.580> it's<00:03:45.910> spell

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
exactly remember but look it's spell

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.690 
exactly remember but look it's spell

of the cool things about Pokemon emerald

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.930 
of the cool things about Pokemon emerald
