welcome<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:08.970> diatonic<00:00:09.750> Murs<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
welcome to the diatonic Murs the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.709 
welcome to the diatonic Murs the
diatonic<00:00:11.370> modes<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.150> seven<00:00:12.540> most

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
diatonic modes are the seven most

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.589 
diatonic modes are the seven most
derived<00:00:13.320> from<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.830> diatonic<00:00:14.400> scale<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.089> what

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
derived from the diatonic scale and what

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.140 
derived from the diatonic scale and what
is<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.230> diatonic<00:00:16.770> scale<00:00:17.070> well<00:00:17.369> that's<00:00:17.850> just

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
is the diatonic scale well that's just

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660 
is the diatonic scale well that's just
your<00:00:18.359> old<00:00:18.510> major<00:00:18.840> scale<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.439> why<00:00:20.130> call<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
your old major scale so why call it the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.550 
your old major scale so why call it the
diatonic<00:00:21.150> scale<00:00:21.510> well<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> word<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.199> actually

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
diatonic scale well the word is actually

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.920 
diatonic scale well the word is actually
quite<00:00:22.710> useful<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.359> know<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.779> have

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
quite useful because as you know we have

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
quite useful because as you know we have
a<00:00:24.960> scale<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:25.769> seven<00:00:26.250> names<00:00:26.519> depending

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
a scale here with seven names depending

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.320 
a scale here with seven names depending
on<00:00:27.779> what<00:00:28.019> note<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.920> scale<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.550> consider<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
on what note in the scale we consider to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.010 
on what note in the scale we consider to
be<00:00:30.480> our<00:00:30.510> home<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.859> if<00:00:32.309> I'm<00:00:32.759> looking<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.809> C

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
be our home so if I'm looking at the C

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.220 
be our home so if I'm looking at the C
major<00:00:34.290> scale<00:00:34.590> from<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> perspective<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.230> C

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
major scale from the perspective of C

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:48.020 
major scale from the perspective of C
major<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> let<00:00:45.510> me<00:00:45.539> first<00:00:45.719> define<00:00:46.610> mastery<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
major so let me first define mastery the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.680 
major so let me first define mastery the
way<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> use<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> word<00:00:49.640> mastery<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.910> turning

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
way I use the word mastery is turning

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
way I use the word mastery is turning
something<00:00:52.020> very<00:00:52.710> difficult<00:00:53.340> into<00:00:53.820> something

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
something very difficult into something

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.020 
something very difficult into something
very<00:00:54.660> very<00:00:55.170> easy<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.070> sounds<00:00:56.640> simple<00:00:56.850> right

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
very very easy it sounds simple right

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.200 
very very easy it sounds simple right
but<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.960> most<00:00:58.140> people<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.129> isn't<00:00:59.430> simple<00:01:00.030> at

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
but for most people this isn't simple at

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
but for most people this isn't simple at
all<00:01:00.359> most<00:01:01.079> people<00:01:01.469> who<00:01:01.559> begin<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> play<00:01:02.280> guitar

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
all most people who begin to play guitar

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
all most people who begin to play guitar
are<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.510> busy<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.229> myself<00:01:04.650> included<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:06.200> so

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
are so busy and myself included are so

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710 
are so busy and myself included are so
busy<00:01:07.500> learning<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.130> lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.729> stuff<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.270> they

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
busy learning a lot of stuff that they

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.109 
busy learning a lot of stuff that they
don't<00:01:09.960> master<00:01:10.619> anything<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.460> well<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
don't master anything really well and

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.719 
don't master anything really well and
the<00:01:12.960> reason<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.189> humans

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the reason for this is that we humans

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.630 
the reason for this is that we humans
are<00:01:14.909> impatient<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.140> impatience<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> drive

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
are impatient this impatience is a drive

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.450 
are impatient this impatience is a drive
that<00:01:18.210> makes<00:01:18.509> us<00:01:18.689> achieve<00:01:19.140> things<00:01:19.590> faster<00:01:20.280> if

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that makes us achieve things faster if

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.300 
that makes us achieve things faster if
it's<00:01:21.180> used<00:01:21.659> intelligently<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:23.070> used

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it's used intelligently but used

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.850 
it's used intelligently but used
unintelligibly<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.570> will<00:01:24.930> sabotage<00:01:25.590> your

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
unintelligibly it will sabotage your

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.999 
unintelligibly it will sabotage your
efforts<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.960> impatience<00:01:27.960> makes<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.650> jump

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
efforts if impatience makes you jump

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249 
efforts if impatience makes you jump
from<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.490> thing<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.909> another<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.869> pursuit

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
from one thing to another in a pursuit

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.130 
from one thing to another in a pursuit
to<00:01:31.770> learn<00:01:32.009> everything<00:01:32.220> all<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:32.909> once<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.960> will

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
to learn everything all at once you will

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.249 
to learn everything all at once you will
end<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.590> knowing<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.630> lot<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.780> things<00:01:36.960> on

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
end up knowing a lot of things on

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.960 
end up knowing a lot of things on
knowing<00:01:37.619> about<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.070> lot<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> things<00:01:38.729> but

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
knowing about a lot of things but

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:54.000 
knowing about a lot of things but
mastering<00:01:39.869> almost<00:01:40.439> nothing

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.500 

but<00:01:55.010> since<00:01:55.220> we<00:01:55.370> have<00:01:55.400> seven<00:01:55.910> different<00:01:56.030> modes

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
but since we have seven different modes

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.480 
but since we have seven different modes
with<00:01:56.930> different<00:01:57.680> up<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.950> tree<00:01:58.160> shapes

level<00:02:09.080> challenge<00:02:09.560> we<00:02:10.160> need<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.700> come<00:02:10.910> up<00:02:10.940> with

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
level challenge we need to come up with

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.680 
level challenge we need to come up with
a<00:02:11.330> system<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:12.470> will<00:02:12.820> simplify<00:02:13.820> all<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.480> this

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
a system that will simplify all of this

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.870 
a system that will simplify all of this
that's<00:02:15.380> why<00:02:15.590> it's<00:02:15.770> called<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.040> system<00:02:16.400> but

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
that's why it's called the system but

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.940 
that's why it's called the system but
that<00:02:17.360> will<00:02:17.540> simplify<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.200> structure<00:02:18.800> it

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
that will simplify it and structure it

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.590 
that will simplify it and structure it
so<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.400> we<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:19.700> understand<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.450> and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
so that we can understand it and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.170 
so that we can understand it and
practice<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.350> an<00:02:21.710> effective<00:02:22.180> systematic

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
practice it in an effective systematic

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.540 
practice it in an effective systematic
and<00:02:23.360> easy<00:02:23.600> way<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.710> system<00:02:25.160> will<00:02:25.280> dictate

and easy way this system will dictate

and easy way this system will dictate
how<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.120> shapes<00:02:26.660> look<00:02:26.990> how<00:02:27.440> we<00:02:27.500> practice

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
how the shapes look how we practice

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.780 
how the shapes look how we practice

using our pedos with the scales and what
we<00:02:32.000> practice<00:02:32.480> first<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.140> last<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.800> great

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
we practice first and last a great

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.700 
we practice first and last a great
system<00:02:35.060> will<00:02:35.210> make<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.510> easy<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.960> absorb<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
system will make it easy to absorb the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.680 
system will make it easy to absorb the
material<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:37.490> will<00:02:37.790> make<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.090> world<00:02:38.360> look

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
material it will make this world look

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.320 
material it will make this world look
simpler<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.590> will<00:02:39.770> show<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.100> an<00:02:40.490> easy<00:02:40.970> and

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
simpler and it will show you an easy and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.080 
simpler and it will show you an easy and
predictable<00:02:41.630> way<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:43.190> conquer<00:02:43.640> these<00:02:43.760> modes

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
predictable way to conquer these modes

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.420 
predictable way to conquer these modes
and<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.840> think<00:02:44.900> you'll<00:02:45.320> find<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.010> modal

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
and I think you'll find that the modal

00:02:46.430 --> 00:03:02.920 
and I think you'll find that the modal
mastery<00:02:46.910> system<00:02:47.360> does<00:02:47.660> just<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.290> for<00:02:48.680> you

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.170 

the<00:03:03.260> ultimate<00:03:03.409> promise<00:03:04.099> of<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.400> system<00:03:04.849> is<00:03:05.030> to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
the ultimate promise of the system is to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.270 
the ultimate promise of the system is to
make<00:03:05.359> you<00:03:05.390> able<00:03:05.719> to<00:03:06.019> play<00:03:06.290> comfortably<00:03:06.680> over

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
make you able to play comfortably over

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.360 
make you able to play comfortably over
any<00:03:08.060> chord<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.930> any<00:03:09.290> chord<00:03:09.620> progression<00:03:10.189> and

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
any chord in any chord progression and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.240 
any chord in any chord progression and
with<00:03:10.819> a<00:03:10.849> maximum<00:03:11.719> number<00:03:12.319> of<00:03:12.469> options<00:03:12.859> to

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
with a maximum number of options to

with a maximum number of options to
choose<00:03:13.549> from<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:14.349> to<00:03:15.349> be<00:03:15.469> able<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.950> shift<00:03:16.280> and

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
choose from and to be able to shift and

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.140 
choose from and to be able to shift and
go<00:03:16.760> from<00:03:17.000> key<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.329> key<00:03:17.569> from<00:03:18.019> mode<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.590> mode

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
go from key to key from mode to mode

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.149 
go from key to key from mode to mode
rapidly<00:03:20.150> without<00:03:20.510> any<00:03:20.900> effort<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.560> thinking

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
rapidly without any effort of thinking

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.500 
rapidly without any effort of thinking
in<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.459> playing<00:03:22.760> situation<00:03:23.620> now<00:03:24.620> if<00:03:25.420> 99%<00:03:26.420> of

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
in the playing situation now if 99% of

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.080 
in the playing situation now if 99% of
the<00:03:26.629> music<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.139> play<00:03:27.409> stay<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.400> same<00:03:28.670> key

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
the music you play stay in the same key

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.209 
the music you play stay in the same key
all<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.629> way<00:03:29.780> through<00:03:30.109> and<00:03:30.349> so<00:03:31.069> you're

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:31.219 
all the way through and so you're

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.129 
all the way through and so you're
basically<00:03:31.370> using<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:32.209> same<00:03:32.450> scale<00:03:32.870> but

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
basically using the same scale but

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.229 
basically using the same scale but
shifting<00:03:33.560> modes<00:03:33.769> only<00:03:34.250> then<00:03:34.849> you<00:03:34.970> don't<00:03:35.180> have

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
shifting modes only then you don't have

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.640 
shifting modes only then you don't have
to<00:03:35.540> spend<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.870> lot<00:03:36.019> of<00:03:36.049> time<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.500> effort

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
to spend a lot of time and effort

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.659 
to spend a lot of time and effort
learning<00:03:37.159> how<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.310> change<00:03:37.669> keys<00:03:38.120> all<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.450> time
