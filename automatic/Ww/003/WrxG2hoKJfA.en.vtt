00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
blackhat was released the idea for the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
blackhat was released the idea for the
storyline<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.890> started<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> unfold<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.420> I

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
storyline just started to unfold and I

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.209 
storyline just started to unfold and I
like<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.989> idea<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.590> actually<00:00:58.710> called

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
like the idea that they actually called

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.580 
like the idea that they actually called
the<00:00:59.370> facility<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.230> blackout<00:01:01.230> weather

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
the facility on blackout weather

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.840 
the facility on blackout weather
stations<00:01:01.980> before<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.399> wanted<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.730> that's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
stations before you wanted so that's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.219 
stations before you wanted so that's
where<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.149> idea<00:01:03.480> started<00:01:03.690> coming<00:01:04.049> from

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
where all the idea started coming from

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.609 
where all the idea started coming from
and<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:05.159> thought<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> was<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:06.000> funny<00:01:06.840> idea<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and I thought it was a funny idea to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.410 
and I thought it was a funny idea to
have<00:01:07.770> these<00:01:07.920> Spartans<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.060> know<00:01:09.150> who<00:01:09.330> were
