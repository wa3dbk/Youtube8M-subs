00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.490 
whole avocado just the flesh scooped out
and<00:00:20.279> chopped<00:00:21.000> up<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.270> little<00:00:21.420> bit<00:00:21.660> into<00:00:22.380> the

little bit so it's smoother and it makes

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.519 
little bit so it's smoother and it makes
better<00:00:26.840> mixes<00:00:27.840> better<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> other

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
a huge deal it doesn't make a huge

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.250 
a huge deal it doesn't make a huge
difference<00:02:22.350> which<00:02:22.530> one<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.830> use<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:25.050> then

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
difference which one you use and then

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.790 
difference which one you use and then

cilantro<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.760> adds<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.300> nice<00:02:30.420> flavor<00:02:31.340> and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
cilantro that adds a nice flavor and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.860 
cilantro that adds a nice flavor and
it's<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.550> little<00:02:32.700> bit<00:02:32.850> different<00:02:33.150> take<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.750> it

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it's a little bit different take in it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.130

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
it's nice for presentation too and then

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.260 
it's nice for presentation too and then
the<00:02:37.230> other<00:02:37.350> thing<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.100> can<00:02:38.130> add<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.880> some

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
the other thing is you can add in some

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.680 
the other thing is you can add in some
minced<00:02:40.200> garlic<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.100> would<00:02:41.340> just<00:02:41.370> take<00:02:41.730> fresh

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
minced garlic so I would just take fresh

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.480 
minced garlic so I would just take fresh
garlic<00:02:43.260> clove<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:43.950> either<00:02:44.130> put<00:02:44.370> it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
garlic clove and you can either put it

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.580 
garlic clove and you can either put it
through<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.360> really<00:02:45.660> fine<00:02:45.870> cheese<00:02:46.200> grater

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
through like a really fine cheese grater

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.090 
through like a really fine cheese grater
or<00:02:47.460> you<00:02:48.270> can<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:48.960> mince<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.680> up<00:02:49.770> with<00:02:49.980> your

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
or you can just mince it up with your

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.010 
or you can just mince it up with your
knife<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.700> takes<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.030> little<00:02:51.150> bit<00:02:51.240> longer<00:02:51.510> but

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
knife that takes a little bit longer but

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.680 
knife that takes a little bit longer but
it's<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.680> same<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.340> make<00:02:54.240> sure<00:02:54.270> it's

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
it's the same and just make sure it's

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.120 
it's the same and just make sure it's
small<00:02:54.900> enough<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.200> it'll<00:02:55.500> blend<00:02:55.770> in<00:02:55.950> there

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
small enough that it'll blend in there

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.380 
small enough that it'll blend in there
really<00:02:56.250> well<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.730> don't<00:02:56.910> bite<00:02:57.120> into<00:02:57.360> a
