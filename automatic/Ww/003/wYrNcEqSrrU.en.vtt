00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.020
 so come on people talked about the tutorial 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.410
 I'll show you here how to defrag the disk 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:09.759
 proc 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.440
 I played that charged the internal trabuco will not appear the button 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.829
 start for you there it is good 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.949
 but I'm going to click on my here on average 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.050
 You click on your bed. 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.720
 will appear and then all programs are not you click on it 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.529
 the young person to have access 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.380
 several parliamentarians from the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.440
 OK 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.650
 dressed as a bearded imitator 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.020
 why there 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.040
 the site click on it etc wait hare 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 Then you have him analyze here the problem is that one confirmed the mark 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300
 or if you prefer the joke worker 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.980
 but the promoter did not 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.270
 the positioning of the thing is not 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.989
 first mine here 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.440
 carol of a new life analysis completed 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.240
 bushehr must decide food and fickle then it means that my 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.960
 is fragmented 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.090
 such a question or click here no one is fragmented 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 there every ten years 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 is doing another analysis is not 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.930
 in case here all these red dots process so great these 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.770
 scratchs 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.130
 all this she created a park that the fragmented 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 which will make the ps take longer 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.610
 to start the work the promoter a program understood 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.970
 so you have to clean the disc 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.780
 if you've been climbing a lot there 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.930
 snow is installing year 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.650
 the pain in a lot of things 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.650
 it's good you let them know if your going food are so good 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.440
 usually a time-consuming process 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.200
 it took me 15 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 twenty minutes 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:15.839
 depending on what you ordered to do, if you get too fragmented 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.809
 It takes longer to find 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.809
 Mine here I have to go well out of the market 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.689
 and just to be able to do this tutorial here right? 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.159
 singer 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.199
 So it does not take too long, I'll have it stopped there. 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.209
 but the surgeon processes it at the very end 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.619
 it just goes from the orcrim that when you click ok 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:47.359
 everything is alright 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.359
 one of the dates is not 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.799
 with Disk Cleanup 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.199
 and I have taught notoriously the previous tutoring 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.199
 What are you doing with your food? 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.659
 You will already see that your pc 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.279
 It's gonna be much faster already. 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.299
 it will get freer, more loose 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.829
 There's not going to be a lot of broken space here from the middle to the harbor. 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:13.739
 fall 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.369
 I think it's the program 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.369
 he will put it all together here 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.129
 and will make what your computer is faster is okay 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.959
 That's it, guys, until next time.
