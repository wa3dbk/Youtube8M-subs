00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 now if it is how they are migrating I have a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.650
 mini because they are three books that I already have 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.820
 and one in a package so if it 's very 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.009
 tiny the first book that I want 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.080
 show is one that when I went to deliver 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.109

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.449
 book that was copying the boy was 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.010
 flame of the two faces of playboy in

 script you sound then you have half weird 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.109

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.450
 something else so if the two 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.219
 faces of Maria's lawsuit meant menÃ©ndez 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.480

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.360
 like 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.620

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.260

 the passenger of the opposites this book 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.260
 It is not terrorism itself is 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.120

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.100
 time for terrorism and that now

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.520
 the page that you do not have to be creative 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.149
