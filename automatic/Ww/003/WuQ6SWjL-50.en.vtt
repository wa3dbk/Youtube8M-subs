monitors on your macbook in this segment

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.480 
monitors on your macbook in this segment
we're<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:20.820> look<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.360> spaces<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:23.130> recall

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
we're going to look at spaces you recall

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.010 
we're going to look at spaces you recall
that<00:00:23.700> in<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:23.939> earlier<00:00:24.210> segment<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.720> had<00:00:24.900> you

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
that in the earlier segment I had you

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.620 
that in the earlier segment I had you
disabled<00:00:25.650> spaces<00:00:26.460> temporarily<00:00:27.270> and<00:00:27.540> now

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
disabled spaces temporarily and now

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.540 
disabled spaces temporarily and now
you'll<00:00:27.840> find<00:00:28.079> out<00:00:28.230> why<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.220> we're<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.399> to<00:00:29.520> go

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
you'll find out why so we're going to go

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.979 
you'll find out why so we're going to go
into<00:00:29.700> system<00:00:30.119> preferences<00:00:32.630> either<00:00:33.630> from<00:00:33.840> the

doc or you from the Apple menu and click
on<00:00:37.620> expose<00:00:38.220> and<00:00:38.399> spaces<00:00:39.380> going<00:00:40.380> to<00:00:40.500> enable

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
on expose and spaces going to enable

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.570 
on expose and spaces going to enable
spaces<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.480> having<00:00:42.810> it<00:00:42.930> show<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.740> the<00:00:43.980> menu

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
spaces I like having it show in the menu

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.480 
spaces I like having it show in the menu
bar<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:45.000> well<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.450> see<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.740> six<00:00:47.460> spaces

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
bar as well I see here I have six spaces

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.440 
bar as well I see here I have six spaces
but<00:00:50.490> the<00:00:50.700> thing<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> keep<00:00:51.240> in<00:00:51.420> mind

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
but the thing you have to keep in mind

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.220 
but the thing you have to keep in mind
now<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.380> that<00:00:52.710> each<00:00:53.190> space<00:00:53.730> has<00:00:54.150> two<00:00:54.510> monitors

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
now is that each space has two monitors

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.830 
now is that each space has two monitors
so<00:00:56.220> I'm<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.400> to<00:00:56.460> leave<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.060> or<00:00:57.630> we

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
so I'm going to leave this here or we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.520 
so I'm going to leave this here or we
can<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.380> i<00:00:58.620> click<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.579> spaces<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.630> you'll

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
can see it i click on spaces and you'll

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.020 
can see it i click on spaces and you'll
see<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.890> we're<00:01:02.040> now<00:01:02.220> confronted<00:01:02.790> with<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
see that we're now confronted with a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.370 
see that we're now confronted with a
huge<00:01:03.510> array<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:04.400> windows<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.820> pick<00:01:06.000> from<00:01:06.380> so

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
huge array of windows to pick from so

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
huge array of windows to pick from so
this<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.820> space<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.970> this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> screen

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
this is space one and this is the screen

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
this is space one and this is the screen
of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.079> mac<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.979> space<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.640> it's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
of the mac this is space one and it's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.040 
of the mac this is space one and it's
the<00:01:18.510> screen<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:22.370> new<00:01:23.370> monitor<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
the screen of the new monitor this is

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.110 
the screen of the new monitor this is
spaced<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.780> Mac<00:01:27.780> new<00:01:28.530> monitor<00:01:29.120> space<00:01:30.120> 3<00:01:30.479> 4<00:01:31.080> 5<00:01:31.530> 6

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
spaced to Mac new monitor space 3 4 5 6

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.740 
spaced to Mac new monitor space 3 4 5 6
so<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.270> thing<00:01:33.510> is<00:01:33.870> is<00:01:34.260> that<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.510> can<00:01:36.510> get<00:01:36.690> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
so the thing is is that you can get a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.390 
so the thing is is that you can get a
little<00:01:36.960> bit<00:01:37.200> confused<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.250> moving

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
little bit confused when you're moving

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.620 
little bit confused when you're moving
around<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.650> find<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.830> helps<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.460> initially<00:01:42.390> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
around I find it helps if initially you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.660 
around I find it helps if initially you
have<00:01:42.840> fewer<00:01:43.729> spaces<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.430> quite

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
have fewer spaces so that it's not quite

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.390 
have fewer spaces so that it's not quite
so<00:01:47.880> difficult<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.930> look<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.320> because<00:01:50.010> here<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
so difficult to look at because here you

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.830 
so difficult to look at because here you
see<00:01:50.580> have<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:51.060> two<00:01:51.570> three<00:01:52.610> four<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
see have one two three four and then the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.700 
see have one two three four and then the
ones<00:01:55.080> on<00:01:55.850> left<00:01:56.850> side<00:01:57.119> will<00:01:57.540> always<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:58.080> your

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
ones on left side will always be your

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.710 
ones on left side will always be your
secondary<00:01:59.310> monitor<00:01:59.610> if<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.330> where<00:02:00.540> your

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
secondary monitor if that's where your

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.649 
secondary monitor if that's where your
monitor<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:02.760> will<00:02:02.939> vary<00:02:03.180> depending<00:02:03.270> on

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
monitor is it will vary depending on

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.309 
monitor is it will vary depending on
where<00:02:04.049> your<00:02:04.500> new<00:02:06.680> monitor<00:02:07.680> sits<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> is

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
where your new monitor sits so this is

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.380 
where your new monitor sits so this is
turning<00:02:10.649> spaces<00:02:11.099> back<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> dual<00:02:11.909> monitor

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
turning spaces back on in a dual monitor

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.660 
turning spaces back on in a dual monitor
just<00:02:13.319> takes<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.769> little<00:02:13.920> bit<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.129> getting<00:02:14.519> used

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
just takes a little bit of getting used

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.409 
just takes a little bit of getting used
to<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.299> then<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.379> just<00:02:16.590> fine<00:02:17.299> bear<00:02:18.299> in

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:18.419 
to and then you can do just fine bear in

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.239 
to and then you can do just fine bear in
mind<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.659> this<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.989> multiple<00:02:19.529> part<00:02:19.829> series

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:20.249 
mind that this is a multiple part series

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:32.670 
mind that this is a multiple part series
and<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.459> sure<00:02:20.609> to<00:02:20.639> listen<00:02:20.939> to<00:02:21.120> all<00:02:21.269> five<00:02:21.659> parts

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.739 

you
