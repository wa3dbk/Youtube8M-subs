00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
have a following because as you can see

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.530 
have a following because as you can see
it<00:00:38.760> has<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> very<00:00:39.120> sleek<00:00:40.969> modernistic<00:00:41.969> shape

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it has a very sleek modernistic shape

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.080 
it has a very sleek modernistic shape
that<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.350> very<00:00:43.620> simple<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.160> use<00:00:44.190> actually<00:00:44.879> too

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
that is very simple to use actually too

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.569 
that is very simple to use actually too
so<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.829> essentially<00:00:46.829> quite<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> handy<00:00:47.430> little

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so it's essentially quite a handy little

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
camera it has a collapsible lens and you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
camera it has a collapsible lens and you
would<00:00:53.370> open<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.239> how<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> would<00:00:54.719> look

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
would open it this is how it would look

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.439 
would open it this is how it would look
in<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.170> close<00:00:55.410> position<00:00:55.980> okay<00:00:56.670> you'd<00:00:57.329> open

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
in this close position okay you'd open

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.770 
in this close position okay you'd open
it<00:00:57.719> by<00:00:57.840> holding<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:59.000> front<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> lens<00:01:00.420> back

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
it by holding the front of the lens back

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.360 
it by holding the front of the lens back
a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:01.050> bit<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.859> moving<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
a little bit and then just moving it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.390 
a little bit and then just moving it
towards<00:01:02.640> infinity<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.559> it's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
towards infinity and there you go it's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
towards infinity and there you go it's
not<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> rangefinder<00:01:06.299> camera<00:01:06.659> per<00:01:06.840> se<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.470> has

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
not a rangefinder camera per se it has

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.630 
not a rangefinder camera per se it has
just<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.159> destination<00:01:09.000> type<00:01:09.390> distance

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
just a destination type distance

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
focusing system which you would just

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.700 
focusing system which you would just
read<00:01:13.770> your<00:01:13.979> distances<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.150> feed<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.470> lens

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
read your distances and feed on the lens

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
again in which case it would close the B

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.980 
again in which case it would close the B
is<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> only<00:01:37.320> open<00:01:37.560> while<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> shutter

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
is to only open while the shutter

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.440 
is to only open while the shutter
releases<00:01:39.990> down<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.159> lever<00:01:41.610> here

releases down which is this lever here
as<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:44.270> F<00:01:45.270> stops<00:01:45.630> are<00:01:45.840> between<00:01:46.079> F<00:01:46.350> 4

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
as you can see F stops are between F 4

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.410 
as you can see F stops are between F 4
and<00:01:46.710> F<00:01:46.920> 16<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.090> about<00:01:48.240> you're

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
but when you look through it you see a a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.350 
but when you look through it you see a a
grayscale<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.750> darkens<00:02:21.319> from<00:02:21.790> from<00:02:22.790> left<00:02:23.239> to

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
grayscale that darkens from from left to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.430 
grayscale that darkens from from left to
right<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.160> each<00:02:25.160> each<00:02:25.540> segment<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.870> numbered

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
right and each each segment is numbered

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.040 
right and each each segment is numbered
and<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.890> would<00:02:28.280> use<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:29.030> calculate<00:02:29.510> your

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
and you would use this to calculate your

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.790 
and you would use this to calculate your
exposure<00:02:30.440> using<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.099> somewhat<00:02:32.030> complicated

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
exposure using this somewhat complicated

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.650 
exposure using this somewhat complicated
dial<00:02:33.800> on<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.220> back<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.700> camera<00:02:34.940> actually

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
dial on the back of the camera actually

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.330 
dial on the back of the camera actually
it's<00:02:35.780> easier<00:02:36.110> just<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.620> use<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.069> film

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
it's easier just to use the film

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.729 
it's easier just to use the film
instructions<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.720> figure<00:02:39.019> out<00:02:39.140> your<00:02:39.319> exposure

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
instructions to figure out your exposure

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.870 
instructions to figure out your exposure
I<00:02:40.099> mean<00:02:40.670> with<00:02:40.790> an<00:02:40.880> f4<00:02:41.300> lens<00:02:42.550> you're<00:02:43.550> not<00:02:43.700> going

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
I mean with an f4 lens you're not going

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.650 
I mean with an f4 lens you're not going
to<00:02:43.940> take<00:02:44.330> many<00:02:44.540> pictures<00:02:44.600> outside<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:46.660> broad

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
to take many pictures outside of broad

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.370 
to take many pictures outside of broad
daylight<00:02:47.690> anyway<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:50.780> know<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.170> is

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
daylight anyway so you know this is

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.000 
daylight anyway so you know this is
pretty<00:02:51.709> much<00:02:51.830> an<00:02:52.100> outdoor<00:02:52.430> type<00:02:52.700> camera<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
pretty much an outdoor type camera to

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.590 
pretty much an outdoor type camera to
open<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.519> back<00:02:55.670> let<00:02:55.880> me<00:02:55.910> close<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.420> lens

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
open the back let me close the lens

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.110 
open the back let me close the lens
first<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.410> open<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.739> back<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.250> would<00:03:00.819> open<00:03:01.819> up

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
first to open the back you would open up

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.339 
first to open the back you would open up
this<00:03:02.330> little<00:03:04.330> deepening<00:03:05.330> here<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.900> then<00:03:06.019> you

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
this little deepening here and then you

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.900 
this little deepening here and then you
know<00:03:06.880> open<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:07.970> up<00:03:08.090> like<00:03:08.239> that<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:09.410> would

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
know open it up like that and you would

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.850 
know open it up like that and you would
blow<00:03:10.910> your<00:03:11.120> camera<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.660> usual<00:03:12.019> fashion<00:03:12.440> it
