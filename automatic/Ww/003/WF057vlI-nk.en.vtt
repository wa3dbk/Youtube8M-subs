00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.740
 hello how about youtube friends we are going to 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.660
 make a review about an application 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.490
 to use in any of our 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.939
 Android this application is a 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.800
 add-on to the well-known launcher 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.580
 by many of us called goal 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.230
 launcher ex and good this time we are going to 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.780
 review the application that is for 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.260
 change the way to block our 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.019
 device this application is this go 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.210
 lakers I comment you have to have 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:45.829
 installed before the goal to an ex-being that 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.990
 they find it for free directly in the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.140
 with the plays thor 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.060
 is this one here 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.390
 like being a little more blue 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.850
 and it's completely free it's a launcher 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.430
 completely customizable is very 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.220
 friendly and has many options for 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.490
 customization this launcher what we 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.590
 allows to do is this configure our 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.820
 phone in this way right now has 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.760
 an appearance of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.810
 of helbing and well lets us 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.280
 have this kind of animations 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.189
 of widgets this calendar and good 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.100
 here some bars to finish the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.170
 processes this also allows us 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.450
 modify the driver 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.119
 to get quite effects 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.830
 interesting but I recommend that what 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.899
 install 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.720
 I think my favorite in terms of 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.450
 launchers and it's not that heavy depending 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.850
 how many add-ons do you put 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.900
 since it has enough from the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.990
 more complete 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.450
 but it works pretty well is 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.840
 extremely customizable they have 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.150
 many widgets from the launcher as well 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.010
 that I recommend them so good one 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.810
 once they have installed an ex-goal 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.920
 let's go directly to the place 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.819
 tour 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.749
 and let's find him 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.749
 position 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.510
 here 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.130
 is this one here just as it is 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.500
 completely free 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.630
 and I have it installed here 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.370
 and good once you have when 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.270
 press the home button I 'm going to 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.580
 ask what is this going to 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.220
 want by default what application you 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.460
 we are going to give the popcorn of crosses for the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.030
 faot the go locker and ready there he returns 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.010
 to the original launcher and we can already 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.780
 start occupying this application we 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.670
 it serves to block our respective 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.670
 differently since then and we 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.200
 we get bored sometimes this is the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.590
 traditional way to unlock this 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.860
 phone in this i sense interface 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.600
 htc sense and good is this to slide 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.800
 down but if you do not like it then 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.650
 congo what we are going to be able to modify that 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.720
 type of iu 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.360
 of animation or type of view so there's 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.579
 version there are paid themes and free themes 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.920
 right now we are going to use 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.519
 the free ones so that they see that therefore 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.409
 has many many very complete topics 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.010
 same and good here you can find them 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.799
 directly in the store inside the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.230
 launcher or directly on the place thor 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:42.079
 here I already have some installed and then 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.030
 as you will see then this one here I am going to 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.209
 enable the options we give here 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.510
 where it says in the book and placed so 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.290
 let's see and right now I have to select the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.290
 text the default 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.030
 and well we give play so once 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.700
 that we blocked our device that 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.299
 let's have a different way of 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.980
 unblock and good something some a guy 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.299
 different from clock and good more 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.069
 information and we can access the 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.860
 external phone of our messages 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.880
 in this way we slide into any 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.330
 of the two there are many many themes and 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.030
 free and equal pay like this one we give to 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.780
 play 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.270
 We tested it 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.760
 and as you can see then there already 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.200
 and change the way to unlock 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.410
 our device so very 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.740
 interesting here we unlock dried and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.740
 tube 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.610
 and we leave it sharp and ready 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.270
 and there are quite a few and very simple ones 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.400
 others not so much but certainly all are 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.029
 very interesting and worth it 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.029
 review them 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.590
 this is depending on where we slide 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.630
 the way that will unlock our 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.760
 device open the phone the 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.790
 messages or in a log from here 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.529
 and we have another one here that has some 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.000
 views 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:15.160
 we lock it again unlocking it 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.250
 and as you can see there changes 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.250
 quite our screen of a loc 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.729
 it's a question of trying 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:29.799
 very many not the very simple this one 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.799
 has like the scream sandwich theme 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.550
 but it is a very good option for 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.490
 change the visual aspect of our 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.219
 device part has another section in 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.310
 the 70 you can configure more 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:47.790
 things 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.040
 as security what of the date the 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.440
 background if they want me to change that 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.280
 be the one that brings by default also what 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.250
 can modify 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.160
 so it's a matter of you 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.000
 go try it 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.310
 and find some subject of your liking 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.409
 also there I comment versions of 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.889
 pay 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:16.989
 this same very interesting so 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:18.699
 well this is the go locker is 

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:20.679
 compatible with any this 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.589
 Android device as long as 

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:25.780

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:30.010
 hex launcher 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:32.610
 so good try it is a very good 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:36.720
 option is a very interesting way of 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:39.080
 change the view of your device 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.990

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.699
