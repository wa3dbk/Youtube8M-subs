00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
work together so it's a bit of a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.400 
work together so it's a bit of a
playhouse<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.510> way<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.840> you're<00:02:34.020> trying<00:02:34.260> to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
playhouse in a way that you're trying to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.140 
playhouse in a way that you're trying to
create<00:02:34.560> around<00:02:35.310> yourself<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.910> make<00:02:36.030> you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
create around yourself to make you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
create around yourself to make you
perform<00:02:36.450> better<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.590> possible<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.100> have

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
perform better is it possible to have

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.160 
perform better is it possible to have
too<00:02:38.580> much<00:02:38.610> success<00:02:39.090> at<00:02:39.480> too<00:02:39.600> young<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.870> an<00:02:40.020> age

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
too much success at too young of an age

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.360 
too much success at too young of an age
I<00:02:41.510> think<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.810> know<00:02:42.930> success<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:43.860> be<00:02:43.890> divided

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
I think you know success can be divided

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.520 
I think you know success can be divided
in<00:02:44.640> many<00:02:45.090> different<00:02:45.330> terms<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.959> think<00:02:46.200> people

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
in many different terms I think people

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.340 
in many different terms I think people
see<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.160> very<00:02:47.400> different<00:02:47.640> way<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.810> think<00:02:49.290> I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
see it in a very different way I think I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.050 
see it in a very different way I think I
gained<00:02:49.560> success<00:02:50.010> from<00:02:50.280> an<00:02:50.370> early<00:02:50.610> age<00:02:50.640> because

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
gained success from an early age because

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.640 
gained success from an early age because
I<00:02:51.209> accomplished<00:02:51.780> something<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.350> court

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
I accomplished something on the court

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.110 
I accomplished something on the court
but<00:02:52.709> then<00:02:53.010> everything<00:02:53.220> else<00:02:53.490> that<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.850> gained

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
but then everything else that I gained

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.060 
but then everything else that I gained
from<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.780> don't<00:02:55.470> think<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.770> could<00:02:55.980> have

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
from that I don't think I could have

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.610 
from that I don't think I could have
prepared<00:02:56.250> myself<00:02:56.640> for<00:02:56.970> because<00:02:57.540> when<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.990> you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
prepared myself for because when you you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.080 
prepared myself for because when you you
know<00:02:58.650> look<00:02:58.920> towards<00:02:59.220> winning<00:02:59.520> Wimbledon<00:02:59.940> or

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
know look towards winning Wimbledon or

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.730
