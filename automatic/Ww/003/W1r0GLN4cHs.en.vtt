neck which I've made first and then what

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.100 
neck which I've made first and then what
I'll<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.890> I'll<00:00:29.220> place<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:31.579> on<00:00:32.690> here<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I'll do is I'll place it on here and the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
a exacto knife a lot of times what I'll

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.100 
a exacto knife a lot of times what I'll
do<00:00:40.469> because<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.190> same<00:00:41.430> width<00:00:42.110> is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
do because this is the same width is

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.310 
do because this is the same width is
I'll<00:00:43.260> put<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.890> way<00:00:44.690> I'll<00:00:45.690> clamp<00:00:46.050> these

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I'll put it this way I'll clamp these

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
I'll put it this way I'll clamp these
down<00:00:46.649> right<00:00:46.920> where<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:50.750> use

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
down right where I want it and then use

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.709 
down right where I want it and then use
the<00:00:51.899> exacto<00:00:52.469> knife<00:00:52.710> around<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:54.270> score

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the exacto knife around that to score

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.139 
the exacto knife around that to score
this<00:00:55.320> edge<00:00:56.180> then<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.879> part

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
this edge then what I do is the part

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.160 
this edge then what I do is the part
within<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.780> V<00:01:01.760> I'll<00:01:02.760> remove<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.960> there's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
within the V I'll remove that so there's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.219 
within the V I'll remove that so there's
maybe<00:01:04.409> about<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.830> quarter<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> an<00:01:05.519> inch<00:01:09.229> carved

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
maybe about a quarter of an inch carved

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.560 
maybe about a quarter of an inch carved
out<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.670> close<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.299> line

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
out here and get as close to this line

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.340 
out here and get as close to this line
as<00:01:12.780> possible<00:01:13.280> then<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:15.650> I<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
as possible then what I do is I get the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.210 
as possible then what I do is I get the
the<00:01:19.350> angle<00:01:19.740> plate<00:01:20.009> machine<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.670> angle<00:01:21.060> plate

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
the angle plate machine this angle plate

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.450 
the angle plate machine this angle plate
and<00:01:23.360> slowly<00:01:24.360> walk<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.840> back<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.650> line<00:01:26.070> so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and slowly walk it back to that line so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
and slowly walk it back to that line so
like<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> say<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.720> instance<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.200> were<00:01:28.320> doing

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
like it say for instance if I were doing

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.789 
like it say for instance if I were doing
this<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.420> doing<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.170> exactly<00:01:31.680> on

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
this one and I'm not doing it exactly on

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.440 
this one and I'm not doing it exactly on
that<00:01:33.860> line<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> has<00:01:35.549> already<00:01:35.909> cut<00:01:36.180> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that line because this has already cut I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.039 
that line because this has already cut I
would<00:01:36.930> clamp<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.530> down<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.630> would<00:01:39.689> take

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
would clamp this down and I would take

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.499 
would clamp this down and I would take
my<00:01:40.350> parent<00:01:41.189> izl<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:44.240> carve<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> out

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
my parent izl and I would carve it out

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.289 
my parent izl and I would carve it out
this<00:01:45.930> way<00:01:46.200> using<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.430> angle<00:01:47.820> plate<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
this way using the angle plate is a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.370 
this way using the angle plate is a
guide<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.560> would<00:01:49.740> carve<00:01:50.189> out<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.460> wall

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
guide and I would carve out that wall

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.160 
guide and I would carve out that wall
and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:53.009> matter<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.780> trial<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and then it's just a matter of trial and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.569 
and then it's just a matter of trial and
error<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:58.770> fitting<00:01:59.280> this<00:02:00.030> joint<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.579> okay

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
error of fitting this joint in here okay

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.889 
error of fitting this joint in here okay
so<00:02:02.640> several<00:02:03.149> times<00:02:03.299> you're<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> be

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
so several times you're going to be

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.990 
so several times you're going to be
taking<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.159> off<00:02:05.280> checking<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
taking this on and off checking the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.510 
taking this on and off checking the
joint<00:02:06.560> all<00:02:07.560> these<00:02:08.190> places<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:10.220> no<00:02:11.220> gaps

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
joint all these places here for no gaps

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.760 
joint all these places here for no gaps
okay<00:02:12.270> what<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.379> do<00:02:13.500> this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
okay what I do I like to do this

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.070 
okay what I do I like to do this
outside<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.820> put<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.630> up<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
outside so I can put this up to the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.610 
outside so I can put this up to the
sunlight<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.860> check<00:02:17.160> for<00:02:18.080> if<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.350> see<00:02:19.470> any

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
sunlight and check for if I can see any

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.770 
sunlight and check for if I can see any
light<00:02:19.860> through<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.910> sun's<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.330> great

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
light through it the sun's a great

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.400 
light through it the sun's a great
source<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.920> course<00:02:23.160> don't
