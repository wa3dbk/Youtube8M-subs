formula<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> hit<00:00:48.899> solve<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:51.059> does

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
formula from this so I hit solve it does

formula from this so I hit solve it does
some<00:00:51.420> thinking<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> hey<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.890> looks<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> lot

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
some thinking and hey that looks a lot

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.439 
some thinking and hey that looks a lot
like<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.760> quadratic<00:00:54.390> formula<00:00:55.670> looks<00:00:56.670> good<00:00:57.000> ok

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
like the quadratic formula looks good ok

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.299 
like the quadratic formula looks good ok
so<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.899> I'm<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.140> try<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.559> next<00:00:58.829> is

the<00:02:32.640> quadratic<00:02:33.180> formula<00:02:33.480> good<00:02:34.019> good

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the quadratic formula good good

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.599 
the quadratic formula good good
now<00:02:35.099> let's<00:02:35.340> try<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:37.019> old<00:02:37.370> torture<00:02:38.370> test

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
now let's try the the old torture test

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.979 
now let's try the the old torture test
okay<00:02:39.450> here<00:02:39.689> we<00:02:39.810> are

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
okay here we are

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.970 
okay here we are
ax<00:02:40.470> cubed<00:02:40.859> plus<00:02:41.519> BX<00:02:42.389> squared<00:02:42.719> plus<00:02:42.840> CX<00:02:43.139> Plus<00:02:43.950> D

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
ax cubed plus BX squared plus CX Plus D

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.910 
ax cubed plus BX squared plus CX Plus D
equals<00:02:44.549> zero<00:02:44.760> or<00:02:45.000> solving<00:02:45.359> for<00:02:45.540> x<00:02:46.129> drumroll

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
equals zero or solving for x drumroll

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.080 
equals zero or solving for x drumroll
thinking<00:02:51.439> thinking<00:02:54.859> and<00:02:55.859> it's<00:02:56.639> crunching

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090

hey there we go okay now let's go up

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.630 
hey there we go okay now let's go up
here<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.390> have<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.690> look-see

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
here and have a look-see

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
here and have a look-see
whoa<00:03:26.890> now<00:03:27.890> if<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.100> guys<00:03:28.250> have<00:03:28.490> looked<00:03:29.360> at<00:03:29.540> this

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
whoa now if you guys have looked at this

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.660 
whoa now if you guys have looked at this
formula<00:03:30.080> before<00:03:30.170> it's<00:03:30.680> ridiculous<00:03:31.430> does

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
formula before it's ridiculous does

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.370 
formula before it's ridiculous does
actually<00:03:31.940> gives<00:03:32.360> several<00:03:32.960> different

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
actually gives several different

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.470 
actually gives several different
solutions<00:03:33.560> for<00:03:33.920> this<00:03:34.160> formula<00:03:34.610> as<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.330> can

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
solutions for this formula as you can

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.630 
solutions for this formula as you can
tell<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.930> is<00:03:36.110> absolutely<00:03:36.800> ridiculous<00:03:37.310> you

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
tell it is absolutely ridiculous you

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.160 
tell it is absolutely ridiculous you
would<00:03:37.760> never<00:03:38.000> use<00:03:38.300> this<00:03:38.480> formula<00:03:38.990> for

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
would never use this formula for

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.370 
would never use this formula for
anything<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.850> hope<00:03:40.850> if<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:41.690> do<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.350> are

anything I hope if you do you are

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.280 
anything I hope if you do you are
probably<00:03:43.010> one<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:43.250> those<00:03:43.400> insane<00:03:44.290> beautiful

we're going to try pocket casts so here
we<00:04:03.470> have<00:04:04.270> we're<00:04:05.270> solving<00:04:05.510> for<00:04:05.720> any<00:04:06.380> probably
