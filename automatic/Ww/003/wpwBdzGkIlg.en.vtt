00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.000
 in 1988 serious law was born his vocation for 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.890
 excellence drives a story of 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.100
 growth that demands a development 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:18.550
 constant of our management 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.850
 our digital studio part of 1967 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.150
 when we bring a 3500 mud our 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.520
 first computer a luxury experts 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.360
 administrative and academic took turns 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.120
 to be able to use it 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.080
 in the 70s the number of computers 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.660
 it was increasing 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.310
 these were destined to tasks every time 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.860
 more specific but they were 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:45.850
 restricted only to skilled workers 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.040
 only in 1977 the crucible room project 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.140
 makes available to the entire community 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.510
 use personal computers- apple 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.500
 macintosh what marks the beginning of a 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.500
 digitization process 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.260
 as a result of this growth the 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.780
 technological challenges were made every 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.610
 once larger and more complex for 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.619
 overcome them systems of 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.210
 information that will support the processes 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.390
 of academic management of our 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.820
 university another important milestone happens 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.950
 the year 2013 when my 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.890
 portal and I know that it brings together in a single 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.960
 space different systems and services 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.020
 related to the user 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.090
 today our development driven by the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.729
 Our vocation of excellence places us 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.350
 new challenge to integrate into a new 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.540
 management platform all the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.840
 information and academic processes in a 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.330
 only system 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.460
 that platform is a banner subsede 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.560
 use banner is a new environment of 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.210
 management that will allow us to build the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.430
 instruments that will accompany our 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.490
 development in the coming decades 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.330
 includes the whole community use students 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.590
 professional and administrative teachers 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.590
 the start-up of the first phase 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.330
 of the banner is soon to occur we are 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.330
 in the process of implementation 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.810
 find out how to become a part and get ready 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.810
 they observe in it is everyone's task
