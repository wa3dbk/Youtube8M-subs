to<00:00:10.889> figure<00:00:11.160> eight<00:00:11.309> you're<00:00:11.490> gonna<00:00:11.639> go<00:00:11.700> oh<00:00:11.730> man

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
to figure eight you're gonna go oh man

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.910 
to figure eight you're gonna go oh man
what's<00:00:12.570> going<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:12.990> let<00:00:13.320> me<00:00:13.410> show<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
see this this wire here I've pretty got

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.349 
see this this wire here I've pretty got
pretty<00:00:25.890> much<00:00:26.039> mangled<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.640> all<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.210> you

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
with here we're gonna bend it right back

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.180 
with here we're gonna bend it right back
down<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.270> same<00:00:36.570> shape<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.890> just

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
down to the same shape here just just

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.709 
down to the same shape here just just
like<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.760> got<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> wires<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> right

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
like so you got the wires on the right

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.740 
like so you got the wires on the right
side<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.559> then<00:00:41.160> watch<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.820> take<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> big

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
side and then watch this I take a big

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
side and then watch this I take a big
pin<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.829> stick<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> right<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.430> between<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
pin and stick it right in between the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.369 
pin and stick it right in between the
wire<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> hook<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:46.020> bend<00:00:46.289> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
wire and the hook and I just bend it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.639 
wire and the hook and I just bend it
right<00:00:46.440> back<00:00:47.059> now<00:00:48.059> look<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.570> know<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.410> still

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
right back now look I know it still

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.430 
right back now look I know it still
looks<00:00:49.829> mangled<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.239> okay<00:00:51.690> I'm<00:00:51.989> fixing

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
