00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.140
 the small division of the German 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.790
 racing championship so to two 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.919
 liter displacement only after one 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.139
 introductory round on rain tires again 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.240
 closed the boxes just before the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.219
 was starting drizzle 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.440
 again, it died and you decided 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.250
 Together, after all, with the thing 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.560
 flex tackle the matter of a race 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.960
 over 18 laps were 30 vehicles 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.019
 involved but basically it just went around 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 2, the 38-year-old defending champion 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.669
 freer from Mönchengladbach with the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.620
 lancia beta turbo or klaus ludwig bonn 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.860
 winner of the two previous ones 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.079
 races in zolder and on the nürburgring 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.350
 ludwig on a 500 hp strong and turo 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.530
 capri and with a full 30 more ps 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.610
 equipped opposite and away as 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.610
 the fastest on the best 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.739
 starting place was still from ludwigs 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.039
 teammates klaus nothing is in it 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.300
 second row has been displaced 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.370
 is started after the napoli is 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.309
 a so-called security state 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.330
 the red-white capri of ludwig sets 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.340
 immediately to the top 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.470
 in blue lancia shoots from the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.660
 second row the second position 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.130
 he had his second place 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.540
 but already in the first round 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.630
 leave again 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.260
 Pretty soon ludwig and sat down 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.580
 some distance behind it nothing fix 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.530
 From the rest of the field we never get two 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.110
 ludwig cleverly controlled the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.470
 not constantly between four and 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.470
 six seconds 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.910
 nothing and gave a himself 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.080
 interesting duel twice kurt says 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.060
 meier in the lead 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.910
 here the lead attacks in the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.300
 Sachskurve but then he has to 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.300
 give in 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.080
 only far from the field 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.810
 statistic already after a few rounds 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.810
 the low achievers were terminated 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.780
 ludwig still around 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.680
 happy after 12 of 18 turns 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.079
 this year alone are violent opponents 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.599
 nothing is missing on the capri turbo 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.999
 stayed with a technical defect 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.290
 Hang somewhere on the track 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:31.870
 Well , in the final phase could still 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.870
 to bring something to ludwig without the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.099
 Master of 1979, however, seriously 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.849
 to endanger 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:43.510
 you ludwig a well-rounded driver and 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:47.010
 heyer first so klaus ludwig curtain 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.390
 free and sigi müller 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.489
 Incidentally, the same goal enema as 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:58.299
 eight days ago that does not exactly speak 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:03:00.609
 for the variety in this class of 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.560
 winner klaus ludwig already travels tomorrow 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.889
 He's in the US around the next weekend 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.639
 in Atlanta at an American 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.489
 racing series 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:13.319
 his vehicle is one of his team speed 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.319
 prepared ford mustang 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.670
 a sports championship in germany 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.920
 this is highly-cultivated automotive technology 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.500
 uncompromising technology expensive technology 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.650
 top car of this race series costs 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.150
 today around 300,000 mark at least as well 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.150
 much like a formula 1 remember 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.090
 the reward for the investment 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:03.800
 speed the goal of victory in the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.870
 large division over two liters of displacement 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.209
 is the number of candidates for the victory 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.819
 come twice as big as in 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.880
 the little four namely hans stuck 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.890
 a new bmw m1 turbo there is that 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.650
 This device is by far the rumor of this device 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.780
 ps strongest nobody wants there of course 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.350
 to cover his cards on the 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.300
 felde 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.680
 However, it is in the long bayern 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.680
 so far not only joy 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.810
 a failure and a third place the 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.340
 written 800 to 1000 ps of the right 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.100
 So certainly not we drive 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.540
 currently with 760 ps and of course 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.830
 another brand new car 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.400
 accordingly problems with the vote 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.410
 the great act of strength but there was the car 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.930
 projecting only the third stretch over 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.550
 and the third place has two weeks 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.720
 proved the car is competitive 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.070
 and we have now for the first time 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.990
 next week time extensively 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.080
 test drives and then believe 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.630
 to get there 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.850
 the porsche 935 of jochen mass was allowed 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.210
 ps what the performance in terms a tee 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.000
 bmw closest but he has 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.040
 a huge advantage considering good 50 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.720
 kilo less 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.180
 the same applies to the porsche of the 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.400
 French from Strasbourg there completely too 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.750
 only where has lag in this season already 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.760
 won a race 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.160
 that at the nürburgring last 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.380
 Manfred has also won the weekend 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.500
 winkelhock from waiblingen already that 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.289
 first races in zolder with about 600 ps 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.310
 he has the least of the top drivers 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.740
 horses under the hood 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.669
 that he just on the engines 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.770
 route hockenheim 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.990
 The fastest was the training 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.900
 low weight and impeccable 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.500
 handling his ford capri turbo the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.480
 start watching in slow motion this time 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.490
 direction on the left now its 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.230
 momentous in the former times to the point 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.410
 Had to be in the middle of the convertible 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.110
 angle right outside bolek a real one 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.120
 piece of the bayern sits down to the 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.650
 top 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.440
 but already at the entrance to the motodrom 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:04.560
 So after three quarters round a new one 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:08.110
 order of mars then i want then 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.550
 Winkelhock only ranked five by it 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.550
 not problems with the car 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.300
 and actually after a round 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.620
 the spotted im has to be in the box 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.620
 are dropouts 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.080
 stuck and now some weak ones 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.300
 continue driving round 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.970
 But then he had the helmet finally 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.800
 settle pitch for piece the car needs 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.479
 there is not only some time left 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.479
 fast but also steady 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.229
 The rest of the race is quickly told 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.190
 the two porsche turbo of mars and 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:53.020
 Holick drivers at the top 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:56.430
 winkelhock has visible reasons 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.430
 to follow difficulties 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.980
 jürgen maas already got him in the 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.830
 first round so meant as believes 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.370
 the race for no apparent reason 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.120
 touched on the side 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.320
 the consequence of course unfavorable 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.030
 dynamic behavior of the vehicle and 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.030
 no chance to keep the connection 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:25.350
 during the race jochen maas 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.810
 demands bolek pressed the ex 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.040
 porn 1 pilots constantly managed 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:34.050
 but not once 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:37.110
 to get past moderate and so was on 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.400
 the entry winner jochen mass tom walek 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.200
 continue out 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.940
 in front of manfred winkler from factories in 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:48.210
 this division in the third season race 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:51.950
 the third winner after winkelhock wool 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.950
 standard size one missing
