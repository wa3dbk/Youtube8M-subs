basement in your mechanical room or

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.600 
basement in your mechanical room or
could<00:01:51.750> even<00:01:51.930> be<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.170> your<00:01:52.200> garage<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.860> induct

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
could even be in your garage and induct

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.230 
could even be in your garage and induct
it<00:01:53.759> from<00:01:53.909> there

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it from there

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.539 
it from there
so<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.570> call<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.869> forced<00:01:55.229> air<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.860> how<00:01:56.009> often

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so we call this forced air and how often

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.280 
so we call this forced air and how often
do<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.270> load<00:01:57.479> when<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> wood

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
do they have to load when it with a wood

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.450 
do they have to load when it with a wood
is<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.590> something<00:01:58.890> they're<00:01:59.009> doing<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.280> few

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
is that something they're doing a few

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.730 
is that something they're doing a few
times<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.880> day<00:01:59.930> well<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.079> technology<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.710> just

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
times a day well the technology is just

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.889 
times a day well the technology is just
you<00:02:02.219> would<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.640> thermostat<00:02:03.270> calling

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you would have your thermostat calling

they<00:02:11.880> will<00:02:12.060> roar<00:02:12.240> up<00:02:12.510> would<00:02:12.660> give<00:02:12.810> us<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:13.080> nice

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
they will roar up would give us a nice

they will roar up would give us a nice
big<00:02:13.710> flame<00:02:13.980> will<00:02:14.490> give<00:02:14.640> us<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.850> lot<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.150> heat

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
big flame will give us a lot of heat

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.660

next opportunity to roar back up you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.730 
next opportunity to roar back up you
could<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.220> 10<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.730> 14<00:02:27.120> hour<00:02:27.270> burn<00:02:27.660> off<00:02:28.170> Oh<00:02:28.230> full

could get 10 to 14 hour burn off Oh full
up<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.880> unlike<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.240> kind<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.750> widow<00:02:30.990> people

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
up so unlike a kind of a widow people

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.930 
up so unlike a kind of a widow people
who<00:02:31.530> are<00:02:31.620> doing<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.830> wood<00:02:32.010> stove<00:02:32.220> today<00:02:32.610> and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
who are doing a wood stove today and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.730 
who are doing a wood stove today and
they<00:02:33.030> heat<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.360> thing<00:02:33.630> up<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.530> know<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
they heat that thing up and you know the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.620 
they heat that thing up and you know the
house<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.100> getting<00:02:35.220> up<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.550> 80<00:02:35.700> 85<00:02:36.180> degrees

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
house is getting up to 80 85 degrees

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.630 
house is getting up to 80 85 degrees
plus<00:02:37.050> because<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:37.710> just<00:02:37.950> cranking<00:02:38.340> along

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
plus because it's just cranking along

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.130 
plus because it's just cranking along
and<00:02:38.850> they<00:02:38.910> have<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.120> kind<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.330> feed<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.750> slow<00:02:39.990> it

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
and they have to kind of feed it slow it

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.840 
and they have to kind of feed it slow it
down<00:02:40.170> or<00:02:40.320> whatever<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.490> really<00:02:41.730> doing

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
down or whatever this is really doing

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.920 
down or whatever this is really doing
the<00:02:42.030> work<00:02:42.060> for<00:02:42.510> you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the work for you

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.780 
the work for you
so<00:02:43.470> you're<00:02:43.650> burning<00:02:43.980> less<00:02:44.190> wood<00:02:44.490> you're

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
so you're burning less wood you're

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.860 
so you're burning less wood you're
maintaining<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.390> more<00:02:45.570> consistent

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
maintaining a more consistent

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.140 
maintaining a more consistent
temperature<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.770> it's<00:02:47.280> forced<00:02:47.640> air<00:02:47.820> right

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
temperature and it's forced air right

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.670 
temperature and it's forced air right
through<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.510> house<00:02:48.660> correct<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.380> you're<00:02:49.560> able

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
through the house correct so you're able

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.350 
through the house correct so you're able
to<00:02:49.800> distribute<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.490> heating<00:02:50.790> system<00:02:51.180> right

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
to distribute the heating system right

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.120 
to distribute the heating system right
across<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.900> whole<00:02:52.050> building<00:02:52.440> no<00:02:52.740> matter<00:02:52.920> how

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
across the whole building no matter how

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.070 
across the whole building no matter how
large<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.730> long<00:02:54.330> as<00:02:54.420> we<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.720> ductwork

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
large it is long as we have the ductwork

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.440 
large it is long as we have the ductwork
in<00:02:55.200> place<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.100> move<00:02:56.220> air<00:02:56.460> to<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.030> poisk<00:02:57.240> we

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
in place we can move air to the poisk we

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.060 
in place we can move air to the poisk we
want<00:02:57.660> oh<00:02:57.960> that's<00:02:58.350> great<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.770> get<00:02:58.920> more

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
want oh that's great so you get more

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.820 
want oh that's great so you get more
control<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.880> burn<00:03:00.420> less<00:03:00.660> wood<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.590> have<00:03:01.710> to

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
control you burn less wood you have to

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.680 
control you burn less wood you have to
tend<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.310> lot<00:03:02.520> less<00:03:02.760> because<00:03:03.270> it's<00:03:03.420> kind<00:03:03.630> of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
tend it a lot less because it's kind of

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.450 
tend it a lot less because it's kind of
taking<00:03:03.990> care<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.410> on<00:03:04.590> its<00:03:04.740> own<00:03:04.920> you're

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
taking care of that on its own you're

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.400 
taking care of that on its own you're
not<00:03:05.670> paying<00:03:06.000> for<00:03:06.060> oil<00:03:06.390> or<00:03:06.570> electricity<00:03:06.930> as<00:03:07.260> all

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
not paying for oil or electricity as all
