00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.140
 and hello and welcome you are well 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.180
 is recreated this part of the chain of 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.000
 cazaux and raziel here cazaux i will you 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.340
 present the sixth mission for 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.950
 mastery achievements so on the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.140
 mission so what's her name 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.969
 this is a former soldier 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.050
 so in fact in this show there 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.089
 before the nuclear strike 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.980
 so we have a little timer at the top of 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.420
 the screen we'll see later 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.679
 will have to fart the fortress 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.730
 planetary that makes complain of the 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.530
 down-earth so I'm going to show you a 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.149
 little bit so how does one proceed in 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.649
 do that first I'm going 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.480
 explode everything but banking or at least 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.739
 a good part on the door with good 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.519
 sure a kinetic burst of kerrigan 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.809
 to save a little baning and a 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.700
 once I get home I do it in one click 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.740
 I used kinetic rafa on everything 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.970
 which is powerful so there for now 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.610
 this is the time that the who is a little 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.750
 little on the right that annoys me a little 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.180
 little so I'm going to go put him a 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.890
 stratum fall and then it will be mostly 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.970
 what has a lot of pv like all that 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.860
 but we will not need much 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.630
 burst so a first on the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.549
 portal a second on the time that 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.729
 that we saw there and then we will have a 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.259
 third on a time to come 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.149
 and during that time I'm going to empty 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.549
 also the small part of corridors there 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.740
 that we see here so the burst 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.180
 kinetic about the wrong that will happen 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.159
 since who feasted is a little at the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.869
 fluff since it moves of course 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.549
 slower than speedling baneling and 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.420
 during this time we wait for them 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.890
 reinforcement of units 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.770
 so here is the second just arrived 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.030
 there will be a third then 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.219
 something else that I did not appreciate 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 in this mission there at the level of choice 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.509
 technological in fact what I take 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.829
 this the speedling there I had chosen the 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.409
 arts gling with the wings there to get 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.780
 move 2 per year per good it's not 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.009
 well it's not a problem but you 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.960
 can also take the others but this 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.880
 what you need is the speedling and 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.150
 the explosion that he at the level of 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.680
 chancres so you 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.659
 you can see it in your mission 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.829
 and make the choice so that as soon as 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.040
 that your rooms expose themselves to 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.019
 thing 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.329
 iil all the units that are around in 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.030
 had of course so here is the third 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.590
 reinforcement have just arrived 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.540
 he is there he is beautiful he is present on 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.519
 see who sneers in front to take 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.310
 the first shots and take the agro from 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.930
 all that is off bunker vikings of 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.120
 everything that hangs out here is she is 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.700
 slowed down like that I see all my 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.269
 mass ahead totally ignoring the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.980
 other units 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.159
 I advance I gather in the corner well 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.139
 sure I am grouping I am grouping I am grouping 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.370
 I'm waiting for baning and I'm going to 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.560
 the assault of the planetary fortress 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.420
 for the moment we do not see her she is 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 not far it is there we see all 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.250
 above all the alines that are in front 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.620
 they will prevent vcs from coming 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.239
 repair the vcs they 're wrong is 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.859
 to be dropper and there i shifts 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.090
 slightly but argue to leave the 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.040
 open path to the good lines that are going 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.930
 come to explode on the fortress 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.150
 so it's not very well done we can 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.769
 realize it a lot better but hey 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.870
 will be enough to explain a little bit 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.840
 how am I doing and here is the typing 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.379
 nuclear happened and I farted the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.989
 planetary fortress just before so 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:27.410
 that's it for this sixth mission so I 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.410
 See you soon for the 7th mission
