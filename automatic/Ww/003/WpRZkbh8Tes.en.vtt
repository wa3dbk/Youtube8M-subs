and you won't be able to access this
area<00:01:07.710> yet<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.549> that's<00:01:09.210> that's<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.530> way

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
area yet and that's that's just the way

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.050 
area yet and that's that's just the way
it<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.040> basically<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> last
