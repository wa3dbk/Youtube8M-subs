 to be interested in an exceptional race on 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.119
 horny price 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.230
 we filled up with starters and it's 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.590
 historical enough there are a lot of 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.140
 females 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.119
 yes a lot of trouble at first it's a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.220
 race a little weird because 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.330
 it's one at a time we have two very three 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.859
 good shows but after that it's very very 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 open so finally it gives us a 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.020
 edition of this horny who is not so 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.730
 noted that we saw a lot more 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.930
 beautiful plateau that you put it good suddenly 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.820
 it gives us a pretty open race 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.469
 is quite interesting for the game of 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.640
 blow you said so there will be two 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.079
 three bases I leave you precisely 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.149
 remember your prognosis 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.059
 then in the lead the number 17 tiego pond 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.370
 then 18 roxane scratches the 3 vittel of 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 brévol the 8 seductive phu tho the cest 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.899
 alicia bella on the 14th a girl of love the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.030
 15 sun gap is 13 valls 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.489
 castellet in the lead so you have there 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.110
 this is the number 17 tiego pond I have 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.320
 want to say it's a little bit his 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.670
 exactly year that's what all 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.590
 world agrees to say here thibault 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.200
 super horse fourth times ago 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
 two years 2nd last year so that's it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.740
 now very seasoned horse who has 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.450
 did a super early winter he won 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.009
 the price of brittany so that allowed 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 christian bigeon him to order a month 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.960
 of freshness before covering the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.880
 Burgundy 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.170
 here in Burgundy it is 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.090
 find himself in a locked race he 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.009
 will finish super well he says second with 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.420
 barely quick to very beautiful 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.650
 milla performance counts twice in 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.390
 the winter he arrives with a lot of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.610
 freshness to get expensive cornelian 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.509
 here he has progressed a lot in his 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.840
 getting upset because it was a 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.400
 little bit his fault in the past 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.110
 this is his young jockey charles bigeon has 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.579
 gained experience also because good 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.020
 it's true that they're the first two 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.280
 years he was still quite young 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.260
 so here it is now 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.030
 a little more seasoned they really 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.380
 both a lot of assets in 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.330
 their game and it's true but normally 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 this is their year what the cat of the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.409
 race 5th charbit people at risk of having 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.390
 a little pressure anyway there is 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.680
 the whole family that will be tense in 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.360
 the courts I had christian bigeon 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.600
 this morning he told me we will have to see the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.100
 spindle zero 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.440
 very well just behind you rank the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.840
 number 18 roxane griff that is not presented 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.550
 the more it's a great champion it's 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 thanks to that kind of judgment we like 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.140
 Shopping here lé lé elected 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.610
 recently the cracks in the series 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.769
 best mare best mares 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.530
 of age it is the richest mare of 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.670
 the French also won this story 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.989
 last year have only handed over his title 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.480
 in play and beat you times 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.850
 precisely we think that time is going to have 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.900
 of taking on it but finally we get 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.459
 realizes that every year low to 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.220
 setubal is always at the top the mare has 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.860
 won again the jules lemonnier key 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.380
 she was superb in brittany in 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.330
 Burgundy it was great but if it is 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.410
 an exceptional mare and so that's 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.269
 for sure in the first three and 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.560
 can even win of course yes maybe 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.269
 the same twinned as last year 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.560
 I have had Eric Raffin at Sikkim Abba 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.570
 who fears pond tiego so yeah 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.709
 it's really both the two big ones 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.450
 favorites the two good bases of the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.190
 race it's sure down right behind it 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.400
 there is a third base too and vittel of 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.769
 similar brévol who won normandy 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.989
 yeah well very bad it's more 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.519
 young people here I agree often I'm 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.350
 say I always say that the corpse 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.989
 it's often races for 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.030
 quite seasoned choice is the class 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.709
 they fight with them there that's for sure 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.750
 now it's a horse that has not had 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.190
 a lot of big fight what while that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.799
 the others they are used to 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.359
 what tiego and roxanne so next to 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.470
 it's a great super 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.549
 horse and he is able to take the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.690
 train to his account he is not without 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.420
 remember his father jacques de bellouet 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.620
 that's it and it's a little bit not the copy 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.599
 may 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.280
 they send each other he inherited all 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.799
 the qualities of those of the father so here we go 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.900
 he was carefully prepared for that he 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.430
 ran once this winter under saddle 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.980
 images easily win the prize without 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.400
 say yes by walking 13 2007 gp so on 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.170
 the course 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.780
 here are all the lights are green 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.569
 now will have to attack it's a 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.409
 older and older ones but I 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.220
 think he can give them a nice 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.329
 replica as for the win wow okay 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.319
 depend on how it's going to run because 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.700
 the jury is out on a small 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.780
 fault I think the other two they 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.620
 will not waste time leaving if 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.150
 the oil and times there is a little bit 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.349
 obliged to make sure to get around them 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.720
 arrived a little complicated then I you 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.120
 said maybe a bit softer than at 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.170
 the fight therefore to see but if he wins he 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.670
 there will be not much to say because 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.629
 that he certainly has an engine for her 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.370
 it's a horny winner 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.690
 if it is not this year it will be 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.370
 maybe the year after what yeah we 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.329
 reminds that he still has 14 victories 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.239
 in 23 outputs 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.160
 it's a career led by 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.560
 master by sébastien ernault and he has he 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.210
 to really save spared it's a 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.550
 big horse pretty sturdy so he goes 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.260
 come I think he's going to get better 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.479
 in getting older 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.190
 so no no it's really great 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.630
 so behind you said it's a 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.789
 little open to place them in the fourth 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.139
 pretty attractive loop photo that comes 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.729
 to win on more than we see rising 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.680
 and made the heart speak after 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.780
 behind those voices there so I really 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.070
 loved his victory was 2002 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.470
 small track so long parents 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.030
 like the 2007 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.039
 he really is he crossed the other day 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.060
 so he walked 12.8 anyway been 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.880
 fair is there it will be deferré of 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.230
 posterior and 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.460
 I think it's funny because 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.200
 it's a horse against him there are ten 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.490
 years hardened he does not have much experience 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.900
 under the saddle but he is very hardened 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.820
 he had races and he's a charles 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.660
 roux spared the horse he responds 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.370
 all the time present is a 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.090
 tweeting it's a little hard and 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.340
 nathalie henry 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.920
 she will ride the race here it is a 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.540
 wait-and-see will let them do that and I 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.860
 think that for that it can agree these 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.850
 kinds of jockey that suits this 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.410
 little horse there so it can be 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.050
 Funny to the hitch we remind that the 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.330
 wrong idea thing but without the markets 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.340
 12th twelve enemies on the distance 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:30.470
 classic so if he repeats his lap times 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:32.360
 there in 5th class and lucia bella 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.970
 who also a newcomer under 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.350
 saddle why and alicia here they have 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.150
 tried the couple surely bar is 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.650
 now with his earnings at the sulky so 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.300
 we heard them under saddle 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.580
 the first shots were not great 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.920
 awesome but she was second of it 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.150
 hit two runs on shorter we 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.650
 chords is really fine the mare 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.880
 is in Burgundy 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.410
 she is part of the notes she was 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.370
 tight and that we would really have very good 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.720
 and often we say that the notes of the 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.740
 Burgundy we speak for the price 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.100
 of america but for the iphone for the 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.750
 Cornulier 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.280
 there she will be deferrée of the four feet 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.620
 jules was practical I think he 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.090
 will not make a mistake normally this 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.190
 very good luck for the places 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.630
 yes the entourage is pretty confident the 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.000
 here I think it's normal 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.990
 as it has been said as it's open to 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.550
 is one of the richest 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.740
 michael still has titles to do 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.360
 worth it is the first starter of jean 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.710
