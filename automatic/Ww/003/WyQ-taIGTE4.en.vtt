00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello not far from jessica harnois 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.820
 President of the Canadian Association 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.590
 the professionals it makes me happy 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.380
 today to present the dawn where you 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.670
 double-life double life 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.590
 is made by our partners trudeau 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.670
 so how to open a bottle nothing 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.800
 more simple I will give you a 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.450
 Council three times you go 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.280
 do it like pros first 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.789
 thing it's really the style rather to 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.680
 use 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.300
 it's easy you can not cut yourself 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.880
 and then to teeth in clique so 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.989
 it's really easy to use 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.190
 the important thing is to put our index 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.720
 to put pressure 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.430
 and then no need to move the 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.440
 bottle you just need to go 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.809
 in 180 degree numbers and turn your 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.699
 hand with the object so first of all one 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.190
 take the bottle by the collar and the 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.170
 quest on installing your index and 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.839
 did not turn twice to be sure 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.940
 that the capsule is well cut did 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.360
 the same with our thumb on their 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.309
 balls to uncap the bottle and 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.220
 and then you just have to insert the tip 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.799
 of your knife inside and the 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.470
 capsule removes itself has passed 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.290
 Step Number One Step Number Two 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.210
 including laundry to stabilize it well 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.770
 take it on the tips of your fingers 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.660
 like that because if I take it from 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.310
 this way too it's hard to 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.590
 well in a place in hot water 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.790
 so I hope I have to close me I t 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.950
 like the neck of the bottle 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.600
 hangman she moves I Africa in 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.160
 full center and then it should come back 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.180
 right in front of me 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.550
 we turn almost to the end 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.660
 so it comes back to us and then we 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.880
 the third step 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.130
 tron will use the double life on 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.840
 settles on the edge of the job make sure 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.030
 you put pressure on the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.680
 bottleneck as well as on the double life and 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.330
 get up in a while until 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.430
 you could not lift corks anymore 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.590
 there I can go no further so the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.710
 second lever have the rating on the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.210
 edge I hold the job well 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.590
 where do I say yes because it becomes very 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.800
 easy everything we have left 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.480
 get off plugs one takes off and then 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.750
 we are left with the moment of tasting with 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.750
 him
