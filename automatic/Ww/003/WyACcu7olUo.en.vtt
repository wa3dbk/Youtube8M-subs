I<00:02:23.100> think<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.910> mean<00:02:24.170> excuse<00:02:25.170> me<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.380> think<00:02:25.470> they

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
I think so I mean excuse me I think they

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.610 
I think so I mean excuse me I think they
could<00:02:25.770> be<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.950> maybe<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.850> little<00:02:27.090> cheaper

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
could be a maybe a little cheaper

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.870 
could be a maybe a little cheaper
because<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:30.150> know<00:02:30.440> it's<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.560> plush<00:02:31.800> away<00:02:32.130> but

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
because you know it's a plush away but

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.040 
because you know it's a plush away but
yeah<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.300> guess<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.720> worth<00:02:33.990> around<00:02:34.110> $10<00:02:36.050> they

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
yeah I guess it is worth around $10 they

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.230 
yeah I guess it is worth around $10 they
do<00:02:37.110> have<00:02:37.440> Pig<00:02:37.800> versions<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.430> these<00:02:38.550> but<00:02:39.150> they

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
do have Pig versions of these but they

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.770 
do have Pig versions of these but they
are<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.450> believe<00:02:39.720> they<00:02:40.170> are<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.350> lot<00:02:40.740> bigger<00:02:41.780> from

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
are I believe they are a lot bigger from
