00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.460
 hello everyone we meet for the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.980
 following the attacks warned so the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.259
 part 2 super trout tv the cat he me 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.939
 seems I promised you the part 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.980
 from following the attacks on the operation 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.779
 bitterness it is a very good operation 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.919
 especially when we are a task force of 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.200
 five members 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.550
 so this time it's not two 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.960
 maps but three maps with three maps 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.910
 super complicated especially the first 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.519
 level 99 assembly 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.089
 it's also distorted level 90 and 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.429
 machinery 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.629
 on the other hand I do not have the level it 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.109
 does not matter since it stays when 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.269
 even very heavy we will say small 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.129
 weak point it's just that bastards 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.289
 attacks we see the troops 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.949
 deployed deployed by which the bonus of 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.600
 status etc 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.329
 it goes a little bit fast and you 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.850
 do not worry I wrote everything down 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.130
 trust me 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.930
 so if you do not see any more super trout 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.120
 little details in the top fr it's 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.530
 because like every human being except 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.060
 me on earth he took a vacation there 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.390
 will come back he will take the hair off the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.950
 stupid 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.950
 it's an expression that no longer exists 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.930
 from 1927 to 28 I do not know anymore 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.730
 I was not told then it's gone we're going 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.060
 start with assembling a player 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.240
 level 62 so it's dante it's gone 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.800
 so mike level 60 of over a thousand 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.030
 details so that too is huge 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.580
 vallon used 8 carbo level 8 so 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.920
 assembly it's a complicated map because 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.110
 we have the qg at the bottom of the map 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.490
 this is not the case for all 2 to 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.590
 thema not worry not seen pull is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.060
 at the bottom and around there are benign 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.280
 flamethrower rocket launcher and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.260
 electro lens world of super cannon he 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.950
 need to screen wesh very often on the 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:03.360
 left and it's so complicated then the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.050
 dga the troops is more 116% + 98% 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.610
 troop health and more 180 points 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.890
 percentage of gunboat points 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.840
 it's enormous 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.790
 so there we know the fuels a little 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.900
 in every way he will destroy the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.069
 two rocket launches 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.560
 where there is fire 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.459
 and all the guys do not even call him 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.480
 18 it was bad 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.739
 So here we have four rocket launches 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.950
 on the right which makes besides 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.629
 successfully destroy three cargo ships out of eight 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.459
 which are level 8 so at most I 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.400
 remember and so we have flamethrowers 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.510
 who are out of reach 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.189
 or rather the hot springs are out of 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.319
 worn and their cassock that are at the top 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.000
 to the left 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.540
 and then we still see it remains a 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.319
 map level 104-99 so points of life 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.180
 qg 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.370
 it is quite considerable even when 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.079
 a lot of life points and you see 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.530
 even though the carbo manage to 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.569
 to make a one shot it's huge it's the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.530
 slab a hole that was added by 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.139
 supercell in this game and it proves well 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.790
 that it's the best especially when 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.590
 they are free eight cantons pass 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.480
 Carmelites oyo this audit 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.400
 I have not yet but I saw 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.849
 videos and I can tell you that 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.680
 tears 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.049
 there is a huge difference so here is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.900
 assemblage 149 points of strength to him 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.849
 all alone level 62 mike with over 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.370
 1000 medal I call him 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.250
 second arcade attack a player says no 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.829
 61 it's also huge that goes so 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.870
 attack this distortion map often 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:36.780
 the attacks are done on the left on 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:39.120
 this map then 96 zucca level 20 there 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.729
 so that's a lot of everything with 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.370
 the max barges is of course more 114 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:50.099
 percentage points of troop damage 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.620
 + 64% health of the troops and more than 110% 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.840
 of tip that way there what will 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.599
 to do this is the method was misouk it's 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.180
 to say pass under smoke in all 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.560
 case and position themselves the shadow of 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.359
 rocket launches I'm like you know 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.780
 rocket launcher does not attack the body at 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.769
 ropes 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.590
 because I'm calling for melee 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.900
 it's a meter ahead of the good can not 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.859
 to say that a student is learning here you are 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.840
 positions between mortars 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.019
 rocket launcher and stack when it's going 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.329
 disappear these fumigens curl the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.849
 groups of defensive buildings that can 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.750
 dangerous and there she focused on 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.830
 the rocket launcher 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.580
 he managed to destroy this subject enough 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.849
 quickly in five shots so we'll say so 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.039
 that these distortions 108 points of strength 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.800
 on this map and the last is stack 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:42.759
 axis a bo 54 player that will attack 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.039
 72 souka level 20 and so big arms so 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.349
 just a level 20 barge barge 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.449
 so him the bonus is a little bit 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:53.409
 less is normal said it is better 54 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:59.530
 years and over 82% damage troops 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:05:02.139
 plus 66% health metro and more 164% 2.2 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.250
 gunboat so here too he'll get 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.500
 position under smoke taken a 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.050
 pen 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.370
 we do not care about that too 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.590
 complicated because we can see that he 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.250
 two years ago it's too good so ben at 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.800
 when the smoke will disappear 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.360
 the troops so here the calais or 3 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.940
 will focus on electron reims 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.409
 free chose beforehand and he 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.300
 left before it's too world will we 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.750
 to get drunk but that's why Pilate goes 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.610
 the curly also and focus on 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.789
 so in particular it seems to me that the 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.529
 big arms were chosen for the mines 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.610
 because mines are particularly 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.990
 enormously on this map 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.180
 it's complicated then that's 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.349
 totally contrary to the assembly the 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.319
 qg is close 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:52.180
 even though on this man who has a lot of 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.830
 defensive buildings between the beach and the 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.990
 qg but that's the level it's 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.789
 necessarily easier so there 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.259
 quietly there are only two 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.080
 tornadoes for the Catalans that touches 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.819
 the east and that touches the no forgiveness and 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.560
 there he will finish quite easily axis pile 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.960
 machine so I do not know the level 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.310
 but 59 points of strength it stays as 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.990
 huge roof are more or less lucky 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:18.490
 the one shot forgiveness are huge here 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.349
 the pass that is destroyed here for these 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.569
 three small attacks especially it's 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.819
 weird because there is I give my opinion 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.509
 I do not know if it's interesting on 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.940
 this map 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.800
 we see at 1 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.230
 especially here that was left and we 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.450
 sees a lot of defensive buildings 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.800
 who are on the right so that does not want 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.660
 not say that these defensive buildings on 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.190
 europe but are useless especially 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.550
 what we do in a task force 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:44.190
 is that we can have for example a 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.140
 energy scene that is next to the 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.330
 beach have grenadier bars that 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.310
 will focus on this cell 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.230
 energy and who will benefit for 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.600
 do a lot of channel points yesterday 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.910
 to destroy the buildings that are 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.730
 precisely behind this cell 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:02.490
 energetic and the guy he's going to reap 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.840
 points of nerves he will destroy parm 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.910
 rocket launches or lines that will 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.100
 to create a breach for the player 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.200
 next here ya ya full of tips ya 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.210
 no perfect trick 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:16.530
 each player has his training to his 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:18.000
 strategy for any type of map 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.700
 I have to stop talking like a 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.250
 reporter here for this episode 4 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.080
 bitterness of super trout would see 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.910
 rather at the bitterness part 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.800
 we'll meet again very soon and I 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.040
 activate me as usual we are very 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.040
 early
