00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.380
 we are going to see london because it has just started the race for the title of 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.389
 best tennis player in the world towards the finals of atp epe what before 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.140
 called the cup of teachers 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.730
 the British Andy Murray and the Argentine Juan Martin del Colro have been the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.560
 responsible for opening the competition 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 it is the first party of the group where fernando is also framed 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 verdasco 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.980
 the madrileÃ±o has had one is for good of luxury in his penultimate training 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.199
 before facing Federer in a few hours 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.620
 nothing less than the Serbian novak djokovic rival of the rafa nadal group and a whole 

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:42.159
 showman is acting trains at quarter to ten live in the 2 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.159
 verdasco 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.740
 and until tomorrow, at about this time, he will not make his debut with rafa nadal 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.980
 will face the Swedish robin soderling 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.900
 today we have gone to train with rafa and we have verified that the forms of 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.900
 dodging traffic jams in London but only for privileged 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.920
 it's twelve o'clock at noon and if some day rafa nadal went up one of the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.440
 benches that cover the London Thames 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.540
 It is not an advertising event nor a touristic visit 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.670
 like verdasco and the rest of the tennis players of this cup masters the academy to train 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.550
 in March and goes through some of London's most iconic landmarks 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.090
 like london bridge 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.720
 in half an hour's journey and even in days as diverse as today is 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.360
 the fastest way to move from the center of london to 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.260
 the greenwich peninsula southeast of the city where it is 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.110
 posted frosty sands 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.440
 after training nadal continues to prepare from tomorrow against robin 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.230
 soderling 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.780
 sensations are good conditions of the central track of the o2 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.780
 sand well this led to a lot of Hispanics 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.130
 our nations is a system 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.170
 it certainly did not disappoint our country which is that it was really faster than 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.750
 all the balls have given less 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.560
 aguirre there is a little more time to try to do things
