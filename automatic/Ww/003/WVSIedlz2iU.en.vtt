00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.710 
compression so there's no PNG or gif
option<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.090> you'll<00:02:05.210> have<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.450> use<00:02:05.570> another

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
option so you'll have to use another

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.380 
option so you'll have to use another
piece<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.439> software<00:02:06.590> or<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.340> free<00:02:07.790> online<00:02:07.970> tool

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
piece of software or a free online tool

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.970 
piece of software or a free online tool
for<00:02:08.659> that<00:02:08.919> at<00:02:09.919> the<00:02:10.039> moment<00:02:10.189> it's<00:02:10.399> set<00:02:10.609> at<00:02:10.879> 70%

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
for that at the moment it's set at 70%

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.090 
for that at the moment it's set at 70%
so<00:02:12.980> we<00:02:13.069> can<00:02:13.189> do<00:02:13.279> a<00:02:13.309> quick<00:02:13.579> J

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
so we can do a quick J

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.760 
so we can do a quick J

that's<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> look<00:02:17.520> at<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.630> moment<00:02:18.780> it's

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
that's going to look at the moment it's

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.340 
that's going to look at the moment it's
a<00:02:19.800> little<00:02:20.640> bit<00:02:20.760> pixelated<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.720> I'm<00:02:21.960> just<00:02:22.170> going

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
a little bit pixelated so I'm just going

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.900 
a little bit pixelated so I'm just going
to<00:02:22.380> increase<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:23.010> size<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.730> by<00:02:24.000> 80%<00:02:25.910> and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
to increase that size to by 80% and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.000 
to increase that size to by 80% and
it'll<00:02:27.510> also<00:02:27.630> tell<00:02:27.960> me<00:02:28.110> how<00:02:28.290> big<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.890> to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
it'll also tell me how big it's going to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.700 
it'll also tell me how big it's going to
be<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:30.180> at<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.420> minutes<00:02:30.630> eleven<00:02:31.260> kilobytes

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710

which<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.250> fine<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:35.670> automatically

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
which is fine you can automatically

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.510 
which is fine you can automatically

automatically rename them you can

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.890 
automatically rename them you can

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
naming your images is when they're saved

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.840 
naming your images is when they're saved
out<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:55.050> can<00:02:55.170> add<00:02:55.260> an<00:02:55.470> extension<00:02:55.830> onto<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
out you can add an extension onto the

out you can add an extension onto the
image<00:02:56.970> names<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:59.280> for<00:02:59.910> instance<00:03:00.590> we<00:03:01.590> want<00:03:01.770> this

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
image names so for instance we want this

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:10.250 
image names so for instance we want this
to<00:03:02.310> be<00:03:02.360> 500<00:03:03.590> pixels<00:03:04.590> wide<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:06.080> 80%<00:03:07.730> quality<00:03:09.260> so

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
to be 500 pixels wide and 80% quality so

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.110 
to be 500 pixels wide and 80% quality so
if<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.380> select<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.800> option<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:11.460> our<00:03:11.730> images

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
if you select this option all our images

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.240 
if you select this option all our images
will<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.530> renamed<00:03:13.530> when<00:03:14.070> they've<00:03:14.220> been

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
will be renamed when they've been

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.630 
will be renamed when they've been
resized<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:16.140> now<00:03:16.260> all<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.590> need<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:16.800> do<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.340> to

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
resized so now all we need to do is to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.150 
resized so now all we need to do is to
resize<00:03:18.210> all<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.660> images<00:03:21.680> select<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.830> folder

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
resize all the images select the folder

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.270 
resize all the images select the folder
you<00:03:23.280> want<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.550> output<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.210> images<00:03:24.540> to

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.479 

I'm<00:03:30.880> Jeeter

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.979 

the<00:03:35.489> next<00:03:35.760> piece<00:03:35.909> of<00:03:35.939> software<00:03:36.420> I'm<00:03:36.629> going<00:03:36.870> to

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
the next piece of software I'm going to

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.649 
the next piece of software I'm going to
show<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.650> shrink<00:03:38.430> or<00:03:38.609> malloc<00:03:38.939> which<00:03:39.359> runs

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
show you is shrink or malloc which runs

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.190 
show you is shrink or malloc which runs
on<00:03:39.900> both<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.290> PC<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:41.099> Mac<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.780> an<00:03:42.930> adult

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
on both the PC and a Mac it's an adult

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.259 
on both the PC and a Mac it's an adult
bear<00:03:43.409> app<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.219> you'll<00:03:44.370> need<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.670> download<00:03:44.819> and

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
bear app so you'll need to download and

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.110 
bear app so you'll need to download and
install<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.930> before<00:03:46.439> you<00:03:46.560> can<00:03:46.709> use<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:47.129> it's

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
install that before you can use it it's

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.059 
install that before you can use it it's
a<00:03:48.299> little<00:03:48.540> bit<00:03:48.719> slicker<00:03:49.049> than<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.379> resizer

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
a little bit slicker than I resizer

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.330 
a little bit slicker than I resizer
and<00:03:50.249> definitely<00:03:50.939> nicer<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.659> eyes<00:03:52.219> but<00:03:53.219> the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
and definitely nicer on the eyes but the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.970 
and definitely nicer on the eyes but the
downside<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.819> it<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.389> you<00:03:54.750> can't<00:03:55.139> preview<00:03:55.739> your

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
downside of it is you can't preview your

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.550 
downside of it is you can't preview your
images<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.239> if<00:03:57.359> you<00:03:57.510> want<00:03:57.689> to<00:03:57.840> find<00:03:58.019> out<00:03:58.200> what

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
images so if you want to find out what

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.349 
images so if you want to find out what
the<00:03:58.680> quality<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.549> image<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.939> going<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.239> be

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
the quality of the image is going to be

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.289 
the quality of the image is going to be
like<00:04:00.569> you're<00:04:01.379> best<00:04:01.620> off<00:04:01.829> exporting<00:04:02.760> one<00:04:03.000> image

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
like you're best off exporting one image

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.129 
like you're best off exporting one image
as<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.599> test<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.180> settings<00:04:06.569> work<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.049> a

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
as a test so the settings work in a

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.729 
as a test so the settings work in a
similar<00:04:07.530> way<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:08.209> have<00:04:09.209> your<00:04:09.239> max<00:04:10.109> width<00:04:10.409> and

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
similar way you have your max width and

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.750 
similar way you have your max width and
height<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:13.680> can<00:04:13.829> also<00:04:13.980> use<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.370> ratio

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
height and you can also use a ratio

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.759 
height and you can also use a ratio
which<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.510> percentage<00:04:16.079> of<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.410> original

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
which is a percentage of the original

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.210 
which is a percentage of the original
image<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:20.209> can<00:04:21.209> order<00:04:21.509> rename<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:22.049> or<00:04:22.680> leave

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
image you can order rename it or leave

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.370 
image you can order rename it or leave
it<00:04:23.250> as<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.580> same<00:04:23.759> as<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:23.940> original<00:04:24.229> you<00:04:25.229> need

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
it as the same as the original you need
