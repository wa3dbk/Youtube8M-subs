00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.870
 new tutorial for how to describe 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.730
 language or rage 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:15.510
 with metals of 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.570
 you really want to raise a liquid but 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:23.669
 this is something crazy the crochet 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.919
 of my account so I can not upload the 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:31.420
 which is what I wanted with the king of 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.780

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:39.700

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:53.040
 Of course I have a sample of how 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.190

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.190
 I will not be able to put the subway 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.530

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.730

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.270
 in other pages the volcanoes that 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.270
 you want 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 about double clicking when they put the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.740
 games where the band says is the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.549
 folder rooms 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:36.189
 in the round so you feel compressed and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.280
 well they will be able to play as they see that 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.659
