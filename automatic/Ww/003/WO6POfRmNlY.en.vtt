all-wheel drive we have this continuous

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.600 
all-wheel drive we have this continuous
noise<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.630> or<00:00:12.780> driving<00:00:13.429> basically<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.490> any

noise on or driving basically at any
speed<00:00:17.960> it's<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.050> bad<00:00:19.260> front<00:00:20.100> driveline

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.810 

go<00:00:23.080> ahead<00:00:23.260> and<00:00:23.410> lift<00:00:23.529> it<00:00:23.650> up<00:00:23.710> and<00:00:24.010> see<00:00:24.699> about

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
go ahead and lift it up and see about

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.760 
go ahead and lift it up and see about
replacing<00:00:25.449> it

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.200 

so<00:00:28.770> you<00:00:28.890> probably<00:00:29.070> jack<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.520> vehicle<00:00:29.670> up<00:00:30.000> all

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
so you probably jack the vehicle up all

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.880 
so you probably jack the vehicle up all
it's<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> four<00:00:30.689> wheel<00:00:30.869> drive<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.410> use<00:00:31.560> safety

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it's a four wheel drive we use safety

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.520 
it's a four wheel drive we use safety
Jack's<00:00:32.309> safety<00:00:32.820> stands<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.809> protect<00:00:34.170> yourself

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
Jack's safety stands to protect yourself

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.729 
Jack's safety stands to protect yourself
so<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:35.030> drop<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> vehicle<00:00:36.470> somehow<00:00:37.470> on

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
so you know drop the vehicle somehow on

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.260 
so you know drop the vehicle somehow on
yourself<00:00:38.190> although<00:00:38.400> it's<00:00:38.640> four<00:00:38.850> wheel<00:00:39.000> drive

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
yourself although it's four wheel drive

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.939 
yourself although it's four wheel drive
so<00:00:40.100> nothing<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.220> I<00:00:41.370> happen<00:00:41.730> anyhow<00:00:42.710> Torx<00:00:43.710> bit

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
so nothing if I happen anyhow Torx bit

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.170 
so nothing if I happen anyhow Torx bit
here<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.400> got<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.580> t30<00:00:45.449> Torx<00:00:45.840> bit

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
here we got a t30 Torx bit

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.490 
here we got a t30 Torx bit
right<00:00:47.750> there<00:00:47.990> and<00:00:48.110> then<00:00:48.170> you<00:00:48.320> put<00:00:48.350> a

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
right there and then you put a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.130 
right there and then you put a
screwdriver<00:00:49.270> through<00:00:50.270> here<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:50.720> you<00:00:50.810> can<00:00:50.900> hold

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
screwdriver through here so you can hold

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.870 
screwdriver through here so you can hold
it<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:51.470> then<00:00:51.650> everything<00:00:52.010> is<00:00:52.130> lefty-loosey

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and two on the other side and then we'll

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.460 
and two on the other side and then we'll
remove<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.360> from<00:01:00.450> there

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
the bad section

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.220 
the bad section
we've<00:01:09.700> got<00:01:09.850> day<00:01:10.120> it's<00:01:10.510> like<00:01:10.660> eight<00:01:10.810> millimeter

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
we've got day it's like eight millimeter

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.760 
we've got day it's like eight millimeter
bolts<00:01:11.440> back<00:01:11.620> there

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.899 

there's<00:01:16.130> five<00:01:16.369> or<00:01:16.520> six<00:01:16.549> of<00:01:16.850> them

and<00:01:21.220> you<00:01:21.340> might<00:01:21.490> want<00:01:21.730> to<00:01:21.820> actually<00:01:22.090> break

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
and you might want to actually break

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.300 
and you might want to actually break
them<00:01:22.690> loose<00:01:22.960> before<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.590> take<00:01:23.740> this<00:01:23.890> end<00:01:24.070> off

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
them loose before you take this end off

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.910 
them loose before you take this end off
so<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.610> can<00:01:24.700> use<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:24.970> screwdriver<00:01:25.800> for<00:01:26.800> your

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
so you can use that screwdriver for your

so you can use that screwdriver for your
holding<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.760> can<00:01:27.910> hold<00:01:28.150> it<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:28.690> you<00:01:28.810> can

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
holding you can hold it and you can

everything they'll be loose
loosey-goosey<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.190> then<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.400> can<00:01:36.580> take

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
loosey-goosey and then you can take

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.280 

you<00:01:59.000> see<00:01:59.210> there's<00:01:59.390> water<00:01:59.660> pouring<00:02:00.020> out<00:02:00.200> of

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
you see there's water pouring out of

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.140 
you see there's water pouring out of
there<00:02:00.470> not<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.650> good<00:02:00.860> idea<00:02:01.010> for<00:02:01.400> water<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.000> come

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
there not a good idea for water to come

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.529 
there not a good idea for water to come
out<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.520> we<00:02:04.610> got<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.820> out

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.899 

there's<00:02:09.200> some<00:02:09.500> looks<00:02:10.250> like<00:02:10.459> some<00:02:10.670> Loctite

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
there's some looks like some Loctite
