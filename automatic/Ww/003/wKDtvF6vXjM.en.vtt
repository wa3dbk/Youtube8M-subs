plate straps what we have here are two
walls<00:00:07.609> we<00:00:08.090> got<00:00:08.270> a<00:00:08.510> wall<00:00:08.929> on<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:09.230> right<00:00:09.650> and<00:00:10.040> a

the other post with the metal hanger on

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.040 
the other post with the metal hanger on
it<00:00:26.840> is<00:00:27.080> going<00:00:27.500> to<00:00:27.710> provide<00:00:28.300> support<00:00:29.300> for<00:00:29.360> a

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
it is going to provide support for a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.670 
it is going to provide support for a
beam<00:00:30.500> that<00:00:30.920> is<00:00:31.670> also<00:00:31.910> going<00:00:32.390> to<00:00:32.630> support<00:00:33.380> the

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
beam that is also going to support the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.110 
beam that is also going to support the
roof<00:00:34.360> now<00:00:35.950> let's<00:00:36.950> take<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:37.220> look<00:00:37.550> at<00:00:37.700> some<00:00:37.970> of

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
roof now let's take a look at some of

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.470 
roof now let's take a look at some of
the<00:00:38.480> framing<00:00:39.640> plate<00:00:40.640> brakes

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
the framing plate brakes

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.570 
the framing plate brakes
so<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:41.930> first<00:00:42.170> arrow<00:00:42.470> here<00:00:42.740> is<00:00:42.890> pointing<00:00:43.340> to

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
so the first arrow here is pointing to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.830 
so the first arrow here is pointing to
the<00:00:44.500> first<00:00:45.500> break<00:00:45.890> on<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.340> right<00:00:46.579> now<00:00:47.390> we<00:00:47.450> have

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
the first break on the right now we have

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.670 
the first break on the right now we have
another<00:00:48.530> break<00:00:48.950> in<00:00:49.329> between<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.510> two<00:00:50.720> posts

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
another break in between the two posts

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.750 
another break in between the two posts
and<00:00:52.239> of<00:00:53.239> course<00:00:53.650> last<00:00:54.650> but<00:00:54.800> not<00:00:55.070> least<00:00:55.430> we<00:00:55.730> have

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and of course last but not least we have

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.479 
and of course last but not least we have
another<00:00:56.480> break<00:00:56.840> in<00:00:57.110> between<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.950> other<00:00:58.160> post

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
another break in between the other post

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.380 
another break in between the other post
and<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.820> wall<00:00:59.030> we<00:00:59.270> have<00:00:59.450> three<00:00:59.960> places<00:01:00.380> where

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
and the wall we have three places where

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.580 
and the wall we have three places where
this<00:01:02.500> wall<00:01:04.089> framing<00:01:05.089> section<00:01:05.810> could<00:01:06.050> actually

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
this wall framing section could actually

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.820 
this wall framing section could actually
separate<00:01:07.720> but<00:01:08.720> we<00:01:08.900> can<00:01:09.080> do<00:01:09.229> something<00:01:09.500> about

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
separate but we can do something about

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.790 
separate but we can do something about
it<00:01:10.130> we<00:01:10.610> can<00:01:11.150> actually<00:01:11.270> install<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:11.960> strap<00:01:12.409> now<00:01:12.770> I

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
it we can actually install a strap now I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.210 
it we can actually install a strap now I
just<00:01:13.190> kind<00:01:13.580> of<00:01:13.729> drew<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.090> strap<00:01:14.450> in<00:01:14.720> here<00:01:15.220> to

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
just kind of drew a strap in here to

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.910 
just kind of drew a strap in here to
give<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:16.909> an<00:01:17.030> idea<00:01:17.180> later<00:01:18.080> on<00:01:18.320> in<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.799> video

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
give you an idea later on in the video

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.469 
give you an idea later on in the video
you'll<00:01:19.340> see<00:01:19.400> what<00:01:19.729> couple<00:01:20.060> these<00:01:20.150> straps

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
you'll see what couple these straps

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.080 
you'll see what couple these straps
actually<00:01:21.049> look<00:01:21.350> like<00:01:21.380> but<00:01:22.040> if<00:01:22.280> we<00:01:22.549> could<00:01:22.790> nail

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
actually look like but if we could nail

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.800 
actually look like but if we could nail
a<00:01:23.390> metal<00:01:23.810> strap<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:25.549> either<00:01:26.090> one<00:01:26.360> of<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.600> top

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
a metal strap to either one of the top

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.469 
a metal strap to either one of the top
plates<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.409> top<00:01:27.680> or<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.340> bottom<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.299> wall

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
plates the top or the bottom of the wall

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.480 
plates the top or the bottom of the wall
framing<00:01:29.840> plates<00:01:30.290> of<00:01:30.860> course<00:01:31.100> here<00:01:31.280> it's<00:01:31.369> on

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
framing plates of course here it's on

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.710 
framing plates of course here it's on
the<00:01:31.610> bottom<00:01:31.970> plates<00:01:33.010> then<00:01:34.010> we<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:35.000> have<00:01:35.390> a

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
the bottom plates then we can have a

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.750 
the bottom plates then we can have a
lateral<00:01:36.200> connection<00:01:36.920> if<00:01:37.100> there<00:01:37.340> was<00:01:37.460> going<00:01:37.640> to

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
lateral connection if there was going to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.700 
lateral connection if there was going to
be<00:01:37.909> any<00:01:38.180> type<00:01:38.570> of<00:01:38.600> movement<00:01:39.020> let's<00:01:39.470> say<00:01:39.560> there

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
be any type of movement let's say there

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.590 
be any type of movement let's say there
was<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:39.860> large<00:01:40.130> earthquake<00:01:40.400> start<00:01:41.180> starting<00:01:41.540> to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
was a large earthquake start starting to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.990 
was a large earthquake start starting to
shake<00:01:41.810> your<00:01:41.960> house<00:01:42.170> up<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.680> starting<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.820> put

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
some pressure in these areas actually

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.030 
some pressure in these areas actually
pulling<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.460> apart<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:47.810> strap<00:01:48.200> could<00:01:48.650> save

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
pulling it apart this strap could save

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.660 
pulling it apart this strap could save
your<00:01:49.610> behind<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:51.380> keep<00:01:51.799> that<00:01:51.979> in<00:01:52.040> mind

framing<00:01:53.630> plate<00:01:53.960> straps<00:01:54.380> are<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.450> definite<00:01:56.450> must

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
framing plate straps are a definite must

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.280 
framing plate straps are a definite must
use<00:01:58.240> while<00:01:59.240> you're<00:01:59.360> framing<00:01:59.659> homes<00:02:00.020> or

use while you're framing homes or

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.990 
use while you're framing homes or
building<00:02:00.740> anything<00:02:01.040> these<00:02:01.549> things<00:02:01.790> can

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
building anything these things can

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.289 
building anything these things can
really<00:02:02.570> provide<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.650> with<00:02:03.830> some<00:02:04.009> additional

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
really provide you with some additional

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.719 
really provide you with some additional
reinforcement<00:02:05.799> next<00:02:06.799> on<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.100> list<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.670> a

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
reinforcement next on the list is a

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.050 
reinforcement next on the list is a
different<00:02:08.539> type<00:02:08.749> of<00:02:09.159> connection<00:02:10.159> you<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.849> see

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
different type of connection you can see

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.200 
different type of connection you can see
that<00:02:11.329> this<00:02:11.689> isn't<00:02:12.459> connecting<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.639> two<00:02:13.819> frame

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
that this isn't connecting the two frame

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.720 
that this isn't connecting the two frame
plates<00:02:14.540> together<00:02:14.950> they<00:02:15.950> don't<00:02:16.130> have<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> choice

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
plates together they don't have a choice

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.020 
plates together they don't have a choice
here<00:02:17.090> because<00:02:17.480> they<00:02:17.750> have<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.960> beam<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:19.640> post

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030

connection that would interfere with the
framing<00:02:22.940> place<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:24.080> couldn't<00:02:24.500> put<00:02:24.740> this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
framing place you couldn't put this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.860

strap on either side of the wall because

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.640 
strap on either side of the wall because
you<00:02:27.560> have<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:27.800> beam<00:02:28.250> pocket<00:02:28.970> there<00:02:29.240> so<00:02:29.750> here's

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
you have a beam pocket there so here's

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.820 
you have a beam pocket there so here's
another<00:02:31.250> way<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.420> use<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:33.440> connect

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
another way that you can use to connect

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.250 
another way that you can use to connect
two<00:02:33.980> walls<00:02:34.250> together<00:02:34.630> anything<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:36.050> do

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
two walls together anything you can do

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.420 
two walls together anything you can do
to<00:02:37.220> prevent<00:02:37.910> these<00:02:38.240> plates<00:02:38.540> from<00:02:38.750> separating

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
to prevent these plates from separating

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.210 
to prevent these plates from separating
is<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:40.760> going<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.940> be<00:02:41.120> an<00:02:41.210> additional<00:02:41.510> bonus

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
is just going to be an additional bonus

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.480 
is just going to be an additional bonus
for<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.460> home<00:02:44.290> next<00:02:45.290> up<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.710> list<00:02:45.920> is

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.580 
for the home next up on the list is
going<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.940> be<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:48.700> smaller<00:02:49.700> strap<00:02:50.590> but

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
going to be a smaller strap but

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.770 
going to be a smaller strap but
providing<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.370> with<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.850> connection<00:02:53.600> it's

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
providing you with a connection it's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.600 
providing you with a connection it's

definitely hard to connect walls and
angles<00:02:58.610> like<00:02:58.820> this<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.720> even<00:03:00.320> though<00:03:00.710> the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
angles like this so even though the

is requesting a strap here I doubt if

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.680 
is requesting a strap here I doubt if
the<00:03:16.430> contractor<00:03:17.060> would<00:03:17.150> have<00:03:17.300> nailed<00:03:17.510> the

the contractor would have nailed the

the contractor would have nailed the
strap<00:03:17.990> on<00:03:18.260> out<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.280> kindness<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.940> his

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.420 
heart with the price of everything as it
is<00:03:22.820> but<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.740> should<00:03:24.980> give<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.370> pretty

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
is but this should give you a pretty

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.930 
is but this should give you a pretty
good<00:03:25.790> idea<00:03:26.920> how<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:27.980> connect<00:03:28.430> these<00:03:28.610> plates

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
good idea how to connect these plates

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.440 
good idea how to connect these plates
together<00:03:29.180> now<00:03:30.050> if<00:03:30.560> you're<00:03:31.250> using<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:32.120> set<00:03:32.420> of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
together now if you're using a set of

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.930 
together now if you're using a set of
building<00:03:33.110> blueprints<00:03:33.650> plans<00:03:34.100> make<00:03:34.580> sure<00:03:34.760> that

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
building blueprints plans make sure that

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.860 
building blueprints plans make sure that
you<00:03:35.120> understand<00:03:36.250> which<00:03:37.250> plates<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.300> engineer

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
you understand which plates the engineer

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.280 
you understand which plates the engineer
wants<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.920> connect<00:03:40.340> together<00:03:41.080> that<00:03:42.080> would

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
wants you to connect together that would

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.120 
wants you to connect together that would
be<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.680> pain<00:03:43.040> in<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.220> butt<00:03:43.550> if<00:03:43.880> you<00:03:44.150> went<00:03:44.450> and

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
be a pain in the butt if you went and

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.190 
be a pain in the butt if you went and
nailed<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.460> metal<00:03:46.730> straps<00:03:47.030> on<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.780> lower

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
nailed the metal straps on the lower

nailed the metal straps on the lower
plate<00:03:48.650> when<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.130> architect<00:03:49.670> wanted<00:03:50.150> them<00:03:50.360> on

plate when the architect wanted them on

plate when the architect wanted them on
the<00:03:50.810> upper<00:03:50.840> plate<00:03:51.440> so<00:03:51.830> again<00:03:52.130> pay<00:03:52.370> attention

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the upper plate so again pay attention

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.720 
the upper plate so again pay attention
to<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.090> plans<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:54.620> straps<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:55.460> I<00:03:55.580> was

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
to the plans the straps that I was

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.380 
to the plans the straps that I was
referring<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:57.190> previously<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.580> was<00:03:59.030> just<00:03:59.210> kind

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
referring to previously I was just kind

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.990 
referring to previously I was just kind
of<00:03:59.450> giving<00:03:59.990> you<00:04:00.080> a<00:04:00.110> general<00:04:00.410> idea<00:04:00.770> about<00:04:01.640> them

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
of giving you a general idea about them

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.270 
of giving you a general idea about them
but<00:04:02.420> if<00:04:02.780> using<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.200> set<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.530> plans<00:04:03.800> make<00:04:04.100> sure

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
but if using a set of plans make sure

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.210 
but if using a set of plans make sure
that<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.550> pay<00:04:04.730> attention<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:05.510> them<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.220> again

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
that you pay attention to them and again

that you pay attention to them and again
these<00:04:07.400> Stretton<00:04:07.760> straps<00:04:08.560> can<00:04:09.560> be<00:04:09.620> tricky

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
make sure that you figure out a way how
