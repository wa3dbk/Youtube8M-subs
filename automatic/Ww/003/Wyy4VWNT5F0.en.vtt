pretty interesting on some of these sets
are<00:00:18.210> well<00:00:18.990> they're<00:00:19.680> certainly<00:00:19.859> worthy<00:00:20.220> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
discussion let's put it that way now

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.960 
discussion let's put it that way now
first<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.680> all<00:00:22.769> first<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
first of all first of all we have the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.420 
first of all first of all we have the
priests<00:00:24.300> which<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.890> priest<00:00:26.160> is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
priests which is here and the priest is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.650 
priests which is here and the priest is
in<00:00:26.910> my<00:00:27.300> opinion<00:00:27.830> pretty<00:00:28.830> cool<00:00:29.220> now<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.390> reason

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
in my opinion pretty cool now the reason

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.810 
in my opinion pretty cool now the reason
why<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.929> doing<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.529> human<00:00:31.949> female<00:00:32.099> model<00:00:32.640> is

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
why I'm doing a human female model is

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
why I'm doing a human female model is
because<00:00:33.210> currently<00:00:33.719> I've<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.710> had<00:00:34.890> bugs

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
because currently I've just had bugs

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
because currently I've just had bugs
with<00:00:35.610> many<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.270> other<00:00:36.390> races<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.110> genders

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
with many of the other races and genders

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.110 
with many of the other races and genders
for<00:00:37.649> example<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.190> human<00:00:38.489> male<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.940> head

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
for example in the human male the head

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.450 
for example in the human male the head
is<00:00:39.300> ginormously<00:00:40.140> oversized<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.980> some<00:00:41.100> reason

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
is ginormously oversized for some reason

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.280 
is ginormously oversized for some reason
so<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> best<00:00:42.600> model<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.170> we're

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
so this is the best model that we're

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
so this is the best model that we're
going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> go<00:00:43.829> off<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.789> know<00:00:44.850> go

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
going to have to go off and you know go

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
going to have to go off and you know go
off<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> minute<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.989> don't<00:00:46.320> ously<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
off with it the minute I don't ously I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.080 
off with it the minute I don't ously I
think<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> pretty<00:00:47.430> solid<00:00:47.640> model<00:00:48.000> for

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
think it's a pretty solid model for

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.180 
think it's a pretty solid model for
showing<00:00:48.300> off<00:00:48.420> armor<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:50.070> know

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
showing off armor because you know

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
showing off armor because you know
things<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.969> shoulders<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> little

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
things like the shoulders are a little

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.290 
things like the shoulders are a little
bit<00:00:52.260> more<00:00:52.289> reasonably<00:00:52.980> proportioned<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.000> say

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
bit more reasonably proportioned and say

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.420 
bit more reasonably proportioned and say
on<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> human<00:00:55.020> male<00:00:55.199> which<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.800> frankly<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
on a human male which can frankly be a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.470 
on a human male which can frankly be a
bit<00:00:57.030> ridiculous<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:57.930> times<00:00:58.609> anyway<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.670> about

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
bit ridiculous at times anyway so about

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.319 
bit ridiculous at times anyway so about
this<00:01:00.809> actual<00:01:01.230> set<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.160> armor<00:01:02.670> first<00:01:03.210> thing

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
this actual set of armor first thing

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.789 
this actual set of armor first thing
you're<00:01:03.420> gonna<00:01:03.539> notice<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.530> can

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
you're gonna notice and if I can

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.920 
you're gonna notice and if I can
actually<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.309> controls<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.810> we

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
actually just use controls right if we

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
actually just use controls right if we
pan<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.890> you've<00:01:08.340> got<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> kind<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> like

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
pan here you've got this kind of like

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.710 
pan here you've got this kind of like
cloth<00:01:09.990> towel<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.830> thingy<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> silk

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
cloth towel or thingy going on the silk

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.270 
cloth towel or thingy going on the silk
thingy<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.229> actually<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:13.770> that's<00:01:13.979> really

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
thingy I actually think that's really

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.530 
thingy I actually think that's really
cool<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> face<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.150> that's<00:01:15.270> definitely

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
cool on the face so that's definitely

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
cool on the face so that's definitely
nice<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.159> these<00:01:17.340> skull

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
nice and then you can see these skull

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.460 
nice and then you can see these skull
things<00:01:18.150> which<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.509> moving<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> shoulders<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
things which are moving the shoulders I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.679 
things which are moving the shoulders I
think<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.770> looks<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.040> cool<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.700> some<00:01:21.630> of

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
think that looks really cool I'm some of

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.609 
think that looks really cool I'm some of
the<00:01:21.750> lighting<00:01:21.990> effects<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> bit<00:01:22.439> broken

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the lighting effects are a bit broken

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.740 
the lighting effects are a bit broken
here<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.759> there<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.330> floating

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
here and then there is this floating

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.780 
here and then there is this floating
thingy<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> back<00:01:25.860> which<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.490> think

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
thingy on the back which I also think

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.539 
thingy on the back which I also think
looks<00:01:27.720> pretty<00:01:28.049> cool<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> rest<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
looks pretty cool as for the rest of the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.160 
looks pretty cool as for the rest of the
set<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.180> got<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> very<00:01:30.570> solid<00:01:30.780> color

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
set I think it's got a very solid color

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
set I think it's got a very solid color
palette<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.740> overall<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.939> looking

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
palette and overall it's just looking

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.679 
palette and overall it's just looking
really<00:01:34.020> quite<00:01:34.259> nice<00:01:34.500> now<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:36.000> some<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
really quite nice now on some of the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.899 
really quite nice now on some of the
models<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:37.950> haven't<00:01:38.189> been<00:01:38.280> too<00:01:38.520> much<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
models I just haven't been too much of a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
models I just haven't been too much of a
fan<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.299> scaling<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> things<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.500> mainly

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
fan of the scaling of things like mainly

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
fan of the scaling of things like mainly
the<00:01:41.009> shoulder<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.659> again<00:01:42.659> we'll<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:42.930> have

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the shoulder but again we'll just have

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.510 
the shoulder but again we'll just have
to<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:43.409> how<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.590> pans<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> full

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
to see how that pans out in the full

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.010 
to see how that pans out in the full
version<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> model<00:01:45.270> though<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.840> that

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
version of the model though I think that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
version of the model though I think that
this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.590> looking<00:01:46.829> pretty<00:01:47.310> decent<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.970> suppose

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
this is looking pretty decent I suppose

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.789 
this is looking pretty decent I suppose
you<00:01:48.780> could<00:01:48.899> maybe<00:01:49.020> say<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.259> shoulders<00:01:49.649> are

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you could maybe say the shoulders are

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.310 
you could maybe say the shoulders are
just<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.979> tad<00:01:50.159> chunky<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.790> priest<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:52.290> know

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
just a tad chunky for a priest you know

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.710 
just a tad chunky for a priest you know
obviously<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.700> look<00:01:54.180> back<00:01:54.479> at

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
obviously if you I think look back at

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
obviously if you I think look back at
some<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.409> cloth<00:01:55.829> gear<00:01:56.250> from<00:01:56.640> past

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
some of the cloth gear from past

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.300 
some of the cloth gear from past
expansions<00:01:57.840> they<00:01:58.409> were<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.590> little<00:01:58.890> bit<00:01:59.159> less

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
expansions they were a little bit less

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.859 
expansions they were a little bit less
ridiculous<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.060> terms<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> shoulders<00:02:00.719> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
ridiculous in terms of the shoulders and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.240 
ridiculous in terms of the shoulders and
stuff<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> suppose<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> lot<00:02:02.070> of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
stuff like that and I suppose a lot of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.330 
stuff like that and I suppose a lot of
players<00:02:02.460> wish<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:04.320> go<00:02:04.770> back<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
players wish they would go back to that

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.609 
players wish they would go back to that
way<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> doing<00:02:05.700> things<00:02:06.119> anyway<00:02:06.960> let's<00:02:07.170> move<00:02:07.409> on

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
way of doing things anyway let's move on

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.969 
way of doing things anyway let's move on
to<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.250> next<00:02:08.580> thing<00:02:08.879> which<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.080> rather

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
to the next thing which is the rather

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.600 
to the next thing which is the rather
odd<00:02:11.580> Dru

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
odd Dru

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.000 
odd Dru
SATs<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.810> I'll<00:02:13.930> try<00:02:14.200> making<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.770> night

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
SATs and I'll try making this a night

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.360 
SATs and I'll try making this a night
elf<00:02:15.220> because<00:02:15.430> hey<00:02:16.210> night<00:02:16.600> elf<00:02:16.810> Druids<00:02:17.370> though

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
elf because hey night elf Druids though

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.710 
elf because hey night elf Druids though
I<00:02:18.400> don't<00:02:18.520> know<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:19.000> will<00:02:19.180> make<00:02:19.210> various

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
I don't know if this will make various

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.400 
I don't know if this will make various
things<00:02:20.020> explode<00:02:20.500> we'll<00:02:20.680> have<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.980> find<00:02:21.190> out<00:02:22.410> so

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
things explode we'll have to find out so

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.500 
things explode we'll have to find out so
far<00:02:23.740> everything<00:02:24.220> seems<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.550> be<00:02:24.640> working<00:02:24.730> nice

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
far everything seems to be working nice

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.230 
far everything seems to be working nice
okay<00:02:25.870> everything<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.260> working<00:02:26.530> now<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:28.000> is

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
okay everything is working now this is

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.270 
okay everything is working now this is
an<00:02:28.480> odd<00:02:28.630> set<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.230> also<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.620> mythic<00:02:29.980> set

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
an odd set this is also the mythic set

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.120 
an odd set this is also the mythic set
so<00:02:31.050> obviously<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:32.500> going<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.920> be<00:02:33.010> very

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
so obviously it's not going to be very

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.850 
so obviously it's not going to be very
easy<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.610> attain<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.240> overall<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:35.470> looking

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
easy to attain and overall it's looking

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.080 
easy to attain and overall it's looking
okay<00:02:36.250> enough<00:02:36.460> from<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.700> front

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
okay enough from the front

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.030 
okay enough from the front
this<00:02:37.210> is<00:02:37.360> definitely<00:02:37.540> an<00:02:37.840> ultra<00:02:38.320> subjective

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
this is definitely an ultra subjective

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.860 
this is definitely an ultra subjective
pitov<00:02:39.370> gear<00:02:39.640> some<00:02:40.150> people<00:02:40.360> are<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.720> love

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
pitov gear some people are going to love

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.100 
pitov gear some people are going to love
it<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.340> some<00:02:42.340> are<00:02:42.370> certainly<00:02:42.880> going<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.930> hate

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
it and some are certainly going to hate

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.370 
it and some are certainly going to hate
it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.740 
it
I'm<00:02:44.560> transmog<00:02:45.220> out<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.730> well<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.150> do<00:02:46.240> like<00:02:46.510> is

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
I'm transmog out of it well I do like is

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.030 
I'm transmog out of it well I do like is
that<00:02:46.780> there's<00:02:47.050> no<00:02:47.260> overall<00:02:47.530> kind<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.800> green

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
that there's no overall kind of green

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.830 
that there's no overall kind of green
carapace<00:02:48.550> thing<00:02:48.850> going<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.510> here<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.780> think

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
carapace thing going on here I think

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.620 
carapace thing going on here I think
it's<00:02:50.200> nice<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.890> sort<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.250> uniform<00:02:52.209> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
it's nice of that sort of uniform the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.900 
it's nice of that sort of uniform the
helm<00:02:52.900> itself<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:53.860> suppose<00:02:54.280> pretty<00:02:54.610> cool<00:02:54.820> if

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
helm itself is I suppose pretty cool if

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.580 
helm itself is I suppose pretty cool if
you're<00:02:54.970> into<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.239> whole<00:02:55.270> bug<00:02:55.540> thing<00:02:55.840> it's<00:02:56.380> got

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
you're into the whole bug thing it's got

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.110 
you're into the whole bug thing it's got
these<00:02:56.709> cool<00:02:56.980> animated<00:02:57.340> shoulders<00:02:57.850> which<00:02:58.000> I

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
these cool animated shoulders which I

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.090 
these cool animated shoulders which I
guess<00:02:58.300> some<00:02:58.510> people<00:02:58.540> would<00:02:58.900> like<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.350> finally

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
guess some people would like and finally

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.160 
guess some people would like and finally
it's<00:03:00.520> got<00:03:00.760> bloody<00:03:01.060> wings<00:03:01.360> strapped<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:02.080> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
it's got bloody wings strapped in the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.100 
it's got bloody wings strapped in the
back<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.800> do<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.640> don't<00:03:04.300> know<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.989> don't

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
back that do that I don't know I don't

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.840 
back that do that I don't know I don't
really<00:03:05.290> like<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:05.950> don't<00:03:06.280> think<00:03:06.459> I'd<00:03:06.700> wear

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
really like it I don't think I'd wear

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.330 
really like it I don't think I'd wear
this<00:03:07.060> at<00:03:07.300> my<00:03:07.570> druid<00:03:07.900> but<00:03:08.260> perhaps<00:03:08.560> some<00:03:09.010> people

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
this at my druid but perhaps some people

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.180 
this at my druid but perhaps some people
would<00:03:10.200> again<00:03:11.200> let<00:03:11.530> me<00:03:11.560> know<00:03:11.709> what<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.010> think

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
would again let me know what you think

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.060 
would again let me know what you think
about<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:13.110> we<00:03:14.110> have<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.350> Warlock<00:03:14.800> now

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
about that we have the Warlock now

which I guess is really cool and overall
I'm<00:04:37.150> just<00:04:37.180> a<00:04:37.750> bit<00:04:37.900> well<00:04:38.590> it's<00:04:39.220> like<00:04:39.789> I'm<00:04:39.940> happy

I'm surprised that I'm happy I guess I

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.370 
I'm surprised that I'm happy I guess I
was<00:04:42.940> so<00:04:43.270> prepared<00:04:43.449> for<00:04:43.810> this<00:04:43.900> just<00:04:44.199> to<00:04:44.349> be

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
was so prepared for this just to be

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.409 
was so prepared for this just to be
another<00:04:44.710> crappy<00:04:45.069> hunter<00:04:45.550> set<00:04:45.789> and<00:04:46.090> then

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
another crappy hunter set and then

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.850 
another crappy hunter set and then
looking<00:04:46.690> at<00:04:46.750> this<00:04:46.810> other<00:04:46.990> recolor<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.500> think<00:04:47.740> it

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
looking at this other recolor I think it

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.189 
looking at this other recolor I think it
also<00:04:48.009> looks<00:04:48.400> really<00:04:48.520> nice<00:04:49.000> now<00:04:49.599> there<00:04:49.780> is<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.900> 3d

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199

also looks really nice now there is a 3d
model<00:04:50.560> for<00:04:50.710> this<00:04:50.800> but<00:04:51.220> as<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.759> can<00:04:51.940> see<00:04:52.120> not

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
model for this but as you can see not

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.379 
model for this but as you can see not
particularly<00:04:53.110> working<00:04:53.680> not<00:04:54.669> particularly

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.900 
particularly working not particularly
well<00:04:55.780> scaled<00:04:56.319> if<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.650> look<00:04:56.830> up<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.550> human

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
well scaled if you look up the the human

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.330 
well scaled if you look up the the human
male<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.539> yeah<00:04:59.380> it<00:04:59.470> breaks<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.979> helm<00:05:00.159> a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
male and yeah it breaks the helm a

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.770 
male and yeah it breaks the helm a
little<00:05:00.580> bit<00:05:00.759> so<00:05:00.940> let's<00:05:01.090> just<00:05:01.240> go<00:05:01.360> back<00:05:01.539> to<00:05:01.690> the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
little bit so let's just go back to the

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.260 
little bit so let's just go back to the
proper<00:05:02.139> version<00:05:02.319> and<00:05:02.710> but<00:05:03.370> yeah<00:05:03.610> look<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.180> think

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
proper version and but yeah look I think

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.719 
proper version and but yeah look I think
this<00:05:04.539> is<00:05:04.659> a<00:05:04.690> nice<00:05:04.900> bit<00:05:05.169> of<00:05:05.199> gear<00:05:05.530> I'm<00:05:05.830> I<00:05:06.370> know

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
this is a nice bit of gear I'm I know

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.279 
this is a nice bit of gear I'm I know
I'm<00:05:07.120> happy<00:05:07.330> with<00:05:07.479> how<00:05:07.599> it<00:05:07.720> turned<00:05:07.750> out<00:05:08.050> I

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
I'm happy with how it turned out I

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.490 
I'm happy with how it turned out I
suppose<00:05:08.650> maybe<00:05:09.300> like<00:05:10.300> these<00:05:10.479> horns<00:05:10.960> not<00:05:11.169> being

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
suppose maybe like these horns not being

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.120 
suppose maybe like these horns not being
symmetrical<00:05:12.340> is<00:05:12.580> perhaps<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.509> tad<00:05:13.539> annoying<00:05:14.130> so

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
symmetrical is perhaps a tad annoying so

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.909 
symmetrical is perhaps a tad annoying so
that<00:05:15.550> could<00:05:15.849> really<00:05:16.180> get<00:05:16.690> on<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.199> nerve<00:05:17.650> some

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
that could really get on the nerve some

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.980 
that could really get on the nerve some
people<00:05:18.190> I<00:05:18.580> don't<00:05:19.210> know<00:05:19.330> if<00:05:19.419> it'll<00:05:19.569> get<00:05:19.780> on<00:05:19.900> my

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
people I don't know if it'll get on my

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.899 
people I don't know if it'll get on my
nerves<00:05:20.229> I<00:05:20.500> can<00:05:20.889> definitely<00:05:21.099> see<00:05:21.669> myself

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
nerves I can definitely see myself

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.580 
nerves I can definitely see myself
getting<00:05:22.240> annoyed<00:05:22.569> out<00:05:22.780> at<00:05:22.900> though<00:05:23.020> so<00:05:23.530> I'll

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
getting annoyed out at though so I'll

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.899 
getting annoyed out at though so I'll
have<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.800> see<00:05:23.830> how<00:05:24.039> it<00:05:24.099> plays<00:05:24.220> out<00:05:24.490> when<00:05:24.699> the

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
have to see how it plays out when the

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.670 
have to see how it plays out when the
expansion<00:05:25.180> actually<00:05:25.720> launches<00:05:26.110> anyway

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
expansion actually launches anyway

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.620
