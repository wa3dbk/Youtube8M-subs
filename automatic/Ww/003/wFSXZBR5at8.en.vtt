00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hey, guys, what are you talking about here? 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.280
 how do you do 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.860
 for the motorcycle panel to light up when 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.580
 you turn the key if you know these fans 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.500
 She does not turn on the key, she only gets on the pedal. 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.500
 a hat or here is when lighting 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.260
 let's think the following process here 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.110
 It's quite simple that you're going to make yourselves 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.910
 identify the color of the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.579
 here for this panel that this vision of 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.150
 fan panel 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.339
 just know do not know if my changes more or 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.670
 shoot a think every one should be 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:55.570
 filmed one on a street and has a green one 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.730
 one so positive to identify there in the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:04.930
 whip down taking a beacon for 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:07.630
 to identify him another cut him is another 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.420
 however, the zimbo connector 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.010
 Give me a way to get me out of 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.960
 what do you take 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:21.070
 there you will amend it on the positive of 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.619
 ignition will have to cut or the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.689
 words are a thing in my here as 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.850
 an invention of the original 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:32.520
 I had to do shit even I mended 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:36.970
 next to ignition confusion on the street no 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.000
 so no good you lived is to call pull 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.280
 an ignition wire and connect directly to the 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.200
 whip that can burn to make you 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:52.650
 cut or strip yarn in brown shot 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:02:00.460
 connector it is locked off and 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:01.990
 positive ignition and 60 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.340
 realizing that it is also being 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.130
 designed south 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.720
 he is always short because on top of 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.489
 panel it has nothing transparent 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.940
 I had continuous sleep and in the future I 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.920
 I'll see if I can buy a panel. 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.750
 customize the agreement was already arrives 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.319
 here and this installation that today was the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:25.120
 The next I went inside made a hole 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.810
 zezinho got lego league 2 wire a 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.230
 nobody 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.530
 I scraped the brown green beads and the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.890
 end a link a side that's alright 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.260

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.989
 explanation is simple shoot the ram 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.650
 positive of the invention is the child who gives 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.650
 start to end of game 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.010
