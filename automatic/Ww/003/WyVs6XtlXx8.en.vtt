00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.100
 we're 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.299
 in this project we follow quickly 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.279
 it's probably worth going to go the route 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.109
 this gentleman they comment to me by here they say to me 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.539
 over here on the intercom that to catch 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.980
 perfect perfect perfect perfect others 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.710
 pinches suddenly we catch all this happens 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.269
 and good for me makes up only 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.340
 for a while it's worth and I just have to give 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.170
 school and for the first time to work are 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.600
 those who leave almost everything practically 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.250
 for not heading and to forgive him a pispÃ¡s already 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.170
 that we are here we think 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.710
 that this goes quickly to this one that has 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.040
 stayed but that we do not take anything like 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.960
 this and the front and sure this 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.149
 obviously kill that other one who also 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.070
 even there we skip this so that it does not 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.340
 the trap comes eating that too 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340
 catch 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.710
 I am in a very fast game 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.490
 ahead it is possible to know that the school 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.490
 still 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.730
 I want to get before itself and 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.790
 we'll start then I'll lose it and such 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.070
 I want to be here to stop it going 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.920
 I'm going to quickly get the chest this 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.510
 the lava of the unjust that the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.830
 carrot 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.830
 It is the best food 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.880
 let's see all this and I'll see if this 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.380
 it happens because it's thoughtful but let's see 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.750
 one thing with programs but that's 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.640
 like paint for mac paint the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.220
 Kidnappers in the boot inventory 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.600
 I've been growing, they 're part of 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.470
 the flight is worth some apples 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.570
 that I like the stone sword of 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.780
 huawei 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.729
 I have put that I know 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.729
 the hearts has also been eaten 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.170
 pretty good 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.190
 comes with banfield 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.530
 xavier, everyone is all a rapper, see 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.950
 participating as bombs like shit 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.190
 this pushed the effect of the influx and what 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.730
 kill now he came back quickly and I make a 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.730
 good rapine 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.280
 to 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.819
 and the cope 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.580
