the<00:03:49.819> tear<00:03:50.000> duct<00:03:50.239> area<00:03:50.419> because<00:03:50.959> if<00:03:52.030> even<00:03:53.030> if

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
the tear duct area because if even if

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.030 
the tear duct area because if even if
whether<00:03:53.359> you<00:03:53.480> water<00:03:53.900> or<00:03:54.169> not<00:03:54.439> I<00:03:54.650> think<00:03:54.680> it

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
whether you water or not I think it

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.159 
whether you water or not I think it
still<00:03:55.280> has<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.639> ability<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.060> travel<00:03:56.540> down<00:03:56.870> and

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
still has the ability to travel down and

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.679 
still has the ability to travel down and
then<00:03:57.730> gather<00:03:58.730> up<00:03:58.819> in<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.150> corner<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.569> then

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
then gather up in the corner and then

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.530 
then gather up in the corner and then
leak<00:03:59.900> down<00:04:00.169> and<00:04:00.379> spoil<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.709> eyeshadow<00:04:01.540> so

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
leak down and spoil the eyeshadow so

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.390 
leak down and spoil the eyeshadow so

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
even with bridles I kind of just tend to

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.830
