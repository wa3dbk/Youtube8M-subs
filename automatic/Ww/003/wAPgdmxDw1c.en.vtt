00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
not going to see wolves as hungry

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.740 
not going to see wolves as hungry
because<00:00:26.760> they<00:00:27.000> had<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:28.070> steer<00:00:29.750> hindquarters

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
because they had a steer hindquarters

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.630 
because they had a steer hindquarters
which<00:00:31.050> was<00:00:31.230> about<00:00:31.410> 40<00:00:31.800> or<00:00:31.830> 50<00:00:32.130> pounds<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.460> meat

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.459 
which was about 40 or 50 pounds of meat
now<00:00:32.850> most<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.450> was<00:00:33.630> probably<00:00:33.899> eaten<00:00:34.320> by

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
four of them do investigate the deer

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.870 
four of them do investigate the deer
initially<00:01:06.560> wanting<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> see<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.790> know

hungry<00:01:13.049> they<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.490> they<00:01:14.490> may<00:01:14.729> engage<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.630> tug

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
hungry they are they may engage in a tug

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.600 
hungry they are they may engage in a tug
of<00:01:15.840> war<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.380> kind<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.860> polling<00:01:17.280> behavior

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
of war or kind of a polling behavior

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
of war or kind of a polling behavior
like<00:01:17.729> Janelle<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.180> doing<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:19.229> there

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
like Janelle is doing that right there

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.429 
like Janelle is doing that right there
so<00:01:19.770> Luna<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> said<00:01:21.210> ed<00:01:21.630> eaten<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.110> lot<00:01:22.140> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
so Luna like I said ed eaten a lot of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.080 
so Luna like I said ed eaten a lot of
that<00:01:22.560> steer<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:22.979> well<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.250> Aidan<00:01:23.670> had<00:01:23.820> probably

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that steer as well as Aidan had probably

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.340 
that steer as well as Aidan had probably
eaten<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> lot<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.630> steer<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:25.110> on

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
eaten a lot of that steer as well on

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.230 
eaten a lot of that steer as well on
Monday<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.100> they're<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> hungry

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
Monday so they're not all that hungry

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.649 
Monday so they're not all that hungry
the<00:01:27.990> other<00:01:28.110> thing<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.950> very<00:01:29.250> warm

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
the other thing is that it's very warm

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.630 
the other thing is that it's very warm
so<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.990> us<00:01:31.020> we're<00:01:31.740> getting<00:01:31.979> temperatures<00:01:32.400> in

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so for us we're getting temperatures in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.880 
so for us we're getting temperatures in
the<00:01:32.729> 70<00:01:33.180> degrees<00:01:33.509> these<00:01:33.990> wolves<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> full

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the 70 degrees these wolves have a full

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.370 
the 70 degrees these wolves have a full
winter<00:01:35.189> coat<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.790> they're<00:01:35.939> not<00:01:36.150> all<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
winter coat so they're not all that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.789 
winter coat so they're not all that
hungry<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.530> they<00:01:40.530> say<00:01:40.740> too

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
hungry and it's it's as they say too

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.399 
hungry and it's it's as they say too
warm<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> eat<00:01:41.520> sometimes<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.110> deer<00:01:43.380> is

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
warm to eat sometimes so the deer is

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.859 
warm to eat sometimes so the deer is
thawed<00:01:44.280> from<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> freezer<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.570> freeze

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
thawed from the freezer we freeze

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
thawed from the freezer we freeze
everything<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.770> about<00:01:46.890> two<00:01:47.130> weeks<00:01:47.159> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
everything here for about two weeks to

everything here for about two weeks to
try<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> control<00:01:48.630> any<00:01:48.990> ticks<00:01:49.350> or<00:01:49.619> things

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
try to control any ticks or things

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.370
