and the device on the right it's on iOS

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.960 
and the device on the right it's on iOS
9<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:19.199> way<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.529> test<00:00:19.800> works<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.760> will

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
9 the way this test works is that I will

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.480 
9 the way this test works is that I will
start<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.449> timer<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.199> then<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.769> will<00:00:22.920> open<00:00:23.100> all

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
start the timer and then I will open all

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.519 
start the timer and then I will open all
of<00:00:23.519> these<00:00:23.820> stock<00:00:24.090> apps<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:25.080> will<00:00:25.289> see

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
of these stock apps and we will see

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.830 
of these stock apps and we will see
which<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.070> devices<00:00:26.670> will<00:00:26.880> perform<00:00:27.269> faster

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
which of the devices will perform faster

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.140 
which of the devices will perform faster
in<00:00:28.019> opening<00:00:28.590> these<00:00:28.769> apps<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.760> let's<00:00:29.970> go

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the timer let's start the timer and see

00:00:38.399 --> 00:01:24.890 
the timer let's start the timer and see
which<00:00:38.670> performs<00:00:39.180> faster

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.740 

you<00:01:25.900> can<00:01:26.080> see<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.470> device<00:01:26.830> on<00:01:27.100> iOS<00:01:27.580> 8<00:01:27.790> did<00:01:28.600> it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
you can see the device on iOS 8 did it

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.280 
you can see the device on iOS 8 did it
in<00:01:28.900> 42<00:01:29.380> seconds<00:01:30.159> while<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.700> device<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.540> iOS<00:01:32.050> 9

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
in 42 seconds while the device on iOS 9

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.700 
in 42 seconds while the device on iOS 9
did<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.190> in<00:01:33.340> 38<00:01:33.820> seconds<00:01:34.510> that's<00:01:35.050> amazing

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
did it in 38 seconds that's amazing

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.490 
did it in 38 seconds that's amazing
because<00:01:35.830> iOS<00:01:36.550> 9<00:01:36.790> is<00:01:37.090> still<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.630> beta<00:01:37.900> 1<00:01:38.259> and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
because iOS 9 is still on beta 1 and

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.370 
because iOS 9 is still on beta 1 and
hopefully<00:01:39.369> it<00:01:39.550> will<00:01:39.700> get<00:01:39.940> even<00:01:40.360> faster<00:01:40.840> with

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
hopefully it will get even faster with

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.100 
hopefully it will get even faster with
the<00:01:41.500> releases<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.369> next<00:01:42.729> betas<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.390> also

results we can see a faster performance

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.830 
results we can see a faster performance
on<00:01:52.000> iOS<00:01:52.509> 9<00:01:52.780> then<00:01:53.440> on<00:01:53.649> iOS<00:01:54.250> 8<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:54.910> that's<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:55.660> for
