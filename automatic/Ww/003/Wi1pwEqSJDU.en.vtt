is simply to swatch it on your jaw line

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.179 
is simply to swatch it on your jaw line
you<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.479> your<00:01:27.659> foundation<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.409> run<00:01:28.740> seamless

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you want your foundation to run seamless

seamlessly from your your jaw into your

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
seamlessly from your your jaw into your
neck<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.240> great<00:01:33.420> place<00:01:33.720> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
neck so that's a really great place to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.649 
neck so that's a really great place to
test<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.680> will<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.360> one's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
test it will see that that one's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.899

probably<00:01:36.869> too<00:01:37.590> light<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.280> one's<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
probably too light this one's going to

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.969 
probably too light this one's going to
be<00:01:39.409> too<00:01:40.409> dark

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
be too dark

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
be too dark

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
hopefully the one in the middle will be

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.690

extra hours sleep now under the eyes
it's<00:02:59.220> very<00:02:59.400> important<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:01.140> really<00:03:01.950> just

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
it's very important that you really just

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.440 
it's very important that you really just
put<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> concealer<00:03:02.910> where<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.269> need<00:03:03.420> it

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
put the concealer where you need it

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.670 
put the concealer where you need it
which<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.840> tends<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.230> right<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.530> that

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
which is tends to be right in that

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.949 
which is tends to be right in that
groove<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:06.120> don't<00:03:06.299> need<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.570> all<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.750> way<00:03:06.930> up

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
groove you don't need it all the way up

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.599 
groove you don't need it all the way up
to<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.320> lashes<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.829> all<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> way<00:03:08.160> down<00:03:08.190> here

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
to the lashes and all the way down here

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.130 
to the lashes and all the way down here
and<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.820> just<00:03:08.850> sort<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.209> want<00:03:09.359> to<00:03:09.450> Pat<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.750> into

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
and you just sort of want to Pat it into

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.110 
and you just sort of want to Pat it into
place<00:03:10.440> another<00:03:11.130> mistake<00:03:11.579> I<00:03:11.730> find<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.090> that

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
place another mistake I find is that

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.120 
place another mistake I find is that
people<00:03:12.450> use<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:13.019> concealer<00:03:13.350> that's<00:03:13.500> too<00:03:13.829> light

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
people use a concealer that's too light

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.710 
people use a concealer that's too light
and<00:03:14.579> then<00:03:14.730> they<00:03:14.820> end<00:03:14.940> up<00:03:15.060> kind<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.299> glowing

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and then they end up kind of glowing

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.690 
and then they end up kind of glowing
under<00:03:16.140> their<00:03:16.290> eyes<00:03:16.320> which<00:03:16.739> doesn't<00:03:17.070> tend<00:03:17.609> to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
under their eyes which doesn't tend to

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.030 
under their eyes which doesn't tend to
look<00:03:17.790> particularly<00:03:18.359> natural<00:03:19.109> again<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.739> lot<00:03:19.950> of

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
look particularly natural again a lot of

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.460 
look particularly natural again a lot of
times<00:03:20.220> you're<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:20.600> really<00:03:21.600> toning<00:03:22.170> things

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
times you're just really toning things

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.470 
times you're just really toning things
down<00:03:22.799> trying<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.549> completely<00:03:24.000> obliterate

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
down trying to completely obliterate

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150 
down trying to completely obliterate
them<00:03:24.630> sometimes<00:03:25.079> I<00:03:25.230> think<00:03:25.440> works<00:03:25.709> against

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
them sometimes I think works against

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.069 
them sometimes I think works against
doing<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.600> sense<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:27.840> you'll

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
doing that in in the sense that you'll

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.270 
doing that in in the sense that you'll
they'll<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.590> drawing<00:03:28.769> attention<00:03:28.950> to

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
they'll be drawing attention to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.860 
they'll be drawing attention to
something<00:03:29.519> if<00:03:29.609> you<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:29.730> too<00:03:30.000> much<00:03:30.209> product

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
something if you have too much product

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.710 
something if you have too much product
on<00:03:31.140> top<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:32.060> another<00:03:33.060> little<00:03:33.209> trick<00:03:33.510> that

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
on top of it another little trick that

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.979 
on top of it another little trick that
we<00:03:33.840> use<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.320> sometimes<00:03:34.739> with<00:03:35.730> laugh<00:03:35.940> lines<00:03:36.269> we

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
we use is sometimes with laugh lines we

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.509 
we use is sometimes with laugh lines we
pop<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> little<00:03:37.470> concealer<00:03:38.070> in<00:03:38.190> there<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.459> it

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
pop a little concealer in there and it

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.610 
pop a little concealer in there and it
tends<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.819> flatten<00:03:39.359> them<00:03:39.480> out<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.780> bed<00:03:39.930> like

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
tends to flatten them out of bed like

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.920 
tends to flatten them out of bed like
look<00:03:41.370> right<00:03:41.549> out

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
look right out

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.809 
look right out
so<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.200> end<00:03:44.319> result<00:03:44.680> is<00:03:44.920> just<00:03:45.430> really

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
so that the end result is just really

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.989 
so that the end result is just really
even<00:03:46.209> skin<00:03:46.629> and<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:48.040> mean<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.459> benefit<00:03:48.849> to<00:03:48.969> that

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:48.999 
even skin and I mean the benefit to that

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.839

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
actually doing the final judge just

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.450 
actually doing the final judge just
because<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:58.780> matte<00:04:59.139> and<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.830> really<00:05:00.099> holds

brush and really you're zeroing in on
problem<00:05:05.800> spots<00:05:06.099> and<00:05:06.400> it<00:05:06.490> really<00:05:06.729> just<00:05:06.970> gives

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
problem spots and it really just gives

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.040 
problem spots and it really just gives
it<00:05:07.270> that<00:05:07.349> final<00:05:09.330> cover-up<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.570> makes<00:05:10.900> it

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
it that final cover-up that makes it

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.430 
it that final cover-up that makes it
truly<00:05:11.259> disappear<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:13.150> takes<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.110> shine<00:05:14.409> away
