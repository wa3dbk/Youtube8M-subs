00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.109
 YouTube talk that the campaign a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.330
 car king videos channel here 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:18.510
 the next person who's there in the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:20.850
 lift a g5 goal 2012 and 2013 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.609
 is a car with a year and little and of use 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 no staff in the country of the cup 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.970
 the car has to be had to be standard 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.859
 had fifa but not right 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.390
 We are in Brazil, the cup in Brazil. 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.559
 country where cars are disposable there 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.010
 many will think 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.450
 the idea is good for you that is mechanical 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.930
 I will not say it's bad, no 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.270
 but I expected it as a car and it has all the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.910
 type of defect could not have expected 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.070
 among other defects of more 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.649
 common the thesis or issue of 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.190
 maintenance of his car to make 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.559
 proof maintenance timing belt tensioner 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.309
 candle changing candle cables the filters 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.710
 air filter between the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.659
 other oil filter and oil change 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.200
 has several types of service to do 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.470
 in the car even new but here in the case 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 here it is disassembled that everything is 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.729
 Let me go, I'll let you go. 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.810
 aggregate of suspension some know 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.470
 for frames per aggregate and there goes 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:36.509
 the power steering box does not 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.759
 found here at the tip of the flag axis 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:46.740
 to the terminal where the steering box is 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:49.890
 sector as some know here all 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:02:00.360
 then disassembled which is the defect falls handle 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:02:05.310
 the retainer there for me the most 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.979
 Funny, this retainer here was 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.140
 changed once 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.220
 What is the leak ? 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.030
 here look here if latch 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.450
 it comes with like a dove 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.050
 left the distance comes as if it were 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.660
 a ball that the plastic material 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.350
 reinforcement on the retainer so that the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.470
 seal with oil pressure do not bend 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:40.760
 so that as soon as he does not 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:43.920
 double here so it's doubling like this 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.040
 out in case he'll leak the man 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.590
 so come with this protection here I go 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.590
 take her now she's in there 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:03.390
 thus giving a reinforcement to the wall here of 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:08.160
 seal rubber so it will not come 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:11.930
 this force of that of the retainer there the pressure 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:17.790
 this does not come from the strength and ball and he 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.920
 leak oil pressure there I want 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.450
 show on the video and that the problem is not 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.420
 case a very new car to give this 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.510
 type of defect to understand a defect 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.300
 that many cars there come to present in the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.470
 most times over ten years old 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.740
 of use 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.790
 then many will say something g5 not 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:45.360
 and if in my opinion this is a 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:50.060
 car that I like so much because I 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:53.880
 I believe we are already in 2014 yet 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.000
 many cars in the power steering 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.290
 air conditioner still series item is 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.290
 it's not a serial 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.560
 I ended up talking nonsense 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.020
 the cars is not the one you have to ask with air 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.140
 or without air with direction without direction 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.330
 in this case it should come in all 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.049
 models already had to come down from said in 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.419
 of the car to be part of the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.590
 car in whatever model 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:28.520
 without understanding and most of the time a 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.370
 the cars of now problems that we 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.729
 old cars gave the defect with more 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.889
 of 10 thousand running over ten years 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.600
 running the car is already showing 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.660
 one year two years of use 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.180
 So, there, in the canopy country, the cars 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:49.729
 are not standard fifa do not hunt the 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.600
 little did not say a little exaggerated 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.290
 are also disposable is every time 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.510
 worse 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.650
 thanks youtube people who liked it and 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:03.770
 click that liked a neighbor and to 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.840
