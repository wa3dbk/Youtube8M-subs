sensor<00:03:43.389> this<00:03:44.049> is<00:03:44.169> definitely<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.650> very<00:03:45.099> good

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400

recommended the t2i moving on this is
probably<00:03:52.450> just<00:03:52.660> about<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.019> mid<00:03:53.260> range<00:03:53.560> of

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
probably just about the mid range of

acted it now has autofocus or continuous
autofocus<00:04:25.479> in<00:04:26.199> video<00:04:26.830> mode<00:04:26.889> I'm<00:04:27.610> actually

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
autofocus in video mode I'm actually

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.700 
autofocus in video mode I'm actually
shooting<00:04:28.150> with<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.419> t3i<00:04:28.900> right<00:04:29.229> now<00:04:29.380> which<00:04:29.560> is

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
shooting with the t3i right now which is

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.559 
shooting with the t3i right now which is
mostly<00:04:30.099> the<00:04:30.310> same<00:04:30.340> which<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.120> can<00:04:31.210> get<00:04:31.360> for<00:04:31.509> a

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
mostly the same which you can get for a

continuous<00:04:37.360> autofocus<00:04:37.509> the<00:04:38.500> model<00:04:38.800> I

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
continuous autofocus the model I

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.589 
continuous autofocus the model I
recommend<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.940> nine<00:04:40.120> hundred<00:04:40.419> dollar

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
recommend is the nine hundred dollar

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.469 
recommend is the nine hundred dollar
