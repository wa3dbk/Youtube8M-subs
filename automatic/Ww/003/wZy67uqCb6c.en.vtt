there that's on their fun let's try out

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.899 
there that's on their fun let's try out
think<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.770> free<00:01:41.040> moon<00:01:41.250> should<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
think that free moon should be on the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.850 
think that free moon should be on the
earth<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.240> make<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.659> trick<00:01:42.930> people<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.560> I

earth to make it trick people but I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
earth to make it trick people but I
don't<00:01:44.220> think<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> case<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
don't think that's the case in this

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.190 
don't think that's the case in this
matter<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.939> definitely<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.750> Mars

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200

matter I think it's definitely on Mars
that<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.740> mine<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.369> my<00:01:50.549> lock<00:01:50.880> answer<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that is mine that's my lock answer I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.980 
that is mine that's my lock answer I
think<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.290> Mars<00:01:52.500> definitely<00:01:53.750> just<00:01:54.750> gone

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

the bottom left there's part of the
shangri-la<00:02:49.680> comic<00:02:50.129> I<00:02:50.430> guess<00:02:51.389> behind<00:02:51.629> it<00:02:52.049> is

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
shangri-la comic I guess behind it is

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.140 
shangri-la comic I guess behind it is
probably<00:02:52.620> some<00:02:52.920> more<00:02:53.159> stuff<00:02:53.459> about<00:02:53.549> noon<00:02:53.940> that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
probably some more stuff about noon that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.879 
probably some more stuff about noon that
lets<00:02:54.359> not<00:02:54.510> been<00:02:54.690> revealed<00:02:54.930> yeah<00:02:55.230> that's<00:02:55.470> what

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
lets not been revealed yeah that's what

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.399 
lets not been revealed yeah that's what
that's<00:02:56.099> why<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.310> think<00:02:56.599> but<00:02:57.599> on<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.840> right<00:02:58.079> side

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
that's why I think but on the right side

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.960 
that's why I think but on the right side
of<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.680> page<00:03:00.439> yeah<00:03:01.439> then<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.280> top<00:03:02.579> right

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
of the page yeah then on the top right

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.119 
of the page yeah then on the top right
there<00:03:03.389> is<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.569> massive<00:03:03.870> shadow<00:03:04.290> which<00:03:04.829> probably

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
there is a massive shadow which probably

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.899 
there is a massive shadow which probably
is<00:03:05.519> Samantha<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.769> on<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.980> top<00:03:08.189> left<00:03:08.400> slide<00:03:08.700> it

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
is Samantha and on the top left slide it

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.729 
is Samantha and on the top left slide it
says<00:03:09.090> meanwhile<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:09.870> then<00:03:10.439> there's<00:03:10.650> a

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
says meanwhile and then there's a

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.589 
says meanwhile and then there's a
pyramid<00:03:11.250> flying<00:03:11.639> onto<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:12.120> moon<00:03:12.269> that's<00:03:12.480> the
