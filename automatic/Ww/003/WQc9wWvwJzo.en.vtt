 that is going to be to create missions like that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.010
 more and nothing less are you going to be able to create 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.980
 missions remember the creator of 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.380
 content that you could create your maps 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.630
 and you could put what you want then 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.240
 it's going to be pretty much the same but in 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.400
 this time they are going to be missions like me 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.560
 I know this as you ask Alejandro 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.710
 how do you know this this but not because 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.720
 you say this good there is a there is a video 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.110
 carnally there is a video that leaked 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.910
 obviously there are pictures and everything down here 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.320
 in the description or possibly here 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.119
 I'm going to put the video so that 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.430
 See, you can put a bit of the video 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.770
 I can not put everything because then I 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.570
 chingan with copyright or know I do not know 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.520
 what are I going to get oysters from or 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.640
 bitch and I'm going to put a pack with strike 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.410
 but well I'm going to put the link here 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.750
 down in the description of the video the 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.960
 video does not say anything or no no no no 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.810
 is commented is simply creating 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.360
 a mission the guy like as when you 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.490
 you create the condor you are creating a 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.929
 map or whatever it is because he is 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.740
 creating a mission that is not seen 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.470
 absolutely 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.049
 nothing else you will be able to see how it is 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.640
 making some changes as it is 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.980
 putting some changes how is 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.080
 doing for example 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.980
 some things in the video you will see 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.980
 you will be able to observe it 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.780
 in the video you see that there is a bit of 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.790
 limits or you will not be able to create 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.709
 you're going to be able to do a good mission 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.499
 crazy but you'll have access to 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.900
 do several very interesting things 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:29.109
 the truth is going to be quite fun 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.859
 with the content creator what the 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:34.900
 that it was free that we all already have 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:37.209
 this several of you made maps 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.849
 ok, it's that they were shown to me by 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.499
 several made very good maps 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.689
 I liked several of the ones that I 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.859
 they taught others they were a little 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.709
 exaggerated but many of you 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.900
 they made their own map and the truth 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.969
 There were several pacifiers 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.010
 they now imagine they will be able to create 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.680
 a mission you will be able to create a 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.109
 mission was going to be chingón this new 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.060
 dlc is not going to be very small but good 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.689
 I know with this I say goodbye 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.500
 it was simply to inform them no no 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.900
 it still knows nothing specifically not 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.449
 he knows when he will leave for example 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.359
 rockstar has not confirmed it simply 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:18.730
 it leaked maybe I do not know if it's a 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.620
 hacker this wey this wey that put it 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.709
 whatever it was he noticed more or less 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.420
 of how the fart was but I with this 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.010
 I say goodbye I hope and you liked it 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.970
