Huntsville High School and today we're
going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.659> cover<00:00:03.870> creating<00:00:04.290> outside<00:00:04.859> Bend<00:00:05.160> on

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
going to cover creating outside Bend on

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.519 
going to cover creating outside Bend on
the<00:00:05.339> ball<00:00:05.549> while<00:00:05.759> shooting<00:00:06.029> we<00:00:07.020> have<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> lot<00:00:07.410> to

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
the ball while shooting we have a lot to

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.920 
the ball while shooting we have a lot to
cover<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.099> let's<00:00:08.130> get<00:00:08.400> started

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.510 

first<00:00:14.930> of<00:00:15.050> all<00:00:15.170> I'd<00:00:15.500> like<00:00:15.559> to<00:00:15.770> thank<00:00:15.889> Bruce<00:00:16.280> an

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
first of all I'd like to thank Bruce an

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.950 
first of all I'd like to thank Bruce an

American challenge for sending some of
their<00:00:18.230> great<00:00:18.529> soccer<00:00:18.800> balls<00:00:19.130> so<00:00:19.369> that<00:00:19.520> we<00:00:19.610> can

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
their great soccer balls so that we can

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.310 
their great soccer balls so that we can
continue<00:00:20.060> to<00:00:20.330> create<00:00:20.450> these<00:00:20.690> videos

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
continue to create these videos

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.740 
continue to create these videos
Bruce<00:00:22.279> will<00:00:22.460> also<00:00:22.730> be<00:00:22.849> down<00:00:23.029> later<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:23.510> summer

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
Bruce will also be down later the summer

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.980 
Bruce will also be down later the summer
to<00:00:23.960> create<00:00:24.230> goalkeeping<00:00:24.830> videos<00:00:25.160> with<00:00:25.369> us<00:00:25.990> now

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
to create goalkeeping videos with us now

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.650 
to create goalkeeping videos with us now
then<00:00:27.200> let's<00:00:27.680> get<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:27.950> carving<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.340> shot

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
then let's get to carving a shot

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
then let's get to carving a shot
creating<00:00:29.660> an<00:00:29.750> outside<00:00:30.079> curve<00:00:30.349> during

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
creating an outside curve during

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.800 
creating an outside curve during
shooting<00:00:31.070> is<00:00:31.220> very<00:00:31.610> different<00:00:32.150> than<00:00:32.239> passing

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
shooting is very different than passing

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.020 
shooting is very different than passing
with<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.020> outside<00:00:33.380> of<00:00:33.410> your<00:00:33.620> foot<00:00:34.030> you're

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
with the outside of your foot you're

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.700 
with the outside of your foot you're
going<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:35.420> still<00:00:35.720> strike<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.200> ball<00:00:36.350> with<00:00:36.410> your

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
going to still strike the ball with your

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.250 
going to still strike the ball with your
laces<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.970> ball<00:00:38.180> is<00:00:38.300> just<00:00:38.420> hit<00:00:38.660> slightly

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
laces the ball is just hit slightly

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.520 
laces the ball is just hit slightly
off-center<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:39.950> create<00:00:40.430> curved<00:00:41.320> curving<00:00:42.320> any

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
off-center to create curved curving any

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.530 
off-center to create curved curving any
ball<00:00:42.920> whether<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:43.670> want<00:00:43.880> to<00:00:43.970> cause<00:00:44.149> that<00:00:44.180> ball

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
ball whether you want to cause that ball

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.380 
ball whether you want to cause that ball
to<00:00:44.840> go<00:00:44.989> left<00:00:45.350> right<00:00:45.800> or<00:00:45.829> down<00:00:46.340> you<00:00:47.059> need<00:00:47.239> to

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
to go left right or down you need to

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.959 
to go left right or down you need to
create<00:00:47.690> spin<00:00:48.079> on<00:00:48.289> the<00:00:48.379> ball<00:00:48.640> there's<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.760> whole

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
create spin on the ball there's a whole

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.729 
create spin on the ball there's a whole
lot<00:00:50.149> of<00:00:50.179> physics<00:00:50.629> behind<00:00:50.960> causing<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.589> ball

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
lot of physics behind causing the ball

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.069 
lot of physics behind causing the ball
to<00:00:51.800> curve<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:53.030> all<00:00:53.179> you<00:00:53.300> need<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.570> understand

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
to curve but all you need to understand

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.770 
to curve but all you need to understand
is<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:55.460> spin<00:00:55.760> on<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.030> ball<00:00:56.210> creates<00:00:56.629> a

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
is that the spin on the ball creates a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.750 
is that the spin on the ball creates a
low<00:00:57.019> pressure<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.739> high<00:00:57.920> pressure<00:00:58.190> area<00:00:58.670> on

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
low pressure and a high pressure area on

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.270 
low pressure and a high pressure area on
the<00:00:58.879> ball<00:00:59.059> which<00:00:59.510> causes<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.109> to<00:01:00.140> bend<00:01:00.499> in<00:01:00.769> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
the ball which causes it to bend in the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.869 
the ball which causes it to bend in the
air<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:03.170> need<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.379> now<00:01:03.649> cover<00:01:04.070> your<00:01:04.160> form<00:01:04.580> while

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
air we need to now cover your form while

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.960 
air we need to now cover your form while
putting<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.300> outside<00:01:05.870> Bend<00:01:06.260> on<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.500> ball

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
putting the outside Bend on the ball

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.149 
putting the outside Bend on the ball
first<00:01:07.970> off<00:01:08.180> let's<00:01:08.630> cover<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.050> plant<00:01:09.320> foot<00:01:09.560> the

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
first off let's cover the plant foot the

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.310 
first off let's cover the plant foot the
plant<00:01:10.490> foot<00:01:10.760> position<00:01:11.360> will<00:01:11.540> differ<00:01:11.780> from<00:01:12.080> the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
plant foot position will differ from the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.530 
plant foot position will differ from the
regular<00:01:12.680> instep<00:01:13.100> drive<00:01:13.400> shot<00:01:13.760> since<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.390> have

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
regular instep drive shot since you have

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.140 
regular instep drive shot since you have
to<00:01:14.690> place<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:14.960> slightly<00:01:15.350> behind<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.890> ball<00:01:16.150> you

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
to place it slightly behind the ball you

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.850 
to place it slightly behind the ball you
need<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.420> place<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.689> slightly<00:01:18.200> behind<00:01:18.560> the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
need to place it slightly behind the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.609 
need to place it slightly behind the
ball<00:01:19.009> into<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.430> side<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:21.049> can<00:01:21.259> swing

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
ball into the side so that you can swing

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.639 
ball into the side so that you can swing
your<00:01:21.829> leg<00:01:22.009> across<00:01:22.460> your<00:01:22.700> body<00:01:23.409> since<00:01:24.409> we're

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
your leg across your body since we're

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.980 
your leg across your body since we're
gonna<00:01:24.799> be<00:01:24.890> putting<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.790> more<00:01:26.210> behind<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.810> ball

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
gonna be putting it more behind the ball

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.170 
gonna be putting it more behind the ball
than<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.619> we<00:01:27.710> need<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.130> also<00:01:28.310> ensure<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:28.909> we

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
than you we need to also ensure that we

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.389 
than you we need to also ensure that we
are<00:01:29.270> putting<00:01:29.509> our<00:01:29.840> shoulders<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.500> head<00:01:30.920> over

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
are putting our shoulders and head over

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.219 
are putting our shoulders and head over
the<00:01:31.520> ball<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:32.180> prevent<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.719> ball<00:01:32.899> from<00:01:32.930> going

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
the ball to prevent the ball from going

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.789 
the ball to prevent the ball from going
too<00:01:33.680> high<00:01:34.659> now<00:01:35.659> let's<00:01:35.869> cover<00:01:36.079> where<00:01:36.409> we<00:01:36.590> want

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
too high now let's cover where we want

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.310 
too high now let's cover where we want
to<00:01:36.920> strike<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.369> ball<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:37.850> on<00:01:38.600> what<00:01:38.899> part<00:01:39.229> of

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
to strike the ball and on what part of

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.160 
to strike the ball and on what part of
our<00:01:39.469> foot<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:40.430> create<00:01:40.729> power<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.270> spin<00:01:41.780> on<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
our foot to create power and spin on the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.260 
our foot to create power and spin on the
shot<00:01:42.409> we<00:01:42.710> need<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:42.979> still<00:01:43.250> use<00:01:43.460> our<00:01:43.579> laces<00:01:43.880> when

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
shot we need to still use our laces when

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.749 
shot we need to still use our laces when
striking<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.869> ball<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.950> big<00:01:46.159> difference<00:01:46.579> is

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
striking the ball the big difference is

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.940 
striking the ball the big difference is
that<00:01:46.789> we<00:01:47.149> want<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.600> strike<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.020> ball<00:01:48.200> slightly
