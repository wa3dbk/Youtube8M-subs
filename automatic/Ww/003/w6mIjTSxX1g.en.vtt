00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.299
 I greet you on my channel today 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.070
 talk to you here about this watch not 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.449
 I will make a long video just 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.160
 I will talk about the basic functions of this watch and 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.420
 because unpacking was so much 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.390
 short no need to run somewhere in general 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.369
 unpacked showed and ran off kit 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.399
 shipments delivered in just such 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.510
 here's a cardboard box 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:43.820
 here comes the wire with such a connector 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:53.989
 checks can pick up to any 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:57.800
 yusbi instruction in Chinese and 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:05.939
 English language 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:09.330
 It looks cool I bought under the room 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:15.060
 I have all the furniture made from this 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.670
 let's say color solution light 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:24.330
 I think black letter is called dark 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:28.159
 books something like the back we have 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:34.070
 the settings button works all on 4 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:41.810
 the little batteries mean brightness 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:45.600
 hours can adjust this minimum 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.080
 this is the maximum I always have on 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.440
 minimum level 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.870
 here is this food squeal here is pressing 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.110
 no buttons can be adjusted 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.880
 but I at least have not found 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.760
 power saving mode 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:08.540
 here you see now that is you took them 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.480
 in the hands they turn on they set 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.690
 can also be turned off then 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.640
 Spring I want to press a button here and 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:23.290
 they light up nicely made enough 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.290
 the display is 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.270
 temperature honestly at my home 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.170
 no thermometer so I can not 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:37.190
 reasoning is incorrectly shown 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:42.160
 there are three alarm settings you 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:49.310
 can set the date is date 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.530
 the display can be 4 24 24 hours and 12 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.950
 o'clock 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:02.000
 then my alarm clock is on 547 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.150
 you can set up three alarms that 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.290
 say this watch looks cool 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.799
 i was buying 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:15.110
 under the interior of your room under the furniture 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.359
 time seems to be going well but honestly 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:22.129
 speaking in the picture the clock looks much 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:25.969
 better than life buy not buy 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:28.359
 you decide to unpack this watch will 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:32.470
 in the video description 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:35.359
 there you will find a link to the seller 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:40.280
 forgot to say that this one is exactly a tree 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:44.540
 I scratched somewhere here and straight chips 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.420
 it is felt and evident that immediately 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.939
 a tree like this 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:58.430
 a small review on this watch is up to you 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:04:02.450
 you already make this decision i say 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:06.319
 so I did not regret that I bought this watch 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:15.319
 although frankly these are all here 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:18.669
 know the mode here is the type find off 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:23.470
 here are these rg saving mode 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:29.090
 there is light let 's admit this glow 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.039
 adjust by long pressing the key 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.210
 And so on 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:39.830
 have to tinker first but then 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:44.030
 you understand what's the instruction of course 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.340
 You can read the instructions but let's say 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.780
 I am a Russian man therefore I did everything 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.880
 at random all thanks to all put
