00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.050 
because to have freedom that involved
risk<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.799> laws<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.850> less

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
risk and the more laws you have the less

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.700 
risk and the more laws you have the less
freedom<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:57.960> there's<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> lot<00:01:58.619> of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
freedom you have there's a lot of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.069 
freedom you have there's a lot of
speculation<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.399> constitutionality<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.630> I

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
speculation on constitutionality and I

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.899 
speculation on constitutionality and I
speculate<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.399> question<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
speculate that the question of

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.880 
speculate that the question of
constitutionality<00:02:03.659> has<00:02:04.409> probably<00:02:04.740> been

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
constitutionality has probably been

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.550 
constitutionality has probably been
asked<00:02:05.430> me<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
asked me not to think that the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.660 
asked me not to think that the
constitutionality<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.590> something<00:02:08.340> has<00:02:08.490> never

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
constitutionality of something has never

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.609 
constitutionality of something has never
been<00:02:08.880> questioned

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
been questioned

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.470 
been questioned
yeah<00:02:10.619> I've<00:02:10.799> thought<00:02:10.829> of<00:02:11.159> that<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.329> know

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
yeah I've thought of that but you know

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.399 
yeah I've thought of that but you know
it's<00:02:12.719> never<00:02:12.959> been<00:02:13.519> decided<00:02:14.519> by<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.480> judicial

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
it's never been decided by the judicial

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.649 
it's never been decided by the judicial
branch<00:02:16.439> that<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.340> unconstitutional<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
branch that it's unconstitutional to

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.289 
branch that it's unconstitutional to
mandate<00:02:19.049> this<00:02:19.290> let's<00:02:19.709> say<00:02:20.010> something<00:02:20.879> happens

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
mandate this let's say something happens

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.449 
mandate this let's say something happens
in<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.569> building<00:02:21.959> whether<00:02:22.799> there<00:02:23.069> are<00:02:23.099> people

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
in the building whether there are people

in the building whether there are people
in<00:02:23.639> there<00:02:23.790> or<00:02:23.969> not<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.480> an<00:02:25.019> alarm<00:02:25.379> goes<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:26.040> the

fire department and the fire crew

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.050 
fire department and the fire crew
arrives<00:02:28.500> could<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> false<00:02:29.370> alarm

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.750 
arrives could be a false alarm
so<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.319> want<00:02:31.530> them<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:31.980> tear<00:02:32.519> down

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
so do you want them to just tear down

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.970 
so do you want them to just tear down
everything<00:02:33.389> go<00:02:33.810> inside<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.439> find<00:02:34.650> out<00:02:34.829> there

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
everything go inside to find out there

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.940 
everything go inside to find out there
is<00:02:35.099> nothing<00:02:35.549> or<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:36.599> you're<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:37.049> of<00:02:37.079> town<00:02:37.230> they
