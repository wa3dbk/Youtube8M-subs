means that you have to have a specific
order<00:02:19.720> for<00:02:20.260> each<00:02:20.650> symbol<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.750> have

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
order for each symbol so that you have

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.680 
order for each symbol so that you have

the least amount of time in the fight

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.170

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.979 
because as the fight gets progressively
longer<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.739> have<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> more<00:02:30.730> chance<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.450> dying

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
longer you have a more chance of dying

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.170 
longer you have a more chance of dying
because<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.650> will<00:02:32.800> have<00:02:32.980> more<00:02:33.340> elite<00:02:33.700> spawn

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180
