00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
on my but it's it's actually airplane -

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.640 
on my but it's it's actually airplane -
it's<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.450> sequel<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.840> airplane<00:03:56.170> but<00:03:56.530> should

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
it's the sequel to airplane but should

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.620 
it's the sequel to airplane but should
it<00:03:56.769> like<00:03:56.890> very<00:03:57.130> much<00:03:57.280> but<00:03:57.579> still<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.480> thought

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
it like very much but still I thought

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.440 
it like very much but still I thought
I'd<00:03:58.780> given<00:03:58.930> them<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.200> try<00:03:59.500> mm-hmm<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.970> for<00:04:01.299> some

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
I'd given them a try mm-hmm and for some

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.729 
I'd given them a try mm-hmm and for some
reason<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:01.810> mentioned<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.470> a<00:04:02.500> tattoo

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
reason I mentioned that to a tattoo

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.530 
reason I mentioned that to a tattoo
artist<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.430> then<00:04:03.519> before<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:03.910> knew<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.269> was

artist and then before you knew it I was

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.870 
artist and then before you knew it I was
knocked<00:04:04.780> out<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.200> woke<00:04:05.440> up<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.860> had<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:06.010> movie
