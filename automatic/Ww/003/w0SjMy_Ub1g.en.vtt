00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
there was just nothing we just could

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209 
there was just nothing we just could
literally<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.290> no<00:01:55.500> ball<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> we

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
literally have no ball if that we

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.950 
literally have no ball if that we
shouldn't<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.640> into<00:01:56.820> their<00:01:57.030> 18<00:01:57.270> yard<00:01:57.509> box<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
shouldn't get into their 18 yard box and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560 
shouldn't get into their 18 yard box and
and<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.189> they<00:01:59.280> were<00:01:59.340> well<00:01:59.549> organized<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.210> em

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and and they were well organized and em

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
and and they were well organized and em
yeah<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.250> team<00:02:02.399> run<00:02:02.490> out<00:02:02.610> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
yeah that I think the team run out of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.219 
yeah that I think the team run out of
ideas<00:02:02.790> pretty<00:02:03.180> early<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.719> honest<00:02:03.899> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
ideas pretty early on to be honest I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.660 
ideas pretty early on to be honest I
mean<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> add<00:02:05.100> weight<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> their

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
mean it's going to add weight to their

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.100 
mean it's going to add weight to their
to<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.000> misery<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.420> surround<00:02:06.840> in

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
to the misery that surround in

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.779 
to the misery that surround in
Liverpool's<00:02:07.590> fan<00:02:07.770> base<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.190> moment<00:02:08.520> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
Liverpool's fan base of the moment it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.790 
Liverpool's fan base of the moment it
would<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.450> would<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.110> justifiable

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
would that be would it be justifiable

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.580 
would that be would it be justifiable
way<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> rub<00:02:11.280> against<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> manager<00:02:11.970> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
way to rub against the manager and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.530 
way to rub against the manager and
oh<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:14.040> think<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.550> think<00:02:14.760> anybody's<00:02:15.269> made<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
oh I think I think anybody's made the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.790 
oh I think I think anybody's made the
mind<00:02:15.720> up<00:02:15.810> about<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.080> manager<00:02:16.379> isn't<00:02:16.530> it's

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
mind up about the manager isn't it's

ultimately do you know do you still
believe<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.160> plan<00:02:53.780> yeah<00:02:54.780> but<00:02:55.049> that's<00:02:55.200> if

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
believe in the plan yeah but that's if

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.530 
believe in the plan yeah but that's if
there's<00:02:55.709> an<00:02:55.799> opportunity<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.489> pushes<00:02:57.120> further

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
there's an opportunity to pushes further

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.819 
there's an opportunity to pushes further
along<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.049> plan<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.379> would<00:02:58.560> take<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
along the plan I would take the

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.339 
along the plan I would take the
opportunity<00:02:59.310> what<00:02:59.610> would<00:02:59.760> that<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:01.110> obvious

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
opportunity what would that the obvious

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.050 
opportunity what would that the obvious
that<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.829> plan<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.370> believe<00:03:02.670> even<00:03:02.879> as<00:03:02.970> I

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
that the plan that I believe even as I

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.640 
that the plan that I believe even as I
believe<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.840> model<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.230> we've<00:03:04.379> got<00:03:04.530> on

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
believe that the model that we've got on

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.500 
believe that the model that we've got on
the<00:03:04.739> Left<00:03:04.920> SG<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.400> correct<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:06.000> believe<00:03:06.269> that

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
the Left SG is correct I believe that

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.030 
the Left SG is correct I believe that
the<00:03:06.690> moment<00:03:07.049> we've<00:03:07.140> got<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.319> manager<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.739> you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
the moment we've got a manager that you

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.069 
the moment we've got a manager that you
can<00:03:08.069> see<00:03:08.579> on<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.480> if<00:03:09.569> we<00:03:09.720> can<00:03:09.900> get

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
can see on that but if we can get

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.949 
can see on that but if we can get
