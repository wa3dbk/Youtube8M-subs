I have done and so maybe I pull up I
brought<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.330> broadcasting<00:03:01.900> career<00:03:02.110> maybe

brought on the broadcasting career maybe

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.980 
brought on the broadcasting career maybe
2<00:03:02.950> 1<00:03:03.460> or<00:03:03.610> 2<00:03:03.760> years<00:03:04.030> early<00:03:04.330> maybe<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.630> don't<00:03:04.720> know

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
2 1 or 2 years early maybe I don't know

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.600 
2 1 or 2 years early maybe I don't know
but<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.740> know<00:03:05.860> once<00:03:06.070> I<00:03:06.220> made<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.460> decision

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
but you know once I made that decision

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.190 
but you know once I made that decision
to<00:03:07.120> do<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:07.420> thought<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.630> know<00:03:07.780> it's<00:03:07.930> just<00:03:08.080> up

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
to do it I thought you know it's just up

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.900 
to do it I thought you know it's just up
to<00:03:08.230> me<00:03:08.350> now<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.770> try<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:08.950> balance<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.520> and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
to me now to try and balance it and

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.790 
to me now to try and balance it and
hopefully<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.840> doesn't<00:03:11.200> have<00:03:11.320> an<00:03:11.410> effect<00:03:11.650> on

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
hopefully it doesn't have an effect on

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.100 
hopefully it doesn't have an effect on
