00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.110
 You have my people and I want you guys a pretty cool program 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:08.580
 Imagine how I think and that is called the Fab Four was actually 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.700
 Lisicki I have her 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.579
 Maintal 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.460
 or was my current and up here too 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.050
 up to 17 degrees 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.970
 us a little sun 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.810
 It's pretty simple for us 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.480
 as a result of their first CD a and because only overripe removal is there and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.529
 Of course, using a simple CD is free 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.579
 and then he goes into the settings 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.140
 and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.420
 he then finds something further down so percent it goes all the way up if it's here 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.360
 for the whole in normal things and the peas and in between Wismar his 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.580
 small section 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.700
 Therefore probably more stuff from IZ for the Reds finds what kicker on it 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.770
 Preusser suitable 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.750
 and percentages then it has screamed adjustment options of course violence 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.180
 to adjust 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.390
 when I leave 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.450
 Percent yes 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.140
 Thanks Scholz that whole in the percent of the club position 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.910
 Percent yes would finally turn on then finally that too 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.570
 Weather should be updated so that it does it for longer 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.210
 Battery consumption the whole it is set to two hours who then 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.370
 we can also play the position over but also that caldera 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.510
 turn off 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.110
 The BayernLB gg just once before in the best applications 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.190
 Review the red on info 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.830
 Below you can enter here the cities interest rates in the far and your city 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.480
 what's the same with me is ordered degrees Celsius like a 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.660
 Percent now just leave again and go back while to al 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.020
 To enrich Nadir yet a few settings similar to Show Image and Yah 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.310
 pushed the CES 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.510
 be quiet from Altona 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.110
 At 1 APA that means when I'm here to the passenger that's actually them 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.740
 go I have this act is wear that sets you with it 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.549
 and below you can find it still shows it was showact with limited 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.580
 Started 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.409
 and that's easy 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.409
 for the status bar up here that you 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.140
 17 degrees Celsius 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.440
 ca and 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.700
 Accordingly, the little sun or whatever the weather is 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:13.629
 and what sets Henry Mueller's settings is down here 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.589
 at the bottom 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.399
 stands Temple ChÃ©ri Unit 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:22.409
 and death turn you off Fahrenheit Celsius what Fahrenheit you use in the US 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.019
 and even now with us, "not that she's 90 degrees or solo again 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.019
 From now on, only 30 are actually with us 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.279
 Celsius by the blows and that's the time Huber was actually when 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.279
 that's pretty cool personally and I'm that too 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.689
 looks cute and dr i think it's cool 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.839
 If I like it, of course, subscribe to a tree subscribe high 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.199
 Rate this and then when I get out of here
