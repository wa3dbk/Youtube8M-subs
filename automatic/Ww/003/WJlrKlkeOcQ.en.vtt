00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that has ant-man on it which is actually

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.710 
that has ant-man on it which is actually
really<00:01:49.350> cool<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.130> paint<00:01:50.399> work<00:01:50.579> isn't<00:01:51.360> perfect

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
really cool the paint work isn't perfect

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
really cool the paint work isn't perfect
but<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.020> tiny<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.040> think<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> really

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
but it's tiny so I think that's a really

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240 
but it's tiny so I think that's a really
cool<00:01:54.570> piece<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.470> glad<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.710> included

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
cool piece and I'm glad that included

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.100 
cool piece and I'm glad that included
that<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.490> he's<00:01:56.579> got<00:01:56.729> those<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:57.659> pretty<00:01:57.960> sure

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that so he's got those I'm pretty sure

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.450 
that so he's got those I'm pretty sure
there's<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> version<00:01:58.710> where<00:01:59.070> he<00:01:59.250> has<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
there's a version where he has a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
there's a version where he has a
different<00:01:59.909> bow<00:02:00.119> I'm<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.840> positive<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.469> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
he does have the quiver on his back it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.119 
he does have the quiver on his back it
has<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.390> bow<00:02:09.569> collapsed<00:02:10.530> already<00:02:10.830> on<00:02:11.009> his

back that doesn't come off

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.960

and since he has it right here it's kind

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.180 
and since he has it right here it's kind
of<00:02:15.120> silly<00:02:15.330> when<00:02:15.510> he's<00:02:15.750> holding<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.100> it

of silly when he's holding it to have it
on<00:02:17.250> his<00:02:17.370> back<00:02:17.550> as<00:02:17.760> well<00:02:17.960> these<00:02:18.960> arrows<00:02:19.410> stay<00:02:19.980> in

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190

on his back as well these arrows stay in
the<00:02:20.310> quiver<00:02:20.520> at<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:20.910> times<00:02:21.240> these<00:02:21.890> arrows<00:02:22.890> can

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the quiver at all times these arrows can

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.250 
the quiver at all times these arrows can
go<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> quiver<00:02:24.300> but<00:02:24.570> they<00:02:24.690> don't<00:02:24.840> all<00:02:25.020> fit

waist twist the biggest complaint with
this<00:04:09.390> guy<00:04:09.570> -<00:04:10.050> things<00:04:10.380> are<00:04:10.560> both<00:04:10.680> right<00:04:11.010> here

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
this guy - things are both right here

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.070 
this guy - things are both right here
one<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:12.060> purple<00:04:12.390> doesn't<00:04:12.750> match<00:04:12.870> the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
one is this purple doesn't match the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.210 
one is this purple doesn't match the
rest<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.410> purple<00:04:13.830> this<00:04:13.920> is<00:04:13.980> like<00:04:14.190> a

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
rest of the purple this is like a

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.880 
rest of the purple this is like a
brownish<00:04:14.730> color<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:15.270> could<00:04:16.260> be<00:04:16.380> wrong<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:16.620> I'm

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
brownish color I could be wrong but I'm

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.349 
brownish color I could be wrong but I'm
pretty<00:04:17.070> sure<00:04:17.130> it's<00:04:17.310> supposed<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.760> match<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.330> I

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
pretty sure it's supposed to match so I

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.099 
pretty sure it's supposed to match so I
don't<00:04:18.540> care<00:04:18.720> for<00:04:18.870> that

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
don't care for that

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.289

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
now you can kind of heat them up and fix

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.370 
now you can kind of heat them up and fix
them<00:04:25.590> but<00:04:25.710> they<00:04:25.860> end<00:04:26.040> up

the boot and at the bottom of the top of
the<00:04:56.260> boot<00:04:56.470> I<00:04:56.680> don't<00:04:56.890> know<00:04:57.010> why<00:04:57.160> they<00:04:57.340> did<00:04:57.490> a

the boot I don't know why they did a
double<00:04:57.940> it's<00:04:58.630> not<00:04:58.780> necessary

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
double it's not necessary

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.940 
bad and then the toe joint
so<00:05:06.880> overall<00:05:07.210> he's<00:05:07.480> done<00:05:07.660> really<00:05:07.870> well<00:05:08.110> full

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
so overall he's done really well full

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.220 
articulation everywhere the paint work
could<00:05:12.160> be<00:05:12.280> better<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.760> arms<00:05:13.540> in<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.840> face<00:05:14.050> and

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
could be better the arms in the face and

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.750 
could be better the arms in the face and
the<00:05:14.320> fingers<00:05:14.650> don't<00:05:14.860> all<00:05:14.980> line<00:05:15.220> up<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.460> then

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
the fingers don't all line up and then

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.370 
the fingers don't all line up and then
the<00:05:15.850> Purple's<00:05:16.210> don't<00:05:16.420> all<00:05:16.540> line<00:05:16.810> up<00:05:17.020> either

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
the Purple's don't all line up either

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.470 
the Purple's don't all line up either
but<00:05:18.070> overall<00:05:18.340> it's<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.670> really<00:05:18.700> nice<00:05:19.180> figure

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
but overall it's a really nice figure

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.150 
but overall it's a really nice figure
and<00:05:19.600> I<00:05:19.810> do<00:05:19.870> recommend<00:05:20.320> it<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.680> especially<00:05:20.950> you

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
and I do recommend it and especially you

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.680 
and I do recommend it and especially you
can<00:05:21.280> get<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.520> complete<00:05:21.910> with<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.240> glider<00:05:22.510> and

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
can get it complete with the glider and

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.350 
can get it complete with the glider and
everything<00:05:23.320> obviously<00:05:23.920> that's<00:05:24.520> definitely

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
everything obviously that's definitely

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.960 
everything obviously that's definitely
better<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:25.870> do<00:05:26.200> so<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:26.890> do<00:05:27.010> suggest<00:05:27.340> that<00:05:27.730> if<00:05:27.880> you

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
better to do so I do suggest that if you

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.810 
better to do so I do suggest that if you
can<00:05:28.150> get<00:05:28.330> it<00:05:29.100> sometimes<00:05:30.100> this<00:05:30.220> guy<00:05:30.340> goes<00:05:30.550> for<00:05:30.580> a

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
can get it sometimes this guy goes for a

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.430 
can get it sometimes this guy goes for a
lot<00:05:30.970> sometimes<00:05:31.300> he<00:05:31.660> doesn't<00:05:31.900> go<00:05:31.960> for<00:05:31.990> two<00:05:32.260> too

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
lot sometimes he doesn't go for two too

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.550
