00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
know as they have increased as you can

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.149 
know as they have increased as you can
see<00:01:17.430> by<00:01:17.670> about<00:01:18.119> 250<00:01:18.659> K<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.619> means<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.979> can

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
see by about 250 K it just means I can

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.469 
see by about 250 K it just means I can
make<00:01:20.280> slightly<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.790> profit<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> end<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
make slightly more profit at the end of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.240 
make slightly more profit at the end of
it<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.810> need<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.200> remember<00:01:22.350> 300k<00:01:23.070> for

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it so I just need to remember 300k for

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.999 
it so I just need to remember 300k for
the<00:01:23.310> end<00:01:23.490> obviously<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.450> compared<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> cost

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the end obviously so I compared the cost

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.350 
the end obviously so I compared the cost
of<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.250> from<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> profits<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.150> obviously

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
of it from the profits I can obviously

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.090 
of it from the profits I can obviously
see<00:01:27.600> how<00:01:27.840> much<00:01:27.960> profit<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.380> really<00:01:28.650> made<00:01:28.829> but

realize<00:02:27.370> you've<00:02:27.609> got<00:02:27.760> from<00:02:27.879> these<00:02:28.030> obviously

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
realize you've got from these obviously

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.059 
realize you've got from these obviously
that<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:29.019> get<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.409> I've<00:02:29.470> already<00:02:29.739> noted

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
that you can get and I've already noted

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.949 
that you can get and I've already noted
them<00:02:30.250> all<00:02:30.640> together<00:02:30.790> as<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.239> can<00:02:31.359> see<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.810> so

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
them all together as you can see just so

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.720 
them all together as you can see just so
they<00:02:32.349> add<00:02:32.500> up<00:02:32.530> over<00:02:32.769> each<00:02:33.040> run<00:02:33.280> as<00:02:33.430> opposed<00:02:33.670> to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
they add up over each run as opposed to

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.099 
they add up over each run as opposed to
taking<00:02:33.879> up<00:02:34.090> more<00:02:34.209> space<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.659> might<00:02:34.780> invent

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
taking up more space and might invent

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.569 
taking up more space and might invent
but<00:02:35.530> as<00:02:35.620> well<00:02:35.739> as<00:02:35.829> this<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.220> did<00:02:36.459> actually

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
but as well as this I did actually

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.399 
but as well as this I did actually
manage<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:37.090> get<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.450> couple<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.870> charms<00:02:38.200> as<00:02:38.319> you

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
manage to get a couple of charms as you

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.920 
manage to get a couple of charms as you
can<00:02:38.530> see<00:02:38.680> 18<00:02:39.189> gold<00:02:39.459> 30<00:02:39.819> Crimson's<00:02:40.359> and<00:02:40.569> seven

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
can see 18 gold 30 Crimson's and seven

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.410 
can see 18 gold 30 Crimson's and seven
green<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.409> far<00:02:41.620> isn't<00:02:42.040> too<00:02:42.310> bad<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:42.760> also<00:02:43.299> the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
green so far isn't too bad and also the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.420 
green so far isn't too bad and also the
amount<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:43.720> XP<00:02:44.049> since<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.739> last<00:02:44.859> clip<00:02:45.159> it's<00:02:45.340> an

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
amount of XP since the last clip it's an

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.789 
amount of XP since the last clip it's an
extra<00:02:45.639> 20k<00:02:46.150> up<00:02:46.299> so<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:47.019> pretty<00:02:47.290> slow<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.769> a

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
extra 20k up so it's pretty slow it's a

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:48.809 
extra 20k up so it's pretty slow it's a
lot<00:02:47.920> slower<00:02:48.099> than<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.310> thought<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.639> would<00:02:48.730> be

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
lot slower than I thought it would be

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.240 
lot slower than I thought it would be
because<00:02:49.120> they're<00:02:49.540> like<00:02:49.659> 879<00:02:50.560> per<00:02:50.739> one<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
because they're like 879 per one so I

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.800 
because they're like 879 per one so I
thought<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.639> be<00:02:51.730> pretty<00:02:51.909> fast<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:52.450> you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
thought it to be pretty fast but you

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.479 
thought it to be pretty fast but you
know<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.079> beautiful<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.500> bonus<00:02:53.769> xp<00:02:54.099> now<00:02:54.280> it's

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
know so beautiful the bonus xp now it's

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.039 
know so beautiful the bonus xp now it's
twice<00:02:54.790> as<00:02:54.940> long<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.450> don't<00:02:55.659> know<00:02:55.870> maybe

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
twice as long and I don't know maybe

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.390 
twice as long and I don't know maybe
it's<00:02:56.230> cuz<00:02:56.349> their<00:02:56.500> life<00:02:56.650> points<00:02:56.980> takes<00:02:57.159> a<00:02:57.250> bit

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
it's cuz their life points takes a bit

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.240 
it's cuz their life points takes a bit
longer<00:02:57.609> but<00:02:57.939> 555<00:02:58.930> K<00:02:59.139> so<00:02:59.349> far<00:02:59.530> isn't<00:02:59.769> too<00:03:00.069> bad<00:03:00.220> I

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
longer but 555 K so far isn't too bad I

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.649 
longer but 555 K so far isn't too bad I
don't<00:03:00.459> think<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.180> yeah<00:03:01.299> I'm<00:03:01.389> going<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.569> get

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
don't think so yeah I'm going to get

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.879 
don't think so yeah I'm going to get
back<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.870> doing<00:03:01.989> earth<00:03:02.139> once<00:03:02.349> now<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.769> I'll

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
back to doing earth once now and I'll

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.800 
back to doing earth once now and I'll
see<00:03:03.129> you<00:03:03.220> guys<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.609> a<00:03:03.670> bit<00:03:03.879> so<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.480> forgot<00:03:04.659> to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
see you guys in a bit so I forgot to

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.119 
see you guys in a bit so I forgot to
mention<00:03:04.900> before<00:03:05.349> but<00:03:05.530> I'm<00:03:05.590> actually<00:03:05.739> using

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
mention before but I'm actually using

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.160 
mention before but I'm actually using
the<00:03:06.220> new<00:03:06.250> revolution<00:03:06.970> combat<00:03:07.299> setup<00:03:07.599> so<00:03:07.900> you

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
the new revolution combat setup so you

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.030 
the new revolution combat setup so you
know<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.409> thought<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.620> keep<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.799> a<00:03:08.859> test

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
know I just thought to keep it a test

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.009 
know I just thought to keep it a test
out<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.459> that's<00:03:09.909> what<00:03:10.060> my<00:03:10.150> abilities<00:03:10.540> are<00:03:10.569> in

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
out and that's what my abilities are in

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.599 
out and that's what my abilities are in
the<00:03:11.109> yellow<00:03:11.349> line<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.859> are<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> bit<00:03:12.250> different

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
the yellow line and are a bit different

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.460 
the yellow line and are a bit different
to<00:03:12.760> how<00:03:12.909> they<00:03:13.030> used<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.389> be<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.930> far<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:14.319> does

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
to how they used to be so far it does

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.050 
to how they used to be so far it does
seem<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.680> be<00:03:14.769> pretty<00:03:15.069> decent<00:03:15.190> setup<00:03:15.760> I've

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
seem to be pretty decent setup I've

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.970 
seem to be pretty decent setup I've
customized<00:03:16.629> a<00:03:16.750> little<00:03:17.079> bit<00:03:17.169> by<00:03:17.379> replacing<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
customized a little bit by replacing the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.920 
customized a little bit by replacing the
zero<00:03:18.280> hotkey<00:03:18.730> with<00:03:18.879> my<00:03:19.030> protection<00:03:19.389> to<00:03:19.599> magic

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
zero hotkey with my protection to magic

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.390 
zero hotkey with my protection to magic
just<00:03:20.169> because<00:03:20.440> that's<00:03:20.889> where<00:03:21.069> I'm<00:03:21.129> used<00:03:21.340> to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
just because that's where I'm used to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.890 
just because that's where I'm used to
having<00:03:21.519> on<00:03:21.699> my<00:03:21.819> own<00:03:21.940> set<00:03:22.150> off<00:03:22.239> my<00:03:22.359> customized

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
having on my own set off my customized

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.270 
having on my own set off my customized
one<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.560> thought<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.859> just<00:03:23.949> makes<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.250> lot

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
one so I thought it just makes a lot

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.309 
one so I thought it just makes a lot
easier<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.090> know<00:03:25.389> it<00:03:25.510> just<00:03:25.930> means<00:03:26.139> that

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
easier and you know it just means that

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.780 
easier and you know it just means that
when<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.739> press<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.069> issues<00:03:27.310> right<00:03:27.489> there<00:03:27.639> it's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
when I press the issues right there it's

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.740 
when I press the issues right there it's
just<00:03:27.909> it's<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.239> lot<00:03:28.359> easier<00:03:28.629> than<00:03:28.690> having

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
just it's just a lot easier than having

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.180 
just it's just a lot easier than having
to<00:03:28.989> flick<00:03:29.139> it<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.290> think<00:03:29.530> but<00:03:29.949> the<00:03:30.010> automatic

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
to flick it I think but the automatic

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.979 
to flick it I think but the automatic
said<00:03:30.579> that<00:03:30.669> they<00:03:30.760> give<00:03:30.909> you<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.269> actually<00:03:31.599> you

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
said that they give you is actually you

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.270 
said that they give you is actually you
know<00:03:32.109> it's<00:03:32.379> pretty<00:03:32.530> good<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:32.859> works<00:03:33.040> from

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
know it's pretty good it works from

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.830 
know it's pretty good it works from
these<00:03:33.400> smaller<00:03:33.669> abilities<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.419> the<00:03:34.449> ones<00:03:34.659> that

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
these smaller abilities to the ones that

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.390 
these smaller abilities to the ones that
require<00:03:34.959> more<00:03:35.409> adrenaline<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.069> actually

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
require more adrenaline and actually

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.500 
require more adrenaline and actually
think<00:03:36.579> it's<00:03:36.699> pretty<00:03:36.909> useful<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.329> works

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
think it's pretty useful and it works

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.330 
think it's pretty useful and it works
really<00:03:37.690> nicely<00:03:37.930> goes<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.739> order<00:03:39.220> that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
really nicely goes to the order that

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.890 
really nicely goes to the order that
works<00:03:39.549> quite<00:03:39.849> thoroughly<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.629> get<00:03:40.810> your

from my bank into my invent and this is

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.720 
from my bank into my invent and this is
pretty<00:04:26.380> much<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> overall<00:04:26.800> value<00:04:27.370> from<00:04:27.580> why

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
pretty much the overall value from why

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.240 
pretty much the overall value from why
it<00:04:27.820> got<00:04:28.030> from<00:04:28.240> 250<00:04:29.110> so<00:04:29.560> if<00:04:29.620> we<00:04:29.710> go<00:04:29.800> back<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:30.010> how

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
it got from 250 so if we go back to how

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.860 
it got from 250 so if we go back to how
much<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.550> cost<00:04:30.790> me<00:04:31.030> like<00:04:31.420> I<00:04:31.450> mentioned<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
much it cost me like I mentioned the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.840 
much it cost me like I mentioned the
beginning<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.290> video<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.800> was<00:04:32.980> 300k<00:04:33.820> I

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
beginning of the video it was 300k I

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.570 
beginning of the video it was 300k I
think<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.150> was<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.270> 500<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.140> 150<00:04:36.010> K<00:04:36.130> it<00:04:36.190> cost<00:04:36.430> me

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
think it was a 500 so 150 K it cost me

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.000 
think it was a 500 so 150 K it cost me
for<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.820> episode<00:04:37.210> for<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:37.510> 250<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.530> from

for the episode for the 250 and from
that<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.190> can<00:04:39.400> see<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:39.640> I've<00:04:39.700> got<00:04:39.820> over<00:04:39.850> 1.3

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
that you can see that I've got over 1.3

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.080 
that you can see that I've got over 1.3
mil<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.050> return<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:41.590> also<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:42.160> few<00:04:42.580> more<00:04:42.730> charms

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
mil in return and also a few more charms

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.580 
mil in return and also a few more charms
and<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.300> saw<00:04:43.510> in<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.750> last<00:04:43.990> clip<00:04:44.320> I<00:04:44.470> showed

and you saw in the last clip I showed

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.410 
and you saw in the last clip I showed
you<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.070> loop<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:45.700> pretty<00:04:45.970> much<00:04:46.120> just<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:46.360> a

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
you the loop so pretty much just like a

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.960 
you the loop so pretty much just like a
1.1<00:04:47.080> or<00:04:47.290> 1.2<00:04:47.950> mil<00:04:48.130> profit<00:04:48.460> from<00:04:48.550> these<00:04:48.730> you

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
1.1 or 1.2 mil profit from these you

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.460 
1.1 or 1.2 mil profit from these you
know<00:04:49.060> if<00:04:49.210> I<00:04:49.300> did<00:04:49.450> carry<00:04:49.690> out<00:04:49.870> for<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.260> whole

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
know if I did carry out for the whole

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.530 
know if I did carry out for the whole
500<00:04:50.710> it<00:04:51.100> essentially<00:04:51.670> be<00:04:51.760> double<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.210> so

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
500 it essentially be double that so

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.810 
500 it essentially be double that so
we're<00:04:52.630> looking<00:04:52.840> at<00:04:52.930> around<00:04:53.140> 2.2<00:04:53.560> 2.4<00:04:54.160> millet

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
we're looking at around 2.2 2.4 millet

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.220 
we're looking at around 2.2 2.4 millet
from<00:04:55.150> these<00:04:55.330> just<00:04:55.600> actually<00:04:55.840> pretty<00:04:56.110> decent

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
from these just actually pretty decent

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.020 
from these just actually pretty decent
and<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:57.130> know<00:04:57.250> pretty<00:04:57.430> much<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.640> same<00:04:57.880> as

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
and you know pretty much the same as

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.460 
and you know pretty much the same as
we've<00:04:58.150> got<00:04:58.270> for<00:04:58.360> last<00:04:58.540> episode<00:04:58.900> when<00:04:59.260> I<00:04:59.290> get

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
we've got for last episode when I get

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.750 
we've got for last episode when I get
the<00:04:59.590> extra<00:04:59.800> loop<00:04:59.980> if<00:05:00.130> we're<00:05:00.280> going<00:05:00.400> on<00:05:00.640> the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
the extra loop if we're going on the

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.430 
the extra loop if we're going on the
double<00:05:01.060> factor<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.510> tab<00:05:01.720> will<00:05:01.870> be<00:05:01.990> roughly

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
double factor the tab will be roughly

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.020 
double factor the tab will be roughly
worth<00:05:02.650> about<00:05:02.830> 5<00:05:03.040> mil<00:05:03.280> so<00:05:03.430> fast<00:05:03.640> it's<00:05:03.850> pretty

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
worth about 5 mil so fast it's pretty

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.420 
worth about 5 mil so fast it's pretty
decent<00:05:04.360> not<00:05:04.720> too<00:05:04.870> bad<00:05:05.020> -<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:05.260> of<00:05:05.740> course<00:05:05.770> leave

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
decent not too bad - and of course leave
