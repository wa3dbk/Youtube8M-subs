00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.900
 The makers' character has a face 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.180
 caught that already so gentlemen you know 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.580
 if you ever wish to wish good that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.439
 are you to have an original doll of your 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.330
 mike character who had an animal 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.770

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.780
 nothing 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.649
 and we have to wait when taken out of 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.689
 these doors that are coming is ok and 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.179
 people even embocar said no me 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.399
 it seems very good to take this 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.649
 minecraft toys because we know the 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.009
 love that people have to michaels and 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.579
 why not take toys my opinion 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.069
 Minecraft personnel will gradually be 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.869
 a color I say it from now on today 22 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.579
 April is going to be like a call of duty or 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.549
 as a division the only difference 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.299
 between activision and the people so 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.190
 wet and the rest is that people get wet 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.670
 it puts you like something 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.080
 it's like selling drugs or call of duty 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.240
 of activision sells you drugs already 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.100
 directly like this already for adults and 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.770
 let's say that the people of mogente sells it 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.450
 as something for children not for making it a 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.580
 little bit, I do not know, I say 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.170
 agreement and I know very well if it continues like this 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.690
 minecraft that is very good toys 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.050
 come exploding everything will be like 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.210
 activision remember a hug people and 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.810
 we'll see each other until the next 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:22.470

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.540
