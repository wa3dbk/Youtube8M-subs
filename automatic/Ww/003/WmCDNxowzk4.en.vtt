so instead of going for something
shimmery<00:01:33.659> though<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.140> had<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.439> something

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
shimmery though I had to do something

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
looks natural but you're not shining

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.550 
looks natural but you're not shining
it's<00:01:39.570> also<00:01:39.720> nice<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.259> lot<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.439> people

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
it's also nice because a lot of people

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.899 
it's also nice because a lot of people
don't<00:01:40.890> realize<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.610> use<00:01:41.790> your

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
don't realize that you can use your

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.999 
don't realize that you can use your
cream<00:01:42.240> blushes<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.380> lip<00:01:43.530> balm<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
cream blushes as a little lip balm and a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
cream blushes as a little lip balm and a
pinch<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.399> which<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.970> very<00:01:45.180> nice<00:01:45.450> I've<00:01:45.930> use

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
pinch to which is very nice I've use

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.660 
pinch to which is very nice I've use
cream<00:01:46.350> blushes<00:01:46.560> an<00:01:46.770> eyeshadow<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.460> well<00:01:47.640> I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
cream blushes an eyeshadow as well I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.160 
cream blushes an eyeshadow as well I
think<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.119> very<00:01:48.149> versatile<00:01:48.689> product<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
think it's very versatile product that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170 
think it's very versatile product that
you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:49.710> over<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.130> face<00:01:50.310> great<00:01:50.880> so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
you can use all over your face great so

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.660 
you can use all over your face great so
what<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.840> opening<00:01:52.170> well<00:01:52.860> next<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
what what are we opening well next I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
what what are we opening well next I
think<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> summertime<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
think in the summertime we are going to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.410 
think in the summertime we are going to
get<00:01:55.680> shiny<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.430> are<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.610> get<00:01:56.700> sweaty<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.299> we

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
get shiny we are gonna get sweaty so we

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.780 
get shiny we are gonna get sweaty so we
tend<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> go<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.960> lot<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.560> powder<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.759> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
tend to go for a lot of powder but I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.880 
tend to go for a lot of powder but I
think<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.240> better<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.680> skip<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
think it's actually better to skip a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.399 
think it's actually better to skip a
compact<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.610> bag<00:02:02.759> instead<00:02:03.630> maybe<00:02:04.170> care

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
compact in your bag instead maybe care

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.469 
compact in your bag instead maybe care
of<00:02:04.500> some<00:02:04.619> blotting<00:02:05.040> papers<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:06.240> soak

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
of some blotting papers to really soak

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.940 
of some blotting papers to really soak
up<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> oil<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.079> your<00:02:07.229> face<00:02:07.500> throughout<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.780 
forehead on your nose on your chin and
that's<00:02:27.160> enough<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.370> really<00:02:27.550> get<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.730> me

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
that's enough to really get to me

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.100

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
something like a lip stain to really

retouching<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.570> just<00:02:52.690> gives<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.870> light

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
retouching and it just gives a light

retouching and it just gives a light
hint<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.440> color<00:02:53.650> that's<00:02:54.250> great<00:02:54.610> that's<00:02:54.790> great
