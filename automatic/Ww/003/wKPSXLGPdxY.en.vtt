cylinders are built up of modules and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.570 
cylinders are built up of modules and
you<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.260> cylinder<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.100> both<00:01:11.280> sides

you will have a cylinder on both sides
in<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.909> particular<00:01:12.240> case<00:01:12.570> we've<00:01:12.780> got<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
in this particular case we've got a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590 
in this particular case we've got a
ascending<00:01:13.830> turn<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.150> actually<00:01:15.299> alter

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
ascending turn and we can actually alter

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.200 
ascending turn and we can actually alter
the<00:01:16.049> different<00:01:16.409> sizes<00:01:16.619> by<00:01:17.040> changing<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:18.119> we

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the different sizes by changing what we

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
the different sizes by changing what we
call<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.600> bar<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> sits<00:01:19.320> underneath<00:01:19.619> here

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
call this bar that sits underneath here

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
call this bar that sits underneath here
and<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.759> I've<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.030> few<00:01:21.270> examples<00:01:21.299> on

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and you know I've got a few examples on

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.679 
and you know I've got a few examples on
front<00:01:22.290> an<00:01:22.350> example<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.979> bar<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> 60

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
front an example this bar here is a 60

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.499 
front an example this bar here is a 60
by<00:01:24.869> 60<00:01:25.070> cylinder<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> quite

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
by 60 cylinder so we can go up to quite

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.569 
by 60 cylinder so we can go up to quite
big<00:01:27.750> lens<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> offsets<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.340> 5

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
big lens and the offsets of 5

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
big lens and the offsets of 5
millimetres<00:01:30.150> either<00:01:30.329> side<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.439> build<00:01:31.680> up

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
millimetres either side as you build up

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.870 
millimetres either side as you build up
to<00:01:32.100> what's<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> shelf<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.689> 60<00:01:34.229> by<00:01:34.380> 16<00:01:34.890> we

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
to what's on the shelf of 60 by 16 we

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
to what's on the shelf of 60 by 16 we
can<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.210> master<00:01:36.960> key<00:01:37.140> these<00:01:37.320> cylinders<00:01:37.860> for

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
can also master key these cylinders for

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
can also master key these cylinders for
you<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.369> well<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.180> wanted<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.750> part

core there's a steel core on the modular
system<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.239> also<00:02:54.450> resists<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.319> tap<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
system it also resists the tap the

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.620 
system it also resists the tap the
attack<00:02:56.099> of<00:02:56.310> snapping<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.849> cylinder<00:02:57.269> as<00:02:57.420> well

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
attack of snapping the cylinder as well
