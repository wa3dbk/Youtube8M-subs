00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you're fit which has obviously been a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
you're fit which has obviously been a
bit<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.039> an<00:00:56.100> issue<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.059> past<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> can
