 let's move them to a container and 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.420

 oh, how rich 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.530
 and I'm thinking right now for our 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.990
 friends that suddenly out there have the 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.350
 natural salmon freezer but they do not have 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.410
 can can steam or can 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.660
 cook poached a piece of salmon and 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.880
 approximately 350 grams so 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.280
 that reduces and crumble it with a little bit 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.630
 of flavor and can use it as is 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.290
 as you indicate us as if it were 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.930
 can not correct if they have fame in their 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.910
 home can be steam better or 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.310
 roasted would also be left with another 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.190
 I also can touch cooked 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.890
 it's even cooked with the ones with the 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.419
 vegetables in mist and look 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.430
 they make the recipe that is 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.380
 giving today elegant as for 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.080
 a little ticket would be perfect a first 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.360
 very versatile dish because if you do not have 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.650
 shrimp maybe you can call it 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.940
 of ax you can put some other 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.550
 thing you do not want octopus to you is that 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.500

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.760
