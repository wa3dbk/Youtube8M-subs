00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.780 
no needles plano the surprising thing
about<00:02:13.989> Lumineers<00:02:14.800> was<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.280> after<00:02:15.430> i<00:02:15.580> had

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
about Lumineers was that after i had

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.060 
about Lumineers was that after i had
been<00:02:15.970> placed<00:02:16.209> my<00:02:16.600> sensitivity<00:02:17.230> actually<00:02:17.890> went

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
been placed my sensitivity actually went

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.610 
been placed my sensitivity actually went
away<00:02:18.360> because<00:02:19.360> i<00:02:19.750> guess<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.380> porcelain

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
away because i guess that the porcelain

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.229 
away because i guess that the porcelain
really<00:02:21.100> covered<00:02:21.430> up<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.610> parts<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.940> my<00:02:22.060> teeth

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
really covered up the parts of my teeth

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.240 
really covered up the parts of my teeth
that<00:02:22.390> were<00:02:22.540> sensitive<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.260> i<00:02:23.500> feel<00:02:23.950> even

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
that were sensitive so i feel even

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.400 
that were sensitive so i feel even
better<00:02:24.400> than<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:24.880> did<00:02:25.090> before<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:25.450> had<00:02:25.630> before

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
better than I did before I had before

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.050
