00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.450
 I 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.130
 good evening welcome rock children 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.690
 and roll surely if you have gone 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.610
 acquire a new mobile you will have seen 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.870
 Between are many features that 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.480
 has nfc 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.280
 which is the nfc the one known as a jet 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.470
 field comunication is a technology of 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.239
 wireless communication that short 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.610
 reach and with high frequency allows 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.699
 exchange data and files between 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.530
 mobile devices 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.329
 if you pass your smartphone with lfc near 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.739
 a work of art in a museum in the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.750
 exhibitor from a store or directly 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.390
 with a friend's phone what 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.070
 you will get is to transfer your files or 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.680
 your content thanks to technology 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.750
 near field or containers of this 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.910
 way you can identify yourself making your 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.350
 payments or as we have already said exchange 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.520
 your files quickly and easily 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.399
 simply with a gesture there are two 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.800
 nfc modes the nfc active mode and the 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.570
 passively in active mode both 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.550
 devices are equipped with sources 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.660
 of energy so both of you are capable 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.520
 to generate its own field 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.840
 electromagnetic and use it for 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.060
 exchange information with others 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.159
 dispositives 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.600
 in passive mode one of the two 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.090
 devices does not have a source 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.649
 own energy and therefore needs that 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.539
 the second device generates the field 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.430
 electromagnetic in which by the 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.880
 modulation of the load are exchanged 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.409
 the archives a decade ago was nokia 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.670
 who started the pilot queues with the 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.929
 nfc connectivity 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.110
 in fact integrated into any of its 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.789
 32 models 32 and 51 40 later others 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.770
 manufacturers followed the example of 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.970
 Finnish brand but without too much 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.250
 enthusiasm years after a period 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.600
 of standardization of the nfc protocol is 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.700
 carried out the first tests of 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.319
 mobile payments with this technology one of 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.330
 the most known projects or more 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.370
 remembered occurred in sitges the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.560
 touristic Catalan town where 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.250
 More than 1500 users participated and 500 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.650
 local businesses 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.720
 nowadays the nfc has two clear 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.670
 divisions of practical application a 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.740
 would be the mobile payment applications 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.570
 with which we can pay anything 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.210
 through smartphones simply 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.890
 approaching it to a receiving device the 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.480
 second application would be the control of 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.040
 devices through the smartphone and 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.140
 be domotic either for example 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.690
 headphones speakers printers 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.070
 etc 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.780
 an example of this last would be the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.340
 nfc tags that by a 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.470
 application can be programmed so that 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.430
 when you zoom in on your smartphone keep a 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.430
 custom configuration
