00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:09.620
 and watching there we go 3 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.820
 [Music] 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.790
 hi girls, how are we? 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.520
 we are in a new video as you see today 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.440
 I have a slight change of color in my 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.600
 foot was on vacation the weekend 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.070
 with families already know and that of the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.650
 people who have the most sensitive skin 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.920
 of the world put me sunscreen put me 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.500
 everything is super difficult that I do not burn 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.350
 As you can see right now I am very red and always 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.960
 what I burn is my nose and here the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.210
 cheeks and a little part of the world is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.520
 it burns a lot a few years ago that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.620
 I went on vacation acapulco roseo rible 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.600
 all the first of the day in the internal and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 the whole shoulders and I could not walk from 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.500
 true that it looked like like a spider 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.149
 because I could not walk from here when 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.609
 I said I was even a video 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.350
 how to heal active ardor and what to me 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.910
 it helped me a lot remember that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.340
 as long as we take care of our skin with 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.870
 sunscreen either on the basis of 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.090
 makeup with sunscreen or 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.670
 only the normal cream always 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.200
 100 sunscreens are very expensive 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.700
 but the truth is that they are worth it 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.070
 that if we do not take care of her she can give us 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.720
 skin cancer and that's very bad so 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.360
 Always remember to protect your 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.740
 of the sun either in daily life that you 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.600
 put a little before your base of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.090
 makeup or when you go to the beach 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.340
 obviously protect yourself pencil I found some 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.860
 remedies that are good to remove 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.330
 the burning because you'll see that holding them 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.730

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.070

 time it works a lot when I

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.170
 It worked super well in that really 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.000

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.049
 puts only in the affected areas a little 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.870
 in the skin and it's going to take away all the 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.269
 ardor that has this background that you will see 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.940
 that also works a lot is the gel 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.239
 of aloe vera that brad that that's so 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.940
 relaxing so cool that you feel like 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.430

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.049
 quick the aloe vera is super good 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.459
 because it helps you to remove the burning 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.280
 refreshing that that's the most important thing 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.760
 another thing that is also good for 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.890
 remove the burning is the natural yogurt the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.750
 delicious natural yogurt that tastes 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.670
 terrific that's also very good 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.620
 you have to go back to the refrigerator and be 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.870
 very cold and what you have to do is 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.269
 get all the skin on everything 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.209
 it burns you and it's going to take you out a lot 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.129
 When it gets hot, you take it back 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.650
 with a damp towel and go back to 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.420
 apply more cold yogurt so that you 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.299
 come back to cool you off in the block 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.400
 follow is the magnificent coconut oil that 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.680
 everyone loves it, it serves for many 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.000
 things and also serves for burning 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.090
 what you have to do obviously 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.950
 just collect it and leave it there until 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.900
 this covers you or the olive oil 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.290
 you can use to get your car 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.349
 chaffing or meat that amazon like that 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.810
 that this is very good last but not 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.849
 less important are the potatoes we are going to 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.129
 make slices of potatoes so you have to 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.200
 get to the freezer for a few 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.329
 minutes by ten and when I'm super 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.200
 you have to put it on top of your 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.090
 skin 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.340
 all the slices then put in the nose 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.989
 everywhere and it really helps you 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.829
 very much this also serves for the 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.900
 dark circles but to alleviate this really 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.909
 that work a lot so this is 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.769
 very good with important you have 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.680
 what to remember is that you do not have to put 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.389
 ice bags where it burns you I do not know 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.159
 everything that is ice do not put it 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.469
 because the ice what the ice does is 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.659
 burn the ice then burn if what 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.220
 put on where obviously later 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.139
 you will see a lot more to the best 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.519
 to feel the moment cool but 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.259
 you'll see that the ice is not good so 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.389
 I do not expect you liked it very much 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.070
 this video as you see are things that 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.320
 we have super easy home that we 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.580
 can help relieve our skin and 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.250
 feel more like 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.990
