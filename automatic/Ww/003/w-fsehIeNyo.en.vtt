parkour<00:00:57.590> is<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.340> most<00:00:58.550> efficient<00:00:58.940> way<00:00:58.970> of

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
parkour is the most efficient way of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.990 
parkour is the most efficient way of
getting<00:00:59.570> from<00:00:59.899> A<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.110> B<00:01:00.640> phrase<00:01:01.640> which<00:01:01.850> is

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
getting from A to B phrase which is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.899 
getting from A to B phrase which is
being<00:01:02.180> used<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:02.540> lot<00:01:02.570> is<00:01:02.870> that<00:01:03.670> it's<00:01:04.670> a

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
being used a lot is that it's a

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.120 
being used a lot is that it's a
practical<00:01:05.420> sport<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.020> it's<00:01:06.650> sort<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:06.950> like<00:01:07.070> a

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
practical sport and it's sort of like a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.550 
practical sport and it's sort of like a
reverse<00:01:07.280> martial<00:01:08.030> arts<00:01:08.360> in<00:01:08.540> which<00:01:09.170> instead<00:01:09.440> of

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
reverse martial arts in which instead of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.020 
reverse martial arts in which instead of
saying<00:01:09.800> to<00:01:09.979> bite<00:01:10.160> your<00:01:10.340> learning<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.759> run<00:01:10.910> away

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
saying to bite your learning to run away

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.560 
saying to bite your learning to run away
with<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.570> certain<00:01:11.930> deal<00:01:12.080> with<00:01:12.200> finesse

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
with a certain deal with finesse

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.390 
with a certain deal with finesse
basically<00:01:14.570> how<00:01:14.810> we<00:01:14.869> train<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:15.830> use<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
basically how we train is we use the

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.609 
basically how we train is we use the
environment<00:01:17.360> around<00:01:17.479> us<00:01:17.840> whatever<00:01:18.140> we<00:01:18.380> find

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
environment around us whatever we find

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.450 
environment around us whatever we find
to<00:01:19.580> determine<00:01:20.500> graceful<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:21.680> efficient<00:01:22.130> ways

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
to determine graceful and efficient ways

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.900 
to determine graceful and efficient ways
to<00:01:22.940> overcome<00:01:23.600> obstacles<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.729> really<00:01:25.729> take

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
to overcome obstacles and really take

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:37.289 
to overcome obstacles and really take
every<00:01:26.149> obstacle<00:01:26.360> ass

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.260 

we<00:01:38.299> train<00:01:38.659> for<00:01:38.899> emergency<00:01:39.469> situations<00:01:40.270> you

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
we train for emergency situations you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.240 
we train for emergency situations you
can<00:01:41.299> also<00:01:41.539> use<00:01:41.689> it<00:01:42.020> in<00:01:42.289> practical<00:01:43.070> situations

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
can also use it in practical situations

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.840 
can also use it in practical situations
in<00:01:43.909> which<00:01:43.969> it's<00:01:44.450> not<00:01:44.509> an<00:01:44.840> emergency<00:01:45.280> but<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:46.640> do

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
in which it's not an emergency but we do

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.940 
in which it's not an emergency but we do
trained<00:01:47.630> specifically<00:01:48.140> for<00:01:48.439> emergency

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
trained specifically for emergency

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.600 
trained specifically for emergency
situations<00:01:49.270> for<00:01:50.270> example<00:01:50.590> if<00:01:51.590> you're<00:01:52.490> being

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
situations for example if you're being

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.910 
situations for example if you're being
attacked<00:01:52.789> by<00:01:53.179> someone<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.500> want<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.799> run

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
attacked by someone and you want to run

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.950 
attacked by someone and you want to run
away<00:01:55.039> that's<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.119> sort<00:01:56.329> of<00:01:56.390> stuff<00:01:56.569> we<00:01:56.750> train

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
away that's the sort of stuff we train

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.200 
away that's the sort of stuff we train
for<00:01:57.170> although<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:58.220> have<00:01:58.399> been<00:01:58.579> known<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.880> use<00:01:59.060> it

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
for although I have been known to use it

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.389 
for although I have been known to use it
if<00:01:59.299> I'm<00:01:59.420> late<00:01:59.569> for<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.869> university<00:02:00.170> classes<00:02:03.399> in

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
if I'm late for a university classes in

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.510 
if I'm late for a university classes in
bigger<00:02:04.729> arm<00:02:04.969> jobs<00:02:05.270> your<00:02:05.659> feet<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:07.399> we

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
bigger arm jobs your feet and we

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.850 
bigger arm jobs your feet and we
couldn't<00:02:07.700> find<00:02:07.969> anyone<00:02:08.299> in<00:02:08.360> perfect<00:02:08.869> because

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
couldn't find anyone in perfect because

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.350 
couldn't find anyone in perfect because
at<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.069> stage<00:02:10.369> Parker<00:02:10.789> was<00:02:10.940> really<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.239> its

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
at that stage Parker was really in its

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.690 
at that stage Parker was really in its
infancy<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:12.170> Australia<00:02:12.620> especially<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.519> Perth

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
infancy in Australia especially in Perth

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.339 
infancy in Australia especially in Perth
being<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.299> isolated<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:15.019> things<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.290> that

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
being so isolated and things like that

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.680 
being so isolated and things like that
so<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:16.069> pretty<00:02:16.190> much<00:02:16.310> relied<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:16.790> people<00:02:17.569> over

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
so we pretty much relied on people over

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.509 
so we pretty much relied on people over
East<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.620> lot<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:18.829> people<00:02:19.040> overseas

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
East and a lot of people overseas

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.110 
East and a lot of people overseas
getting<00:02:20.390> material<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:21.019> videos<00:02:21.380> photos

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
getting material like videos photos

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.160 
getting material like videos photos
tutorials<00:02:23.120> as<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.360> how<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.810> techniques

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
tutorials as to how to do the techniques

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.050 
tutorials as to how to do the techniques
and<00:02:24.349> things<00:02:24.410> like<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.700> us<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.940> was<00:02:25.970> a

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
and things like that so for us it was a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.509 
and things like that so for us it was a
really<00:02:26.329> steep<00:02:26.569> learning<00:02:26.750> curve<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.459> then<00:02:28.459> we

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
really steep learning curve but then we

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.949 
really steep learning curve but then we
had<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.670> few<00:02:28.880> guys<00:02:29.000> come<00:02:29.269> over<00:02:29.299> from<00:02:29.569> overseas

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
had a few guys come over from overseas

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.539 
had a few guys come over from overseas
to<00:02:30.140> live<00:02:30.290> over<00:02:30.500> here<00:02:30.530> who<00:02:30.890> are<00:02:31.010> experienced

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
to live over here who are experienced

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.640 
to live over here who are experienced
and<00:02:31.730> they<00:02:32.569> taught<00:02:32.780> us<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.959> few<00:02:33.110> things<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.590> then

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
and they taught us a few things and then

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.930 
and they taught us a few things and then
from<00:02:34.010> there<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.280> just<00:02:34.310> kind<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.700> blossomed

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
from there it just kind of blossomed

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.170 
from there it just kind of blossomed
into<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.450> communities<00:02:35.900> today<00:02:40.000> it's<00:02:41.000> really

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
into the communities today it's really

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.509 
into the communities today it's really
good<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.420> see<00:02:41.510> now<00:02:41.900> as<00:02:42.230> one<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.709> original

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
good to see now as one of the original

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.039 
good to see now as one of the original
guys<00:02:43.670> who<00:02:43.880> started<00:02:44.090> out<00:02:44.359> that<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:44.810> current

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
guys who started out that this current

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.050 
guys who started out that this current
generation<00:02:45.319> is<00:02:45.799> coming<00:02:46.100> through<00:02:46.340> they've<00:02:46.910> got

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
generation is coming through they've got

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.400 
generation is coming through they've got
all<00:02:47.180> these<00:02:47.299> really<00:02:47.690> really<00:02:47.900> good<00:02:48.049> skills

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
all these really really good skills

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.379 
all these really really good skills
because<00:02:48.920> they've<00:02:49.459> got<00:02:49.609> people<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.970> teach<00:02:50.150> them

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
because they've got people to teach them

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:51.759 
because they've got people to teach them
because<00:02:50.690> we've<00:02:50.840> got<00:02:51.019> a<00:02:51.049> lot<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.260> instructing

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
because we've got a lot of instructing

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.800 
because we've got a lot of instructing
and<00:02:51.920> things<00:02:52.100> like<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.280> going<00:02:52.519> on<00:02:52.670> now<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.150> um

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
and things like that going on now and um

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.559 
and things like that going on now and um
the<00:02:54.590> new<00:02:54.769> generation<00:02:55.430> surpassed<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.120> old<00:02:56.329> and

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
the new generation surpassed the old and

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.539 
the new generation surpassed the old and
as<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.900> result<00:02:57.139> it<00:02:57.410> creates<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.859> more<00:02:58.010> healthy

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
as a result it creates a more healthy

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.940 
as a result it creates a more healthy
