00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 hello dear play open heartily 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.430
 Welcome to our new game tip 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.630
 monster mix 3 acts on this title 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.240
 it's a mix of jump'n'run 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.619
 and puzzle titles in this game 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.790
 you take control over one 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.630
 little monster 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.969
 been specifically mysterious 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.250
 This one navigates her through a pretty 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.510
 crazy island landscape 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.059
 in between you meet again and again 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.579
 on another monster the clou of the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.590
 It is now that you sent the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.710
 the other's properties give us that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.780
 combined with your own 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.790
 actual control works over 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.860
 the arrow keys with the help of the spacebar 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.390
 can you between the geely mont then 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.520
 switch back and forth 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.350
 but that works only if that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.899
 other monsters also on the screen 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 You can see it when you see the two monsters 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.479
 moved over each other and the enter button 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.939
 you can also join together 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.860
 so will be two flat elongated ones 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.829
 jelly monsters, for example 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.010
 circular or cube-shaped 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.110
 monster that's important because he 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.360
 at some places in the levels only 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.610
 get ahead if you have the right form 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.170
 some have the monsters can 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 for example, just walk 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.340
 others can jump and others can jump 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.340
 swim or even climb 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.229
 The aim of the game is to give each level one 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.210
 to reach statue at the level end and 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.310
 decorate them with flowers 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.440
 the flowers can you earlier in the level of 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.660
 Collect how many flowers you already have 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.830
 you have collected up here 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.830
 see the ad 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.630
 each flower also gives you some time each time 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.790
 more flowers you collect and the more 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.860
 time you left at the end of the level the more 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.220
 your level rating will be better 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.220
 fail 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.040
 the interesting thing about monsters x3 is the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.260
 mix of puzzle game and jump'n'run 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.330
 because then you jump with your chili 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.120
 monsters over abysses climbs on 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.650
 Wood blocks along uses spring britta 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.350
 to higher sections to 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.850
 reach through water and be 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.700
 every now and then with more or less 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.709
 So busy with complex puzzles 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.440
 your switch will activate teleporter 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.840

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.970
 to steer another or windy one 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.989
 blocks take advantage of you through the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.519
 wear 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.380
 the developers were in things 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.940
 Leveldesign pretty clever than that 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.519
 puzzles are not always at first 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.100
 look transparent for the long-term fun 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.780
 In addition, numerous secrets provide the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.780
 you can discover in the levels 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.000
 Monster Mix 3 is a really clever one 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.769
 title that makes a lot of fun so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.060
 but explore the mysterious island 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.310
 and to decorate the statues 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.319
