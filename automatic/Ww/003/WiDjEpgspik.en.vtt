00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.610

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:49.629
 like eleven o'clock at night sleep in bed 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.629
 what I like most every day of a cat 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.320
 1983 from my captivity my captors 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.229
 they continue to cheat 7000 with strangers 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.659
 hanging objects and small they have dinner 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.729
 lavishly fresh meat while a 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.250
 the other inmates and me feed us 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.860
 with a mix of some kind of nuggets 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.140
 dry after ciu my rations of a 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.909
 perfectly clear form but without 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.130
 But I must eat to conserve 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.710
 forces the only thing that keeps me with 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.900
 pizza is my dream to escape 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.990
 in an attempt to dislike them once 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.299
 I vomited the hate carpet was beheaded 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.970
 an arm that dropped his body without 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.619
 life at his feet had the hope of 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.720
 that my act instilled fear in their 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.360
 hearts as it shows the 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.810
 perfection my capabilities however 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.550
 they limited themselves to making comments of type 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.080
 good the little bastards this 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.360
 night they have made some kind of assembly 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.009
 with his accomplices were confined in a 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.410
 lonely place for making noise and 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.630
 Seize the food but I also lock myself 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.399
 I felt that I thought I heard allergies 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.440
 I must learn what that means and how 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.509
 use it to my advantage 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.860
 today I almost succeed in an attempt to 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.899
 to kill one of my executioners 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.479
 tangling between her legs while 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.740
 I walked I have to try again 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.170
 morning 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.819
 this bad because the statins 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.250
 I am convinced that the others 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.340
 prisoners are the street so snitches the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.630
 dog of special privileges 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.140
 regularly explained but always 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.150
 come back copy is a piece of paper 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.860
 bird must be an informant what have 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.590
 observed communicating with the guards 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.840
 I'm sure that regular 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.790
 that brings all my movements 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.410
 my factors have provided a 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.910
 extra protection with a raised cage 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.910
 so you 're something 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.180
 at this time
