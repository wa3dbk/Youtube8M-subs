00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.310
 the butterfly are so beautiful that it would be 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.330
 if they could not smoke 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:18.049
 the star cells could not see the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.049
 bid to go 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.210
 Hello guys 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 It's okay today, I 'm back to give 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.779
 quality in the novelty and was 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.850
 locked on my channel and how are you 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.400
 could you see I put a photo 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.420
 the beginning of the video so that you 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.270
 You can read that I'm pretty blond then. 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.150
 The people who accompany me know that I 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.470
 I had to do an essay called 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.850
 scintigraphy that is to see if it really 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.730
 nothing a change heart and grace that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.340
 last week if you did not give anything I will not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.230
 It's okay to have catheterization. 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.630
 with the technological part is is an exam 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.650
 very annoying to do and not the duration 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.659
 approximate 5 hours and they indicate the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.939
 in our bloodstream that this 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.479
 world heart struggle then you stay 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.899
 tired without doing anything it transpires 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.899
 was finally 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.490
 so I wanted to share until the end 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:33.359
 after the cardiologist was missing the 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:36.539
 salt the doc report monex in Tokyo that 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.950
 I I'm going to it is on the street parallel to 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.219
 where the office of my 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.530
 cardiologist and as I had already 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.729
 commented that I got an agreement to 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.340
 make fifa sense too 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.499
 get an appointment with the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.020
 endocrinologist because I check the 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:55.319
 Abuse function of 70 person to achieve 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.149
 vacancy per day October 30 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.159
 So we were scared, it's not for 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.840
 wait a month and a half for an appointment 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.729
 any people at all 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.659
 and then I went to this practice to pretend 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.769
 that had this 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.030
 need the date of my appointment 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.959
 confused to see if I could get the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.110
 fitting 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.450
 You think it worked? 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.379
 in the endocrine he was neither my 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.650
 exams 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.319
 he simply prescribed the award and 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.060
 I did not stay five minutes in the 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.569
 endocrinologist room 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.340
 anyway simple and light did not need 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.970
 have waited so just refer to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:41.970
 to go for it, but at last he gave seven 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:44.250
 schin and people means that my 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.900
 preoperative process 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.569
 I need to confess that I was not 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.620
 anxious but collecting or dying and 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:57.959
 anxiety and and now as the passes 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.970
 brand deals with surgeon and things 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.500
 what will be the date of the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.310
 rebirth, right? 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.629
 but then crowd the focus of this video 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.109
 does not do to speak a little bit of 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.310
 technique that choose to do and why that 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:16.500
 I chose 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.590
 The truth is I do not think we 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.650
 we should look for this kind of information 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.760
 only with reports of people already operated 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:31.829
 Before deciding, I researched a lot. 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.980
 on the subject and I did not ask for the opinion 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.569
 no one's not here to be 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.790
 anyone's opinion maker so well. 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.130
 I think it's worth giving a 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.590
 studied in the theoretical part before 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.870
 look for other people because 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.340
 nilly influences a bit and 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.239
 google's there for that 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.000
 7 Then I'll make the war. 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.030
 I did not study much about it either. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.169
 before and when I got to my surgeon 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.860
 he asked if I knew quota here I 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.870
 I wanted to do every family 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.980
 if he said that really the best 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.000
 surgery is recommended in my case is it 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.269
 who does not know the ball weighs a surgery 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.209
 reduction as much as restrictive 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.540
 fortunately it is restrictive because the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.030
 your stomach will become smaller deny having 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.670
 a direct link from his study to the option 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.530
 small intestine will be ôôôô food 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.750
 will have a brief passage through the 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.610
 burst and fell straight into the gut 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.020
 which will be directly connected 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.270
 the final to take what will happen 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.130
 when and if germany arrives at 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.950
 intestine she will know if the reason is 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.520
 precisely because it will not absorb 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.010
 everything that food has to offer 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.440
 here comes the criticism of many people 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.419
 relation to the work technique that is 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.900
 usually people have to take 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.460
 vitamin or for a long time or until 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.150
 even in the process of life 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.970
 to supply this lack of nutrients 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.550
 What are vitamins that rock the food? 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.110
 provide our lap but it is the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.320
 Question, folks, I think there's a lot 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.169
 people complaining full belly because 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.530
 never that a person could so much weight 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.870
 in a short time if it was not for the surgery 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.460
 before taking vitamins obviously without end 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.130
 for the rest of your life than you are taking 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.090
 that insulin has pressure 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.100
 high of what is totally here asphalt 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.470
 fragile I do not see the fact of taking 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.870
 vitamin as something bad then guys 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.900
 get it out of your head 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.590
 this is not going to hurt the 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:50.180
 result of the chosen technique ok then 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:53.330
 The guys I chose the brand is just 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:57.260
 by testing enough to insert 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.940
 I saw it is the surgery that will only decrease 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:04.900
 your stomach will not touch the 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:09.460
 intestine and my doctor said that it is 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.410
 to lose 30 to 35 kilos and depending 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.240
 defining co-morbidities as well 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.600
 the person will vary from person to 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.280
 person, so you can not tell him 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.639
 also told me that the bay is the technique 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.020
 most used in Brazil as much as 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.039
 in the united states 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.229
 so I opted for it and also 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.360
 He recommended and got everything right and this was 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:35.770
 one of the main reasons for 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.650
 chosen by the people aipac forgiveness 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.530
 my face is sleepy but here yesterday when 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.350
 I was recording I was going to a party. 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.030
 to search did not give time to finish and 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.210
 I also have one more thing to 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.150
 tell you that in relation to a 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.970
 facebook group is my first video 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.820
 comment on one and I participate today 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.280
 more frequent than another calling 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.199
 bariatrics are paulo so I wanted to 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.520
 count to participate also a group 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.979
 very cool 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.570
 It's a group where I find the administrator 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.550
 more accessible 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.460
 And look what you need, what I see in 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.370
 other groups of people fighting bearing 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:19.599
 things needed and administrators 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:21.580
 They have to have a control and discipline 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:25.180
 what's happening in the group itself 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.760
 the name of the bariatric administrator 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.380
 São Paulo rt he is very good people 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.440
 Come on, people participated. 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.960
 meet people new new stories 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.870
 new information at last 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.650
 and although the name is bariatric, they are 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.270
 Paulo 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.150
 this does not mean that only the 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:47.810
 people from são paulo can participate 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.550
 so what is not a restricted group 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:53.030
 much by contact with anyone 

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:56.570
 You'll be very welcome here, we'll do it. 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.700
 So I hope to come back soon. 

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:03.940
