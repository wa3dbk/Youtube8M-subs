00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
sorry this video probably sucks but I

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.130 
sorry this video probably sucks but I
figured<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.970> best<00:02:22.270> way<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.450> do<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.930> I

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
figured this is the best way to do it I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.850 
figured this is the best way to do it I
have<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:24.070> record<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:24.610> on<00:02:24.760> my<00:02:24.910> own<00:02:24.940> because<00:02:25.860> my

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
have to record it on my own because my

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.890 
have to record it on my own because my
roommates<00:02:27.220> aren't<00:02:27.490> here<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.570> put<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
roommates aren't here so you put the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.080 
roommates aren't here so you put the
bowl<00:02:29.110> on<00:02:29.140> top<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:30.520> won't<00:02:30.790> count<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.240> bowl<00:02:31.560> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
bowl on top it won't count the bowl and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.960 
bowl on top it won't count the bowl and
then<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:35.170> just<00:02:35.320> gonna<00:02:35.500> put<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> hundred<00:02:36.730> grams

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
then I'm just gonna put a hundred grams

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.470 
then I'm just gonna put a hundred grams
in<00:02:37.180> here

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.100 

and<00:02:41.520> honestly<00:02:42.520> I'll<00:02:43.300> probably<00:02:43.600> heat<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.959> up

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
and honestly I'll probably heat it up

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.530 
and honestly I'll probably heat it up
but<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.410> lot<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.770> times<00:02:44.980> I'm<00:02:45.190> even<00:02:45.880> too<00:02:46.120> lazy<00:02:46.360> to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
but a lot of times I'm even too lazy to

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.180 
but a lot of times I'm even too lazy to
do<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.050> just<00:02:47.080> eat<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.530> cold<00:02:47.770> because<00:02:48.040> I

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
do that and I just eat it cold because I

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.390 
do that and I just eat it cold because I
don't<00:02:48.340> really<00:02:48.520> care<00:02:48.959> but<00:02:49.959> I'll<00:02:50.100> probably<00:02:51.100> heat

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
don't really care but I'll probably heat

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:01.100 
don't really care but I'll probably heat
it<00:02:51.550> up<00:02:52.380> today<00:02:53.380> after<00:02:53.920> getting<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.300> there

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:10.620 

I'm<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.880> there<00:03:05.010> 105<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:10.150> don't<00:03:10.300> have<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.510> be

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
I'm just there 105 you don't have to be

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.620 
I'm just there 105 you don't have to be
this<00:03:10.810> anal<00:03:11.290> but<00:03:11.650> all<00:03:12.640> right<00:03:12.790> 101<00:03:13.239> that's<00:03:13.420> good

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
this anal but all right 101 that's good

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.850 
this anal but all right 101 that's good
enough<00:03:15.360> okay<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.600> got<00:03:16.840> my<00:03:17.200> rice<00:03:17.440> in<00:03:17.680> there

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
enough okay so I got my rice in there

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.100 
enough okay so I got my rice in there
and<00:03:18.100> then<00:03:18.280> now<00:03:18.549> if<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.299> just<00:03:19.360> press<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:20.049> button

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
and then now if I just press this button

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.410 
and then now if I just press this button
again<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.860> goes<00:03:20.980> back<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.280> zero<00:03:21.489> so<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.180> takes

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
again it goes back to zero so it takes

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.930 
again it goes back to zero so it takes
away<00:03:22.799> what<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:23.830> just<00:03:24.130> put<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.459> there<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:24.760> then

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
away what I just put in there and then

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.570 
away what I just put in there and then
I'm<00:03:25.209> gonna<00:03:25.420> put<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:25.870> 16<00:03:26.470> grams<00:03:26.830> of<00:03:27.040> almonds

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.750 

which<00:03:30.580> gives<00:03:30.910> me<00:03:31.209> 8<00:03:31.930> grams<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.620> fat<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.190> 3

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
which gives me 8 grams of fat and 3

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.600 
which gives me 8 grams of fat and 3
grams<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.180> carbs<00:03:34.480> 3<00:03:34.660> grams<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:35.049> protein<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.799> just

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
grams of carbs 3 grams of protein I just

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.310 
grams of carbs 3 grams of protein I just
know<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.970> from<00:03:37.410> having<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:39.580> many<00:03:39.670> aunts<00:03:40.320> day

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
know that from having so many aunts day

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.449 
know that from having so many aunts day
after<00:03:41.739> day<00:03:42.060> which<00:03:43.060> I<00:03:43.180> love<00:03:43.390> them<00:03:43.540> though<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.459> 17

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
after day which I love them though so 17

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.240 
after day which I love them though so 17
try<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.239> take<00:03:46.420> out<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.630> small<00:03:46.810> one<00:03:47.140> I<00:03:47.170> guess

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.979 

nope<00:03:51.280> I'll<00:03:52.030> probably<00:03:52.209> just<00:03:52.420> end<00:03:52.630> up<00:03:52.720> going

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
nope I'll probably just end up going

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.710 
nope I'll probably just end up going
with<00:03:53.019> 17<00:03:53.620> all<00:03:54.130> right<00:03:54.310> that's<00:03:54.519> fine<00:03:54.790> no<00:03:55.510> big

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
with 17 all right that's fine no big

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.100 
with 17 all right that's fine no big
deal

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
deal

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.370 
deal
ok<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.680> 17<00:03:57.280> grams<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.870> I'll<00:03:58.959> probably<00:03:59.140> just

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
ok so 17 grams so I'll probably just

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.600 
ok so 17 grams so I'll probably just
throw<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.680> in<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.860> microwave<00:04:00.010> for<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.400> little

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
throw that in the microwave for a little

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.440 
throw that in the microwave for a little
bit<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:00.970> then<00:04:01.830> as<00:04:02.830> far<00:04:03.040> as<00:04:03.100> my<00:04:03.459> protein<00:04:04.239> goes

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
bit and then as far as my protein goes

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.340 
bit and then as far as my protein goes
I've<00:04:04.630> actually<00:04:04.840> even<00:04:05.260> been<00:04:06.540> so<00:04:07.540> anal<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.260> the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
I've actually even been so anal to the

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.789 
I've actually even been so anal to the
point<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.799> I'm<00:04:08.950> actually<00:04:09.220> going<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:10.799> measure

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
point that I'm actually going to measure

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.460 
point that I'm actually going to measure
my<00:04:12.040> protein<00:04:12.880> too<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.660> reason<00:04:13.989> why<00:04:14.170> is<00:04:14.230> I

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
my protein too and the reason why is I

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.940 
my protein too and the reason why is I
noticed<00:04:14.890> that<00:04:15.100> I<00:04:15.570> wanted<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.630> try<00:04:17.079> actually

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
noticed that I wanted to try actually

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.800 
noticed that I wanted to try actually
measuring<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.760> out<00:04:18.970> because<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.359> serving

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
measuring it out because the serving

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.789 
measuring it out because the serving
size<00:04:19.989> is<00:04:20.349> a<00:04:20.830> scoop<00:04:21.280> but

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
size is a scoop but

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.860 
size is a scoop but
scoop<00:04:22.069> is<00:04:22.340> supposed<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.729> be<00:04:22.879> 24<00:04:23.449> grams<00:04:25.870> where

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
scoop is supposed to be 24 grams where

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.770 
scoop is supposed to be 24 grams where
is<00:04:27.050> it<00:04:27.289> yeah<00:04:27.650> see<00:04:27.949> so<00:04:28.490> then<00:04:28.759> I<00:04:28.970> just<00:04:29.030> measured<00:04:29.659> a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
is it yeah see so then I just measured a

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.360 
is it yeah see so then I just measured a
scoop<00:04:30.080> just<00:04:30.349> for<00:04:30.500> shits<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.830> giggles<00:04:30.919> and

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
scoop just for shits and giggles and

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.189 
scoop just for shits and giggles and
usually<00:04:31.639> a<00:04:31.669> scoop<00:04:32.000> ended<00:04:32.270> up<00:04:32.389> being<00:04:32.599> like<00:04:32.690> 28

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
usually a scoop ended up being like 28

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.860 
usually a scoop ended up being like 28
to<00:04:33.349> 30<00:04:33.650> so<00:04:33.979> I'm<00:04:34.069> actually<00:04:34.250> getting<00:04:34.629> more<00:04:35.629> than

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
to 30 so I'm actually getting more than

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.890 
to 30 so I'm actually getting more than
I<00:04:35.990> thought<00:04:36.229> and<00:04:37.150> I'm<00:04:38.150> trying<00:04:38.389> to<00:04:38.419> be<00:04:38.539> precise

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
I thought and I'm trying to be precise

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.050 
I thought and I'm trying to be precise
here<00:04:39.199> so<00:04:40.090> that's<00:04:41.090> why<00:04:41.330> I<00:04:42.550> actually<00:04:43.550> measure<00:04:43.819> it

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
here so that's why I actually measure it

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:53.490 
here so that's why I actually measure it
now<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:45.069> grab<00:04:46.069> my<00:04:46.250> scooper<00:04:47.979> get<00:04:48.979> that<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.370> zero

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.649 

and<00:04:54.500> then<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:57.800> want<00:04:58.099> two<00:04:58.280> scoops<00:04:58.699> I<00:04:58.940> want<00:04:59.150> 48

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
and then so I want two scoops I want 48

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.450 
and then so I want two scoops I want 48
grams<00:05:00.400> so<00:05:01.400> there's<00:05:01.669> like<00:05:02.379> whatever<00:05:03.460> regular

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
grams so there's like whatever regular

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.029 
grams so there's like whatever regular
sized<00:05:04.969> scoop<00:05:05.360> see<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:05.870> night<00:05:06.110> okay<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:06.620> that<00:05:06.889> was

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
sized scoop see a night okay so that was

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.279 
sized scoop see a night okay so that was
more<00:05:07.340> like<00:05:07.699> it<00:05:07.969> size<00:05:08.330> 24<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.020> that<00:05:09.050> was

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
more like it size 24 so that was

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.369 
more like it size 24 so that was
