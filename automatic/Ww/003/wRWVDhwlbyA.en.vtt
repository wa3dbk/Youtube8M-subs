00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
add-ons or what not you are somewhat

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.750 
add-ons or what not you are somewhat
limited<00:01:37.020> exactly<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.070> you're<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.400> limited

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
limited exactly so you're really limited

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.280 
limited exactly so you're really limited
to<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.510> what<00:01:39.780> we're<00:01:39.900> trying<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.200> with

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
to that and what we're trying to do with

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.800 
to that and what we're trying to do with

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
connected to the world yeah while still

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.970 
connected to the world yeah while still
getting<00:01:45.000> great<00:01:45.540> image<00:01:46.020> quality<00:01:46.170> well<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
getting great image quality well so

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.440 
getting great image quality well so
there's<00:01:47.580> kind<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.850> two<00:01:48.000> sides<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
there's kind of the two sides of this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.570 
there's kind of the two sides of this
there's<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.840> Android<00:01:49.200> side<00:01:49.620> which<00:01:50.040> runs<00:01:50.430> off

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
there's the Android side which runs off

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.790 
there's the Android side which runs off
android<00:01:50.970> OS<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.570> Google<00:01:51.990> Play<00:01:52.170> has<00:01:52.380> any<00:01:52.620> app

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
android OS has Google Play has any app

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.310 
android OS has Google Play has any app
you<00:01:52.830> want<00:01:53.190> Facebook<00:01:54.000> Twitter<00:01:54.030> Instagram<00:01:54.450> you

you want Facebook Twitter Instagram you
name<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.710> yeah<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> know<00:01:56.760> it's<00:01:57.180> only<00:01:57.540> scary<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
name it yeah I know it's only scary to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.690 
name it yeah I know it's only scary to
think<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.470> all<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:58.770> options<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.490> for

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
think of all the options you can get for

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.160 
think of all the options you can get for
it<00:01:59.730> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.330> there's<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> camera<00:02:00.810> side<00:02:00.990> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
it and then there's the camera side to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
it and then there's the camera side to
it<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.320> well<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.650> there's<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.250> ten<00:02:02.430> times

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it as well so there's a ten times

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.870 
it as well so there's a ten times
optical<00:02:02.850> zoom<00:02:03.060> okay<00:02:04.340> we're<00:02:05.340> looking<00:02:05.670> at

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
optical zoom okay we're looking at

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.649 
optical zoom okay we're looking at
built-in<00:02:06.870> GPS<00:02:07.489> has<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> CMOS<00:02:09.030> sensor<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.569> all

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
built-in GPS has a CMOS sensor so all

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.029 
built-in GPS has a CMOS sensor so all
the<00:02:09.720> things<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.019> get<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> CMOS<00:02:10.739> sensor

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the things you get with a CMOS sensor

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.759 
the things you get with a CMOS sensor
grade<00:02:11.459> low-light<00:02:11.879> image<00:02:12.150> quality<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:13.739> have

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
grade low-light image quality you have

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.229 
grade low-light image quality you have
fast<00:02:14.189> frame<00:02:14.579> rate<00:02:14.819> when<00:02:15.060> you're<00:02:15.150> actually

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
fast frame rate when you're actually

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.750 
fast frame rate when you're actually
shooting<00:02:15.540> let's<00:02:15.900> say<00:02:16.019> you're<00:02:16.290> doing<00:02:16.530> sports

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
shooting let's say you're doing sports

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.729 
shooting let's say you're doing sports
great<00:02:18.330> video<00:02:18.569> mode<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.930> get<00:02:18.989> full<00:02:19.230> 1080p<00:02:19.620> HD

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
great video mode you get full 1080p HD

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.399 
great video mode you get full 1080p HD
video<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.299> on<00:02:21.599> top<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.170> fact

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
video so and on top of that the fact

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.470 
video so and on top of that the fact
that<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.680> sensor<00:02:23.129> in<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.790> much<00:02:24.239> much

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that the sensor in this is much much

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.789 
that the sensor in this is much much
larger<00:02:24.689> than<00:02:24.870> what<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.110> normally<00:02:25.170> get<00:02:25.560> with

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
larger than what you normally get with

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.920 
larger than what you normally get with
your<00:02:26.129> iphone<00:02:26.459> or<00:02:26.640> blackberry<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.450> samsung<00:02:27.900> oh

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
your iphone or blackberry or samsung oh

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.589 
your iphone or blackberry or samsung oh
yeah<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.590> image<00:02:29.220> quality<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.579> fantastic<00:02:29.849> and

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
yeah so image quality is fantastic and

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.390 
yeah so image quality is fantastic and
then<00:02:30.870> having<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.500> kind<00:02:31.829> of<00:02:31.950> connected

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
then having that kind of connected

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.890 
then having that kind of connected
ability<00:02:32.790> being<00:02:32.939> able<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.120> go<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.450> get<00:02:33.659> into<00:02:33.810> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
ability being able to go and get into a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
Wi-Fi zone the camera automatically

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.059 
Wi-Fi zone the camera automatically
connect<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.959> or<00:02:37.079> if<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.530> want<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> hot<00:02:37.860> spot

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
connect to it or if you want a hot spot

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.289 
connect to it or if you want a hot spot
from<00:02:38.340> your<00:02:38.519> phone<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.879> you're<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> middle

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
from your phone if you're in the middle

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.940 
from your phone if you're in the middle
of<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.510> field<00:02:39.659> somewhere<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.590> want<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.829> go

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
of a field somewhere and you want to go

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.940 
of a field somewhere and you want to go
and<00:02:41.159> zoom<00:02:41.670> in<00:02:41.849> using<00:02:42.120> your<00:02:42.299> 10<00:02:42.480> *<00:02:42.720> oom<00:02:42.959> capture

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
and zoom in using your 10 * oom capture

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.500 
and zoom in using your 10 * oom capture
that<00:02:44.040> great<00:02:44.310> image<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.819> then<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.390> can

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
that great image and then you can

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.479 
that great image and then you can
hotspot<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.019> your<00:02:46.140> phone<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.500> then<00:02:46.560> send<00:02:47.430> it

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
hotspot to your phone and then send it

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.920 
hotspot to your phone and then send it
directly<00:02:47.790> off<00:02:47.939> into<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.180> world<00:02:48.269> so<00:02:48.629> basically

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
directly off into the world so basically

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.479 
directly off into the world so basically
