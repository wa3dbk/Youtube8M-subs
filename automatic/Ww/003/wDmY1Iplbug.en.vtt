00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.240
 initiated by the detail of services at the Oregon site is a place 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.140
 also mystery 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.249
 since the appearance of the moon in daylight 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.249
 a place where the rules of physics do not seem to apply 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.749
 in a place where even the law of shyness 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.880
 breeders text the curtain 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.880
 thank you for the house of mysteries 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.450
 it is easy to follow from about 3000 square meters was known from 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.449
 Amerindians long before the white man of 1 victory 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.370
 the first chevrolet nearly enter his workshop 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.370
 Kyrgyz territory 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.280
 but he concluded his family are the owners of these lands since 40 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.620
 years 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.250
 they bought pianists the Scottish physicists who had come in 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.940
 friend 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 to study strange phenomena happen here 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.910
 after some 14000 pianist experience had explained this ground 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.780
 extends over a manic area a place they tame texas 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.330
 the gravitational force a magnetic attraction or health has been made of 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.610
 weird way 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.900
 if ever that understood what was happening here he never told anyone he 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.150
 burned those documents before we 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.620
 the half-volley that would have burned these documents because they did not believe 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
 that people were willing to accept what is being done here 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.880
 peugeot - couples the mystery surrounding the vortex of Lorient which has 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.220
 been very profitable the place has become a port attraction 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.740
 corentin green cabaret is at its hunt the csc 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.409
 canada ranked right we hope his opponent head on Saturday face 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.980
 to face the fan finally accepts the financial question is to lagos and there 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.350
 even less with a basket a market to go to social action 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.520
 one year before 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.180
 this cabin is the main attraction of the quartet will be quite long exchange of 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.080
 diamonds following a first announcement the successful launch of its foundation and 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.780
 hit a maple several meters lower 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.780
 she will appear in front of palop the business press 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.989
 in front of laval 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.949
 inside everything is wrong all the walls of a health house that 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.769
 were not changed is another perception of what is going on 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.769
 to talk about what 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.730
 the last ones in equilibrium on the plane have indeed tilted towards the North 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:32.469
 rather than being with someone 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.630
 she regrets that this case did not take place in 2007 in rio 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.799
 in the green she pointed out m 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.099
 so to celebrate his situation in the world agrees to research 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.599
 itself 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.599
 we roll 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.359
 the water of another world 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.760
 I had the merit of never quoting the bottles same ngom 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:08.039
 - wall street is in turmoil 49 years old arrived in alsace marseille we went 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:12.179
 in this sense then we made a personal exploit we have no right but self but 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:15.179
 we went beyond 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.359
 but according to m 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.029
 sexual assault on a snow and frost 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.489
 the aid network to greece 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.159
 despite his looks 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.260
 he tells him acknowledges that these phenomena are only illusions 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.369
 hospitalized optics to leave home 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.269
 but he asserts that there are mysterious forces that act in their 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.179
 class 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.179
 Christians have really left changing the size of a grain 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.319
 it took place at such a party 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.959
 but it is only way that we can use to measure something here 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.549
 because the dimensions of the instruments of measurement of the charges inside 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.549
 this room is such bullshit activity 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.999
 we looked closely at this phenomenon 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:07.239
 we placed two posts of identical dimensions on each side 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.749
 of a board in both ends are at the same level 1 before 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.919
 proof is that the camera is equidistant from both peoples 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.429
 people a small and a big season on the side of each side 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.529
 despite these criticisms had granted him outside the house 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.719
 isere edition and the difference in size between the two people does not 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.719
 do not seem to be lying when these change side m 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.800
 this map as well as the magnetic fields of the earth as well as the 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800
 magnetic phenomena 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 that occur across the usa 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.419
 magnetic phenomena are usually caused by deposits 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.869
 of volcanic materials - geological events 

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:51.330
 quantity has consequences on the French Riviera 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.060
 jean-Claude underlined the professor at the California Institute of Technology at 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.910
 pasadena 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.450
 and say there is something unusual about where is 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.009
 passed the mystery house 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.770
 mix and nothing of the mister it is so the same beautiful at this place but 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.789
 anyone could detect with a magnetometer if we look at the 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.229
 map of the area there are phenomena like that everywhere 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.229
 why would that be more exceptional than the others 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.689
 the vortex of Lorient whose roots 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:23.599
 a few hundred miles south of salsa found in California 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.529
 similar phenomena have occurred for decades as 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.080
 this excerpt from a TV show bears witness to it 

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.460
 george fries 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.419
 what and according to you 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.069
 until March pierre bemba does not stress me 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:39.089
 he refers to hack 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.209
 at the height of last season and during that time 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.020
 Saturday for rape was unearthed by the arranged and his span his sweet voice 

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:48.259
 period 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.500
 among the big domain names with gravelines will be normal for them 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:53.599
 regional 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.550
 - three scenarios 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.889
 I already actively to this debate quickly turned to the sea 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.330
 he will soon be reproaching himself for not writing 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.319
 too much 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.409
 for this purpose there are more than a dozen similar places in 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.869
 north america yes really mastered around 1:30 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:20.869
 the titles devastated this season 3 is there too 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.340
 nobody knew what was needed 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.930
 and I would not like a maternal assistant for the second but I think 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.550
 that as a simple woman china has a role for the style the iron pot 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:43.370
 for this 25th day of series I traveled the country 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.729
 and to measure the intensity of the magnetic field 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.520
 in this is what is used by greenhouse crops 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.020
 she knows that each country has champions but especially the outcome of 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.710
 this crisis 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.800
 the archeological site at the United States stone circle ference your 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.370
 car 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.240
 people build their monuments over strange but natural season 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.669
 fierce they did the same thing happens if these affairs 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.960
 this week out we asked his expectations and a rate to measure 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.320
 the magnetic fields surrounding the house of mysteries besides the 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:14.650
 pope inside the price simi vortex the numerical value of the territory 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.930
 while outside it returns to normal we are very disappointed after 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.349
 this raw information 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:22.830
 we can definitively conclude there is a huge difference between these 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.729
 two without three 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.680
 after salvatore feueau season even though all the vices and china on the 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.159
 changes it makes me feel guilty too late but it could affect your mind 

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:34.539
 the king's fool since the 80s 

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.930
 theories about the physiological effects of magnetic fields 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.319
 are rather clear it is the sad record of some effect on 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:42.310
 neurotransmitters like serotonin 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.640
 melatonin and dopamine he would train apparently a 

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.490
 overproduction of these chemicals that affect mood 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.429
 and on player behavior 

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:51.979
 a kind of natural prozac
