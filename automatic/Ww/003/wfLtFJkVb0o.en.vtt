00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.279
 then we all have to be friends of the Indian phenomenon 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.399
 when we are at night 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:16.800
 to look at the sky 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.949
 then, apart from the few planets, we see them at high speed 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.329
 move us past 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.329
 where we know that I am not able to only stars 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.109
 where does stars actually come from when they've always been under it? 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.629
 they were created sometime in a process that we still have today 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:33.850
 to investigate 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.140
 that is how the question today be like 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.310
 arise stars 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.680
 which conditions 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.640
 must be fulfilled 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.310
 make these giant big balls 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.580
 the Frisian big glass dome 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.070
 their luminosity 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.180
 unfold 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.460
 as well as our sun 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.850
 maybe even life 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.550
 in your area 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.740
 feed and produce 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.530
 Stars are not just created like that but stars are like gas clouds 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.750
 and one of these gas clouds again to know one of the most famous gas clouds 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.320
 is in our Milky Way 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.210
 the Orion Nebula 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.130
 One recognizes one in the Orion Nebula 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.930
 Plauen 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.579
 Blue painted cloud 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.189
 and a rose lit up both wanted to belong together and they will be on 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.650
 lit by young stars 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.610
 one sees in the picture in particular the smaller blue fog on the left 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.620
 Side one sees 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.430
 dark stripes in it that is dust 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.170
 whose small core themes of velvet and out communicate the light absorb 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.040
 "We recognize very bright stars in this blue part 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.650
 who are responsible for the luminosity of life overall this bright star 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.920
 are very big star 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.700
 these big stars are so big 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.179
 that within a few million years 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.990
 to die 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.179
 a star his brother Georg you a nuclear fusion reactor 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.060
 in its core become nuclei 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.040
 Cores fuse together 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.950
 and this core fusion process in the end for luminosity 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.420
 responsible how strong 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.920
 this one where it's happening inside of us depends on how much 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.589
 print 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.180
 on this star loads and the more pressure so the larger his assist 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.519
 the faster he burns 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.609
 the material inside and therefore the life of a star is quite whole 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.040
 sensitive depending on how heavier it is 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.590
 for example, the sun of ten billion years of life 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.330
 a star that is twice as heavy as the sun becomes only a billion 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.090
 Years of life and the stars the Moria mist illuminates this blue cloud the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.270
 Live for only ten or 30 million years and then your life is over 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.499
 Finish with their style pieces by turns 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.359
 Fusion of their animals feed 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.929
 their feed, so to speak, consumes Indra for light 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:44.179
 and that's why we know the stars because they're so short 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:45.560
 Lifetime names we know 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.680
 Surely they are not far from their center the stars are in 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.649
 this was created 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:52.289
 Now that happens 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.809
 why cool and suddenly material so gas 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.230
 to such a Google together 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.970
 what is the reason for the gas collapsing at all now is the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.020
 same reason therefore here on earth 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.810
 Percent can not fly off Gerd now pull the gravity of the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.769
 Attached earth and of course it is 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.809
 in space gravitation gravity 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.029
 is the one 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.789
 The decides if a body collapses so get federal as well 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:22.439
 who are bound to the earth as he is then bound to the sun again 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.979
 Modern the earth is tied 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.239
 or if you can move while traveling 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.529
 and such a gas cloud here starts to collapse just then 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.539
 so they coincide 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.579
 when their gravity over all other forces 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.450
 Now what powers can be active in such a cloud at all 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.449
 be opposed to gravity 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.269
 the pressure of such a cloud consists of several parts 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.449
 First of all there is the pressure that simply arises because of the cloud 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.069
 Temperature has 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.139
 High temperature means great pressure, so imagine 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.790
 the balloon inflated properly listen to pressure 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.630
 who inflated with hot gas 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.099
 then he can even get up, that is to say 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.169
 we have with the pressure of a force which are exactly against it 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.779
 So we have gravity 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:11.739
 on the one hand 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.120
 the cloud together 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.349
 PrÃ¶ll breaks 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.180
 So gravity pushes 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.989
 after those and 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.769
 the temperature pushes out 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.980
 such wanted 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.879
 like Orion wanted, for example 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.879
 are 400 light years in total 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.860
 this means 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.260
 incredible dimensions and if we remember that our sun has one 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.470
 Diameter of 700 thousand kilometers 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.949
 and one light year 7 9 trillion kilometers we can imagine 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.439
 that fits it must happen tremendous processes with it so synonymous 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.340
 Giant wanted 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.770
 here inside, such a tiny little ribbon becomes its star 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.029
 how does that happen? 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.719
 Now, first of all, the temperature must be below 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.899
 if the temperature does not drop then the pressure of the gas is able to last 

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.370
 to counteract gravity 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.150
 So it has to be 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.469
 something happens it sinks temperature she has to cool 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.590
 by which processes a guest cools 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.760
 It cools radiation when it shines for life energy 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.930
 and thereby the temperature is lowered 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.419
 that is only one 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.380
 Variant like a cloud 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.840
 can be brought to coincide and many stars on 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.080
 once to picture so not only one then many at a time 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.129
 the next the next problem 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.930
 Of course, what does that mean, it also wanted to be able to rotate 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.430
 Wiesenburg Eckenga Russell if we use it enough turning the 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.960
 Centrifugal force to the outside and that would of course again something like that 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.120
 mean like impression that means also 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.370
 There she was 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.740
 would not be 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.420
 what we need to get a cloud in one place 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.020
 really let Kolbe fall together so the rotation works 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.499
 against gravity 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:47.250
 and that's a huge problem getting rid of the rotation of a cloud 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.330
 I have to ride the cloud to get rid of its spin energy and it does 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.350
 though by making single chunks she forms chunks of Ian in it and that is 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.469
 exactly these churches 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.009
 their temperature has dropped so they blasted a bit more 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.849
 as their environment these spheres practically ride through each other 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.409
 they can move against everyone and they lose the money 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:09.309
 energy 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:10.539
 and thereby can 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.769
 he still wanted to be given the opportunity to collapse 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.759
 such a giant board disregarded that sense on the order of magnitude 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.379
 of a few hundred light-years 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.379
 So a light year is the distance the light travels in a year 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.230
 So about 9 trillion kilometers 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.590
 a huge distance for comparison the distance from the earth to the sun to 80 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.250
 minutes 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.389
 from the earth to the moon 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.500
 about an important basis the whole solar system until the 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:39.090
 typically some light hours so it's expanding and you can use them 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.409
 So where are these huge ones that are huge amounts 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:44.639
 in these giants Langat that so these huge gas clouds 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.219
 and those are pretty inhomogeneously distributed each in each one of these little ones 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:50.979
 Distribution of these hits 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.979
 Greater of a light that they are the whole again 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:57.150
 This money can be imagined as the man 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.110
 With a microscope on it are always the same one always areas 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.110
 which coincide and the road 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.980
 and by the radiation they can recognize 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.100
 only by letting them lose their energy we can have this gas 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.600
 even realize that something is happening inside
