00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.100 
first tutorial and in a short series I'm
going<00:00:12.100> to<00:00:12.250> be<00:00:12.310> doing<00:00:12.430> on<00:00:12.700> PowerPoint<00:00:13.240> already

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
going to be doing on PowerPoint already

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.990 
going to be doing on PowerPoint already
have<00:00:14.320> another<00:00:14.830> video<00:00:15.099> that's<00:00:15.460> more<00:00:15.700> in<00:00:15.760> depth

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
have another video that's more in depth

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.939 
have another video that's more in depth
on<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.330> beginning<00:00:16.930> PowerPoint<00:00:17.470> this<00:00:17.650> one<00:00:17.800> is

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
on the beginning PowerPoint this one is

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.070 
on the beginning PowerPoint this one is
going<00:00:18.070> to<00:00:18.130> be<00:00:18.310> a<00:00:18.340> bit<00:00:18.550> faster<00:00:19.119> or<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:19.780> start

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
going to be a bit faster or the start

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.279 
going to be a bit faster or the start
let's<00:00:20.350> go<00:00:20.380> slow<00:00:20.800> down<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.160> show<00:00:21.369> you<00:00:21.430> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
let's go slow down to show you the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.850 
let's go slow down to show you the
different<00:00:23.289> things<00:00:23.470> you<00:00:23.560> can<00:00:23.680> do<00:00:23.800> with

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
different things you can do with

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.620 
different things you can do with
PowerPoint<00:00:24.520> so<00:00:24.820> I'm<00:00:24.880> going<00:00:25.029> to<00:00:25.060> quickly<00:00:25.270> just

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
PowerPoint so I'm going to quickly just

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.160 
PowerPoint so I'm going to quickly just
make<00:00:25.840> it<00:00:25.869> PowerPoint<00:00:26.970> first<00:00:27.970> go<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.270> slide

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
make it PowerPoint first go to slide

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.000 
make it PowerPoint first go to slide
design<00:00:30.600> I'm<00:00:31.600> going<00:00:31.779> to<00:00:31.900> choose<00:00:32.079> this<00:00:32.500> curtain

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
design I'm going to choose this curtain

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.950 
design I'm going to choose this curtain
design<00:00:33.370> because<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:33.879> has<00:00:34.000> a<00:00:34.030> lot<00:00:34.239> of<00:00:34.269> contrast

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
design because it has a lot of contrast

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.340 
design because it has a lot of contrast
it's<00:00:35.380> easy<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.680> tell<00:00:35.860> if<00:00:36.160> stuff<00:00:36.940> changes<00:00:37.540> and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
it's easy to tell if stuff changes and

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:57.140 
it's easy to tell if stuff changes and
then<00:00:40.410> sup<00:00:41.410> meg<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:45.120> how<00:00:46.120> is<00:00:47.079> it<00:00:47.440> going

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:07.230 

stuff<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.510> type<00:01:00.000> type<00:01:01.000> I<00:01:04.380> m.r.k<00:01:05.380> to<00:01:06.370> which<00:01:07.090> I

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
stuff to type type I m.r.k to which I

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.450 
stuff to type type I m.r.k to which I
want<00:01:07.420> that<00:01:07.510> to<00:01:07.660> be<00:01:07.780> squared<00:01:08.230> so<00:01:09.070> I'm<00:01:09.220> going<00:01:09.400> to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
want that to be squared so I'm going to

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.390 
want that to be squared so I'm going to
do<00:01:09.610> is<00:01:09.730> I'm<00:01:09.850> going<00:01:09.910> to<00:01:10.060> highlight<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:11.010> go<00:01:12.010> font

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
do is I'm going to highlight to go font

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.920 
do is I'm going to highlight to go font
and<00:01:13.210> then<00:01:13.390> it<00:01:13.480> goes<00:01:13.660> super<00:01:14.200> script<00:01:14.500> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and then it goes super script and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.030 
and then it goes super script and
superscript<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.050> going<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.260> make<00:01:17.620> it<00:01:17.770> like<00:01:18.010> a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
superscript is going to make it like a

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.820 
superscript is going to make it like a
small<00:01:18.430> letter<00:01:18.670> like<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.660> squared<00:01:20.140> sine<00:01:20.440> and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
small letter like a squared sine and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.190 
small letter like a squared sine and
then<00:01:21.010> subscript<00:01:21.700> OBS<00:01:22.120> course<00:01:22.420> I<00:01:22.630> like<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.900> too

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
then subscript OBS course I like a too

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.680 
then subscript OBS course I like a too
but<00:01:23.440> look<00:01:23.560> below<00:01:23.920> below<00:01:24.190> it<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:25.390> if<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.570> like

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
but look below below it so if you like

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.600 
but look below below it so if you like
this<00:01:25.900> subscript<00:01:26.710> would<00:01:26.890> be<00:01:27.010> this<00:01:27.130> little<00:01:27.340> tube

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
this subscript would be this little tube

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.170 
this subscript would be this little tube
down<00:01:27.970> here<00:01:28.330> near<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.200> bottom<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:30.729> going<00:01:31.060> to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
down here near the bottom I'm going to

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.950 
down here near the bottom I'm going to
press<00:01:31.509> ENTER<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:33.790> one<00:01:34.000> thing<00:01:34.030> you've<00:01:34.420> gotta<00:01:34.600> I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
press ENTER now one thing you've gotta I

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.180 
press ENTER now one thing you've gotta I
don't<00:01:35.200> know<00:01:35.320> if<00:01:35.410> it's<00:01:35.530> going<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.740> do<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:35.950> or<00:01:36.070> not

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
don't know if it's going to do it or not

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.240 
don't know if it's going to do it or not
yet<00:01:36.430> did<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:36.759> see<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:37.540> keeps<00:01:38.070> superscript<00:01:39.070> on

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
yet did it see it keeps superscript on

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.480 
yet did it see it keeps superscript on
so<00:01:39.610> just<00:01:39.790> go<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.000> font<00:01:41.190> superscript<00:01:42.360> okay<00:01:44.490> this

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
so just go to font superscript okay this

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.170 
so just go to font superscript okay this
is<00:01:46.210> all<00:01:46.900> random<00:01:49.170> yep<00:01:50.170> that's<00:01:50.410> for<00:01:50.590> sure<00:01:50.770> and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
is all random yep that's for sure and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.719 
is all random yep that's for sure and
sup<00:01:52.180> rocks<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:53.229> does<00:01:53.500> start<00:01:54.070> using<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:56.729> will

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
sup rocks it does start using it will

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.419 
sup rocks it does start using it will
give<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> little<00:01:58.210> short<00:01:59.160> telling<00:02:00.160> how<00:02:00.340> it

you<00:02:10.420> slide<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:12.100> pic<00:02:13.770> picture<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:15.130> like<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.210> to

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
you slide a pic picture I like it to

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.510 
you slide a pic picture I like it to
abbreviate<00:02:16.600> stuff<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:18.190> if<00:02:18.250> i'm<00:02:18.340> going<00:02:18.430> to
