00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
survey tool as you turn to a mob and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.120 
survey tool as you turn to a mob and
also<00:01:07.299> has<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.510> function<00:01:08.049> to<00:01:08.350> allow<00:01:08.619> you<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.890> turn

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
also has a function to allow you to turn

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
also has a function to allow you to turn
into<00:01:09.729> of<00:01:10.119> course<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.229> player<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.930> player

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
into of course a player now the player

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.560 
into of course a player now the player
it<00:01:16.930> worked<00:01:17.229> actually<00:01:17.409> quite<00:01:17.890> fine<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:19.360> is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
it worked actually quite fine which is

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.929 
it worked actually quite fine which is
makes<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.229> really<00:01:20.439> good<00:01:20.710> guess<00:01:20.979> but<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.820> be

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
makes it a really good guess but to be

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.469 
makes it a really good guess but to be
honest<00:01:22.299> no<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:24.009> really<00:01:24.280> not<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:25.000> reason<00:01:25.210> why

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
honest no it's really not the reason why

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.899 
honest no it's really not the reason why
there's<00:01:25.749> a<00:01:25.810> ghost<00:01:26.079> a<00:01:26.530> lot<00:01:27.039> of<00:01:27.070> people<00:01:27.249> saw<00:01:27.609> like

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
there's a ghost a lot of people saw like

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.779 
there's a ghost a lot of people saw like
in<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.210> chat<00:01:28.450> OHF<00:01:29.079> do<00:01:29.229> deathfire<00:01:29.770> join<00:01:30.100> but

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
in the chat OHF do deathfire join but

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.940 
in the chat OHF do deathfire join but
little<00:01:31.179> did<00:01:31.390> they<00:01:31.570> know<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:32.259> myself<00:01:32.469> and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
little did they know that is myself and

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.940 
little did they know that is myself and
I<00:01:33.100> can't<00:01:33.369> be<00:01:33.520> in<00:01:33.609> two<00:01:33.700> places<00:01:33.820> at<00:01:34.270> once<00:01:34.950> which

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
I can't be in two places at once which

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.090 
I can't be in two places at once which
leads<00:01:36.249> me<00:01:36.429> to<00:01:36.609> believe<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:39.310> an<00:01:39.490> NPC<00:01:40.270> plugin

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
leads me to believe it's an NPC plugin

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.999 
leads me to believe it's an NPC plugin
now<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.990> want<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.289> burst<00:01:44.499> anyone's

closest<00:02:02.740> thing<00:02:02.859> that<00:02:02.920> I've<00:02:03.130> got<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.700> using

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
closest thing that I've got to using

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.149 
closest thing that I've got to using
that<00:02:04.179> is<00:02:04.420> like<00:02:04.600> adding<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:05.020> mob<00:02:05.289> which<00:02:05.799> is<00:02:05.979> like

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.210 
the more creatures stuff um so you know
that<00:02:12.760> leaves<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:14.590> what<00:02:14.890> else<00:02:15.040> is

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
that leaves it to what what else is

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.770 
that leaves it to what what else is
