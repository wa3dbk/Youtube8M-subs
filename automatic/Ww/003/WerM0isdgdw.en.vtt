00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
wrong with it the only suggestion I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.310 
wrong with it the only suggestion I
would<00:00:32.820> make<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.540> break<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.230> little

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
would make is to break it up a little

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
would make is to break it up a little
bit<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.460> chop<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.239> into<00:00:36.420> pieces

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
bit so if you can chop it up into pieces

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.060 
bit so if you can chop it up into pieces
that'll<00:00:37.170> help<00:00:37.320> because<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:39.540> skins<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.320> tend

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
that'll help because the skins can tend

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.430 
that'll help because the skins can tend
to<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> bit<00:00:41.430> stubborn<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.170> still

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to be a bit stubborn but it's still

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
to be a bit stubborn but it's still
again<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.010> nothing<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.610> paranoid<00:00:45.000> about

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
and full of nitrogen I'm gonna need to

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.440 
and full of nitrogen I'm gonna need to
add<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.500> ton<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:16.140> dry<00:02:17.140> stuff<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.370> it's<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.240> time

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
add a ton of dry stuff so it's that time

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.180 
add a ton of dry stuff so it's that time
of<00:02:19.480> year<00:02:19.630> where<00:02:20.020> we're<00:02:20.170> getting<00:02:20.290> tons<00:02:20.980> and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
of year where we're getting tons and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.820 
of year where we're getting tons and
tons<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.459> leaves<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.540> let<00:02:23.260> me<00:02:23.380> show<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.620> what

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
tons of leaves so let me show you what

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.650 
tons of leaves so let me show you what
I'm<00:02:23.920> gonna<00:02:24.040> do<00:02:24.310> with<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.670> leaves<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.209> because

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
I'm gonna do with the leaves now because

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.750 
I'm gonna do with the leaves now because
there<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.020> definitely<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.500> way<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.740> put<00:02:27.610> them

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
there is definitely a way to put them

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.930 
there is definitely a way to put them
into<00:02:27.940> your<00:02:28.180> compost<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:29.050> they<00:02:29.500> don't<00:02:29.910> cause<00:02:30.910> a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
into your compost so they don't cause a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.570 
into your compost so they don't cause a
lot<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.330> clumping<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.230> speak<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:33.340> guessed

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
lot of clumping so to speak you guessed

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.940 
lot of clumping so to speak you guessed
it<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:33.940> shred<00:02:34.209> them<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.989> let's<00:02:35.410> do<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.620> all

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
it we shred them so let's do that all

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.670 
it we shred them so let's do that all
right<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:36.819> as<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.150> saw<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.870> have<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> ton<00:02:38.650> of

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
right so as you just saw I have a ton of

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.440 
right so as you just saw I have a ton of
fruit<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.190> vegetable<00:02:39.610> waste<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:40.030> deal<00:02:40.239> with

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
fruit and vegetable waste to deal with

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.020 
fruit and vegetable waste to deal with
so<00:02:40.989> because<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.160> such<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.459> large<00:02:42.700> quantity

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
so because I have such a large quantity

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.390 
so because I have such a large quantity
obviously<00:02:43.989> now<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.440> have<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.800> add<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.920> lot<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.220> dry

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400

like<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:44.079> gonna<00:03:44.170> get<00:03:44.350> really

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
like this it's just gonna get really

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.910 
like this it's just gonna get really
clumpy<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.329> as<00:03:46.329> their<00:03:46.510> result<00:03:46.840> you're<00:03:47.799> just

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
clumpy and as their result you're just

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.470 
clumpy and as their result you're just
gonna<00:03:48.040> have<00:03:48.190> crappy<00:03:48.430> compost<00:03:48.970> it'll<00:03:49.299> take<00:03:49.450> a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
gonna have crappy compost it'll take a

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.319 
gonna have crappy compost it'll take a
lot<00:03:49.690> longer<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.079> break<00:03:50.320> down<00:03:50.910> but<00:03:51.910> also<00:03:52.180> keep

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
lot longer to break down but also keep

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.849 
lot longer to break down but also keep
in<00:03:52.480> mind<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.810> don't<00:03:52.989> want<00:03:53.140> your<00:03:53.260> leaves<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.650> be

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
in mind you don't want your leaves to be

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.460 
in mind you don't want your leaves to be
turned<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.220> dust<00:03:54.400> because<00:03:55.000> then<00:03:55.239> that's<00:03:55.750> not

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
turned to dust because then that's not

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.800 
turned to dust because then that's not
letting<00:03:56.829> as<00:03:56.920> much<00:03:57.130> oxygen<00:03:57.310> into<00:03:58.060> your<00:03:58.090> overall

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
letting as much oxygen into your overall

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.630 
letting as much oxygen into your overall
pile<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.269> somewhere<00:04:01.269> in<00:04:01.329> between<00:04:01.420> but<00:04:02.430> yeah<00:04:03.430> so

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
pile so somewhere in between but yeah so

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.550 
pile so somewhere in between but yeah so
you<00:04:03.730> just<00:04:03.850> want<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.060> go<00:04:04.209> through<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.870> beat<00:04:05.410> up

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
you just want to go through and beat up

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.500
