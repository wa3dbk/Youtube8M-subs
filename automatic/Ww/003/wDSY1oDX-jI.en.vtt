ladder systems here that you can get i

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.600 
ladder systems here that you can get i
mean<00:01:44.490> there's<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.680> there<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.860> you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
know different systems that hold

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.950 
know different systems that hold
different<00:01:49.649> weight<00:01:49.950> basically<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.689> think

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
different weight basically from I think

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.109 
different weight basically from I think
it's<00:01:52.049> 250<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:54.890> 375<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.189> think<00:01:56.729> I'm<00:01:56.909> not

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
it's 250 up to 375 I think I'm not

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
it's 250 up to 375 I think I'm not
positive<00:01:57.479> about<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.259> might<00:01:58.439> want<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
positive about that you might want to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.569 
positive about that you might want to
check<00:01:58.920> oh<00:02:00.200> by<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.380> before<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> get<00:02:02.430> into

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
check oh by the way before I get into

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.389 
check oh by the way before I get into
this<00:02:03.210> other<00:02:03.930> stuff<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.409> you're<00:02:04.920> watching<00:02:05.100> this

here view demonstration and watch

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.050 
here view demonstration and watch
infomercial<00:03:42.829> so<00:03:43.829> that<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.070> can<00:03:44.250> see<00:03:44.609> really

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.500 
how these things work and I think that
you<00:03:47.100> know<00:03:47.190> once<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.609> see<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.850> it's<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.299> one

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
you know once you see it it's like one

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.789 
you know once you see it it's like one
of<00:03:48.540> those<00:03:48.630> things<00:03:48.959> where<00:03:49.170> something<00:03:49.709> you're

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
of those things where something you're

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.650 
of those things where something you're
like<00:03:49.920> well<00:03:50.609> so<00:03:50.760> what<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.060> just<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.299> ladder<00:03:51.510> and

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
like well so what it's just a ladder and

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.569 
like well so what it's just a ladder and
then<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.320> know<00:03:52.410> they<00:03:52.590> show<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:52.920> what<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.340> does

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
then you know they show you what it does

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.710 
then you know they show you what it does
and<00:03:54.200> you're<00:03:55.200> just<00:03:55.320> like<00:03:55.470> okay<00:03:55.739> now<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.190> get<00:03:56.370> it

let's<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.870> take<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.109> look<00:04:16.410> at<00:04:16.700> at<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:18.090> one

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
let's just take a look at at this one

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.430 
let's just take a look at at this one
and<00:04:18.450> let's<00:04:18.600> see<00:04:18.750> hope<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.019> doesn't<00:04:19.260> take<00:04:19.380> too

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
and let's see hope it doesn't take too

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.440 
and let's see hope it doesn't take too
long<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.769> play

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.940 

yeah<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:26.660> I'm<00:04:26.750> going<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:26.960> just<00:04:27.170> talk<00:04:27.530> over<00:04:27.830> this

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
yeah so I'm going to just talk over this

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
for a second but you can see it

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.750 
for a second but you can see it
basically<00:04:29.420> you<00:04:29.750> know<00:04:29.840> shows<00:04:30.170> you<00:04:30.500> all<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.310> the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
you just like you take it apart and it

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.850 
you just like you take it apart and it
becomes<00:04:42.880> scaffolding<00:04:43.880> which<00:04:44.180> is<00:04:44.360> really<00:04:44.570> nice
