think that that's a ripoff to people
right<00:03:38.550> so<00:03:39.740> when<00:03:40.740> it<00:03:40.830> comes<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.100> photographs

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
right so when it comes to photographs

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.220 
right so when it comes to photographs
you<00:03:42.090> should<00:03:42.300> do<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.540> when<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.930> comes<00:03:43.110> to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
you should do that when it comes to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.930 
you should do that when it comes to
instructional<00:03:43.740> videos<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.430> should<00:03:44.610> not<00:03:44.730> do

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
instructional videos you should not do

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.050 
instructional videos you should not do
that<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.290> I'll<00:03:46.590> just<00:03:46.620> work<00:03:46.890> around<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.310> back

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
that so I'll just work around the back

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.600 
that so I'll just work around the back
of<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.720> head<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.530> exact<00:03:49.920> same<00:03:50.130> way<00:03:50.310> i<00:03:50.340> have

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
of the head the exact same way i have

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.250 
of the head the exact same way i have
just<00:03:51.510> scooping<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.320> hair<00:03:52.700> working<00:03:53.700> up<00:03:54.260> and

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
just scooping the hair working up and

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.890 
just scooping the hair working up and
taper<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.800> out<00:03:56.180> now<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.240> can<00:03:57.450> really<00:03:57.630> see

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
taper that out now you can really see

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.050 
taper that out now you can really see
right<00:03:58.110> here<00:03:58.290> how<00:03:58.620> heavy<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.070> weight<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.640> okay

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
right here how heavy that weight is okay

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.940 
right here how heavy that weight is okay
so<00:04:00.630> it's<00:04:00.750> going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.959> start<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.470> disappear

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
so it's going to start to disappear

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
so it's going to start to disappear
right<00:04:02.100> now<00:04:02.280> with<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.520> Clippers<00:04:04.730> really<00:04:05.730> heavy

okay sometimes it's hard to get the foam
in<00:05:22.760> there<00:05:22.910> straight<00:05:23.180> up<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.450> down

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.600 

over<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.200> side<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.770> you<00:05:32.160> see<00:05:32.340> on<00:05:32.430> the

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
over to the side and you see on the

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.130 
over to the side and you see on the
sides<00:05:32.880> of<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.180> head<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.510> hair<00:05:33.660> grows<00:05:33.780> lighter

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
sides of the head the hair grows lighter

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.440 
sides of the head the hair grows lighter
so<00:05:34.770> it's<00:05:34.890> going<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.100> take<00:05:35.310> for<00:05:35.490> easier<00:05:35.880> and

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
so it's going to take for easier and
