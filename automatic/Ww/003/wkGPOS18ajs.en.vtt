that<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:27.960> he<00:01:28.140> finishes<00:01:28.259> me<00:01:28.619> off<00:01:28.650> with

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that and then he finishes me off with

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:29.870 
that and then he finishes me off with
dark<00:01:29.040> pulse<00:01:29.220> because<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> thought<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.729> would

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
dark pulse because I thought you would

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
dark pulse because I thought you would
want<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.420> Dark<00:01:30.630> Void<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.170> yeah

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
be too scared because well obviously I'm

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.590 
be too scared because well obviously I'm
a<00:02:02.250> multi-scale<00:02:02.729> range<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.270> he<00:02:03.360> shows<00:02:03.570> me

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
a multi-scale range but then he shows me

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.960 
a multi-scale range but then he shows me
the<00:02:03.840> sword<00:02:04.020> sense<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.560> groudon<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.729> became

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
the sword sense and groudon just became

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.340 
the sword sense and groudon just became
a<00:02:06.000> big<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.360> threat<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> reason<00:02:06.930> why<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> went

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
a big a threat now the reason why I went

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.169 
a big a threat now the reason why I went
for<00:02:07.530> ruse<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.429> wanted<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.819> see<00:02:09.000> how

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
for ruse was because I wanted to see how

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.880 
for ruse was because I wanted to see how
much<00:02:09.360> damage<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.840> plus<00:02:10.080> two<00:02:10.229> stoners<00:02:10.500> we<00:02:10.770> do

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
much damage it plus two stoners we do

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.500 
much damage it plus two stoners we do
seeing<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.220> i'm<00:02:11.400> still<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.790> multi<00:02:12.090> scale<00:02:12.270> range

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
seeing as i'm still in multi scale range

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.120 
seeing as i'm still in multi scale range
but<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.080> goes<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.290> earthquake<00:02:13.620> i<00:02:13.770> guess<00:02:13.980> maybe

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
but it goes for earthquake i guess maybe

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.350 
but it goes for earthquake i guess maybe
he<00:02:14.310> missed<00:02:14.520> clicked<00:02:14.700> or<00:02:14.790> something<00:02:15.030> not<00:02:15.209> too

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
he missed clicked or something not too

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.870 
he missed clicked or something not too
short<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:16.170> he<00:02:16.319> ends<00:02:16.440> up<00:02:16.560> I'm<00:02:17.040> not<00:02:17.489> sorry<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.760> had

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
short but he ends up I'm not sorry I had

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.309 
short but he ends up I'm not sorry I had
the<00:02:18.000> ball<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.390> they<00:02:18.480> came<00:02:18.630> out<00:02:18.660> into<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.110> me

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
the ball and they came out into the me

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.570 
the ball and they came out into the me
too<00:02:19.530> which<00:02:19.709> is<00:02:19.739> fine<00:02:19.980> by<00:02:20.130> me<00:02:20.250> because<00:02:20.370> I'm

too which is fine by me because I'm

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.949 
too which is fine by me because I'm
still<00:02:20.790> more<00:02:20.970> discovering<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.840> easily

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
still more discovering so I can easily

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.360 
still more discovering so I can easily
just<00:02:22.260> go<00:02:22.410> for<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.590> toxic<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.100> he's<00:02:23.250> actually

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370

going to switch into the luya don't
really<00:02:26.099> know<00:02:26.250> why<00:02:26.489> if<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.819> was<00:02:26.970> him<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.120> would

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
have stayed in and gone for a ice beam

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.620 
have stayed in and gone for a ice beam
to<00:02:29.220> break<00:02:29.400> my<00:02:29.519> multi<00:02:29.850> scale<00:02:30.030> but<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.480> hey

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
to break my multi scale but you know hey

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.780 
to break my multi scale but you know hey
toxic<00:02:31.410> hang<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.650> opposing<00:02:31.890> lugia<00:02:32.310> makes<00:02:32.610> me

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
toxic hang in opposing lugia makes me

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
toxic hang in opposing lugia makes me
happy<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.660> I'm<00:02:34.050> gonna<00:02:34.230> switch<00:02:34.410> out<00:02:34.560> knowing

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
happy so I'm gonna switch out knowing

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.140 
happy so I'm gonna switch out knowing
that<00:02:34.980> he's<00:02:35.130> more<00:02:35.310> likely<00:02:35.519> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.850> go<00:02:36.000> for

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
that he's more likely going to go for

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.580 
that he's more likely going to go for
his<00:02:36.239> own<00:02:36.330> toxic<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.019> need<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.350> even

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
his own toxic and if you need and even

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.750 
his own toxic and if you need and even
if<00:02:37.799> he<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.010> carrying<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.370> substitute

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
if he is carrying the substitute

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.420 
if he is carrying the substitute
eventually<00:02:39.330> he's<00:02:39.810> gonna<00:02:40.019> run<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.440> HP<00:02:40.920> so

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
eventually he's gonna run out of HP so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.759 
eventually he's gonna run out of HP so
I'm<00:02:41.640> switching<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.090> my<00:02:42.480> ferrothorn<00:02:43.470> as<00:02:43.680> he

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
I'm switching to my ferrothorn as he

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.170 
I'm switching to my ferrothorn as he
does<00:02:43.920> go<00:02:44.069> from<00:02:44.220> toxic<00:02:44.549> when<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.700> volunter<00:02:45.060> and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
does go from toxic when the volunter and

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.610 
does go from toxic when the volunter and
I<00:02:45.239> can<00:02:45.360> either<00:02:45.480> go<00:02:45.660> for<00:02:45.690> allure<00:02:46.049> spike<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.560> I

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
I can either go for allure spike so I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.620 
I can either go for allure spike so I
can<00:02:46.739> go<00:02:46.830> for<00:02:47.010> leech<00:02:47.130> seed<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.489> really<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.600> just

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
can go for leech seed and really I just

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.180 
can go for leech seed and really I just
want<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.110> get<00:02:49.230> rid<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.590> lugia<00:02:49.890> because<00:02:50.160> I

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
want to get rid of this lugia because I

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.800 
want to get rid of this lugia because I
know<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.580> might<00:02:50.819> prove<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.299> be<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.450> bit<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
know it might prove to be a bit of a

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.059 
know it might prove to be a bit of a
nuisance<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.230> I'm<00:02:52.319> actually<00:02:52.440> going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.799> go<00:02:52.830> for

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
nuisance so I'm actually going to go for

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.920 
nuisance so I'm actually going to go for
leech<00:02:53.220> seed<00:02:53.400> I'm<00:02:53.640> hindsight<00:02:54.299> looking<00:02:54.330> back<00:02:54.780> in

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
leech seed I'm hindsight looking back in

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.059 
leech seed I'm hindsight looking back in
the<00:02:55.019> battle<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.290> should<00:02:55.530> have<00:02:55.650> gone<00:02:55.799> for<00:02:56.010> a

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
the battle I should have gone for a

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.289 
the battle I should have gone for a
little<00:02:56.220> spike<00:02:56.580> because<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:57.030> would<00:02:57.180> have

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
little spike because that would have

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.900 
little spike because that would have
benefited<00:02:57.750> me<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> bit<00:02:58.620> more<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:59.160> battle<00:02:59.670> as

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
benefited me a bit more in battle as

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.000 
benefited me a bit more in battle as
you'll<00:03:00.209> see<00:03:00.330> later<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.170> he<00:03:01.560> does<00:03:01.739> turn<00:03:01.980> out

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
you'll see later on so he does turn out

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.349 
you'll see later on so he does turn out
to<00:03:02.160> have<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.400> dragon<00:03:02.700> tail<00:03:02.850> which<00:03:03.000> means<00:03:03.180> he's

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
to have the dragon tail which means he's

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.319 
to have the dragon tail which means he's
just<00:03:03.570> toxic<00:03:03.810> roost<00:03:04.260> dragon<00:03:04.980> tail<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.489> reflect

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
just toxic roost dragon tail and reflect

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.970 
just toxic roost dragon tail and reflect
their<00:03:06.450> substitute<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.019> as<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.560> said<00:03:07.620> even<00:03:07.829> if

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
their substitute and as I said even if

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.259 
their substitute and as I said even if
he<00:03:08.100> was<00:03:08.220> carrying<00:03:08.430> substitute<00:03:08.850> eventually

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
he was carrying substitute eventually

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.449 
he was carrying substitute eventually
he's<00:03:09.420> going<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.630> die<00:03:09.750> from<00:03:10.019> HP<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.980> after<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
he's going to die from HP so after the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.190 
he's going to die from HP so after the
iron<00:03:11.609> bar<00:03:11.910> bleats<00:03:12.239> eat<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.570> talk<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.900> damage

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
iron bar bleats eat and talk to damage

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.420 
iron bar bleats eat and talk to damage
all<00:03:13.410> racking<00:03:13.769> up<00:03:13.829> on<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.160> thing<00:03:14.340> is

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
all racking up on it this thing is

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.770 
all racking up on it this thing is
practically<00:03:14.820> dead<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.269> know<00:03:15.390> he's<00:03:15.600> more

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
practically dead so I know he's more

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.449 
practically dead so I know he's more
likely<00:03:15.989> not<00:03:16.260> going<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.440> want<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.650> save<00:03:16.829> it<00:03:16.950> so

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
likely not going to want to save it so

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.590 
likely not going to want to save it so
I'm<00:03:17.549> predicting<00:03:17.970> him<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.209> go<00:03:18.299> for<00:03:18.450> an<00:03:18.540> ice

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
I'm predicting him to go for an ice

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.910 
I'm predicting him to go for an ice
cream<00:03:18.810> or<00:03:18.870> go<00:03:19.049> for<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.260> toxic<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:19.709> I'm<00:03:19.769> just

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
cream or go for the toxic so I'm just

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.840 
cream or go for the toxic so I'm just
going<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.100> switch<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.400> back<00:03:20.489> out<00:03:20.640> some

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
going to switch it back out some

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.400 
going to switch it back out some
ferrothorn<00:03:21.269> but<00:03:21.840> he<00:03:21.989> turns<00:03:22.170> out<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.320> have

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
ferrothorn but he turns out to have

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.020 
ferrothorn but he turns out to have
reflect<00:03:22.829> as<00:03:22.980> opposed<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.400> having<00:03:23.549> substitute

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
reflect as opposed to having substitute

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.240 
reflect as opposed to having substitute
now<00:03:24.450> really<00:03:24.870> reflect<00:03:25.500> doesn't<00:03:25.890> matter<00:03:26.040> what

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
now really reflect doesn't matter what

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.740 
now really reflect doesn't matter what
so<00:03:26.400> ever<00:03:26.430> considered<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.209> only<00:03:27.420> real

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
so ever considered that the only real

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.090 
so ever considered that the only real
offensive<00:03:27.989> hitter<00:03:28.230> on<00:03:28.440> my<00:03:28.590> team<00:03:28.829> was

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
offensive hitter on my team was

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.430 
offensive hitter on my team was
excadrill<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.090> because<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.600> didn't<00:03:31.260> lose<00:03:31.350> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
excadrill and because I didn't lose the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.810 
excadrill and because I didn't lose the
weather<00:03:31.620> why<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.799> really<00:03:32.310> won't<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.640> much

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
weather why I really won't have much

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.550 
weather why I really won't have much
purpose<00:03:33.180> for<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.359> so<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.900> don't<00:03:34.230> really<00:03:34.350> care

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
purpose for it so I don't really care

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.349 
purpose for it so I don't really care
about<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.829> reflect<00:03:35.130> anyways<00:03:36.060> I'm<00:03:36.209> at<00:03:36.329> a

off chance that it did go for the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.849 
off chance that it did go for the
outrage<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.389> see<00:04:11.689> how<00:04:11.840> much<00:04:11.959> it<00:04:12.109> would<00:04:12.169> do<00:04:12.349> but

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
outrage to see how much it would do but

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.500 
outrage to see how much it would do but
I<00:04:12.919> decide<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.370> bring<00:04:13.519> in<00:04:13.669> my<00:04:13.790> lugia<00:04:14.120> have<00:04:14.359> to

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
I decide to bring in my lugia have to

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.960 
I decide to bring in my lugia have to
kill<00:04:14.780> kills<00:04:15.319> off<00:04:15.469> my<00:04:15.680> latios<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.099> I<00:04:16.820> will

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
kill kills off my latios and I will

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.310 
kill kills off my latios and I will
easily<00:04:17.150> be<00:04:17.329> able<00:04:17.389> to<00:04:17.599> take<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.780> extreme<00:04:18.019> speed

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
easily be able to take the extreme speed

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.870 
easily be able to take the extreme speed
I<00:04:18.380> don't<00:04:18.799> really<00:04:19.009> know<00:04:19.220> why<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.489> were<00:04:19.699> pretty

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
I don't really know why you were pretty

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.570 
I don't really know why you were pretty
extreme<00:04:20.150> speed<00:04:20.389> I<00:04:20.479> mean<00:04:20.660> he's<00:04:20.900> faster<00:04:21.289> than<00:04:21.320> me

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
extreme speed I mean he's faster than me

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.560 
extreme speed I mean he's faster than me
so<00:04:22.580> he<00:04:22.610> should<00:04:22.789> have<00:04:22.880> gone<00:04:22.940> for<00:04:23.060> outrage<00:04:23.360> which

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
so he should have gone for outrage which

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.610 
so he should have gone for outrage which
obviously<00:04:23.870> would<00:04:24.080> have<00:04:24.199> done<00:04:24.320> more<00:04:24.440> damage

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
obviously would have done more damage

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.170 
obviously would have done more damage
but<00:04:25.099> yeah<00:04:25.250> anyway<00:04:25.550> she's<00:04:25.699> gonna<00:04:25.789> bring<00:04:26.000> in<00:04:26.120> the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
but yeah anyway she's gonna bring in the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.420 
but yeah anyway she's gonna bring in the
dog<00:04:26.389> and<00:04:26.599> now<00:04:26.830> because<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:27.860> don't<00:04:27.979> want<00:04:28.099> to<00:04:28.280> stay

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
dog and now because I don't want to stay

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.100 
dog and now because I don't want to stay
in<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:28.699> take<00:04:28.729> a<00:04:28.820> Draco<00:04:29.270> meteor<00:04:29.389> I'm<00:04:29.870> actually

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
in and take a Draco meteor I'm actually

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.450 
in and take a Draco meteor I'm actually
going<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.410> switch<00:04:30.590> out<00:04:30.770> when<00:04:30.949> on<00:04:31.130> hindsight

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
going to switch out when on hindsight

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.650 
going to switch out when on hindsight
maybe<00:04:31.699> I<00:04:31.789> should<00:04:31.940> have<00:04:32.030> stayed<00:04:32.180> in<00:04:32.300> because<00:04:32.539> if

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
maybe I should have stayed in because if

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.420 
maybe I should have stayed in because if
he<00:04:32.750> had<00:04:32.960> gone<00:04:33.110> for<00:04:33.289> the<00:04:33.349> rocks<00:04:33.560> then<00:04:34.099> I<00:04:34.250> would

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
he had gone for the rocks then I would

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.100 
he had gone for the rocks then I would
have<00:04:34.550> really<00:04:35.060> been<00:04:35.180> risky<00:04:35.479> but<00:04:35.630> he

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
have really been risky but he

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.779 
have really been risky but he
accidentally<00:04:36.590> sing<00:04:36.949> the<00:04:37.070> Draco<00:04:37.370> meteor<00:04:37.520> as

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
rather have stone edge as opposed to

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.899 
rather have stone edge as opposed to
Dragon<00:05:18.440> Claw<00:05:18.620> cuz<00:05:18.889> in<00:05:19.039> situations<00:05:19.610> like<00:05:19.669> this

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
Dragon Claw cuz in situations like this

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.850

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
where I would really come in handy

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.480 
where I would really come in handy
because<00:05:23.659> no<00:05:24.500> one<00:05:24.590> edges<00:05:24.800> obvious<00:05:25.099> to<00:05:25.220> perfect

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
because no one edges obvious to perfect

because no one edges obvious to perfect
them<00:05:25.580> on<00:05:25.699> me<00:05:25.789> even<00:05:25.909> though<00:05:26.060> it's<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:26.270> stabbed

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:07.309 
in luleå and stalk him out a lot easier

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:08.829 
in luleå and stalk him out a lot easier
with<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:07.669> toxic<00:06:08.089> be<00:06:08.240> able<00:06:08.360> to<00:06:08.449> finish<00:06:08.569> him<00:06:08.749> off

with the toxic be able to finish him off

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.839 
with the toxic be able to finish him off
but<00:06:09.080> it<00:06:09.379> turns<00:06:09.620> out<00:06:09.770> I<00:06:09.830> out<00:06:10.069> speed<00:06:10.430> him<00:06:10.610> so<00:06:10.819> I

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
but it turns out I out speed him so I

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.969 
but it turns out I out speed him so I
guess<00:06:11.089> he's<00:06:11.240> running<00:06:11.449> a<00:06:11.539> very<00:06:11.900> very<00:06:12.349> bulky

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979
