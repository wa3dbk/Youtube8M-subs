00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
this is just as I got it and we'll see

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.700 
this is just as I got it and we'll see
how<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.300> holds<00:04:44.570> up<00:04:44.660> over<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.020> years<00:04:45.200> I'll<00:04:45.650> be

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
how it holds up over the years I'll be

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.290 
how it holds up over the years I'll be
using<00:04:45.919> it<00:04:46.190> quite<00:04:46.220> a<00:04:46.430> bit<00:04:46.490> this<00:04:46.760> coming<00:04:47.060> summer

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
using it quite a bit this coming summer

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.740 
using it quite a bit this coming summer
so<00:04:48.550> we'll<00:04:49.550> see<00:04:49.760> how<00:04:49.910> it<00:04:50.000> does<00:04:50.120> I<00:04:50.389> think<00:04:50.600> it's

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
so we'll see how it does I think it's

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.350
