minutes to thirty seconds in we do the
bridge<00:03:55.310> I'd<00:03:56.310> give<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.519> different<00:03:56.819> version<00:03:57.000> of

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
bridge I'd give a different version of

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.759 
bridge I'd give a different version of
the<00:03:57.329> bridge<00:03:57.569> I'll<00:03:57.840> show<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.079> what<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.230> do<00:03:58.379> this

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
the bridge I'll show you what I do this

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.839 
the bridge I'll show you what I do this
isn't<00:03:59.069> exactly<00:03:59.129> what<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.579> song<00:03:59.849> does<00:04:00.120> but<00:04:01.849> and

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
isn't exactly what the song does but and

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.369 
isn't exactly what the song does but and
I<00:04:02.970> feel<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:03.269> it<00:04:03.390> makes<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.629> little<00:04:03.780> more<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.140> do

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
I feel like it makes a little more to do

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.500 
I feel like it makes a little more to do
so<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.920> rich

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.290 

after

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:37.460 

so<00:04:15.300> after<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.690> second<00:04:16.050> chorus

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:51.110
