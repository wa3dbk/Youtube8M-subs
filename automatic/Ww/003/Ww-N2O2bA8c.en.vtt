say<00:03:18.510> Brooklyn<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.079> tunnel<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.799> ripping

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
say Brooklyn is a tunnel it's ripping

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.780 
say Brooklyn is a tunnel it's ripping
the<00:03:20.880> actual<00:03:21.329> muscle<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.810> get<00:03:21.930> bigger<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:23.549> for

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the actual muscle to get bigger that for

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.630 
the actual muscle to get bigger that for
open<00:03:24.030> does<00:03:24.560> poking<00:03:26.420> puts<00:03:27.420> on<00:03:28.019> muscle<00:03:28.980> mass<00:03:29.250> and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
open does poking puts on muscle mass and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.780 
open does poking puts on muscle mass and
size<00:03:30.420> for<00:03:31.260> your<00:03:31.440> muscles<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.400> you'll<00:03:32.579> get

Bob now the next one is ripping ripping

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.180 
Bob now the next one is ripping ripping
is<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:42.000> same<00:03:42.299> exercises<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.680> lived<00:03:44.010> in

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
is the same exercises but lived in

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.670 
is the same exercises but lived in
different<00:03:44.489> ways<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.359> doing<00:03:45.900> different

repetitions<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.970> living<00:03:48.690> exercise<00:03:49.200> will<00:03:49.620> be

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
repetitions a living exercise will be

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.309 
repetitions a living exercise will be
like<00:03:49.980> twenty<00:03:50.730> ones<00:03:50.970> while<00:03:51.660> kernel<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.140> one

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
like twenty ones while kernel and one

look<00:03:53.970> at<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.210> video<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.660> can<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:56.790> would

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
look at that video you can you would

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.809 
look at that video you can you would
just<00:03:58.680> rather<00:03:59.060> a<00:04:00.060> low<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.230> medium<00:04:01.440> weight<00:04:01.819> but

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
just rather a low to medium weight but

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.550 
just rather a low to medium weight but
you<00:04:03.270> want<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.510> do<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.690> lot<00:04:04.080> of<00:04:04.410> repetitions<00:04:05.270> so

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
you want to do a lot of repetitions so

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.900 
you want to do a lot of repetitions so
under<00:04:07.560> 20<00:04:07.890> months<00:04:08.280> are<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.970> seven<00:04:10.100> in<00:04:11.100> one<00:04:11.250> set

under 20 months are the seven in one set

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.800 
under 20 months are the seven in one set
seven<00:04:12.720> today<00:04:13.380> then<00:04:14.250> above<00:04:14.640> seven<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.600> there

wings one repetitions now normally you
just<00:04:24.360> get<00:04:25.790> you<00:04:26.790> could<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.150> get<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.720> dumbbell

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
just get you could just get a dumbbell

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.510 
just get you could just get a dumbbell
now<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.160> can<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:31.580> forget<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:33.890> ribbon<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:35.160> mean

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
now you can just forget to ribbon I mean

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.440 
now you can just forget to ribbon I mean
in<00:04:35.730> this<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:37.130> anyway<00:04:38.130> it's<00:04:38.310> not<00:04:38.520> good<00:04:38.940> night

so<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.750> wanted<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.140> bit<00:04:40.290> like<00:04:40.530> Ida<00:04:40.770> back<00:04:41.040> both<00:04:41.370> of

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
so I wanted a bit like Ida back both of

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.980 
so I wanted a bit like Ida back both of
them<00:04:41.760> but<00:04:42.300> literally<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.990> would<00:04:43.200> do<00:04:43.940> one<00:04:45.890> to
