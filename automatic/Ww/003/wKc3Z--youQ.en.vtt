00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.470

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.750

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.000

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.650

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.770

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.770
 hands 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.769
 5 let's look at the nightstand of all their time at the very 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.700
 business 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:55.970
 and also by becoming a clown like 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:59.870
 dolls, yes, too, that the dolls themselves 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:04.760
 Okay, let's go look for another 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.400
 of course I will help open the door what rino 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.850
 prime 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.850
 give me an enemy 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:29.250
 6 half cuts of finishing 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:34.530
 difficult to turn a pass 25 sound of blows 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:38.090
 of course great great great and 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:48.269
 wonderful hand if concentration 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:53.640
 find the enemy and concentrating a scarf yes 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:55.819
 the blow is just that it's buried no 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.230
 opportunities to look at some 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.319
 60 well yes of course with such guys 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.739
 he just copes 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:15.569
 but the sight is great so one hit so 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:22.260
 so then some bunny got it 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:23.039
 stern hare caught where else are the enemies 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.410
 are hiding 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.410
 with us 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:49.180

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.350
 cleavers 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.169
 I remember when there were no updates yet 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.449
 This is sweeter than 20 I just bought them 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.190
 pumped and sold because of them 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.910
 nothing could be done 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.250
 acceptable with such press leaves 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:17.020
 have seen kills pretty well 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:20.010
 what to say of course would have gone over though 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:28.240
 no that's worth crit chance crit crit damage 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:31.570
