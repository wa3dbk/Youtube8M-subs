00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.100
 hameln-pyrmont Hameln and Hess July pass on a second channel 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.380
 Dogs dedicated to styling 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.070
 i am health wise i am an all around Walter i am today and i have shown 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.030
 a new hairstyle 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.470
 "She wrote at the beginning of September you do not see them 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.239
 really like that 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.079
 they are split up in Patagonia, something different, too 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.070
 to bring in a bit more liveliness when Hamas is there and percent he has 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.929
 but do not talk "because they have simply expanded even more alive 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:37.590
 structure 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.460
 and lessened interest 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.480
 I know from Titi already very many annual production at least 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.430
 6 7 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.010
 Oh yes already 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.100
 and that is the writing of the lawyers of Elsner 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 he flips through "my son" 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.280
 yes that's the plans of Chi Chi Le other things that shake it up meant 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.610
 he was sitting in Krems is a mix of wax and here I would say it is 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.300
 a paste that fit around picture is 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.120
 Sky blue 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.460
 and smells of coconut 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.490
 the positive thing about this class is 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.520
 "That's right here 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.400
 that you have that is malleable again that means you can always 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.430
 Diffuser refresh your knowledge and just change a bit if 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.500
 be on the road then have a look 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.610
 the MQ of it for example i would like something to have sunflowers anyway 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 so to say 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.450
 that is really good 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.120
 really nice creamy 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.380
 you do not need much of it 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.460
 but that is the small size, there is still one size bigger 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.790
 still big pot 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.790
 and he has it here 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.560
 30 milliliters and sometimes my hair somewhere around his products 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.570
 be pick 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.170
 the Holy Land Hesse goes through the hair 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.799
 two people she wants when you see how it looks but with hairspray worry that 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.720
 for example 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.440
 and Dr 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.709
 it's about time so the product will fall I like it very much 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.819
 what should have been chosen by the court 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.850
 Bernadette Mennel Bremerhaven are then we are sad 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.730
 um and maybe he has some really good styling tips with his cell phone 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.410
 polenta 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.800
 I would be glad if he arrives they have to return their big brother 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.019
 do not even turn that on 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.189
