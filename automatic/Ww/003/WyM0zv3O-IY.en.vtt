on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> ground<00:00:54.170> which<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.199> pretty<00:00:55.590> stupid

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
on the ground which is pretty stupid

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
on the ground which is pretty stupid
seal<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> thought<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.300> mod<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.690> gonna

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
seal what I thought this mod was gonna

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.590 
seal what I thought this mod was gonna
be<00:00:58.020> was<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.820> do<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.449> get

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
be was like you can do this you get

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.110 
be was like you can do this you get
their<00:01:00.780> effects<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.699> didn't

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
their effects you like this and I didn't

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.429 
their effects you like this and I didn't
use<00:01:03.210> mod<00:01:03.420> loader<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:03.809> nothing<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
use mod loader or nothing like that so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.100 
use mod loader or nothing like that so
maybe<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:04.769> why<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.189> can't<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.540> he

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
maybe that's why you can't do it but he

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.230 
maybe that's why you can't do it but he
said<00:01:07.439> don't<00:01:07.710> use<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.340> see<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.760> was<00:01:09.150> hoping

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
said don't use it so see I was hoping

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.690 
said don't use it so see I was hoping
like<00:01:09.540> there<00:01:09.720> would<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.840> snow<00:01:10.220> let<00:01:11.220> down<00:01:11.430> from

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
like there would be snow let down from

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460 
like there would be snow let down from
like<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.030> guy<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.720> left<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.229> from

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
like this guy or like left there from

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740 
like this guy or like left there from
when<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> walk<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:13.950> him<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.750> there's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
when you walk with him and there's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
when you walk with him and there's
nothing<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.470> know<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.710> mean<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.430> was

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
nothing you know what I mean so that was

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.240 
nothing you know what I mean so that was
kind<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.840> letdown<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.680> let's<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.159> what

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
kind of a letdown but let's see what

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.810 
kind of a letdown but let's see what
else<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.549> recorded<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> guys<00:01:22.820> alright

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
else I recorded for you guys alright

else I recorded for you guys alright
going<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> I'd<00:01:24.990> made<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.470> like

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
going from that I'd made this like

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.859 
going from that I'd made this like
little<00:01:25.799> tested<00:01:26.280> marina<00:01:26.570> well<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.689> really

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
little tested marina well not really

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.999 
little tested marina well not really
arena<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.409> little<00:01:28.619> kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> like

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
arena like this little kind of like

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.940 
arena like this little kind of like
pipeline<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.090> when<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> transform<00:01:31.200> into<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.560> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
pipeline so when I transform into this I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
pipeline so when I transform into this I
wanted<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.000> how<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.689> would<00:01:33.810> look<00:01:34.020> when<00:01:34.170> I'm

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
wanted to see how it would look when I'm

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.810 
wanted to see how it would look when I'm
going<00:01:34.530> down<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.890> first<00:01:35.070> person<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.700> see

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
going down there in first person and see

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.069 
going down there in first person and see
if<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.090> work<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> didn't<00:01:37.020> know

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
if I actually work because I didn't know

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.410 
if I actually work because I didn't know
it<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.320> work<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:38.880> I'm

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
it would work so as you can see I'm

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.429 
it would work so as you can see I'm
going<00:01:39.630> through<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.110> actually<00:01:40.229> work

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
going through it and it actually work

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.140 
going through it and it actually work
that's<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> cool<00:01:40.890> thing<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.369> mod<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that's the cool thing about the mod you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.429 
that's the cool thing about the mod you
actually<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.020> tall<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
actually have to be like as tall as the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
actually have to be like as tall as the
blocks<00:01:43.680> you're<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.070> still<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.579> Steve's

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
blocks you're not still like Steve's

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.630 
blocks you're not still like Steve's
characteristics<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.320> makes<00:01:46.500> sense<00:01:46.740> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
characteristics if that makes sense so

and<00:03:40.340> I'm<00:03:41.340> hitting<00:03:41.670> these<00:03:41.849> blocks<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.420> it's

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
and I'm hitting these blocks and it's

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.740 
and I'm hitting these blocks and it's
actually<00:03:42.840> pretty<00:03:42.989> far<00:03:43.170> distance<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:45.360> that

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
actually pretty far distance so that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.729 
actually pretty far distance so that
actually<00:03:46.110> that's<00:03:46.260> another<00:03:46.470> thing<00:03:46.680> that

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
actually that's another thing that

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.610 
actually that's another thing that
applies<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.280> giant<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:48.480> in<00:03:48.810> this<00:03:49.410> mod<00:03:49.590> I

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
applies to the giant so in this mod I

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.800 
applies to the giant so in this mod I
dread<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.310> 2<00:03:50.610> out<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.819> 10<00:03:51.060> just<00:03:51.630> because

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
dread it like a 2 out of 10 just because

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.600 
dread it like a 2 out of 10 just because
