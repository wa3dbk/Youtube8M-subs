00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.280
 commenting on this new minecraft video 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 It is sometimes a tutorial from a door 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.260
 proximity 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.860
 and it's a part of proximity that is that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.860
 you can see 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.870
 that's a door of proximity it's worth 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.750
 and now that we move away it closes as 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.750
 I do this with the command block 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.390
 very simple system okay I'm not going to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.230
 build here 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.960
 do not see it 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.840
 It is very simple and very simple the truth 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.840
 it impresses and everything is also common 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.840
 as soon as it is what they are is that this 1 2 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.230
 3 4 5 or 6 6 blocks 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.230
 two 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.310
 3 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.880
 4 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.310
 5 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.550
 and 6 vale 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.409
 let's see 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.300
 ok here we have to do 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.060
 2. 3 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.060
 two 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.359
 I have done something wrong I do not know what 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.359
 are 4 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.070
 4 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.380
 A) Yes 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.190
 1 2 3 4 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.180
 for example I'm giving myself a little bit with 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.180
 what of such but 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.459
 steak and pistons 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.460
 and a little bit of this is very simple 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.330
 first you have to make a door like that 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.330
 with pistons 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.150
 very simple 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.020
 and so 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.860
 this then hide it is simple ok no 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.900
 so do not eat your head too much 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.900
 you do not have to do this and put here 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.020
 do not 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.190
 This is where the video with a tick better if not 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.790
 it's with a tic not going 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.380
 and put this on all this like this 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.620
 OK 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.299
 and is that I did this one floor above 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.299
 it's my fault but 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.020
 you can hide in many ways I 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.990
 I looked for this because it is the least we 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.740
 hindered and the simplest so it's 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.740
 very easy 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.650
 does not occupy too much is quite compact 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.770
 what you have to do is know 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.050
 I have done it because it is 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.050
 my way but good 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.840
 quick and easy for the whole family 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.870
 a little more than if it does not increase the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.730
 system guys because I do it at 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.250
 long to do it all step by step 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.610
 Okay, it's okay, we take two hoppers 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.220
 OK 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.770
 you have to place one looking like that and now 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.920
 other 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.640
 with this we make a loop 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.610
 and here you have to put a comparator then 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:10.670
 of the comparator comes the block of 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:13.849
 command with the command test ford p 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.700
 we open the bracket and we put earl 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:20.060
 same and the radius that we want for 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.150
 example I want radio 15 that is with the 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.330
 that I have the other block can be 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.730
 increase the radius the r are the number of 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.240
 blocks that around this in which 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.030
 it is located vale 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.660
 so it goes 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.690
 that's what then peter to amplify the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.690
 signal 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.950
 one of the rest a block to change the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.950
 signal 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.909
 and text so what we do is that the 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:54.909
 door is closed 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.560
 and now here for this to work there are 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:06.490
 to put an object 1 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.110
 so the signal looks 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.610
 very good now every time we 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.820
 let's get closer 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.850
 to 15 blocks will open 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.220
 is useful for adventure maps already 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.320
 I say 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.390
 I think I'll use it 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.780
 of the adventure maps created but it 's 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.820
 a very useful command so good like 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.430
 if you have liked to subscribe for more and 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.430
 says that always motivates goodbye
