00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
between the four new heroes and you'll

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.469 
between the four new heroes and you'll
begin<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> unravel<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.280> mystery<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.270> hot

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
begin to unravel the mystery the hot

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.410 
begin to unravel the mystery the hot
behind<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.320> zombie<00:01:16.710> takeover<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> um<00:01:20.390> what<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
behind the zombie takeover so um what I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.749 
behind the zombie takeover so um what I
thought<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.680> basically<00:01:25.759> read

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
thought of this is that I basically read

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.789 
thought of this is that I basically read
it<00:01:26.880> sentence<00:01:27.299> by<00:01:27.509> sentence<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.400> I<00:01:29.400> thought

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
it sentence by sentence and I thought

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.609 
it sentence by sentence and I thought
when<00:01:31.799> he<00:01:31.829> said<00:01:32.689> death<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> most<00:01:34.229> common

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
when he said death is the most common

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
when he said death is the most common
ending<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.460> necessarily<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.329> only

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
ending but not necessarily the only

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.940 
ending but not necessarily the only
ending<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.650> made<00:01:37.860> me<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:40.320> started

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
ending this made me think and I started

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.899 
ending this made me think and I started
to<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.100> when<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:42.060> i<00:01:42.270> ever<00:01:43.369> played<00:01:44.369> zombies

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
to think when have i ever played zombies

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.550 
to think when have i ever played zombies
or<00:01:45.030> seen<00:01:45.270> zombies<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:45.899> there's<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.259> an

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
or seen zombies when there's not an

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.300 
or seen zombies when there's not an
ending<00:01:47.189> either<00:01:47.460> where<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.540> die<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.710> end

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
ending either where you die or you end

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.230 
ending either where you die or you end
the<00:01:50.460> game<00:01:50.610> yourself<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.590> i<00:01:52.590> thought<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.250> if

certain steps I don't really recall what
you<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.910> do<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.390> could<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.319> sort<00:02:25.620> of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
you have to do but it could be sort of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.410 
you have to do but it could be sort of
like<00:02:25.830> an<00:02:26.010> easter<00:02:26.370> egg<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.790> I'm<00:02:26.910> thinking

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
like an easter egg what I'm thinking

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.370 
like an easter egg what I'm thinking
like<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.200> black<00:02:28.410> ops<00:02:28.650> 2<00:02:28.800> um<00:02:29.870> what<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> thought<00:02:31.140> is

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
like in black ops 2 um what I thought is

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.220 
like in black ops 2 um what I thought is
that<00:02:31.410> there<00:02:32.069> might<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.400> an<00:02:32.700> actual<00:02:33.180> way<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.630> be

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that there might be an actual way to be

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.710 
that there might be an actual way to be
zombies<00:02:34.920> or<00:02:35.130> actually<00:02:35.610> win<00:02:35.850> against<00:02:36.270> zombies

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
zombies or actually win against zombies

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.430 
zombies or actually win against zombies
now<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.980> don't<00:02:38.280> know<00:02:38.520> if<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.790> was<00:02:39.440> completing

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
now I don't know if this was completing

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.490 
now I don't know if this was completing
the<00:02:40.560> easter<00:02:41.010> egg<00:02:41.130> or<00:02:41.790> doing<00:02:42.360> what<00:02:42.600> I'm<00:02:42.870> not

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the easter egg or doing what I'm not

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.160 
the easter egg or doing what I'm not
exactly<00:02:43.860> sure<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:45.660> an<00:02:46.019> idea

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
exactly sure but this is just an idea

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.350 
exactly sure but this is just an idea
i'm<00:02:46.470> throwing<00:02:46.860> out<00:02:47.040> there<00:02:47.280> again<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:48.030> not

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
i'm throwing out there again I I do not

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.240 
i'm throwing out there again I I do not
know<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.959> was<00:02:49.080> just<00:02:49.350> what<00:02:49.680> came<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.069> my<00:02:50.220> mind

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
know it was just what came to my mind

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.550 
know it was just what came to my mind
and<00:02:50.819> I<00:02:50.970> thought<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.480> could<00:02:51.750> be<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> possible

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
and I thought this could be a possible

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.900 
and I thought this could be a possible
solution<00:02:53.269> but<00:02:54.269> or<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:55.019> reason<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.640> think

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
solution but or a reason but I think

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.130 
solution but or a reason but I think
that<00:02:58.010> after<00:02:59.010> either<00:03:00.000> completing<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.720> Easter

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
that after either completing the Easter

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.410 
that after either completing the Easter
egg<00:03:01.170> or<00:03:01.590> or<00:03:01.920> doing<00:03:02.459> some<00:03:02.670> steps<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.299> can

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
egg or or doing some steps you can

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.500 
egg or or doing some steps you can
actually<00:03:03.810> win<00:03:04.380> against<00:03:04.799> zombies<00:03:05.280> or<00:03:05.580> be

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
actually win against zombies or be

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.199 
actually win against zombies or be
zombies<00:03:07.080> or<00:03:07.230> whatever<00:03:07.530> because<00:03:08.030> what<00:03:09.030> other

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
zombies or whatever because what other

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.740 
zombies or whatever because what other
way<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.870> there<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.709> end<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.580> game<00:03:11.750> besides

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
way is there to end the game besides

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.789 
way is there to end the game besides
death<00:03:13.350> or<00:03:13.739> ending<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.640> game<00:03:14.670> yourself<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.799> in

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
death or ending the game yourself and in

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.349 
death or ending the game yourself and in
in<00:03:17.130> transit<00:03:17.850> or<00:03:18.570> in<00:03:19.280> zombies<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.519> all<00:03:20.670> black

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
in transit or in zombies and all black

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.319 
in transit or in zombies and all black
ops<00:03:21.660> well<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.170> war<00:03:22.380> they've<00:03:22.680> never<00:03:22.890> had<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.670> way

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
ops well the war they've never had a way

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.470 
ops well the war they've never had a way
you<00:03:24.390> can<00:03:24.780> actually<00:03:25.019> be<00:03:25.470> zombies<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.940> I'm

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
you can actually be zombies so I'm

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.259 
you can actually be zombies so I'm
thinking<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:29.010> really<00:03:29.459> really

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
thinking this is a really really

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.900 
thinking this is a really really
important<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.370> topic<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:33.290> might<00:03:34.290> actually

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
important a topic that might actually

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.500 
important a topic that might actually
might<00:03:35.910> actually<00:03:36.120> be<00:03:36.630> true<00:03:36.959> um<00:03:37.910> I'm<00:03:38.910> hoping<00:03:39.329> it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
might actually be true um I'm hoping it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.270 
might actually be true um I'm hoping it
is<00:03:39.540> because<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:40.320> you<00:03:40.530> can<00:03:40.680> actually<00:03:41.100> be

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
is because if you can actually be

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.000 
is because if you can actually be
zombies<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:42.090> would<00:03:42.299> be<00:03:42.480> I'd<00:03:43.109> be<00:03:43.170> playing<00:03:43.680> to
