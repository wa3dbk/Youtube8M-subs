 internal space such black pr 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.799
 but I model shows the internal 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.159
 planned by character 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.429
 gate garage for two cars here 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.480

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.769
 second floor and accordingly it 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:25.209

 Now let's see all these rooms 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.910

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.049
 this is the way out to the staircase 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.049
 Further 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.080
 staircase staircase to the second floor 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.980
 This is our entrance so here I will do to 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.850
 it was clear this 2 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.380
 this is this code on the plot 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.830
 respectively here under the stairs to the entrance 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.880

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.040
 second floor rooms next 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.270

 such a small bathroom but enough 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.350
 high ceiling and thus the bathroom 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.330
 looks volume 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:03.560
 now the living part is the live part of us 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:06.890
 separate it is considered as for 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.180
 Well, how to use a separate family 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.390
 so for use for example in this 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.630

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.060
 notice the ceiling high beams 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.020
 trusses are all open thereby 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.950
 small space is visually very 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.310
 volume is obtained 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.910
 this gun in the kitchen in the kitchen in the kitchen 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.040

 most in all other rooms 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:22.930
 high ceilings this is a reverse view of 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:26.620
 living room on the example of the opening is the elements 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:30.940
 couch such 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.460
 such space as it turns out 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.390
 total closed this little bedroom is she 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.240

 is right on the shelves in the wall 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.950
 there is a bathroom behind the wall and so here 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:57.080
 worth the installation and here on top of us 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:06:03.280
 the place has a shelf and a large bedroom on us 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:05.849

 let it be a full bedroom 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:30.129
 it turns out that we did 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:32.289
 following and from the standard project 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:35.919
 the garage slightly lifted raised 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:38.349
 literally 80 centimeters roof and so 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.789
 the most we got a full 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:45.210
 by a full-fledged residential light floor so 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:47.979
 such minimal sacrifices we created 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.620
 whole volume space in which 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:54.460
