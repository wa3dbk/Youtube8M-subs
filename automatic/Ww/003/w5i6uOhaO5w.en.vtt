00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.330
 but good to see 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.230
 so they know they're fine 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.910
 then I think it leaves me 1 thing that does not 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.130
 I like that people get away from me 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.740
 well people have a destiny to die 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.740

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.040

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.340
 arc 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.420
 I like the bow because I like jacques 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.189
 because the arches can be allowed 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.590
 do many things like for example 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.689
 trolling hey because he does not let this happen 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.670
 well I wanted to comment guys is 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.320
 this video is a bit informative is a 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.490
 game of informative names since 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.009
 Well, you want to comment 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.630
 many things like which followed as 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.640
 which for example that we have played without 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.289
 modalities to play is to say that 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.269
 before I got up and said look today I'm going 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.180
 to play escapes the beast or sky wars or 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.560
 Hunger games or you the run or gerben 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.090
 but it is that now I no longer 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.100
 there are hard ways for me to 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.480
 like to record have decided montoto 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.980
 as well I'm saying but it's that 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.660
 now I do not have guys it 's news that I 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.880
 Give some advice to some of you so you can see 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.680
 you who are wide or whatever 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.910
 You say examination and in this mode to 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.239
 it's very cool, the one that is going to 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.220
 like 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.330
 I say okay so I'm going to try because my 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.330
 faithful subscriber told me 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.800
 so that's why basically I 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.660
 I'm going to play the areas that arenas 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.020
 I say the modalities with their minerals 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.450
 OK 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.450
 the gamer girl who is going to die to see here 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.650
 according to dyn 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.450
 so I wanted to tell you also that if 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.130
 It's not too much trouble because you do not have 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.350
 afraid to tell me that I did something 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.720
 bad thing or if I jump with the thing or if 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.550
 You see I think you see a chest tell me 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.710
 because when I had big youtuber 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.380
 before when he does not have a channel 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.540
 it bothered me a lot that for example 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.430
 that he did not step on a chest and that I 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.230
 I was watching it plan but hey 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.600
 that is in the chest or telling you 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.280
 that I know you know I see something and he does not 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.990
 see it and youtube 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.720
 that is something that annoyed me very much 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.400
 ok and that's why I think it's necessary that 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.500
 you criticize me not that I 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.390
 you say look dexia is uncle to those who have 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.890
 done a thing of know vale or any 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.700
 thing if you dare if you see that like me 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.350
 he touched a fault committing a stupidity or 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.850
 you see that the gameplay is 16 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.400
 it's already uncle this video I liked it 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.040
 so and so this opinion and I then 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.120
 always respect is more I want 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.460
 criticism to be able to always improve what 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.090
 I said 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.490
 but this then we have five left 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.750
 people that I think I will kill very 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.970
 fast because I'm so crazy to talk and 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.860
 this would have to kill pretty fast 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.600
 because if they are not going to piss me off and 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.280
 I want it to piss me off to see I think 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.010
 surely this was not there in the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.180
 dome and it's there I do not want to have a 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.300
 bitch of ender because I do not want 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.650
 risk that has been left to serious to 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.050
 that there is no one and reasoned pearl 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.570
 because I wanted to marry her foolishly but 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.500
 What I really want to do is find you 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.330
 that is, I do not care where they are 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.330
 I just want to find them and kill them 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.470
 because if he is not a bully I do not like it here 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.050
 in eating half open to see what's 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.390
 nothing is worth then I think that people 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.460
 will be to see in the other spam that are 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.050
 it will be there if they are there 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.460
 inside and I do not know why map two very 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.680
 big the map as you can see is 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.180
 little one has died one we have something left 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.180
 for the shortest time there 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.180
 I want that if I'm not very sure but 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.740
 you wait t 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.199
 the crazy one calls you crazy but I think that 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.090
 dead boy over there we watch the 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.729
 back that comes to us nobody does not see 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.210
 no one at the moment which thing 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.210

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.650
 I saw butterflies and played my mother 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.949
 if I could fly it would be all much more 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.779
 easy true if you exceed but if here 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.400

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:17.820
