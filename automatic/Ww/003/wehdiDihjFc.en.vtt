00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi to all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.750
 those two on server two then then 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.189
 today we wanted to make this block there 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.050
 we are taking enough to taste 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.550
 make the blocks as you see there 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.469
 we put the black shirts either 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.670
 our own official shirts 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.580
 chat with friends 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.500
 today we wanted to talk about something that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.180
 aroused the curiosity of interest e 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.490
 also the indignation of many of you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.400
 in fact we get several messages for 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.150
 ask us what we think of payments 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.850
 fixed monthly on some games then there 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.950
 are different schools of thought already me and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.129
 we think differently about some 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.579
 what he does not play and gt r then does 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.879
 like a world apart from never having 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.800
 played per set but some have some 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.340
 played but not with a monthly payment 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 I, on the other hand, often found myself 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.190
 on particular servers so maybe 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 private individuals who needed a sos 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.480
 been sustenance for who server is not 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.430
 which is what field of fried air is 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.339
 however it takes the payment of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.340
 server while you are breaking a hard drive are you 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.090
 frigated ram to empower are more 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.040
 cost players are 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.759
 let's say this thing doesn't come here 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.250
 understood by all and appreciated are gods 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.880
 costs that actually make sense, that is 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.409
 that money as paid ends up 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.150
 they actually end up in a fund 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.049
 cash that also serves the same 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.250
 players map updates 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.380
 introduction of new play areas 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.049
 new introductions quest the new monsters 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.509
 new customizations for the characters 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.369
 are games that are in continuous 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.770
 evolution and these were the first 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.960
 games to be evolving where 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.180
 those fps were the ones that remained 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.040
 now fps also evolve 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.229
 look at a butterfield a cod 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.560
 new maps come out, in short, everything 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:00.510
 is taking is let's say that that 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.400
 so form of becoming however on the gt r 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.750
 I'd feel like breaking a spear a 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.300
 favor of all those guys who 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.880
 they would like to play with it but not 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.810
 they have 15 euros a month plus the cost of 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.340
 initial game yes this is a pity the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.830
 ownership of that which the gdr la 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.050
 the night you play there maybe makes you the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.180
 first month free they gave you the 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.600
 first month free happens to world of 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.700
 warcraft, then is it so why not 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.470
 you can continue next month because if 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.550
 you have no money you can't continue 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.030
 there are more or less nice methods for 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.700
 to give you extra days of gods 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.680
 months free calls your friend you know 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.970
 who plays and gt r knows how they work 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.690
 our things 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.970
 however in short you are always there there from Ticino 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.500
 I'm month joe cole a month after I have to 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.240
 do 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.340
 yes also because they are games related to 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.260
 character growth you can't 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.330
 abandon that account after we 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.580
 you have lost so many hours and more hours you lose us 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.010
 you lose more money than you are sorry 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.739
 leaving the game is clear why 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.630
 becomes a real investment 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:12.510
 this is our advice 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.370
 as long as it is 12 13 15 euros per 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.510
 month which in the end is the cost of one 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.850
 pizza and coca cola if you can 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.880
 find a game that you really like 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.550
 maybe it's also worth spending cd 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.100
 however you must make sure that the game does not 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.370
 will disappoint you tomorrow because around there 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.500
 There are so many videogame scams 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.019
 so head south and headlines they have 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.610
 a certain importance a certain charisma e 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.260
 that they can't afford to do 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.540
 shitty figures look at world of 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.890
 warcraft or an elder scrolls online 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.230
 hardly these two games 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.760
 they will close their doors this way after having you 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.769
 cheated no yes the difference lies in the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.630
 fact that there are many others that yes 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.739
 peddle for free to play brands dop 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.459
 she at the end of the fair 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.780
 I'm not the one that's civilians there 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.590
 we ask that in a future 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.960
 surely it will happen is the fps from now 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.310
 than maybe every three 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.330
 they buy a dlc slowly 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.700
 they will begin to fall every two months 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.370
 then each month will also become that one 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.090
 subscription we also believe that we 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.130
 the bad habit is that it is and perhaps that 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.120
 day we'll stop playing fps 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.160
 because what makes a fps is the base 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.200
 of the game the setting of the game does not 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.050
 certainly the variety of machines e 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.240
 the problematic of the mimetic then 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.550
 who already have accounts that can 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.250
 discharge all dlc see butterfield 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.650
 stay with a couple of beans in hand 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.390
 because later he can't play with all the 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.130
 world because all the world does 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.920
 always move to newer maps 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.420
 try entering the battlefield 3 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.130
 towards the end of the career of 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.560
 battlefield 3 if you both in the maps 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.150
 of the first expansion you couldn't find us 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.300
 not even a dog and they were maps 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.220
 in my opinion therefore better 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.530
 fuck you is a is a biting dog 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.050
 the situ queue adds material adds 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.230
 material but impoverishes the basic game 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.460
 which however should always remain 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.460
 but it is important and it is not
