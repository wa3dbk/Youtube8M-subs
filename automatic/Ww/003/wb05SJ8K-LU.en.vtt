00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.190 
hey I'm read from Casper longboarding

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.579 
hey I'm read from Casper longboarding
here<00:00:05.190> with<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.640> review<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.020> orangutang

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
here with a review on the orangutang

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.249 
here with a review on the orangutang
stimulus<00:00:08.510> 86<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.690> yellow<00:00:11.450> first<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.630> all<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:13.019> know

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
stimulus 86 a yellow first of all I know

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.480 
stimulus 86 a yellow first of all I know
there<00:00:13.920> are<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.070> lot<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.280> reading<00:00:14.730> 10<00:00:14.969> years<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
there are a lot of reading 10 years and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.769 
there are a lot of reading 10 years and
honestly<00:00:17.490> I'm<00:00:17.609> not<00:00:17.670> sure<00:00:17.850> why<00:00:18.180> they<00:00:18.449> seem<00:00:18.660> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
honestly I'm not sure why they seem to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.540 
honestly I'm not sure why they seem to
make<00:00:18.930> fine<00:00:19.410> wheels<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.980> me<00:00:21.380> so<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.680> give<00:00:23.460> them

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
make fine wheels to me so just give them

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.849 
make fine wheels to me so just give them
a<00:00:23.670> try<00:00:23.910> if<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.840> don't<00:00:25.019> like<00:00:25.170> them<00:00:25.320> then<00:00:25.529> move

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
a try if you don't like them then move

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.859 
a try if you don't like them then move
on<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:27.859> this<00:00:28.859> wheel<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.550> primarily<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.599> free

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
on so this wheel is primarily a free

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.959 
on so this wheel is primarily a free
ride<00:00:31.080> wheel<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.130> already<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.520> you

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
ride wheel and you already know that you

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.420 
ride wheel and you already know that you
already<00:00:33.480> probably<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.100> wheel<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
already probably know that this wheel is

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.580 
already probably know that this wheel is
70<00:00:35.940> millimeters<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.850> I<00:00:39.260> don't<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
70 millimeters and I don't know the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.670 
70 millimeters and I don't know the
contact<00:00:40.980> patch<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.140> has

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
contact patch but as you can see it has

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.200 
contact patch but as you can see it has
been<00:00:43.739> coned<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.840> know<00:00:46.829> how<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:47.940> wheels

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
been coned so I do know how these wheels

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.389 
been coned so I do know how these wheels
ride<00:00:48.510> I've<00:00:49.289> been<00:00:49.500> riding<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.309> about

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
ride I've been riding them for about

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.819 
ride I've been riding them for about
I've<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.360> I've<00:00:51.660> written<00:00:52.079> them<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.260> two

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
I've actually I've written them for two

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.060 
I've actually I've written them for two
months<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:54.860> anyway<00:00:56.149> these<00:00:57.149> wheels<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:58.070> mean

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
months but anyway these wheels I mean

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.529 
months but anyway these wheels I mean
they<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.520> slide<00:01:00.090> pretty<00:01:00.600> well<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> only<00:01:02.539> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
they they slide pretty well the only the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
they they slide pretty well the only the
only<00:01:03.780> thing<00:01:04.229> i<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.040> slide

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
only thing i don't like about the slide

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.149 
only thing i don't like about the slide
is<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:06.030> little<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.860> kind<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
is a it's a little like it's kind of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.280 
is a it's a little like it's kind of
choppy<00:01:08.580> feeling<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.110> feels

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
choppy feeling it that's what it feels

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
choppy feeling it that's what it feels
like<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> me<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
like to me and i don't like how it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.090 
like to me and i don't like how it
shatters<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.530> sound<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.590> don't<00:01:16.950> like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
shatters the sound I and I don't like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.810 
shatters the sound I and I don't like
that<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.689> but<00:01:18.689> um<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.640> haven't<00:01:20.640> written

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that at all but um I haven't written

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.770 
that at all but um I haven't written
these<00:01:21.299> softer<00:01:21.810> wheels<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.360> mean<00:01:24.360> maybe<00:01:24.570> they

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
these softer wheels so I mean maybe they

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.330 
these softer wheels so I mean maybe they
chat<00:01:25.080> or<00:01:25.229> less<00:01:25.439> or<00:01:25.830> whatever<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.080> right<00:01:28.340> these

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
chat or less or whatever but right these

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.710 
chat or less or whatever but right these
wheels<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.560> don't<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.770> mean<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
wheels just I don't know I mean I

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.330 
wheels just I don't know I mean I
they're<00:01:33.720> good<00:01:33.960> they're<00:01:34.200> pretty<00:01:35.009> good<00:01:35.189> for

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
they're good they're pretty good for

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.499 
they're good they're pretty good for
free<00:01:35.490> riding<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.970> especially<00:01:36.150> good<00:01:36.450> for

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
free riding there especially good for

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.319 
free riding there especially good for
learning<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.110> slides<00:01:37.409> since<00:01:37.799> there<00:01:38.070> no

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
learning the slides since there no

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.140 
learning the slides since there no
they're<00:01:39.329> very<00:01:39.799> kind<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.860> an<00:01:40.979> icy<00:01:41.310> slide<00:01:41.549> i<00:01:41.579> want

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
they're very kind of an icy slide i want

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.380 
they're very kind of an icy slide i want
to<00:01:42.240> say<00:01:42.360> i<00:01:42.390> see<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.130> since<00:01:44.130> they<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.640> fairly

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to say i see but since they are a fairly

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.969 
to say i see but since they are a fairly
slidy<00:01:45.840> wheel<00:01:46.140> they're<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.770> learning

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
slidy wheel they're good for learning

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889 
slidy wheel they're good for learning
the<00:01:47.220> slides<00:01:47.490> or<00:01:47.790> beginners<00:01:48.420> who<00:01:48.630> want<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the slides or beginners who want to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.319 
the slides or beginners who want to
learn<00:01:48.990> slides<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.659> there<00:01:52.560> also<00:01:53.329> believe

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
learn slides and on there also believe

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.459 
learn slides and on there also believe
it<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.689> very<00:01:54.990> versatile<00:01:55.680> wheel

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
it or not a very versatile wheel

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.219 
it or not a very versatile wheel
actually<00:01:58.469> i<00:01:59.060> mean<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.270> i<00:02:00.420> had<00:02:00.810> these<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.200> my

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
actually i mean like i had these on my

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.149 
actually i mean like i had these on my
downhill<00:02:01.500> board<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:03.590> there<00:02:04.590> weren't<00:02:04.710> really

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
downhill board and there weren't really

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.789 
downhill board and there weren't really
much<00:02:05.430> problems<00:02:05.939> except<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.450> sliding<00:02:07.320> out<00:02:07.469> in

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
much problems except for sliding out in

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.710 
much problems except for sliding out in
corners

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
corners

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.980 
corners
so<00:02:11.670> that's<00:02:12.670> not<00:02:12.820> really<00:02:13.000> serving<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.750> huge

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
so that's not really serving a huge

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.870 
so that's not really serving a huge
issue<00:02:14.140> because<00:02:14.680> most<00:02:15.130> people<00:02:15.400> won't<00:02:15.520> use<00:02:15.760> this

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
issue because most people won't use this

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:24.870 
issue because most people won't use this
for<00:02:16.090> downhill<00:02:16.270> anyway<00:02:23.250> any<00:02:24.250> other<00:02:24.580> problems

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
for downhill anyway any other problems

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.720 
for downhill anyway any other problems
on<00:02:25.330> these<00:02:25.600> wheels<00:02:26.040> actually<00:02:27.040> lasted<00:02:27.580> very

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
on these wheels actually lasted very

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.620 
on these wheels actually lasted very
there<00:02:30.730> come<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> point<00:02:31.300> where<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.570> don't

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
there come to the point where I don't
