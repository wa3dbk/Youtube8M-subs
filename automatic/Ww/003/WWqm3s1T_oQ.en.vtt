a<00:00:19.609> stars<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:20.789> going<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.060> there<00:00:21.210> like<00:00:21.240> this

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
a stars are going in there like this

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.439 
a stars are going in there like this
you're<00:00:23.580> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> push<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.029> all<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.119> way<00:00:24.210> back

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
you're going to push it all the way back

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:36.799 
you're going to push it all the way back
as<00:00:24.689> far<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.230> go<00:00:34.820> use<00:00:35.820> two<00:00:36.059> painters<00:00:36.510> one

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
as far as it and go use two painters one

00:00:36.809 --> 00:01:03.290 
as far as it and go use two painters one
on<00:00:36.899> each<00:00:37.020> side<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.559> holds<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.860> straight<00:01:02.300> so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
on each side so it holds it straight so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
on each side so it holds it straight so
now<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:04.129> is<00:01:05.129> where<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.549> paint

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
now what we have here is where to paint

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.940 
now what we have here is where to paint
stars<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> side<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> clamp<00:01:07.320> holding

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
stars on the side with a clamp holding

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.020 
stars on the side with a clamp holding
it<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.810> could<00:01:09.930> let<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.470> drive

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
it out so we could let the out drive

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.600 
it out so we could let the out drive
down<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.200> connect<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> all<00:01:16.610> right

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
down and you can connect it all right

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.100 
down and you can connect it all right
now<00:01:17.939> might<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.450> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.720> difficult<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
now might be kind of difficult to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.660 
now might be kind of difficult to
understand<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> did<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:19.979> okay<00:01:20.430> once

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
understand what I did but okay once

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.020 
understand what I did but okay once
again<00:01:21.259> exhaust<00:01:22.430> tubing<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.549> got<00:01:23.700> ready<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.970> just

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.429 
again exhaust tubing I got ready I just
clamped<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.570> air<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.960> clamp

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
clamped on air with this clamp

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.590 
clamped on air with this clamp
okay<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.950> had<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.729> pulled<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.090 
pliers and as he did that I took this
other<00:01:30.509> exhaust<00:01:30.900> clamp<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.560> earning

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
other exhaust clamp right here earning

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.859 
other exhaust clamp right here earning
this<00:01:32.189> other<00:01:32.369> hose<00:01:32.549> clamp<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.479> put<00:01:33.689> two

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
this other hose clamp and I put two

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.780 
this other hose clamp and I put two
stars<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.530> once<00:01:34.740> they're<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.250> right

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
stars in here once they're on the right

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.429 
stars in here once they're on the right
side<00:01:36.000> once<00:01:36.270> they're<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> left<00:01:36.780> side<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.899 
side once they're on the left side and
when<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> pull<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> push<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> stars

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
when you pull it out and push the stars

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.120 
when you pull it out and push the stars
as<00:01:39.210> far<00:01:39.240> forward<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.990> could<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.799> tighten

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
as far forward as I could and tighten

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.789 
as far forward as I could and tighten
the<00:01:41.189> stars<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.150> now<00:01:42.360> without<00:01:43.320> doing<00:01:43.560> anything

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the stars and now without doing anything

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.340 
the stars and now without doing anything
it's<00:01:44.450> bellows<00:01:45.450> stretched<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> way<00:01:46.110> out

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's bellows stretched all the way out

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.800 
it's bellows stretched all the way out
and<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:47.369> will<00:01:47.460> let<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:48.030> drive<00:01:48.270> down<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and it will let the out drive down and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.120 
and it will let the out drive down and
it's<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> go<00:01:49.409> should<00:01:49.710> go<00:01:49.829> right<00:01:49.979> into

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's going to go should go right into

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.490 
it's going to go should go right into
the<00:01:50.340> floor<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.579> come<00:01:50.820> back<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.659> well<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the floor to come back out so well of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.530 
the floor to come back out so well of
course<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.250> exhaust<00:01:53.850> even<00:01:54.090> gets<00:01:54.240> come<00:01:54.390> back

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
course this exhaust even gets come back

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.300 
course this exhaust even gets come back
out<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> gotta<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.920> undo<00:01:56.159> your

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
out so all you gotta do is undo your

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.850 
out so all you gotta do is undo your
clamp<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.689> take<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.110> exhaust<00:01:58.530> tubing<00:01:58.740> out

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
clamp on to take this exhaust tubing out

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.080 
clamp on to take this exhaust tubing out
and<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.219> now<00:01:59.430> we're<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> let<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.880> down

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and then now we're going to let it down

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.969 
and then now we're going to let it down
and<00:02:00.329> should<00:02:00.570> fit<00:02:00.750> right<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.049> there<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.710> we

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and should fit right in there as we

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.440 
and should fit right in there as we
pulled<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> gives<00:02:02.670> us<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:02.939> room<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.210> work

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
pulled it gives us a little room to work

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.719 
pulled it gives us a little room to work
on
