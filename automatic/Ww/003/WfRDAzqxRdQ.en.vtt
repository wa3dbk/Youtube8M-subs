00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
group sometimes three I was a bit

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.160 
group sometimes three I was a bit
worried<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> single<00:00:57.989> player<00:00:58.140> mode

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
worried that the single player mode

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.930 
worried that the single player mode
wouldn't<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.829> anywhere<00:00:59.129> near<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.430> good<00:00:59.640> as<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
wouldn't be anywhere near as good as the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.970 
wouldn't be anywhere near as good as the
online<00:01:00.300> mode<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.050> feel<00:01:01.199> tacked<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.710> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
online mode and we just feel tacked on I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.770 
online mode and we just feel tacked on I
can<00:01:02.579> say<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.910> while<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.210> nowhere<00:01:03.420> near<00:01:03.600> as

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
can say that while it's nowhere near as

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.210 
can say that while it's nowhere near as
addictive<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> online<00:01:04.650> mode<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
addictive as the online mode it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
addictive as the online mode it
certainly<00:01:05.970> doesn't<00:01:06.240> feel<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.780> act<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.080> they

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
certainly doesn't feel to act on they

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.960 
certainly doesn't feel to act on they
put<00:01:07.770> some<00:01:07.920> thought<00:01:08.130> into<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> level<00:01:08.580> designs

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

put some thought into the level designs
and<00:01:09.270> actually<00:01:09.630> built<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.960> single<00:01:10.229> player<00:01:10.439> mode

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and actually built a single player mode

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.649 
and actually built a single player mode
