00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
accomplish all those things course there

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.759 
accomplish all those things course there
is<00:02:30.790> no<00:02:30.909> doubt<00:02:31.180> mechanism<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.230> pretty<00:02:32.620> defined

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
is no doubt mechanism so pretty defined

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.530 
is no doubt mechanism so pretty defined
balance<00:02:35.769> between<00:02:36.370> all<00:02:37.060> those<00:02:37.299> three

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
balance between all those three

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.679 
balance between all those three
components<00:02:37.689> and<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:40.090> unfortunately

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
components and it's one unfortunately

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.509 
components and it's one unfortunately
that<00:02:40.840> takes<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.260> lot<00:02:41.409> of<00:02:41.439> trials<00:02:41.889> and<00:02:42.069> errors<00:02:42.250> to

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
that takes a lot of trials and errors to

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.920 
that takes a lot of trials and errors to
find<00:02:42.760> out<00:02:42.909> that's<00:02:43.030> why<00:02:43.209> I'm<00:02:43.329> fortunate<00:02:43.719> a<00:02:43.780> lot

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
find out that's why I'm fortunate a lot

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.050 
find out that's why I'm fortunate a lot
of<00:02:44.049> women<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.349> discover<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.579> balance

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
of women that discover that balance

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.819 
of women that discover that balance
discovered<00:02:46.510> later<00:02:46.689> in<00:02:46.900> life<00:02:46.930> because<00:02:47.620> you

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
discovered later in life because you

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.280 
discovered later in life because you
know<00:02:47.859> you<00:02:47.980> do<00:02:48.129> have<00:02:48.159> to<00:02:48.459> try<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> lot<00:02:48.969> to<00:02:49.959> find

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
know you do have to try a lot to find

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.470 
know you do have to try a lot to find
first<00:02:51.129> of<00:02:51.219> all<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.430> learn<00:02:51.609> that<00:02:51.879> health<00:02:52.269> and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
first of all to learn that health and

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.729 
first of all to learn that health and
strength<00:02:52.750> are<00:02:52.870> much<00:02:53.019> more<00:02:53.200> important<00:02:53.650> than

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
strength are much more important than

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.440 
strength are much more important than
being<00:02:53.859> skinny<00:02:54.249> and<00:02:54.549> then<00:02:54.969> when<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.239> learn

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
being skinny and then when you learn

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.330 
being skinny and then when you learn
those<00:02:55.629> two<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.109> still<00:02:56.439> don't<00:02:56.829> want<00:02:57.159> to

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
those two and you still don't want to

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.909 
those two and you still don't want to
gain<00:02:57.579> weight<00:02:57.689> finding<00:02:58.689> the<00:02:59.409> balance<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.889> be

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
gain weight finding the balance to be

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.259 
gain weight finding the balance to be
able<00:03:00.129> to<00:03:00.250> have<00:03:00.370> all<00:03:00.609> those<00:03:00.760> things<00:03:01.060> at<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
able to have all those things at the

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.809 
able to have all those things at the
same<00:03:01.450> time<00:03:01.689> is<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.590> it's<00:03:02.889> quite<00:03:03.099> tricky<00:03:03.430> you

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
same time is that it's quite tricky you

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.640 
same time is that it's quite tricky you
know<00:03:03.849> but<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:04.629> achievable<00:03:05.109> but<00:03:05.349> it's<00:03:05.500> not

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
know but it's achievable but it's not

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.860 
know but it's achievable but it's not
easy<00:03:05.799> okay<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.909> i<00:03:06.939> think<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.299> should<00:03:07.329> focus<00:03:07.569> on

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
easy okay so i think you should focus on

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.699 
easy okay so i think you should focus on
that<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.079> if<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.829> think<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:10.709> it's

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
that and if you think that it's

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.220 
that and if you think that it's
important<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.540> confront<00:03:13.540> those<00:03:13.840> women<00:03:14.199> that

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
important to confront those women that

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.189 
important to confront those women that
constantly<00:03:14.709> brag<00:03:14.949> about<00:03:15.159> having<00:03:15.250> flat<00:03:15.549> abs

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.199 
constantly brag about having flat abs

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.420 
constantly brag about having flat abs
first<00:03:17.199> of<00:03:17.319> all<00:03:17.379> i<00:03:17.409> don't<00:03:17.530> think<00:03:17.769> it's<00:03:17.889> really

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
first of all i don't think it's really

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.679 
first of all i don't think it's really
important<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.790> confront<00:03:19.180> them<00:03:19.299> i<00:03:19.389> don't<00:03:19.419> think

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:19.689 
important to confront them i don't think

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.740 
important to confront them i don't think
it's<00:03:19.840> necessary<00:03:20.829> i<00:03:20.889> think<00:03:21.219> its<00:03:21.310> protective<00:03:21.909> i

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
it's necessary i think its protective i

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.229
