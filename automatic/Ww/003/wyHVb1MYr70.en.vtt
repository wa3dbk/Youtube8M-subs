Patrick's creation hey what's this meter
say<00:02:37.310> we're<00:02:38.180> at<00:02:38.330> 90<00:02:39.170> feet<00:02:40.239> bringing<00:02:41.239> our<00:02:41.480> top

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.970 

somebody<00:02:54.880> figured<00:02:55.060> out<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.590> could<00:02:56.620> use

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
somebody figured out that you could use

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.520 
somebody figured out that you could use
a<00:02:57.220> lawn<00:02:57.550> sprinkler<00:02:57.730> valve<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:59.140> control<00:02:59.410> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
a lawn sprinkler valve to control the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.140 
a lawn sprinkler valve to control the
airflow<00:02:59.680> off<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.340> tank<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:00.760> we've<00:03:00.940> basically

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
airflow off the tank so we've basically

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.720 
airflow off the tank so we've basically
create<00:03:01.540> those<00:03:01.630> two<00:03:01.780> PVC<00:03:02.320> tanks<00:03:02.710> but<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.640> I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
create those two PVC tanks but like I

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.130 
create those two PVC tanks but like I
said<00:03:03.790> ideally<00:03:04.240> would<00:03:04.420> be<00:03:04.480> about<00:03:04.660> six<00:03:04.990> feet

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
said ideally would be about six feet

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.050 
said ideally would be about six feet
long<00:03:05.200> about<00:03:05.620> six<00:03:05.830> eight<00:03:05.980> inches<00:03:06.190> wide<00:03:06.370> they

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
long about six eight inches wide they

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.520 
long about six eight inches wide they
feed<00:03:07.300> into<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.630> repurposed<00:03:08.200> sprinkler

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
feed into this repurposed sprinkler

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.070 
feed into this repurposed sprinkler
valve<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.460> feeds<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.940> into<00:03:10.270> our<00:03:10.540> barrel
