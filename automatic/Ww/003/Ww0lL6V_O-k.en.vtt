want to duplicate with regards to that
and<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.350> will<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.920> melon<00:00:23.760> seeds<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:25.320> all

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and that will be melon seeds so we all

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.929 
and that will be melon seeds so we all
know<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.650> they're<00:00:26.039> pretty<00:00:26.250> damn<00:00:26.580> hard<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
know that they're pretty damn hard to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.670 
know that they're pretty damn hard to
get<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.390> got<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.570> find<00:00:27.810> them<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.260> got<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.470> find

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
get you got to find them you got to find

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.589 
get you got to find them you got to find
out<00:00:28.859> underground<00:00:29.189> mine<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.359> jazz

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
out underground mine and all that jazz

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.110 
out underground mine and all that jazz
and<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.769> two<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.790> this

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and then you get one or two and so this

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880 
and then you get one or two and so this
will<00:00:33.300> save<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.690> again<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.320> find<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.680> you

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
will save you again if you find one you

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
will save you again if you find one you
could<00:00:35.040> probably<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> long<00:00:36.000> way<00:00:36.210> by

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
could probably do this a long way by

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.970 
could probably do this a long way by
simply<00:00:36.870> planning<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.469> breaking<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
simply planning it and breaking it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.540 
simply planning it and breaking it
planning<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> breaking<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:40.070> but<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.430> you

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
planning and breaking it but what you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.819 
planning and breaking it but what you
can<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.930> go<00:00:43.110> ahead<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.440> once

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
can really do is just go ahead and once

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190

run down here and go up here so find
yourself<00:01:13.860> an<00:01:14.250> anvil<00:01:14.460> once<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> got<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> one

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
yourself an anvil once you got the one

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
yourself an anvil once you got the one
melon<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> found<00:01:17.070> even<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.729> set
