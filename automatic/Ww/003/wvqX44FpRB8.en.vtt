the<00:02:22.720> eyes<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.710> does<00:02:23.920> crease<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.880> do<00:02:25.030> like

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
the eyes but it does crease so I do like

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.780 
the eyes but it does crease so I do like
to<00:02:25.450> set<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.900> really<00:02:26.200> good<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:27.520> is<00:02:27.760> a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
to set that in really good and it is a

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.170 
to set that in really good and it is a
little<00:02:28.060> bit<00:02:28.270> lighter<00:02:29.370> not<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:30.970> light

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
little bit lighter not really that light

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.820 
little bit lighter not really that light
but<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.930> little<00:02:32.080> bit<00:02:32.290> lighter<00:02:32.440> than<00:02:32.560> my

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
but just a little bit lighter than my

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.970 
but just a little bit lighter than my
skin<00:02:32.860> color<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.750> like<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.380> make<00:02:35.650> sure<00:02:35.800> it's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
skin color so I like to make sure it's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.820 
skin color so I like to make sure it's
blended<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.430> completely<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:38.260> don't<00:02:38.470> go

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
blended in completely and I don't go

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.200 
blended in completely and I don't go
super<00:02:39.160> crazy<00:02:39.340> with<00:02:39.580> highlighting<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
super crazy with highlighting and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.880 
super crazy with highlighting and
contouring<00:02:40.240> because<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:40.990> really<00:02:41.260> don't<00:02:41.440> see<00:02:41.560> a

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
contouring because I really don't see a

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.490 
contouring because I really don't see a
difference<00:02:42.270> when<00:02:43.270> people<00:02:43.630> do<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.290> don't

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
difference when people do that I don't

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.490 
difference when people do that I don't
find<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.190> necessary<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:46.720> here<00:02:47.140> i<00:02:47.200> am<00:02:47.290> just

person<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.810> right<00:03:51.799> here<00:03:51.830> I'm<00:03:52.069> just

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
person and right here I'm just

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.090 
person and right here I'm just

more<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.610> highlighter<00:03:56.330> than<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.660> bronzer

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
more of a highlighter than a bronzer

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.410 
more of a highlighter than a bronzer
