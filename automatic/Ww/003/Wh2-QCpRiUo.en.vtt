00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
cheetah so in theory you could simply

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.470

just<00:02:14.890> kite<00:02:15.250> him<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.820> guy<00:02:15.940> had<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.210> lot<00:02:16.450> of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
just kite him but this guy had a lot of

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.760 
just kite him but this guy had a lot of
help<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.900> was<00:02:16.990> impossible<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.560> kill

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
help and it was impossible to kill

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.900

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
without running out of mana so

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.880

the works so I was like I like if I make
this<00:06:46.630> one<00:06:46.780> real<00:06:46.930> quick<00:06:46.960> and<00:06:47.320> there<00:06:47.950> being<00:06:48.070> a

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
this one real quick and there being a

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.410 
this one real quick and there being a
lot<00:06:48.190> longer<00:06:48.520> than<00:06:48.700> I<00:06:48.850> thought<00:06:48.880> it<00:06:49.150> would<00:06:49.270> be

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
lot longer than I thought it would be

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.210 
lot longer than I thought it would be
but<00:06:49.690> I<00:06:49.930> think<00:06:50.200> it<00:06:50.290> turned<00:06:50.500> out<00:06:50.590> pretty<00:06:50.830> well

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
but I think it turned out pretty well

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.150 
but I think it turned out pretty well
