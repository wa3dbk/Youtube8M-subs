00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.110
Hey guys Samsung India today released their
next Flagship Series the Galaxy S series you

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.440
have the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge.
And I am gonna give you a quick camera test

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.709
of these devices.
Now both the camera are identical.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.580
So I am just gonna show you the camera on
the S6.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.699
It has an updated Ui and you can just tap
it here to bring out additional options.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.140
You have the Effects and HDR on or off or
auto you can do anything.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.140
And then your self timer the flash auto on
and off.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.960
And then you have the usual system settings
where you can have your grid lines and there

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.270
you see max it clicks at 16MP.
Remember it has optical image stabilization.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.671
So you have video size that goes up to all
the way ultra HD that meaning 3840*2160 and

00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.019
not only 2K.
So it goes beyond 2K.

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.339
By the way the front camera also records at
2K now that could be one of the first not

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.290
only first with Samsung not only this device
it had it in the flagship device before.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.860
But 2K on the front camera is really really
awesome if you have a fast enough internet

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.250
connection that is.
You have tracking auto focus which is a new

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.010
feature here.
Which meaning even if your subject is moving

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.290
your focus is gonna be locked on that subject.
And it's not gonna you know give you out of

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.490
focus moving subjects.
Another thing and well it's not exactly as

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.360
fast as the face detection system you find
on the DSLR's.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.870
But still this contrast detection system is
good enough to track relatively slow moving

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.260
subjects like your dog may be your kids or
stuff.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.450
And then you have location tags and some of
the other things.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.430
And then your video starts with this those
kind of stuff.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.150
And you have lot's of modes around here.
Selfie because I have the front camera on

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.810
now so Selfie Wide selfie and what not.
If I go here and switch to the back camera.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.540
You can see switching from the front and back
camera also is very very seamless.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.210
So that's the back camera.
Here you have lot's and lot's of options.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.609
You also have a pro mode which is important
for those who do not want to leave everything

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:17.909
to the camera alone.
So you have you can change some of the picture

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.010
controls there.
And then your there you see micro or Landscape

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.569
mode.
You have the white balance the ISO and your

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.540
exposure compensation scale.
Here also you have additional option.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.609
But probably I would have liked to control
the aperture and the shutter speed as well.

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.590
But I can understand on the phone cameras
they are generally mostly on the software

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.040
level.
Even if some of the other manufacturer give

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.879
you that aperture or shutter speed settings
more often than not they are actually tweaking

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.219
the software and not exactly give you that
particular feature on the lens.

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.520
So we have checked the still and video quality
of the S6 and the S6 Edge.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.629
And they are magnificent to say the least.
The rear 16MP camera can record stills which

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.120
are very natural saturation and Hue.
It does not over saturate the color pallets

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.569
at all.
Not even the Maroon and the Red color pallets

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.480
which many of the cameras stand to do.
And it's edge to edge sharpness even for the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.670
front camera.
And because of the very fast and wide aperture

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.480
of 1.9 on both the cameras.
Even under low light you can actually have

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.279
all the light you need.
Even if the lights source is far away or it's

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:33.670
very little.
Not only that it also checks the nose level

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.900
up to respectable ISO level.
The videos are very sharp there is no fuzziness

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.549
edge to edge sharpness on the videos.
And the OIS actually works great.

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.609
We have recorded some video with some jerking
movements.

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.470
And still the video actually came out very
very stable.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.729
So all in all amazing camera probably one
of the best in the market right now.
