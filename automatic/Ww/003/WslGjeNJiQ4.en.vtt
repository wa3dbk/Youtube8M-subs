00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.370
 for the white knight released on 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.080
 playstation 2 in 2006 tales of the abyss 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.490
 is one of the many episodes of the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.680
 series that had never seen the light of day 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.880
 we in europe 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.980
 a situation that ends with 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.060
 the arrival of this remake on 3ds and who 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.700
 repeat point by point 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 the original story 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.580
 So here you are in the shoes of the udc a 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.730
 young boy who will quickly be 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.020
 confronted with a story that goes beyond 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.500
 a context that will lead him to meet 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.150
 a group of rather pleasant companions 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.380
 far enough from the usual clichÃ©s his 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.330
 characters are often at the center of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.070
 personal conversations named this kit 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.140
 bringing information sometimes 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.550
 essential about the gameplay itself 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.530
 if they are far too systematic 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.010
 and suffers from a lack of enough dubbing 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.010
 annoying 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.610
 it is certainly possible to zap them 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.850
 but at the risk of losing elements of 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.850
 the story 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.430
 an old-fashioned structure that would have 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.719
 deserved a small facelift 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.719
 just like the scenario unfolding 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.310
 no because it must be admitted that this 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.299
 last is too flat and does not take off 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.759
 that after twenty hours of 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.200
 swat look game have happily 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.940
 the story holds water and it is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.110
 nice to progress even though the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.759
 context is sometimes a little too much 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.799
 complexes without reason but the great 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.659
 strength of this tales of the abyss is without 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.280
 challenges his combat system that 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.850
 skillfully blends pure action and 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.929
 a bit of strategy 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.610
 thank you for everything often relies on 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.850
 clubbing some buttons 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.770
 subtleties pusta will reflect this is the case 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.149
 fields of on behalf of circles that 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.210
 appear on the ground after use 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.619
 of an element it is then possible to 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.420
 trigger a very special attack 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.830
 effective provided that the latter 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.819
 also belong to the element in 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.170
 question an ingenious idea that the 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.549
 boss also operates very well 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.990
 the other way to put all the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.150
 world okay in a fight and getting 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.590
 serve mystics art sort of fury 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.979
 that invade the entire screen by causing 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.790
 considerable damage 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.470
 this leads to clashes 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.640
 spectacular and vibrant but who 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.739
 still suffers from a lack of 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.870
 challenge a little dated diaby flock 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.650
 stress a very good rpg that simply 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.090
 been poorly adapted with its 3d relief 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.069
 useless and his lack of new ideas 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.110
 points but that it is justified only 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.530
 for his arrival in europe what is 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.530
 already not bad 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.130
