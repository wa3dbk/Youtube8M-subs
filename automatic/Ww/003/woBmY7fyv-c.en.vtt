there's a real optimism about the club
and<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.399> can<00:02:10.580> feel<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.789> one<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.180> off<00:02:11.269> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
and you can feel that one and off the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.059 
and you can feel that one and off the
pitch<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.750> can<00:02:11.900> feel<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.650> know<00:02:12.739> just<00:02:12.980> in

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
pitch you can feel it you know just in

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.949 
pitch you can feel it you know just in
business<00:02:13.370> circles<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:14.030> social<00:02:14.480> circles<00:02:14.870> in

business circles and social circles in

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.199 
business circles and social circles in
the<00:02:15.019> city<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:16.190> think<00:02:16.340> that's<00:02:16.640> reflected<00:02:17.090> by

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
the city and I think that's reflected by

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.330 
the city and I think that's reflected by
the<00:02:17.269> performances<00:02:17.780> or<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.019> pitch<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.470> last

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
the performances or the pitch and last

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.410 
the performances or the pitch and last
year<00:02:19.519> was<00:02:19.610> disappointing<00:02:20.120> we<00:02:20.180> didn't<00:02:20.360> get

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
year was disappointing we didn't get

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.699 
year was disappointing we didn't get
silverware<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.110> think<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:21.350> progressed

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
silverware but I think we progressed

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.470 
silverware but I think we progressed
last<00:02:21.950> year<00:02:22.160> as<00:02:22.250> well<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.790> can<00:02:22.940> see<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.120> I

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
last year as well you can see that I

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.390 
last year as well you can see that I
think<00:02:24.050> there's<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.230> real<00:02:24.410> genuine<00:02:24.980> feeling

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
think there's a real genuine feeling

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.130 
think there's a real genuine feeling
that<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.760> club's<00:02:26.000> going<00:02:26.300> in<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.019> right

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
that the club's going in the right

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.790 
that the club's going in the right
direction<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.890> bacteria<00:02:28.400> should<00:02:28.670> be
