00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.030
 with samuel and with and I really keep it 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.800
 for me a pride to present oneself that 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.559
 they made a wonderful adaptation for 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.690
 a water - in washer plate very 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.240
 little bit because here we have a washing machine 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.220
 he normally uses 200 liters of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.480
 water when we put the clothes and the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.480
 puts throw in action 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.390
 of the washing machine and we're going to capture it in the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.179
 first tank the first tank is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
 trained to store all the water already 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.320
 bill the sleeve automatically to the second 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020
 So much that second tank starts 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.140
 water policy and once purified 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.900
 the ball 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:48.360
 and just the third tank would receive 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:50.820
 and the water as recycled we are 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.820
 speaking here we are going to give many one if 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.860
 it's more than 190 liters of water we're not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.140
 have purified a loss as 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.390
 the washing machine 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.390
 at the time of squeezing clothes 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.780
 of the water 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.979
 seven minutes 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.340
 I'm seeing was adapted to make a 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:29.119
 session home and it's much smaller 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:33.550
 this would be the minimum that has 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.550
 simulators salt water consumption 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.470
 then this system is capable of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.240
 support the crushers to fill them and 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.100
 with the pressure solution and the same 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.140
 time to be purifying the water and 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.950
 so do not lose the ones that the units for 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.570
 very much 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.880
 I want to find is something so wonderful 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.110
 do not use can occupy all this 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.509
 space that you are seeing with the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.729
 attachments once placed 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.770
 directly where the water reaches 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.960
 our houses and the other the system 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.990
 intelligent basically what you 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.649
 they would have 100 30 centimeters around 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.909
 your washing machine 10 centimeters squared 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.909
 to make it like the place 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:24.230
 ours as we have a having a 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.459
 email and telephone 0 44 55 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.560
 10 94 48 64 and my email is 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.040
 sanz point service to stolen from 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.040
 dot com 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:43.330
 it is the only one with headquarters house and service 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.790
 points 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.750
 hotmail dotcom is very much worth it to 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.400
 clean the planet 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.400
 in that invention and adaptation
