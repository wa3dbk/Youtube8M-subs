00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.380
 players like needles and and also crazy 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.780

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.840

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.580

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.470
 An accompanying training week was very 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.140
 very good workout quality like 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:46.270
 actually in the last months always 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.750
 Almost almost outstanding themes 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 were 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.310
 quick switch to ball gain 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.619
 depending on the zone according to predetermined 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.840
 times and how long could we need 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.840

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.860

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.920
 third block of standard situations 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.310
 where you rehearse two new variations 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.649
 I have these three things 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.880

 after the squad was announced 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.520
