now when we talk about economy sweeping
there's<00:00:35.260> bound<00:00:35.469> to<00:00:35.620> be<00:00:35.680> something<00:00:36.010> like

there's bound to be something like

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.920 
there's bound to be something like
regular<00:00:36.670> sweeping<00:00:37.090> and<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.300> risk<00:00:37.480> when<00:00:37.870> I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
regular sweeping and the risk when I

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.799 
regular sweeping and the risk when I
talk<00:00:38.230> about<00:00:38.260> regular<00:00:38.800> sweeping<00:00:39.360> I'm<00:00:40.360> talking

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
talk about regular sweeping I'm talking

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.229 
talk about regular sweeping I'm talking
about<00:00:40.870> playing<00:00:41.730> appreciated<00:00:42.730> notes<00:00:42.969> on

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
about playing appreciated notes on

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.209 
about playing appreciated notes on
different<00:00:43.960> strings<00:00:44.140> with<00:00:44.530> just<00:00:44.739> one<00:00:44.920> big

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
different strings with just one big

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.689 
different strings with just one big
movement<00:00:45.730> and<00:00:46.030> you<00:00:46.300> make<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.510> sort<00:00:46.809> of<00:00:46.930> raking

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
movement and you make a sort of raking

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.729 
movement and you make a sort of raking
sweeping<00:00:48.699> big<00:00:49.420> movement<00:00:49.930> with<00:00:50.079> it<00:00:50.229> so<00:00:50.530> hence

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
sweeping big movement with it so hence

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.889 
sweeping big movement with it so hence
the<00:00:50.860> term<00:00:51.010> sweep<00:00:51.339> it<00:00:51.579> i'm<00:00:52.479> going<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.750> show<00:00:52.870> you

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
the term sweep it i'm going to show you

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.039 
the term sweep it i'm going to show you
what<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:53.140> mean<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:55.120> left<00:00:55.329> hand<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.659> doing<00:00:55.690> some

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
what I mean the left hand is doing some

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.979 
what I mean the left hand is doing some
sort<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.350> hammer<00:00:56.559> on<00:00:56.769> pattern<00:00:57.159> all<00:00:57.309> by<00:00:57.579> itself

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
sort of hammer on pattern all by itself

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.899 
sort of hammer on pattern all by itself
in<00:00:58.989> this<00:00:59.769> case<00:00:59.979> i'll<00:01:00.190> be<00:01:00.339> showing<00:01:00.519> your<00:01:00.729> b

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
in this case i'll be showing your b

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.469 
in this case i'll be showing your b
minor<00:01:01.649> which<00:01:02.649> consists<00:01:03.219> of<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.729> 11<00:01:04.089> position

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
minor which consists of the 11 position

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.669 
minor which consists of the 11 position
on<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.690> g<00:01:04.899> string<00:01:04.929> which<00:01:05.890> is<00:01:06.070> an<00:01:06.190> f-sharp

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
on the g string which is an f-sharp

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.960 
on the g string which is an f-sharp
which<00:01:08.679> is<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:08.860> fifth<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.399> a<00:01:09.460> b-minor<00:01:09.850> chord

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
which is a fifth and a b-minor chord

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.419 
which is a fifth and a b-minor chord
then<00:01:10.960> I'm<00:01:11.140> going<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.649> 12th<00:01:11.950> position<00:01:12.070> on

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
then I'm going to the 12th position on

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.930 
then I'm going to the 12th position on
the<00:01:12.520> B<00:01:12.700> string<00:01:12.759> which<00:01:13.210> is<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.420> be<00:01:14.759> that's<00:01:15.759> the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
the B string which is a be that's the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.240 
the B string which is a be that's the
route<00:01:16.149> then<00:01:16.899> I'm<00:01:16.990> going<00:01:17.289> to<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.560> 10<00:01:17.800> position

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
route then I'm going to the 10 position

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.450 
route then I'm going to the 10 position
on<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.429> I<00:01:18.460> E<00:01:18.550> string<00:01:19.060> which<00:01:19.330> is<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.539> deep<00:01:20.460> that's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
on the I E string which is a deep that's

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.969 
on the I E string which is a deep that's
a<00:01:21.670> minor<00:01:21.880> third<00:01:22.179> and<00:01:22.450> I'll<00:01:23.409> add<00:01:23.619> for<00:01:23.830> good

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
a minor third and I'll add for good

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.919 
a minor third and I'll add for good
measure<00:01:24.190> another<00:01:25.030> note<00:01:25.300> on<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.539> high<00:01:25.690> E

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
measure another note on the high E

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.469 
measure another note on the high E
string<00:01:26.020> which<00:01:26.560> is<00:01:26.830> on<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.130> 14<00:01:27.610> position<00:01:27.789> and<00:01:28.330> F

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
string which is on the 14 position and F

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.809 
string which is on the 14 position and F
sharp<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.409> that's<00:01:29.619> again<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:30.130> fifth<00:01:30.460> but<00:01:30.670> then

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
sharp so that's again a fifth but then

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:40.499 
sharp so that's again a fifth but then
an<00:01:30.909> octave<00:01:31.210> oh<00:01:31.330> man<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.860> get<00:01:33.159> this<00:01:39.210> now<00:01:40.210> let's

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
an octave oh man you get this now let's

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.709 
an octave oh man you get this now let's
look<00:01:40.689> at<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.960> right<00:01:41.140> hand<00:01:42.090> now<00:01:43.090> look<00:01:43.509> at<00:01:43.630> what

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.330 
look at the right hand now look at what
my<00:01:43.780> right<00:01:44.079> hand<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.439> doing<00:01:44.820> i'm<00:01:47.189> picking<00:01:48.189> all

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
my right hand is doing i'm picking all

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.920 
my right hand is doing i'm picking all
the<00:01:48.399> strengths<00:01:48.909> but<00:01:49.060> I'm<00:01:49.210> doing<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.570> with<00:01:49.600> one

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
the strengths but I'm doing it with one

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.569 
the strengths but I'm doing it with one
movement<00:01:50.229> I'm<00:01:50.560> not<00:01:50.710> going<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.100> do<00:01:51.219> the<00:01:51.340> notes

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
movement I'm not going to do the notes

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.789 
movement I'm not going to do the notes
so<00:01:51.969> take<00:01:52.719> a<00:01:52.780> look<00:01:52.899> close<00:01:53.140> look<00:01:53.289> at<00:01:53.439> my<00:01:53.560> right

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
hand I'm actually making sort of

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.560 
hand I'm actually making sort of
sweeping<00:01:56.320> raking<00:01:57.189> motion<00:01:57.610> with<00:01:57.759> it<00:01:57.909> across

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
sweeping raking motion with it across

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:08.190 
sweeping raking motion with it across
the<00:01:58.630> three<00:01:58.990> strings<00:01:59.320> here<00:01:59.590> we<00:01:59.680> go<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.960> going

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the three strings here we go I'm going

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.990 
the three strings here we go I'm going
back<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.709> forth<00:02:08.950> back<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.310> forth<00:02:09.519> and

back and forth back and forth and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.810 
back and forth back and forth and
together<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:10.959> sounds<00:02:11.140> something<00:02:11.440> like<00:02:11.650> this

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.250 

now<00:02:18.820> as<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:19.240> see<00:02:19.300> my<00:02:19.720> right<00:02:19.960> hand

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
now as you can see my right hand

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.140 
now as you can see my right hand
actually<00:02:20.500> isn't<00:02:20.980> doing<00:02:21.310> all<00:02:21.460> that<00:02:21.550> much<00:02:21.790> work

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
actually isn't doing all that much work

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.880 
actually isn't doing all that much work
and<00:02:22.420> that's<00:02:22.630> because<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.080> notes<00:02:23.350> will<00:02:23.590> sound

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and that's because the notes will sound

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.440 
and that's because the notes will sound
by<00:02:24.100> themselves<00:02:24.610> because<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.180> saw<00:02:25.390> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
by themselves because you saw the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.750 
by themselves because you saw the
hammering<00:02:25.840> on<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.440> them<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.190> don't<00:02:27.280> really

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
hammering on to them so you don't really

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.480 
hammering on to them so you don't really
need<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.180> pick<00:02:28.990> them<00:02:29.170> or<00:02:29.380> rake<00:02:29.710> them<00:02:29.920> they<00:02:30.310> will

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
need to pick them or rake them they will

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.870 
need to pick them or rake them they will
sound<00:02:30.820> by<00:02:31.030> themselves<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:35.520> what<00:02:36.520> I'm<00:02:36.610> going<00:02:36.790> to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
sound by themselves so what I'm going to

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.610 
sound by themselves so what I'm going to
do<00:02:37.060> now<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.540> I'm<00:02:37.720> only<00:02:37.960> going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.410> rake<00:02:38.590> the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
do now is I'm only going to rake the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.860 
do now is I'm only going to rake the
strings<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.460> I'm<00:02:39.550> going<00:02:39.910> up<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.330> not<00:02:40.720> when

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
strings and I'm going up and not when

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.050 
strings and I'm going up and not when
I'm<00:02:40.960> going<00:02:41.260> down<00:02:41.470> since<00:02:41.830> I'm<00:02:42.040> going<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.940> do

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
I'm going down since I'm going to do

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.760 
I'm going down since I'm going to do
this<00:02:47.610> I'm<00:02:48.610> not<00:02:48.790> going<00:02:49.120> back<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:50.530> don't

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
this I'm not going back and you don't

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.790 
this I'm not going back and you don't
really<00:02:51.010> need<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.460> go<00:02:51.610> back<00:02:51.880> because<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.530> notes

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
really need to go back because the notes

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.680 
really need to go back because the notes
are<00:02:54.070> strong<00:02:54.310> enough<00:02:54.550> all<00:02:54.790> by<00:02:54.820> themselves<00:02:55.180> so

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
are strong enough all by themselves so

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.770 
are strong enough all by themselves so
they<00:02:56.050> sound<00:02:56.380> whether<00:02:57.340> or<00:02:57.490> not<00:02:57.610> i'm<00:02:57.850> picking

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
they sound whether or not i'm picking

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.440 
they sound whether or not i'm picking
them<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.170> raking<00:02:59.620> them<00:02:59.800> they<00:03:00.640> will<00:03:00.970> sound<00:03:01.270> by

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
them I raking them they will sound by

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:12.710 
them I raking them they will sound by
themselves<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.260> get<00:03:02.440> this

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.540 

but<00:03:13.720> why<00:03:13.870> stop<00:03:13.930> there<00:03:14.260> because<00:03:14.830> my<00:03:15.070> right<00:03:15.280> hand

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
but why stop there because my right hand

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.010 
but why stop there because my right hand
actually<00:03:15.790> isn't<00:03:16.210> doing<00:03:16.540> all<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:16.780> much

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
actually isn't doing all that much

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.660 
actually isn't doing all that much
there's<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.590> much<00:03:17.650> else<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.250> do<00:03:18.460> with<00:03:18.640> it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
there's so much else I can do with it

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.180 
there's so much else I can do with it
like<00:03:19.270> maybe<00:03:19.510> make<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.900> real<00:03:20.200> cool<00:03:20.500> hand<00:03:20.800> gesture

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
like maybe make a real cool hand gesture

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.250 
like maybe make a real cool hand gesture
to<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.460> audience<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.090> remember<00:03:22.810> that's<00:03:22.990> always

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
to the audience I remember that's always

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.570 
to the audience I remember that's always
a<00:03:23.290> good<00:03:23.470> option<00:03:23.680> but<00:03:24.010> I'm<00:03:24.100> going<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.490> do

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
a good option but I'm going to do

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.580 
a good option but I'm going to do
something<00:03:24.850> else<00:03:25.180> I'm<00:03:25.690> going<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.140> use<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.560> to

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
something else I'm going to use it to

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.000 
something else I'm going to use it to
tap<00:03:26.980> notes<00:03:27.970> while<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.930> arpeggios<00:03:29.410> going<00:03:29.860> on

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
tap notes while the arpeggios going on

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.160 
tap notes while the arpeggios going on

case I'm going to add another note i'm

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.840 
case I'm going to add another note i'm
going<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.930> tap<00:03:35.140> in<00:03:35.290> my<00:03:35.410> right<00:03:35.620> hand<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.340> it's

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
going to tap in my right hand and it's

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.020 
going to tap in my right hand and it's
going<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.150> be<00:03:37.390> on<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.530> 19<00:03:39.190> position<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:39.910> the

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
going to be on this 19 position of the

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.110 
going to be on this 19 position of the
high<00:03:40.150> E<00:03:40.390> string<00:03:40.420> which<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:41.080> B<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:43.000> of

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
high E string which is a B and that of

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.880 
high E string which is a B and that of
course<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.690> root<00:03:43.870> in<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.350> b-minor<00:03:44.770> chord

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
course is the root in a b-minor chord

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.010 
course is the root in a b-minor chord
but<00:03:45.220> then<00:03:45.400> one<00:03:45.550> octave<00:03:45.970> up<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.720> I'll<00:03:46.780> start

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
but then one octave up and so I'll start

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.740 
but then one octave up and so I'll start
very<00:03:47.290> slowly<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.920> then<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.520> gradually<00:03:49.300> add

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
very slowly and then I gradually add

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:59.220 
very slowly and then I gradually add
some<00:03:49.959> speed<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.070> get<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:58.300> wanna

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
some speed to it so you get this I wanna

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:09.710 
some speed to it so you get this I wanna
play<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.650> little<00:03:59.770> bit<00:03:59.980> faster<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.430> get<00:04:00.580> this

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720
