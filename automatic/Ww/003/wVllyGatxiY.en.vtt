sitting down with somebody who knows

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.530 
sitting down with somebody who knows
about<00:03:25.470> lung<00:03:25.650> cancer<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.820> direct<00:03:27.390> their

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
about lung cancer and can direct their

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.900 
about lung cancer and can direct their

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
care and get a diagnostic and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.140 
care and get a diagnostic and
therapeutic<00:03:30.170> plan<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.410> place<00:03:31.560> quickly<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.280> we

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
therapeutic plan in place quickly is we

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.770 
therapeutic plan in place quickly is we
think<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:33.510> really<00:03:33.750> important<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.830> overall

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
think it's really important the overall

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.810 
think it's really important the overall
treatments<00:03:36.780> for<00:03:37.260> lung<00:03:37.470> cancer<00:03:37.500> are<00:03:38.130> almost

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
treatments for lung cancer are almost

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.759 
treatments for lung cancer are almost
standardized<00:03:39.360> across<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.959> country<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.440> think

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
standardized across the country I think

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.580 
standardized across the country I think
it<00:03:40.860> really<00:03:40.890> comes<00:03:41.250> down<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.700> individual

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
it really comes down to the individual

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.590 
it really comes down to the individual
physician<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.310> organization<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.269> the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
physician and the organization and the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.350 
physician and the organization and the
program<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:47.519> dedicated<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
program that is dedicated to the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.840 
program that is dedicated to the
treatment<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:49.019> disease<00:03:49.320> process<00:03:49.850> you

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
treatment of that disease process you

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.430 
treatment of that disease process you
need<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.180> go<00:03:51.330> people<00:03:51.780> who<00:03:52.140> have<00:03:52.260> lung<00:03:52.410> cancer

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
need to go people who have lung cancer

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.060 
need to go people who have lung cancer
need<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.370> go<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.550> a<00:03:53.870> institution<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.860> set

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
need to go to a institution that is set

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.759 
need to go to a institution that is set
up<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:57.150> really<00:03:57.810> has<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.080> dedication<00:03:58.590> to

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
up and that really has a dedication to

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.740 
up and that really has a dedication to
that<00:03:59.570> person<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:02.010> treatment<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.489> a

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
that person and the treatment of a

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.330 
that person and the treatment of a
difficult<00:04:03.750> disease<00:04:04.019> process<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:05.100> we<00:04:05.190> have

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
difficult disease process and we have

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.140 
difficult disease process and we have
that<00:04:05.489> here<00:04:05.600> most<00:04:06.600> importantly<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.350> think<00:04:07.530> that

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
that here most importantly I think that

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.020 
that here most importantly I think that
we<00:04:09.150> have<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.360> very<00:04:09.600> unique<00:04:10.040> situation<00:04:11.040> where<00:04:11.310> we

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
we have a very unique situation where we

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.809 
we have a very unique situation where we
meet<00:04:12.420> on<00:04:12.660> almost<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.590> daily<00:04:13.620> basis<00:04:14.250> but

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
meet on almost a daily basis but

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.509 
meet on almost a daily basis but
on<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.120> weekly<00:04:15.450> basis<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.109> discuss<00:04:16.530> everybody

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
on a weekly basis to discuss everybody
