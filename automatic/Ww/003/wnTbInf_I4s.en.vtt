areas are marked in blue are the areas
we<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> take<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> bus<00:00:48.989> once<00:00:49.289> we've<00:00:49.469> hijacked

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
we can take the bus once we've hijacked

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.369 
we can take the bus once we've hijacked
it<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.700> lose<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> cops<00:00:51.230> therefore<00:00:52.230> have

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it to lose the cops therefore have

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.810 
it to lose the cops therefore have
highlighted<00:00:52.739> two<00:00:52.980> points<00:00:53.340> along<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> route

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
highlighted two points along the route

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
highlighted two points along the route
point<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.660> point<00:00:54.899> B<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.590> ideal

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
point a and point B that are ideal

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
point a and point B that are ideal
places<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.699> intercept<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> bus<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.629> hijack

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
places to intercept the bus and hijack

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.900 
places to intercept the bus and hijack
it<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.469> we'll<00:00:58.890> look<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.129> both<00:00:59.160> points<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
it and we'll look at both points in the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.549 
it and we'll look at both points in the
video<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.629> once<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:00.989> hijacked<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> bus

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
video so once you have hijacked the bus

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.229 
video so once you have hijacked the bus
and<00:01:01.920> everyone<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.460> your<00:01:02.489> crew<00:01:02.730> has<00:01:02.910> lost<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and everyone in your crew has lost the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.060 
and everyone in your crew has lost the
cops<00:01:03.420> you'll<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.110> need<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> take<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> bus<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
cops you'll then need to take the bus to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.380 
cops you'll then need to take the bus to
the<00:01:05.100> drop-off<00:01:05.489> point<00:01:05.519> which<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.390> nearby

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.150 

so<00:01:10.390> looking<00:01:10.750> at<00:01:10.810> interception<00:01:11.350> point<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.770> first

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
so looking at interception point a first

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.470 
so looking at interception point a first
you'll<00:01:12.460> need<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.700> take<00:01:12.790> out<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.060> bus<00:01:13.210> driver

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
you'll need to take out the bus driver

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.820 
you'll need to take out the bus driver
and<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:13.990> can<00:01:14.110> do<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:14.350> with<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.530> range<00:01:14.710> of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
and you can do that with the range of

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.580 
and you can do that with the range of
weapons<00:01:15.130> sniper<00:01:16.090> rifles<00:01:16.510> one<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:16.930> the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
weapons sniper rifles one and the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.230 
weapons sniper rifles one and the
marksman<00:01:18.010> rifle<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.490> be<00:01:18.580> honest<00:01:18.790> is<00:01:18.970> probably

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
marksman rifle to be honest is probably

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.969 
marksman rifle to be honest is probably
the<00:01:19.360> best

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.469 

as<00:01:29.979> soon<00:01:30.220> as<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.369> killed<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:30.760> driver<00:01:31.060> you

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
as soon as you killed that driver you

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.660 
as soon as you killed that driver you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
your crew getting a vowel will also have

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.740 
your crew getting a vowel will also have
a<00:01:35.110> three<00:01:35.320> star<00:01:35.500> wanted<00:01:35.770> rating<00:01:36.600> someone<00:01:37.600> from

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:02.330 
of cheating but the best way in quickest
way<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.979> use<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.520> homing<00:01:51.670> launcher

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.620 

with<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.430> helicopter<00:02:03.579> out<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.090> way<00:02:04.210> you

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
with the helicopter out the way you

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.840 
with the helicopter out the way you
shouldn't<00:02:04.869> get<00:02:05.020> any<00:02:05.079> more<00:02:05.350> spawning<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.759> all

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
shouldn't get any more spawning so all

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.460 
shouldn't get any more spawning so all
you<00:02:06.939> need<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.179> do<00:02:07.270> now<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.719> head<00:02:07.929> towards<00:02:08.319> one

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
you need to do now is head towards one

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.320 
you need to do now is head towards one
of<00:02:08.500> those<00:02:08.709> two<00:02:08.979> light<00:02:09.399> blue<00:02:09.610> areas<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.209> you

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
of those two light blue areas that you

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.150 
of those two light blue areas that you
marked<00:02:10.599> on<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.780> map<00:02:10.810> earlier<00:02:11.080> both<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:12.069> which

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
marked on the map earlier both of which

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.770 
marked on the map earlier both of which
are<00:02:12.370> sort<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.610> Hill<00:02:12.819> mountain<00:02:13.300> ranges<00:02:13.629> and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
are sort of Hill mountain ranges and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.240 
are sort of Hill mountain ranges and
then<00:02:14.170> wait<00:02:14.379> there<00:02:14.410> until<00:02:14.590> you've<00:02:14.950> lost<00:02:15.099> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
then wait there until you've lost the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
cops there are a couple of routes up the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.229 
cops there are a couple of routes up the
mountains<00:02:17.800> some<00:02:18.310> are<00:02:18.400> more<00:02:18.519> easy<00:02:18.760> than<00:02:19.000> others

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
mountains some are more easy than others

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.550 
mountains some are more easy than others
and<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:19.750> you're<00:02:19.900> one<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.200> ones<00:02:20.349> following
