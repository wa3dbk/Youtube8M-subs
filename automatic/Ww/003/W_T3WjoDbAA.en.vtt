think<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> looks<00:01:00.750> better<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
think it looks better and you can get it

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.470 
think it looks better and you can get it
bigger<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.850> doesn't<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.239> ratty

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
bigger and then it doesn't get all ratty

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.820 
bigger and then it doesn't get all ratty
and<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:03.870> curls<00:01:04.140> don't<00:01:04.350> fall<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.710> look

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.730 
and your curls don't fall out and look
balik<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.760> looks<00:01:06.030> better<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.570> my<00:01:06.689> opinion

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
balik it just looks better in my opinion

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.170
