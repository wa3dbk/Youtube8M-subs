00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
keychain versions of my space gun now

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.400 
keychain versions of my space gun now
originally<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.460> went<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:36.059> 3d<00:00:36.540> modeled<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
originally I went in 3d modeled the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.720 
originally I went in 3d modeled the
space<00:00:38.070> gun<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.780> had<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.960> printed<00:00:40.730> from

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
space gun and had it printed from

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.240 
space gun and had it printed from
shapeways<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> little<00:00:43.020> 3d<00:00:43.320> printed

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
shapeways so it's a little 3d printed

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.389 
shapeways so it's a little 3d printed
space<00:00:44.460> gun<00:00:44.730> only<00:00:45.270> scaled<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.230> down<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.860> haven't

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
space gun only scaled way down I haven't

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.880 
space gun only scaled way down I haven't
done<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:47.820> much<00:00:48.000> 3d<00:00:48.719> printing<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.590> still

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
done very much 3d printing and I'm still

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.680 
done very much 3d printing and I'm still
trying<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.219> figure<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.550> how<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.329> would<00:00:51.480> fit

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
trying to figure out how it would fit

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.410 
trying to figure out how it would fit
into<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.050> work<00:00:52.260> pipeline<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.180> kind

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
into my work pipeline so this was kind

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
into my work pipeline so this was kind
of<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> test<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.289> real<00:00:55.469> trick<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.520> printed

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
of a test the real trick is the printed

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
of a test the real trick is the printed
piece<00:00:57.180> comes<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.870> has<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> bit<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
piece comes out and it has a bit of a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.470 
piece comes out and it has a bit of a
texture<00:00:58.890> kind<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> stair-stepping<00:01:00.059> thing

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
texture kind of a stair-stepping thing

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.959 
texture kind of a stair-stepping thing
to<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.020> my<00:01:01.289> goal<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.280> then<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
to it my goal is to then go in and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.570 
to it my goal is to then go in and
remove<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.870> by<00:01:04.170> finishing<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.220> went<00:01:05.460> over

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
remove that by finishing it I went over

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
remove that by finishing it I went over
the<00:01:05.700> whole<00:01:05.850> 3d<00:01:06.180> printed<00:01:06.540> piece<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> bit<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the whole 3d printed piece with a bit of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.640 
the whole 3d printed piece with a bit of
this<00:01:07.530> spot<00:01:08.280> putty<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.600> sort<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.229> fill<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
this spot putty here to sort of fill in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
this spot putty here to sort of fill in
that<00:01:10.799> texture<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> ran<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.240> problems

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
that texture where I ran into problems

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.280 
that texture where I ran into problems
was<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.950> still<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.580> can't<00:01:14.880> sand<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.659> it's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
was you still really can't sand it it's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.320 
was you still really can't sand it it's
a<00:01:16.439> nylon<00:01:16.710> plastic<00:01:17.460> material<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.060> when<00:01:18.240> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
a nylon plastic material and when you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.719 
a nylon plastic material and when you
sand<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> gets<00:01:19.110> kind<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.500> fuzzy<00:01:19.860> my<00:01:20.250> plan<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
sand it it gets kind of fuzzy my plan is

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.520 
sand it it gets kind of fuzzy my plan is
to<00:01:20.759> make<00:01:21.030> molds<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.570> these<00:01:21.689> little<00:01:22.020> keychains

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
to make molds of these little keychains

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.530 
to make molds of these little keychains
and<00:01:22.710> cast<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.070> whole<00:01:23.220> bunch<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and cast a whole bunch of them so I

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.440 
and cast a whole bunch of them so I
can't<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.590> fuzzy<00:01:26.310> looking<00:01:26.820> mold<00:01:27.119> because

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
can't have a fuzzy looking mold because

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.300 
can't have a fuzzy looking mold because
then<00:01:27.810> every<00:01:28.170> piece<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.409> pops<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> look

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
then every piece that pops out a look

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490 
then every piece that pops out a look
kind<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.790> fuzzy<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.630> did<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> lot<00:01:31.320> of

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
kind of fuzzy so I did what a lot of

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
kind of fuzzy so I did what a lot of
sculptors<00:01:32.460> will<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.450> made<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
sculptors will do and I made a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.800 
sculptors will do and I made a
preliminary<00:01:34.320> mold<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.790> little<00:01:36.090> guy<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
preliminary mold this little guy here I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.740 
preliminary mold this little guy here I
did<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> one-piece<00:01:37.650> mold<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.970> cranked<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
did as a one-piece mold and I cranked it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.050 
did as a one-piece mold and I cranked it
out<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.409> fast<00:01:40.860> because<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> knew<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
out really really fast because I knew I

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.910 
out really really fast because I knew I
was<00:01:42.509> only<00:01:42.780> gonna<00:01:42.899> cast<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.350> couple<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> pieces

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
was only gonna cast a couple of pieces

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.730 
was only gonna cast a couple of pieces
from<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.360> pieces<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.869> got<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> here

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
from this the pieces I got out of here

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.670 
from this the pieces I got out of here
were<00:01:47.670> these<00:01:47.820> rough<00:01:48.180> kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.780> dudes<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
cast from a polyurethane plastic resin

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.929 
cast from a polyurethane plastic resin
and<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.710> sand<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.369> my<00:01:59.490> heart's<00:01:59.790> content
