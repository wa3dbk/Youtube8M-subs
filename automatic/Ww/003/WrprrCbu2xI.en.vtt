00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.750 
so he does also come with a sad face and
we<00:03:39.290> can<00:03:39.440> assume<00:03:39.710> that's<00:03:39.950> when<00:03:40.100> he's<00:03:40.250> lost<00:03:40.490> his

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
we can assume that's when he's lost his

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.470 
we can assume that's when he's lost his
balloon<00:03:41.240> is<00:03:41.480> floated<00:03:41.870> away<00:03:41.960> into<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.590> sky

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
balloon is floated away into the sky

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.700 
balloon is floated away into the sky
okay<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:44.540> there<00:03:44.780> we<00:03:44.810> go<00:03:44.870> there<00:03:45.230> are<00:03:45.470> two

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
okay so there we go there are two

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.230 
okay so there we go there are two
minifigures<00:03:46.370> let's<00:03:46.700> take<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.880> look<00:03:47.090> at<00:03:47.120> the

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
minifigures let's take a look at the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.430 
minifigures let's take a look at the
balloon<00:03:47.450> cart<00:03:47.780> itself<00:03:48.140> now<00:03:49.660> okay<00:03:50.660> so<00:03:50.720> there<00:03:51.200> is

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
balloon cart itself now okay so there is

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.100 
balloon cart itself now okay so there is
the<00:03:51.680> balloon<00:03:52.070> car<00:03:52.550> let's<00:03:52.880> take<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> 360<00:03:53.780> view<00:03:53.810> of

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
the balloon car let's take a 360 view of

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:17.180 
the balloon car let's take a 360 view of
this<00:03:54.200> now

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.820 

okay<00:04:18.190> background<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.270> the<00:04:19.660> side<00:04:20.080> so<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.470> couple

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
okay background to the side so a couple

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.590 
okay background to the side so a couple
of<00:04:21.010> features<00:04:21.190> on<00:04:21.459> this<00:04:21.580> we<00:04:21.790> have<00:04:21.970> this<00:04:22.240> area

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
of features on this we have this area

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.190 
of features on this we have this area
here<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:23.170> little<00:04:23.980> cupboard<00:04:24.480> does<00:04:25.480> come<00:04:25.810> down<00:04:25.840> we

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
here a little cupboard does come down we

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.380 
here a little cupboard does come down we
have<00:04:26.290> some<00:04:26.440> pieces<00:04:26.740> in<00:04:27.070> there<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.520> would<00:04:28.270> assume

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
have some pieces in there I would assume

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.600 
have some pieces in there I would assume
this<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.020> for<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.380> accessories<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.370> tie<00:04:30.550> the

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
this is for the accessories to tie the

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.470 
this is for the accessories to tie the
balloons<00:04:31.060> up<00:04:31.330> etc<00:04:32.490> two<00:04:33.490> studs<00:04:34.060> an<00:04:34.180> errand

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
balloons up etc two studs an errand

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.550 
balloons up etc two studs an errand
orange<00:04:34.780> stud<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.980> red<00:04:36.670> stud<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:38.380> obviously

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
orange stud and a red stud and obviously

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.420 
orange stud and a red stud and obviously
the<00:04:38.740> trends<00:04:39.190> loosen<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:39.940> clear<00:04:40.210> adult

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
the trends loosen to clear adult

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.950 
the trends loosen to clear adult
obviously<00:04:42.430> round<00:04:42.760> to<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.000> rear<00:04:43.300> we<00:04:43.690> have

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
obviously round to the rear we have

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.210 
obviously round to the rear we have
these<00:04:45.510> containers<00:04:46.510> here<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.170> this<00:04:47.350> would<00:04:47.680> one

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
these containers here and this would one

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.910 
these containers here and this would one
would<00:04:48.460> assume<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:48.880> for<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.090> helium<00:04:49.920> to

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
would assume is for the helium to

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.280 
would assume is for the helium to
obviously<00:04:51.220> go<00:04:51.490> inside<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.300> balloons<00:04:52.630> through

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
obviously go inside the balloons through

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.360 
obviously go inside the balloons through
the<00:04:53.880> valves<00:04:54.880> at<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.480> top<00:04:56.080> then<00:04:56.890> obviously<00:04:57.070> we

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
the valves at the top then obviously we

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.940 
the valves at the top then obviously we
have<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:58.090> free<00:04:58.660> or<00:04:58.840> add<00:04:59.020> three<00:04:59.380> different<00:04:59.800> kind

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
have a free or add three different kind

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.620 
have a free or add three different kind
of<00:04:59.980> balloons<00:05:00.280> here<00:05:00.520> already<00:05:00.910> blown<00:05:01.210> up<00:05:01.420> and

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
of balloons here already blown up and

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.680 
of balloons here already blown up and
they<00:05:01.780> just<00:05:02.020> simply<00:05:02.820> take<00:05:03.820> all<00:05:04.000> three<00:05:04.390> of<00:05:04.420> those

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
they just simply take all three of those

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.150 
they just simply take all three of those
out<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:07.150> can<00:05:07.330> see<00:05:07.600> there<00:05:07.870> they<00:05:08.080> simply<00:05:08.620> sit

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
out you can see there they simply sit

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.540 
out you can see there they simply sit
down<00:05:09.900> through<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.080> three<00:05:11.500> different<00:05:11.980> slots

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
down through the three different slots

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.480 
down through the three different slots
there<00:05:12.970> i'm<00:05:13.840> going<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.080> hold<00:05:14.260> down<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:15.160> kind<00:05:15.400> of

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490

the<00:05:15.580> basket<00:05:16.060> area<00:05:16.420> down<00:05:16.690> here<00:05:16.720> that's<00:05:17.410> the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
the basket area down here that's the

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.920 
the basket area down here that's the
rear<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:18.790> closer<00:05:19.090> look<00:05:19.330> at<00:05:19.420> those<00:05:19.570> balloons

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
but they do look pretty cool so in total

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.970 
but they do look pretty cool so in total
