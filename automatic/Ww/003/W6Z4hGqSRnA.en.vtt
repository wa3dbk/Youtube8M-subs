00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.500
 I was never the owner of Cardinal Mazzarino nick was a helmet 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.750
 so called door of the langhe first country that opens the Piedmontese langa 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.250
 the Cardinal Mazzarino, a historic residence that was 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.939
 u in 1399 until 1948 a convent of Carmelite nuns 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.180
 the comment was then shot later became a mansion 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.089
 history 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.590
 with a garden that is part of the historic gardens of Piedmont 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.160
 and today it is an alicia molestan the corner cameras 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.579
 the keeping structure try to maintain 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.629
 what was what was the original plant of the convent and his 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.369
 features of the country house if we want 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.650
 accompanies me small marine - castelnuovo 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.679
 this is the carmel garden 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.879
 here ze carmela because it is a photo of a convent of nuns 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.789
 Carmelites a secret garden like many others like many in Cherasco 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.970
 and you can't see anything from the outside, it's all surrounded by love 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.980
 hehe here we see the area of ​​the top 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.980
 here next to me is the port area 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.010
 it is a wild garden registered in the wild jardin register 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.450
 of piedmont as you can see absolutely regular with siori e 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.590
 plants that sprout everywhere in a mess and in my opinion a lot 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.750
 charming 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.100
 and now we enter the terminal 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.790
 we pass under the portico 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.320
 the porch and has the original column bases of the era as you can see 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.920
 there remain only that there remains while there are balconies 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.720
 little later. between the times already of the nuns 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.020
 the cardinal's restaurant is divided into 3 rooms as he said of acetate by 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.900
 keep the original layout of the house as much as possible 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.640
 it's the atmosphere as you can see a very familiar webcam stack of books for 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.039
 our times 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.669
 a little room a little bit more 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.209
 collection 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.459
 It was born as a butterfly 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.740
 which hosts the large realizing environments with you can see however are all the 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:25.990
 very small rooms 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.750
 we host a maximum of 35 people to try to 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.940
 still at most every wound that some of our kitchen even now there is 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.829
 I will tell you this requires 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.650
 behind me the kitchen of the cardinal who gives on the garden so thanks also 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.700
 because the quality of life of those in the kitchen is important 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.640
 in the kitchen amelia clear the cook from my restaurant slow food extraction a 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.660
 for a kitchen 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.829
 of the territory then Langarola 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.980
 very simple hey hey seasonal snow 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.900
 all the ingredients we use come from the territory 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.700
 and extremely traditional recipes from the area are combined 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.050
 with some small incursion of beginning of amelia activity when in the paths 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.189
 vicenza 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.599
 this is our kitchen 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.090
 as you can see amelia coming and working spoken of action and all the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.279
 tracing are of last generation 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:24.549
 hehe as I said it is a traditional cuisine of the territory 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.989
 where we are looking for is the variety and well we change our menu 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.219
 every 3 weeks is too much to reward the variety of a rich kitchen like 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.489
 the one that is not present 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.439
 we are facing the years entering the external façade of the road from 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.400
 only via san pietro in the historic center of castro 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.530
 the house is its origins in 400 and then undergoes a series of interventions 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.090
 later 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.180
 eheh in the Napoleonic era 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.660
 dates events had number 37 today 48 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.660
 it is still the Napoleonic number 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.489
 the house the torrid abode of the maddalena owes its name then 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.510
 significant passage of cables to Mazzarino Cherasco 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.510
 to stop the so-called peace of helmet. 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:17.010
 as I said, it happens later to become a convent of nuns 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.549
 icon we still keep 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.989
 the bell 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.639
 original 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.639
 and now follow me to visit the room 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
 we go up from the original scale of the comment 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.059
 and let's start at the abbess's room 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.129
 there are only three terminal rooms 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.279
 we have the room of the abbess the room of the cardinal's relase son 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.039
 obviously 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.500
 are all the rooms 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.110
 canon tries to keep fr again 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.639
 the original convent shabby 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.809
 nico about age are very large room I fear very very large 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:54.300
 the first is subdivided 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.749
 in venzone 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:59.069
 and is therefore the abbess a little more feminine with these flowers with i 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:04:59.890
 sketches 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.050
 and fashion attached to the walls 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.199
 the area of ​​the prayer with the kneeling and the original of the time 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.199
 conventual 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
 and we continue into the prior's room 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.150
 the fanta detrarre characterized by a canopy bed and not called calm 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.740
 on the belle époque a style and 'from a beautiful Napoleonic amadè with nel 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.639
 double delivery characteristic of real estate called k. 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.770
 another very thing 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.089
 original karin of the era 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:41.729
 and in the bathrooms 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.360
 we have speed 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.650
 in which evidently even the nuns used some tricks 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.589
 some stain you have 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.589
 finally the cardinal's thirst 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.919
 the suite inside two rooms 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.700
 so it accommodates up to 4 people we have again 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.639
 I have a four-poster bed as you can see all of ours 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.750
 Upholstery all our Czech coin respiration and fashionable bedspreads 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:13.650
 of the time and in short from in we llaman you a picture of the mandarin 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.190
 data we have. try to copy the fabrics 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.699
 and be 'identity to reproduce them almost very similar we say 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.719
 the writing is composed. as he used to say in the bedroom 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:31.869
 so we also have a bedroom with twin beds and from here it's perfect for 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:33.650
 a family 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.809
 from the walks 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:40.100
 we always have different monuments around the cardinal 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.759
 the church of the convent the Madonna 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.900
 santa maria del popolo de among the trees 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.430
 and print of sant'agostino
