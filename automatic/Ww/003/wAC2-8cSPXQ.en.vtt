00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.700
 Well, hello to all my dear friends and I 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.740
 I have recently in the comments under one 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.599
 read from the movies 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 another comment about flash 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.920
 pomegranate that is a guy there strongly 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.930
 I wondered how I was like that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.930
 way quickly throwing down two grenades 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.650
 why is this comment regular yes 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.590
 because so many people asked me 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.480
 how am I doing this and so I decided 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.309
 write so small 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.520
 a very small training video 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.680
 Immediately I will say that this is not any bindy 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.590
 This is not some kind of script and no there 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.719
 aliases it is generally no 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.390
 no need for additional software 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.789
 you only need the index finger and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.920
 left mouse button means leans back 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.199
 all this is very simple let's imagine 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.649
 we want to let the situation want to throw a haeshka 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.870
 on the ridge that we do for this and just 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.059
 we aim we press the left mouse button our 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 grenade swings then when we 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.580
 we want to throw we just take it like this 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.650
 and we let it fly away somewhere 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.740
 explodes in principle no matter yes let's 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 repeat the same with smoke to 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.799
 wipe we press the left button 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.229
 mice to throw it away we just 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.150
 now let go of flash drives and we have two 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.610
 pieces and we want and throw two 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.250
 at the same time we are doing this 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.850
 next we press the left mouse button 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.829
 and gratman swings when we want 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.720
 we throw and let go and you immediately 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.450
 press the left button again 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.060
 mice and again throw back grant that is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.790
 here you need to respond quickly that is 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.500
 while the grenade flies away from us then to us 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.500
 need to have time to press the left button again 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.540
 mice let's see again and here you are 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.540
 can follow the actions of my hands 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.470
 Well and this I think you can 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.229
 finish if you want some other 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.360
