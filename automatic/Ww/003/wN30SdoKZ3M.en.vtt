00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.960
 hi hello here lyon and well I bring you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.650
 an exclusive video from here of the channel that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.110
 the truth 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.599
 I do not think they find it in someone else 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.219
 place or yes yes it will take a little or 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.790
 they will take it from here 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.560
 and well what is this is a video about the 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.970
 johan and tommaso that both were 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.890
 shrinking what is the game of 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.800
 minecraft and when they are playing 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.410
 minecraft 0.8 point zero and well let's 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.309
 give play or that as here you can see 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.749
 is the main card and the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.600
 rails propelled as you can see there 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:42.859
 is the new inventory in creative that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.749
 it looks amazing it's really fine 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.699
 placed everything and here what is going to 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:50.789
 be good because it's going to approach that 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.949
 part and going to throw a pig is going to 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.479
 propel ok 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.159
 there is excellent as can merida 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.530
 it works quite well there is the 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:02.140
 creative inventory as I tell you 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.720
 and although it seems that goes exposes to the other 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.570
 Over there 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.090
 ok the back to the car and goodbye 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 be doha I do not know the truth is incredible 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.830
 this 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.360
 really that as soon as I started to see 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.970
 this video I said wow what do I have to 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.350
 share with everyone so they see this and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.830
 well you can also talk some 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.070
 things about How it works 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.050
 example there is commenting and as soon as 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 at the viewing distance that is 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.460
 much longer and then you can appreciate 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.080
 pretty and there you can still see the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 pig that keeps moving in the part 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.900
 below and also the pictures of the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.760
 items are also transparent as not 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.240
 they had promised us they had not 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.520
 taught 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.490
 also the water looks lighter while 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.470
 The closer you are to the person 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.509
 player also the viewing distance 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.060
 already has like that various ceilings like 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.060
 they could see in the part there and look 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.399
 there is lengthening the vision much more 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.890
 ok there is loading the map little by little 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.510
 Pacifiers as always 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.440
 and nothing really that looks pretty 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.700
 incredible and we are going to advance a little 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.280
 in this part where will you get what is 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.880
 how is it that the animals chase you 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.560
 I think it's a little bit further back in this 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.480
 part to see see 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.510
 I think that if I do not remember well 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.220
 it was further back I do not remember there are anymore 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.460
 a good pig that was already throwing 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.770
 apparently 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.380
 and it is exposed that right now he is going to show 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.390
 how is it that animals follow them 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.770
 ok I supposed to think also 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.280
 can with the seeds as you can see 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.160
 this carrot potato and has a wheat in 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.310
 the hand to see let's see what is going 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.310
 to do 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.090
 I suppose they are discussing something and not 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.630
 I know very well but you can appreciate it 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.870
 while what is the inventory in 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.570
 creative that looks great ok there it is 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.300
 taking out the seeds of the new 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.340
 food that they added 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.350
 and it seems to me that with any food 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.480
 the animals can not continue 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.440
 look there, the service is there 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.060
 following apparently or otherwise safer 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.280
 with a carrot there you can see 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.780
 and he's following it and it does not look great 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.540
 ok there is the little pig chasing 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.000
 johan with the carrot out there there's another 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.250
 and another and everyone is added to the party 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.620
 today really that looks amazing I'm 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.810
 very very excited because by power 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.370
 playing it really has no idea 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.440
 how much 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.600
 although like that there was a little bit 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.610
 from the apparently 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.620
 but well let's try to advance what 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.700
 another little bit to see what else he has for us 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.849
 here 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:04.880
 ok you are looking at the inventory again 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:06.860
 see on this side it looks like it's going to plant 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.790
 to see does not seem that it is only 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.790
 talking about some things 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.770
 and what I want to see is that other 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.770
 surprises have us out there 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.090
 although nothing else that loads the video 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.280
 upload video very well 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.970
 I want to think that at this moment it's going to 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.680
 plant or something like that and so let's see 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.449
 what can johan do in this 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.940
 As you can see, the 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.960
 rails and so on we are followed by 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.830
 animals and how can you see is 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.530
 starting to want to plant and what is 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.919
 doing is a very handsome little room very 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.830
 well is expanding the area what 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.840
 I want to see also is yes 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.790
 as it is said m 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.790
 if only the seeds of 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.550
 always doing that too for example 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.590
 something that happened to me is that there is already 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.060
 which is called tall grass but only 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.580
 in creative it seems to me that they still do not go 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.850
 to generate in survival mode if 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.110
 some if they realized it 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.660
 it seems that only should be in mode 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.400
 creative putting the tall grass but 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.979
 well, it is progressing little by little 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.210
 almost a fact that for the 0.9 point zero 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.710
 then you can put what is the 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.660
 good the tall grass is generated as a 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.660
 new world ok there is planting 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.470
 the exclusive food of minecraft and the 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.180
 is growing there we can see very 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.180
 well everything grows very handsome 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.620
 the animation looks pretty good at 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.630
 just like the colors you see looks great 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.210
 and nothing really that I hope impatiently 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.169
 this seems to me that the video no longer takes 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.090
 to finish and nothing I hope you have 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.509
 liked this exclusive video from here of 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.220
 channel is great we are already seeing a 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.289
 How is everything going to work? 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.740
 in the case of the rails that is like 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.330
 the most incredible thing about this video and nothing 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.490
 I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.620
 subscribe and if you have not yet done 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.490

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.139
 next video see you later 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.139
 allowing the enclave of the end
