remember<00:00:11.170> that<00:00:11.320> the<00:00:11.469> fundamental<00:00:12.279> thing<00:00:12.549> I'm

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
remember that the fundamental thing I'm

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.549 
remember that the fundamental thing I'm
trying<00:00:13.059> to<00:00:13.209> teach<00:00:13.420> in<00:00:13.629> this<00:00:13.779> workshop<00:00:14.289> is

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
trying to teach in this workshop is

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.210 
trying to teach in this workshop is
using<00:00:14.949> Opaques<00:00:15.490> and<00:00:15.910> in<00:00:16.090> this<00:00:16.240> case<00:00:16.600> whites

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
using Opaques and in this case whites

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.190 
using Opaques and in this case whites
with<00:00:18.220> transparent<00:00:18.970> washes<00:00:19.450> over<00:00:19.570> top<00:00:19.960> of

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
with transparent washes over top of

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.060 
with transparent washes over top of
those<00:00:20.350> white<00:00:20.710> marks<00:00:21.220> to<00:00:21.940> convey<00:00:22.360> texture<00:00:23.140> okay

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
those white marks to convey texture okay

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.040 
those white marks to convey texture okay
I<00:00:24.280> want<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:24.940> white<00:00:25.240> to<00:00:25.510> look<00:00:25.690> like<00:00:25.900> the

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
I want the white to look like the

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.350 
I want the white to look like the
texture<00:00:26.680> and<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:27.369> wash<00:00:27.610> is<00:00:27.850> to<00:00:28.000> make<00:00:28.150> it<00:00:28.330> look

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
texture and the wash is to make it look

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.420 
texture and the wash is to make it look
like<00:00:28.690> colored<00:00:29.140> texture<00:00:29.740> when<00:00:30.100> I<00:00:30.130> take

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
like colored texture when I take

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.330 
like colored texture when I take
something<00:00:30.940> as<00:00:31.090> simple<00:00:31.539> as<00:00:31.660> this<00:00:31.869> bark<00:00:32.680> it<00:00:33.160> has

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
something as simple as this bark it has

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.880 
something as simple as this bark it has
a<00:00:33.370> lot<00:00:33.670> of<00:00:33.820> facets<00:00:34.420> to<00:00:34.539> it<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:35.109> I<00:00:35.379> could<00:00:35.589> spend

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
a lot of facets to it and I could spend

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.180 
a lot of facets to it and I could spend
hours<00:00:36.069> drawing<00:00:36.879> every<00:00:37.539> little<00:00:37.839> detail<00:00:38.159> but<00:00:39.159> I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
hours drawing every little detail but I

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.950 
hours drawing every little detail but I
thought<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:39.819> would<00:00:39.940> be<00:00:40.059> interesting<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.719> show

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
thought it would be interesting to show

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.110 
thought it would be interesting to show
you<00:00:40.989> something<00:00:41.739> I've<00:00:41.890> come<00:00:42.190> up<00:00:42.399> with<00:00:42.609> the<00:00:42.879> gets

you something I've come up with the gets
this<00:00:43.359> job<00:00:43.659> done<00:00:44.019> a<00:00:44.050> lot<00:00:44.319> sooner<00:00:44.679> I'll<00:00:45.039> take<00:00:45.429> an

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
this job done a lot sooner I'll take an

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.700 
this job done a lot sooner I'll take an
ordinary<00:00:45.879> sheet<00:00:46.479> of<00:00:46.629> bond<00:00:46.899> paper<00:00:49.350> cut<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.469> to<00:00:50.649> a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
ordinary sheet of bond paper cut it to a

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.790 
ordinary sheet of bond paper cut it to a
manageable<00:00:51.010> size<00:00:51.760> and<00:00:52.239> crumple<00:00:53.019> it<00:00:53.170> up<00:00:53.319> I'd

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
manageable size and crumple it up I'd

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.069 
manageable size and crumple it up I'd
rather<00:00:54.100> use<00:00:54.489> this<00:00:54.729> thin<00:00:54.999> paper<00:00:55.269> towel<00:00:55.659> or

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
rather use this thin paper towel or

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.680 
rather use this thin paper towel or
t-shirt<00:00:56.559> material<00:00:57.069> or<00:00:57.639> whatever<00:00:57.789> but<00:00:58.420> if<00:00:58.539> you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
t-shirt material or whatever but if you

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.930 
t-shirt material or whatever but if you
look<00:00:58.870> at<00:00:59.019> that<00:00:59.139> pattern<00:00:59.769> that<00:00:59.829> that's<00:01:00.190> created

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
look at that pattern that that's created

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.840 
look at that pattern that that's created
do<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:01.959> see<00:01:02.289> a<00:01:02.319> resemblance<00:01:02.799> to<00:01:03.129> anything<00:01:03.699> in

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
do you see a resemblance to anything in

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.690 
do you see a resemblance to anything in
that<00:01:03.999> bark<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:05.320> facets<00:01:06.040> that<00:01:06.220> are<00:01:06.370> in<00:01:06.490> this

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
that bark the facets that are in this

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.120 
that bark the facets that are in this
bark<00:01:07.119> might<00:01:07.930> be<00:01:08.110> something<00:01:08.560> else<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:08.950> could

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
bark might be something else you could

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.819 
bark might be something else you could
look<00:01:09.280> at<00:01:09.490> there's<00:01:09.969> a<00:01:10.060> potential<00:01:10.600> for<00:01:11.049> me<00:01:11.259> to

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
look at there's a potential for me to

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.270 
look at there's a potential for me to
take<00:01:12.130> this<00:01:12.460> piece<00:01:13.329> of<00:01:13.600> paper<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.259> dip<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:15.070> into

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
take this piece of paper and dip it into

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.999 
take this piece of paper and dip it into
a<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:16.200> well<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.500> white<00:01:17.829> and<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:19.659> apply<00:01:20.469> it<00:01:20.500> in

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
a a well of white and then apply it in

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.230 
a a well of white and then apply it in
whatever<00:01:21.850> form<00:01:22.479> I<00:01:22.719> want<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.380> see<00:01:24.340> if<00:01:24.609> I<00:01:25.000> can

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
whatever form I want and see if I can

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.200 
whatever form I want and see if I can
create<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.930> bark<00:01:26.409> like<00:01:26.770> under<00:01:27.520> painting<00:01:27.789> I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
create a bark like under painting I

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.969 
create a bark like under painting I
don't<00:01:28.630> think<00:01:28.869> it's<00:01:29.020> going<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.200> take<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.469> lot<00:01:29.799> of

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
don't think it's going to take a lot of

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.700 
don't think it's going to take a lot of
imagination<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:31.020> understand<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.229> one<00:01:32.469> these

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
imagination to understand that one these

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.789 
imagination to understand that one these
marks<00:01:33.250> are<00:01:33.490> covered<00:01:34.149> with<00:01:34.659> Browns<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.500> are

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
marks are covered with Browns that are

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.770 
marks are covered with Browns that are
darker<00:01:36.310> maybe<00:01:36.490> at<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.880> first<00:01:37.179> part<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.659> then

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
darker maybe at the first part and then

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.440 
darker maybe at the first part and then
successively<00:01:38.350> lighter<00:01:38.950> washes<00:01:39.670> as<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:39.880> do<00:01:40.030> more

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
successively lighter washes as I do more

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.349 
successively lighter washes as I do more
of<00:01:40.509> these<00:01:40.869> you'll<00:01:41.409> create<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:42.130> feeling<00:01:42.609> of<00:01:42.880> bark

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
of these you'll create a feeling of bark

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.719 
of these you'll create a feeling of bark
I'll<00:01:43.570> let<00:01:44.320> some<00:01:44.649> of<00:01:44.770> these<00:01:44.859> dry<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.490> maybe

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
I'll let some of these dry and maybe

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.929 
I'll let some of these dry and maybe
come<00:01:46.060> back<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.600> them<00:01:46.810> but<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.979> idea<00:01:48.429> is<00:01:48.700> to

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
come back to them but the idea is to

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.789 
come back to them but the idea is to
show<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.719> there<00:01:49.960> are<00:01:50.109> ways<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.380> make

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
show you that there are ways to make

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.819 
show you that there are ways to make
complex<00:01:51.549> things<00:01:51.999> in<00:01:52.240> nature<00:01:52.560> happen<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.679> lot

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
complex things in nature happen a lot

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.760 
complex things in nature happen a lot
faster

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
faster

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.829 
faster
you
