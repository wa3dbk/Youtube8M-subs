explain to you now so you will know is
that<00:00:24.650> a<00:00:24.830> piano<00:00:25.220> is<00:00:27.070> based<00:00:28.070> on<00:00:28.250> steps<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.810> if<00:00:29.990> you

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
that a piano is based on steps so if you

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.710 
that a piano is based on steps so if you
move<00:00:30.349> up<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.519> piano<00:00:31.880> you<00:00:32.390> take<00:00:33.040> steps<00:00:34.040> up

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
move up the piano you take steps up

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.940 
move up the piano you take steps up
right<00:00:35.890> every<00:00:36.890> step<00:00:37.160> up<00:00:37.400> is<00:00:38.620> half<00:00:39.620> a<00:00:39.770> step

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
right every step up is half a step

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.800 
right every step up is half a step
that's<00:00:40.100> what<00:00:40.310> they<00:00:40.460> call<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.700> half<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.030> step<00:00:41.120> so

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
that's what they call a half a step so

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.100 
that's what they call a half a step so
from<00:00:42.050> I<00:00:42.140> see<00:00:42.380> to<00:00:42.590> a<00:00:42.620> c-sharp<00:00:43.490> is<00:00:44.270> half<00:00:44.810> step

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
from I see to a c-sharp is half step

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.280 
from I see to a c-sharp is half step
then<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.800> Adi<00:00:46.040> half<00:00:46.280> step<00:00:46.640> d<00:00:47.480> sharp<00:00:47.690> half<00:00:47.960> step

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
then to Adi half step d sharp half step

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.000 
then to Adi half step d sharp half step
e<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.790> goes<00:00:49.940> all<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.240> way<00:00:50.780> up<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.500> the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
e and it goes all the way up to the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.710 
e and it goes all the way up to the
right<00:00:52.810> of<00:00:53.810> the<00:00:53.890> piano<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:56.030> every<00:00:56.330> step<00:00:56.570> you

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
right of the piano so every step you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.800 
right of the piano so every step you
take<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.170> 0<00:00:57.380> point<00:00:57.680> 5<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:59.300> will<00:00:59.420> need<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.600> know

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
take is 0 point 5 you will need to know

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.420 
take is 0 point 5 you will need to know
this<00:00:59.990> when<00:01:00.380> I<00:01:00.410> explained<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.040> either<00:01:01.220> play

to do with the other way around so you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.370

grab<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.039> see<00:01:44.280> first<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.569> take<00:01:46.080> two<00:01:46.350> steps

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
grab your see first you take two steps

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.480 
grab your see first you take two steps
with<00:01:47.039> a<00:01:47.069> major<00:01:47.310> chord<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.390> point<00:01:48.690> 5<00:01:48.899> 11.5<00:01:49.860> two

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
