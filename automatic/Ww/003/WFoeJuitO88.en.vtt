00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.679
 After finishing the match, the general manager Jorge Valdano analyzed the 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:06.680
 Real Madrid television cameras the move that involved the expulsion of Kaka 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.259
 what is certain is that 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:11.809
 ee the player 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.709
 he wants to play 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.720
 there are other players that when they feel 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.140
 by the way is that they do not touch they are thrown to the ground tries to provoke the network card 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.630
 of the adversary 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.850
 Christians always wants to play always wants to follow the the the play and during 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.900
 in a good stretch what he was trying to release them c 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.820
 of an adversary who 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.440
 percent and seville 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.870
 the pretending 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.950
 slow it down 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.610
 with a continuous grab 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.340
 well, because 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.590
 first say that 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.590
 is logically injured 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.620
 All our consideration deserves 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.930
 I hope to also say that the intention of Christian is not that of 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.930
 assaulting the Christian's intention to continue playing 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.860
 it's something very similar to what happens when the ball goes out of bounds 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.110
 of the iata goal valley out running to court 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.220
 he wants to take it instantly because he has the desire to participate and 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.200
 to participate a lot in the game abc the team does not agree to agree a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.520
 little more rest 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.920
 but she is so anxious to play that everything will already be at its maximum 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 not good speed but you can not 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.850
 dt nothing that explained have to build the show you have to have 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.649
 those who do to interrupt the show but we have clear that 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.260
 consideration 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.510
 and then it is very difficult to do justice within a field not 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.850
 also the Portuguese wanted to give his face and before the media explained how he had 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.190
 seen the same 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.290
 pastor efficiency that understand football 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.530
 about the intention that I have to play free me 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.530
 they lie are always not only stressed I grabbed 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.149
 forever 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.410
 I aspire to valledupar to england with two years 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.710
 and beyond conan as england the pro only many times 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.370
 I learned in those years 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.720
 Well, they told me on Saturday with two shots they do that kind of thing or 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.799
 either because he has lost that 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.579
 I mean by this that my intention now jesus goux look for damages 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:22.230
 in or cheat the referees li who what happened and I talked to guys who 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:23.579
 has injured 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.699
 and that's what the serene mÃ©ndez told me today 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.999
 Perry, forgiveness, because your intention will be pruned. 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.619
 no I'm not denying that as he also a small boy 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.899
 one meter seventy hit him in the face 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:41.149
 what are you going to say now to do the interpretation that you want to see it 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.149
 understand by teenagers in Aramaic freedom 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:49.289
 i do that human mind unlucky to be stuck in the review 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:55.439
 look at the leaf who thinks that my opinion was a shame and in a well 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.429
 blind movement in a well do nothing quoted that an avalanche of the devesa then 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.429
 red focus alive I do not understand that kind of thing 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:08.239
 I'm calm the team won the most important thing but it's very good very 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.959
 sad for him because of what happened 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.789
 in my opinion it is not red onetti in the same way in the world
