and stuff but I ended up the best thing

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.970 
and stuff but I ended up the best thing
because<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.230> terrarium<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
because I have the the terrarium the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.549 
because I have the the terrarium the
exeter<00:00:41.520> terrariums<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.210> small<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
exeter terrariums are small and then you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.700 
exeter terrariums are small and then you
have<00:00:43.710> pretty<00:00:44.250> nice<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.820> tall<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
have pretty nice but tall one and the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.060 
have pretty nice but tall one and the
the<00:00:47.010> white<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:48.020> really<00:00:49.020> really<00:00:49.320> big<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.039> I

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the white one really really big so I

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.979 
the white one really really big so I
actually<00:00:50.280> found<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.850> bookshelf<00:00:51.120> aquarium

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

which is the same thing on the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.680 
which is the same thing on the
difference<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.149> doesn't<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
difference is that it doesn't have the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
difference is that it doesn't have the
doors<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.500> open<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.309> the

river rocks probably and make it into
the<00:04:15.940> fountain<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.599> it<00:04:17.049> will<00:04:17.199> cover

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
the fountain so it will cover

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.759 
the fountain so it will cover
the<00:04:18.859> reservoir<00:04:19.430> itself<00:04:19.669> itself<00:04:20.539> and<00:04:21.409> it<00:04:21.590> will

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
the reservoir itself itself and it will

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.159 
the reservoir itself itself and it will
come<00:04:22.039> up<00:04:22.069> like<00:04:22.970> I'll<00:04:23.270> probably<00:04:23.539> shorten<00:04:23.990> the

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
come up like I'll probably shorten the

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.790 
come up like I'll probably shorten the
the<00:04:24.710> lure<00:04:24.889> silicone<00:04:25.699> hose<00:04:25.939> shorten<00:04:26.900> up<00:04:26.990> or

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
the lure silicone hose shorten up or

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.600 
the lure silicone hose shorten up or
maybe<00:04:28.430> like<00:04:28.939> maybe<00:04:29.240> inch<00:04:29.659> and<00:04:30.439> the<00:04:30.889> little

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
maybe like maybe inch and the little

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.010 
maybe like maybe inch and the little
pile<00:04:31.849> of<00:04:31.879> frogs<00:04:32.270> will<00:04:32.419> come<00:04:32.629> up<00:04:32.750> all<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:32.960> way

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
pile of frogs will come up all the way

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.300 
pile of frogs will come up all the way
there<00:04:33.229> so<00:04:33.439> it<00:04:33.560> will<00:04:33.680> create<00:04:33.889> kinda<00:04:34.189> like<00:04:34.280> a

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
there so it will create kinda like a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.790 
there so it will create kinda like a
fountain<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:35.270> will<00:04:35.509> be<00:04:35.810> drooping<00:04:36.080> down<00:04:36.439> those

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
fountain it will be drooping down those

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.439 
fountain it will be drooping down those
rocks<00:04:37.219> I<00:04:37.550> think<00:04:37.849> there's<00:04:38.000> gonna<00:04:38.120> be<00:04:38.270> really

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
rocks I think there's gonna be really

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.559 
rocks I think there's gonna be really
cool<00:04:38.750> little<00:04:39.050> touch<00:04:39.199> and<00:04:39.939> put<00:04:40.939> those<00:04:41.090> I<00:04:41.150> think

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
cool little touch and put those I think

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.300 
cool little touch and put those I think
that<00:04:41.689> is<00:04:41.840> just<00:04:41.870> over<00:04:42.379> spray<00:04:42.620> I<00:04:42.650> sprayed<00:04:43.159> it

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
that is just over spray I sprayed it

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.550 
that is just over spray I sprayed it
with<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.520> water<00:04:43.819> to<00:04:44.210> get<00:04:44.360> all<00:04:44.539> the<00:04:44.719> dust<00:04:45.409> and

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560

gonna<00:05:31.940> be<00:05:32.120> really<00:05:32.330> pretty<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:33.050> think<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.620> really

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
gonna be really pretty I think it really

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.100 
gonna be really pretty I think it really
will<00:05:34.129> and<00:05:34.400> here<00:05:35.270> and<00:05:35.479> then<00:05:35.629> I<00:05:35.659> have<00:05:35.900> those

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
will and here and then I have those

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.619 
will and here and then I have those
little<00:05:36.379> onions<00:05:36.710> you<00:05:37.370> know<00:05:37.490> plant<00:05:37.879> that<00:05:38.150> so

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629 
little onions you know plant that so

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:40.510 
little onions you know plant that so
they<00:05:38.810> should<00:05:39.080> start<00:05:39.349> growing<00:05:39.710> also<00:05:40.129> and<00:05:40.310> I

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
they should start growing also and I

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.829 
they should start growing also and I
