slightly

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
slightly

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.170 
slightly
they<00:03:32.290> also<00:03:32.500> rotate<00:03:33.340> actually<00:03:33.970> right<00:03:34.150> here

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
they also rotate actually right here

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.030 
they also rotate actually right here
slightly<00:03:35.050> but<00:03:35.200> it's<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.350> bit<00:03:35.530> hindered<00:03:35.709> by<00:03:35.980> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
slightly but it's a bit hindered by the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.580 
slightly but it's a bit hindered by the
part<00:03:36.940> here<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.900> really<00:03:38.110> aren't<00:03:38.230> gonna<00:03:38.410> get

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
part here so you really aren't gonna get

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.530 
part here so you really aren't gonna get
a<00:03:38.650> whole<00:03:38.920> full<00:03:39.459> rotation<00:03:40.000> with<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.300> but

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
a whole full rotation with that but

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.350 
a whole full rotation with that but
bends<00:03:41.290> at<00:03:41.470> two<00:03:41.739> points<00:03:42.040> with<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.220> knee<00:03:42.370> goes

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
bends at two points with the knee goes

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.090 
bends at two points with the knee goes
fits<00:03:44.200> for<00:03:44.410> him<00:03:44.530> back<00:03:44.590> at<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.770> foot<00:03:44.950> and

rotates<00:03:45.459> at<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.580> foot<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.570> this<00:03:47.140> extra

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
rotates at the foot so this extra

the<00:05:40.060> detail<00:05:40.390> on<00:05:40.419> this<00:05:40.630> guy<00:05:40.780> because<00:05:40.960> it<00:05:41.080> is

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
the detail on this guy because it is

the detail on this guy because it is
really<00:05:41.770> nice<00:05:41.919> but<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.760> head<00:05:43.000> can<00:05:43.030> rotate

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
really nice but the head can rotate

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.730 
really nice but the head can rotate
around<00:05:43.600> but<00:05:43.840> it<00:05:43.930> gets<00:05:44.020> a<00:05:44.110> bit<00:05:44.289> hindered<00:05:44.440> by<00:05:44.710> the

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
around but it gets a bit hindered by the

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.469 
around but it gets a bit hindered by the
hood<00:05:45.070> or<00:05:45.280> the<00:05:45.580> hair<00:05:45.760> in<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:46.000> Cape

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
hood or the hair in the Cape

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.180 
hood or the hair in the Cape
but<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.930> hair<00:05:47.110> is<00:05:47.140> a<00:05:47.229> rubber<00:05:47.470> so<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:47.740> can<00:05:48.010> get

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
but the hair is a rubber so you can get

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.060 
but the hair is a rubber so you can get
some<00:05:48.539> flexibility<00:05:49.539> with<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:50.620> arms<00:05:50.950> can

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
some flexibility with that the arms can

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.950 
some flexibility with that the arms can
go<00:05:51.130> in<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.550> out<00:05:51.610> rotate<00:05:52.120> around<00:05:52.419> but<00:05:52.750> again

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
go in and out rotate around but again

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.690 
go in and out rotate around but again

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 
especially this or this Thor is just I'm

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.290 
especially this or this Thor is just I'm
blown<00:07:02.090> away<00:07:02.240> by<00:07:02.389> it<00:07:02.600> I<00:07:03.520> would<00:07:04.520> recommend<00:07:05.090> this

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
blown away by it I would recommend this

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.060 
blown away by it I would recommend this
path<00:07:05.930> if<00:07:06.169> you<00:07:06.229> don't<00:07:06.470> already<00:07:06.590> have<00:07:06.800> the

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
path if you don't already have the

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.379 
path if you don't already have the
figures<00:07:07.370> if<00:07:07.520> you<00:07:07.580> already<00:07:07.729> have<00:07:08.000> these<00:07:08.210> two

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:08.389 
figures if you already have these two

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:09.640 
figures if you already have these two
figures<00:07:08.750> and<00:07:08.900> it's<00:07:08.990> kind<00:07:09.199> of<00:07:09.320> pointless

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
figures and it's kind of pointless

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.570 
figures and it's kind of pointless
getting<00:07:10.040> it<00:07:10.130> because<00:07:10.280> they're<00:07:10.400> basically

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
getting it because they're basically

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.930 
getting it because they're basically
just<00:07:10.970> repacks<00:07:11.449> -<00:07:11.930> the<00:07:12.050> Thor's<00:07:12.290> new<00:07:12.530> paint

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
just repacks - the Thor's new paint

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.580 
just repacks - the Thor's new paint
other<00:07:14.449> than<00:07:14.630> that<00:07:14.780> I<00:07:14.810> mean<00:07:14.960> I<00:07:15.110> can't<00:07:15.410> really

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
other than that I mean I can't really

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:16.840 
other than that I mean I can't really
recommend<00:07:15.830> this<00:07:16.190> if<00:07:16.340> you<00:07:16.400> already<00:07:16.520> have<00:07:16.729> these

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:16.850 
recommend this if you already have these

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.029 
recommend this if you already have these
figures<00:07:17.150> but<00:07:17.270> if<00:07:17.389> you<00:07:17.479> don't<00:07:17.690> go<00:07:18.560> out<00:07:18.740> and<00:07:18.919> buy
