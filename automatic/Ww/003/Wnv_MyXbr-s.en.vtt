00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.059
 ignorant and welcome to youssef today 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.679
 to talk together a pasta 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.259
 au gratin with cheese the ingredients 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.010
 for 4 people it is 300 grams of pasta 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.980
 50 g of butter 25 of flour 400 grams of 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.869
 milk 150 g of mixed fontina cheese 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.060
 gruyere gorgonzola and 100 grams of 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.490
 fresh cream 50 g of Parmesan cheese 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.150
 grated and nutmeg coarse salt and 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.339
 fine salt 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.140
 we have moved forward slightly 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.660
 so we put in this bowl 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.430
 the milk and the sheets three cheeses then 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.200
 the gruviera fontina gorgonzola a 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.690
 macerate for a few hours 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.430
 now they are ready to be used 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.360
 now we will take the cream and the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.460
 we will boil on the fire between 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.410
 we will base the milk on the cheeses 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.390
 clearly filtering the milk there 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.460
 serves to make the bechamel in this 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.920
 small pan and in a side pan 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.899
 we will prepare the roux with half the butter e 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.670
 the flour to prepare it now 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.219
 we're going to get the butter, we'll put it 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.230
 in the pan we will then add the flour 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.000
 and when a compound will be created 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.830
 quite dense we will mix for a 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.729
 minute and we'll add it to the milk 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.729
 together with nutmeg 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.670
 we will mix with a whisk for about 10 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.619
 15 minutes and in the meantime we throw the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.039
 pasta obviously the pasta should be thrown in 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.039
 salt water 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.759
 the pasta is ready cooked, of course 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.220
 tooth because then in the oven 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.780
 so now it must be drained passed under 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.360
 cold water and then be me one 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.890

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.869

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.640
 béchamel and ready now we add 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.380

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.280
 add the boiling cream ei 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.840

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.459

 degrees for about twenty minutes 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.090
