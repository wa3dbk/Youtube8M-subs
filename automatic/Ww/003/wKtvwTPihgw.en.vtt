you can see me using here and the reason
i<00:04:24.840> picked<00:04:25.050> this<00:04:25.200> is<00:04:25.410> as<00:04:25.740> different<00:04:26.010> positives

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
i picked this is as different positives

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.730 
i picked this is as different positives
and<00:04:26.729> negatives<00:04:26.789> compared<00:04:27.539> to<00:04:27.599> the<00:04:27.659> 1911<00:04:28.020> and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.990 
and negatives compared to the 1911 and
the<00:04:28.830> reason<00:04:29.039> i<00:04:29.099> have<00:04:29.190> used<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.460> also<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.820> go

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
the reason i have used it also to go

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.339 
the reason i have used it also to go
with<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> theme<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.419> my<00:04:30.599> assault<00:04:30.870> rifle<00:04:31.229> and

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.090 
composite
weapons<00:04:33.780> that<00:04:33.900> are<00:04:34.020> light<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:34.410> durable<00:04:34.710> and

weapons that are light and durable and
very<00:04:35.220> compact<00:04:35.730> so<00:04:36.270> that's<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.600> reason<00:04:36.630> for

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
very compact so that's the reason for

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.380 
very compact so that's the reason for
this<00:04:37.050> weapon<00:04:37.410> now<00:04:38.400> whilst<00:04:38.640> it's<00:04:38.850> very<00:04:39.090> small

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
this weapon now whilst it's very small

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.300 
this weapon now whilst it's very small
it's<00:04:39.450> still<00:04:39.840> actually<00:04:39.990> chambers<00:04:40.590> 13<00:04:41.040> rounds

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
it's still actually chambers 13 rounds

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.250 
it's still actually chambers 13 rounds
plus<00:04:41.910> one<00:04:42.180> in<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.330> chamber<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:42.840> for<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:42.990> small

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
plus one in the chamber so for a small

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.900 
plus one in the chamber so for a small
pistol<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.740> still<00:04:43.950> packs<00:04:44.130> quite<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.460> punch<00:04:44.520> in

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
pistol it still packs quite a punch in

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.390 
pistol it still packs quite a punch in
terms<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:45.360> round<00:04:45.690> capacity<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.620> also<00:04:46.680> fires

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
terms of round capacity but also fires

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.710 
terms of round capacity but also fires
something<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.790> little<00:04:48.000> bit<00:04:48.270> bigger<00:04:48.480> than<00:04:48.540> 9

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
something a little bit bigger than 9

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.090 
something a little bit bigger than 9
millimeter<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.350> fires<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.650> 40<00:04:50.070> caliber

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
millimeter and it fires a 40 caliber

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.070 
millimeter and it fires a 40 caliber
round<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:50.820> it's<00:04:50.940> not<00:04:51.060> as<00:04:51.180> big<00:04:51.270> as<00:04:51.390> a<00:04:51.450> 45<00:04:51.900> but

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
round so it's not as big as a 45 but

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.450 
round so it's not as big as a 45 but
it's<00:04:52.200> bigger<00:04:52.380> than<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.590> 9<00:04:52.770> mil<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:53.190> you're<00:04:53.310> still

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
it's bigger than a 9 mil so you're still

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.070 
it's bigger than a 9 mil so you're still
packing<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:54.180> little<00:04:54.420> bit<00:04:54.540> more<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.840> punch

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
packing that little bit more of a punch

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.840 
packing that little bit more of a punch
so<00:04:55.710> there<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:55.920> go<00:04:55.980> guys<00:04:56.040> I<00:04:56.220> have<00:04:56.580> talked<00:04:56.790> you
