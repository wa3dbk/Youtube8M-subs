00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
just missing a couple things like the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.900

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.509 
front the front rod holder there and
this<00:01:02.910> handle<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.769> missing<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.100> cargo

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
this handle and it was missing the cargo

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
this handle and it was missing the cargo
net<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> back<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.470> went<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
net on the back so I just went and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.859 
net on the back so I just went and
picked<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.360> kind<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.659> wrap<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
picked this up and just kind of wrap it

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.359 
picked this up and just kind of wrap it
around<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.740> actually<00:01:10.860> hold<00:01:11.100> stuff

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
around this so I can actually hold stuff

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
around this so I can actually hold stuff
in<00:01:11.549> there<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.030> worry<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.930> know

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
in there not to worry about it you know

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.320 
in there not to worry about it you know
being<00:01:13.350> lost<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.340> got<00:01:14.520> flipped<00:01:14.909> over<00:01:15.119> or

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
being lost or if it got flipped over or

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.920 
being lost or if it got flipped over or
something<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.790> two<00:01:18.150> two<00:01:18.600> rod

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
something so it's got two two rod

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.039 
something so it's got two two rod
holders<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.530> back<00:01:20.479> just<00:01:21.479> place<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.990> your

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
holders in the back just place for your

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.370 
holders in the back just place for your
tackle<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.820> went<00:01:24.030> ahead<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.750> put<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> net

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
tackle and I went ahead I just put a net

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.969 
tackle and I went ahead I just put a net
on<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.259> got<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:31.619> inside

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
on here you know you got your inside

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
on here you know you got your inside
storage<00:01:33.020> something<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:35.060> went<00:01:36.060> ahead<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
storage something I went ahead and I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.109 
storage something I went ahead and I
should<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.079> bought<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.130> mounted<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
should just bought this and mounted it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.530 
should just bought this and mounted it
on<00:01:39.270> here

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.770 

it's<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.860> rail<00:01:46.070> blazer<00:01:47.170> Rob<00:01:48.170> holder<00:01:48.530> -<00:01:48.980> ah

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.510 

so<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:54.350> actually<00:01:54.680> worked<00:01:54.890> out<00:01:55.040> pretty<00:01:55.310> great

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
so it actually worked out pretty great

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.490 
so it actually worked out pretty great
that<00:01:55.760> it<00:01:55.910> fit<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.210> these<00:01:56.330> these<00:01:56.870> holes<00:01:57.170> because

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
that it fit in these these holes because

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.050 
that it fit in these these holes because
I<00:01:57.560> figured<00:01:57.890> I'm<00:01:58.040> not<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.460> be<00:01:58.550> using<00:01:58.940> them

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
I figured I'm not going to be using them

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.270 
I figured I'm not going to be using them
may<00:01:59.720> use<00:01:59.870> this<00:02:00.080> one<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:00.500> down<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:00.860> ever<00:02:01.100> use

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
may use this one but down I ever use

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.410 
may use this one but down I ever use
that<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:01.580> for<00:02:01.700> anything<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:04.180> I'll<00:02:05.180> probably

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
that one for anything so I'll probably

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.320 
that one for anything so I'll probably
end<00:02:05.660> up<00:02:05.780> mounting<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.640> fish<00:02:07.640> finder<00:02:07.850> up<00:02:08.149> there

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
end up mounting a fish finder up there

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.040 
end up mounting a fish finder up there
eventually<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.210> got<00:02:14.540> your<00:02:14.570> inside

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
eventually and then you got your inside

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:24.040 
eventually and then you got your inside
storage<00:02:15.440> here<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:22.480> actually<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.690> picked

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
storage here so I actually just picked

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.230 
storage here so I actually just picked
that<00:02:24.230> up<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:26.690> inside<00:02:27.110> here<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:28.210> can<00:02:29.210> just

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
that up and it's inside here I can just

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.900 
that up and it's inside here I can just
keep<00:02:29.480> keep<00:02:30.050> a<00:02:30.110> bunch<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:31.310> bunch<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.670> stuff

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
keep keep a bunch of you bunch of stuff

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.210 
keep keep a bunch of you bunch of stuff
down<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.150> there<00:02:32.390> my<00:02:32.540> paddle<00:02:32.960> and<00:02:33.950> it's

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
down in there my paddle and it's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.290 
down in there my paddle and it's
actually<00:02:34.490> kind<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.760> nice<00:02:34.910> because<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.270> can

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
actually kind of nice because you can

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.640 
actually kind of nice because you can
actually<00:02:35.540> take<00:02:35.810> your<00:02:35.840> fishing<00:02:36.290> pole<00:02:36.440> and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
actually take your fishing pole and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.270 
actually take your fishing pole and
stick<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.010> all<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.190> way<00:02:37.430> down<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.940> end<00:02:39.280> so

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
stick it all the way down to the end so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.880 
stick it all the way down to the end so
and<00:02:40.670> then<00:02:41.209> nothing<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.780> made<00:02:41.959> actually<00:02:42.740> made

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
and then nothing I made actually made

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.020 
and then nothing I made actually made
this<00:02:43.100> carp<00:02:43.750> PB<00:02:44.750> had<00:02:45.200> made<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> PVC<00:02:46.040> here<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:46.970> I

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
this carp PB had made a PVC here so I

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.960 
this carp PB had made a PVC here so I
can<00:02:47.209> set<00:02:47.540> my<00:02:48.230> kayak<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.220> wheeled

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
can set my kayak on it and wheeled

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.540 
can set my kayak on it and wheeled
around<00:02:50.180> because<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.230> does<00:02:51.410> really<00:02:51.620> like<00:02:51.770> 68

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550
