for us so i really don't have much
choice<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.100> i<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.189> set<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.640> light

unfortunately<00:01:13.010> since<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> lot

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
unfortunately since this is a lot

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460

electric-type<00:01:15.210> monotype<00:01:15.869> team<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.439> very

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
electric-type monotype team I'm very

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.990 
electric-type monotype team I'm very
wait<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> stealth<00:01:17.220> rock<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> probably

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
wait to stealth rock so it probably

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.149 
wait to stealth rock so it probably
isn't<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> best<00:01:18.390> monotype<00:01:19.020> tender<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.920> all

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
isn't the best monotype tender it's all

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.270 
isn't the best monotype tender it's all
good<00:01:20.400> anyway<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.680> lantern<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:22.799> an<00:01:22.950> absolute

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
good anyway so lantern was an absolute

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.130 
good anyway so lantern was an absolute
beast<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.759> battle<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.750> power

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
beast in this battle so this is my power

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.940 
beast in this battle so this is my power
of<00:01:25.259> fusion<00:01:25.650> lantern<00:01:27.259> it's<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.619> massive

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
of fusion lantern it's just a massive

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.830 
of fusion lantern it's just a massive
pain<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> ass<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> anyone<00:01:30.090> who<00:01:30.210> comes<00:01:30.630> up

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
pain in the ass the anyone who comes up

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.510 
pain in the ass the anyone who comes up
against<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.650> basically<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.220> two<00:01:32.340> one

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
against it you basically have two one

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.899 
against it you basically have two one
shot<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> want<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> kill<00:01:33.540> her<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.909> his

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
shot if you want to kill her so and his

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.300 
shot if you want to kill her so and his
spirit<00:01:36.329> whom<00:01:36.479> was<00:01:36.829> probably<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> best<00:01:38.100> wall

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
spirit whom was probably the best wall

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310 
spirit whom was probably the best wall
on<00:01:38.520> his<00:01:38.640> team<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> wanted<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:39.900> past<00:01:40.170> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
on his team so I wanted to get past that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.990 
on his team so I wanted to get past that
as<00:01:40.439> well<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.740> he<00:01:41.130> switched<00:01:41.250> into<00:01:41.579> Pinta<00:01:41.850> which

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
as well so he switched into Pinta which

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.249 
as well so he switched into Pinta which
was<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.270> little<00:01:42.450> bit<00:01:42.540> risky<00:01:42.840> there<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.170> I

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
was a little bit risky there because I

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
was a little bit risky there because I
could<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.500> burned<00:01:44.159> him<00:01:44.340> scold<00:01:44.790> hit<00:01:45.479> Smith

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
could have burned him scold hit Smith

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.080 
could have burned him scold hit Smith
earthquake<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:47.130> pretty<00:01:47.340> hard<00:01:47.610> actually

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
earthquake pretty pretty hard actually

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.179 
earthquake pretty pretty hard actually
so<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.810> gave<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> thunder<00:01:49.710> wave<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.009> slow

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
so I just gave the thunder wave to slow

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.410 
so I just gave the thunder wave to slow
that<00:01:50.340> thing<00:01:50.399> down<00:01:50.579> because<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.240> quite

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that thing down because it's got quite

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.389 
that thing down because it's got quite
good<00:01:51.659> speed<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.740> off<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.860> confusion

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
good speed and I get off the confusion

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.880 
good speed and I get off the confusion
as<00:01:53.460> well<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.970> he's<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> chance<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.409> attacking<00:01:55.680> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
as well so he's a chance of attacking is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.730 
as well so he's a chance of attacking is
about<00:01:56.159> about<00:01:57.000> 30<00:01:57.240> percentage<00:01:57.810> around<00:01:58.409> there

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
about about 30 percentage around there

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.910 
about about 30 percentage around there
ok<00:01:59.729> so<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> power<00:02:01.049> fusion<00:02:01.350> again<00:02:01.710> which

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
ok so I get the power fusion again which

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.160 
ok so I get the power fusion again which
is<00:02:01.950> cool<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.549> he<00:02:03.479> hurts<00:02:03.659> himself<00:02:03.840> in

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
is cool and he hurts himself in

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.859 
is cool and he hurts himself in
confusions<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.950> Down<00:02:05.189> Goes<00:02:05.399> kinsa<00:02:05.869> Jess

next to it gets a shadow sneak though

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.710 
next to it gets a shadow sneak though
which<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.840> cool<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:55.270> that's<00:02:56.270> a<00:02:56.330> good<00:02:56.450> move<00:02:56.600> to

thunderpunch<00:03:01.520> hits<00:03:01.850> I<00:03:02.120> think<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.720> would<00:03:02.840> have

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
thunderpunch hits I think it would have

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.550 
thunderpunch hits I think it would have
really<00:03:03.110> mattered<00:03:03.530> anyway<00:03:05.080> so<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:06.200> comes<00:03:06.320> it

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
really mattered anyway so in comes it

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.980 
really mattered anyway so in comes it
lastly<00:03:06.920> comes<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.220> qwilfish<00:03:07.550> hit<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:08.959> a

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
lastly comes to qwilfish hit that for a

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.290 
lastly comes to qwilfish hit that for a
fun<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.980> punchy<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.459> think<00:03:10.670> he<00:03:10.730> had<00:03:10.850> intimidate

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.570 
fun of punchy I think he had intimidate
on<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:11.600> thing<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:11.810> that's<00:03:12.320> why<00:03:12.830> didn't<00:03:13.459> his

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580
