hey<00:00:17.290> guys<00:00:17.470> so<00:00:17.650> today<00:00:17.680> we're<00:00:17.920> going<00:00:18.010> to<00:00:18.100> be

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
hey guys so today we're going to be

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.950 
hey guys so today we're going to be
going<00:00:18.310> over<00:00:18.490> components<00:00:19.330> versus<00:00:19.570> clocks<00:00:19.810> of

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
going over components versus clocks of

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.060 
going over components versus clocks of
speakers<00:00:20.320> today<00:00:20.530> we're<00:00:20.710> going<00:00:20.830> to<00:00:20.920> show<00:00:21.040> you

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
speakers today we're going to show you

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.730 
speakers today we're going to show you
the<00:00:21.250> jlc<00:00:21.790> 2's<00:00:22.090> got<00:00:22.780> the<00:00:22.870> components<00:00:23.140> on<00:00:23.410> your

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
the jlc 2's got the components on your

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.330 
the jlc 2's got the components on your
left<00:00:24.070> here<00:00:24.250> collapses<00:00:25.060> on<00:00:25.180> your<00:00:25.330> right<00:00:26.340> okay

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
left here collapses on your right okay

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.920 
left here collapses on your right okay
so<00:00:27.820> when<00:00:27.970> you're<00:00:28.090> deciding<00:00:28.300> between<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:28.750> two

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
so when you're deciding between the two

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.390 
so when you're deciding between the two
types<00:00:29.230> of<00:00:29.320> speakers<00:00:29.710> there's<00:00:29.920> several<00:00:30.130> things

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
types of speakers there's several things

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.940 
types of speakers there's several things
you<00:00:30.490> want<00:00:30.670> to<00:00:30.730> keep<00:00:30.910> in<00:00:31.030> mind<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:32.230> budget

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
you want to keep in mind one budget

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.290 
you want to keep in mind one budget
because<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.370> opponent<00:00:33.489> speakers<00:00:33.880> are<00:00:34.090> more

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
because the opponent speakers are more

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.600 
because the opponent speakers are more
expensive<00:00:34.570> than<00:00:34.750> colossal<00:00:35.200> speakers<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:36.400> the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
expensive than colossal speakers to the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.310 
expensive than colossal speakers to the
application<00:00:37.239> do<00:00:37.660> you<00:00:37.750> have<00:00:37.840> enough<00:00:37.989> room<00:00:38.290> to

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
application do you have enough room to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
little more where compared to a coaxial

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.320 
little more where compared to a coaxial
now<00:00:47.440> looking<00:00:47.890> at<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.160> coaxial<00:00:48.520> or<00:00:48.580> full-range

speaker<00:00:49.600> if<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:49.750> want<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.019> call<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:51.250> waste

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
speaker if you want to call it the waste

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.560 
speaker if you want to call it the waste
design<00:00:51.699> is<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.940> have<00:00:52.089> your<00:00:52.210> tweeter<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.510> the

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
design is you have your tweeter in the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.119 
design is you have your tweeter in the
middle<00:00:52.809> this<00:00:53.290> taste<00:00:53.589> caramel<00:00:53.800> your<00:00:54.010> high

middle this taste caramel your high

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.530 
middle this taste caramel your high
frequencies<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:54.940> then<00:00:55.330> you<00:00:55.390> have<00:00:55.480> your

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
frequencies and then you have your

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.750 
frequencies and then you have your
mid-range<00:00:55.750> loafer<00:00:56.230> over<00:00:56.440> here<00:00:56.680> this<00:00:57.610> will

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
mid-range loafer over here this will

play bit this is only supposed to be a

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.689 
play bit this is only supposed to be a
mid-range<00:00:59.379> bass<00:00:59.769> so<00:00:59.980> when<00:01:00.129> you're<00:01:00.250> not<00:01:00.550> for

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
mid-range bass so when you're not for

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.549 
mid-range bass so when you're not for
installing<00:01:01.030> this<00:01:01.269> if<00:01:01.479> you<00:01:01.690> have<00:01:01.839> a<00:01:01.870> deck<00:01:02.290> or<00:01:02.500> an

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
installing this if you have a deck or an

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.380 
installing this if you have a deck or an
aftermarket<00:01:02.920> amplifier<00:01:03.489> you<00:01:03.970> want<00:01:04.120> to<00:01:04.180> tune

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
aftermarket amplifier you want to tune

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.469 
aftermarket amplifier you want to tune
this<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.780> appropriate<00:01:05.290> frequency<00:01:06.479> now

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
this to the appropriate frequency now

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.490 
this to the appropriate frequency now
inside<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.810> here<00:01:07.990> that's<00:01:08.110> going<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.350> be<00:01:08.409> a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
inside of here that's going to be a

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.830 
inside of here that's going to be a
crossover<00:01:09.010> or<00:01:09.370> basically<00:01:10.270> it's<00:01:10.360> just<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.600> cap

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
crossover or basically it's just a cap

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.060 
crossover or basically it's just a cap
and<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.229> blocks<00:01:11.470> up<00:01:11.650> all<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:11.890> low<00:01:12.010> frequencies

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
and it blocks up all the low frequencies

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.420 
and it blocks up all the low frequencies
from<00:01:12.610> playing<00:01:12.880> out<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.000> here<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:17.560> going<00:01:17.979> on<00:01:18.130> to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
from playing out of here now going on to

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.880 
from playing out of here now going on to
components<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:20.350> biggest<00:01:20.650> thing<00:01:20.770> you'll

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
components the biggest thing you'll

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.680 
components the biggest thing you'll
notice<00:01:21.070> is<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.610> comes<00:01:21.790> with<00:01:21.910> this<00:01:22.240> well<00:01:22.570> this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
notice is it comes with this well this

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.110 
notice is it comes with this well this
is<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.840> crossover<00:01:23.320> house<00:01:23.680> inputs<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.490> outputs

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
is a crossover house inputs and outputs

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.410 
is a crossover house inputs and outputs
for<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.330> woofer<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:25.930> for<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.800> tweeter<00:01:27.420> now

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
for the woofer and for the tweeter now

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.030 
for the woofer and for the tweeter now
the<00:01:28.480> main<00:01:28.780> advantage<00:01:29.230> where<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.590> component

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
the main advantage where the component

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.560 
the main advantage where the component
is<00:01:30.160> you<00:01:30.400> can<00:01:30.520> see<00:01:30.700> that<00:01:30.880> it's<00:01:31.090> got<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.360> lot<00:01:31.540> more

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
is you can see that it's got a lot more

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.930 
is you can see that it's got a lot more
going<00:01:31.930> on<00:01:32.200> compared<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:33.280> your<00:01:33.730> coaxial<00:01:34.180> design

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
going on compared to your coaxial design

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.880 
going on compared to your coaxial design
so<00:01:36.940> basically<00:01:37.420> what<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:37.780> does<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.290> it<00:01:38.530> allows

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
so basically what it does is it allows

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.490 
so basically what it does is it allows
you<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.520> reproduce<00:01:39.970> music<00:01:40.690> more<00:01:40.990> accurately

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
you to reproduce music more accurately

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.040 
you to reproduce music more accurately
compared<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:43.330> other<00:01:43.450> differences

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
compared to this the other differences

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.380 
compared to this the other differences
is<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:45.040> tweeter<00:01:45.460> location

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
is the tweeter location

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.300 
is the tweeter location
now<00:01:47.050> we<00:01:47.140> see<00:01:47.320> on<00:01:47.410> this<00:01:47.560> right<00:01:47.890> now<00:01:48.010> it's<00:01:48.160> got

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
now we see on this right now it's got

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.650 
now we see on this right now it's got
the<00:01:48.400> flush<00:01:48.640> mount<00:01:48.940> so<00:01:49.120> you<00:01:49.210> have<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.480> make<00:01:49.630> a

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
the flush mount so you have to make a

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.770 
the flush mount so you have to make a
hole<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.320> I'll<00:01:50.590> mount<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.950> nice<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.280> flush

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
hole and I'll mount it nice and flush

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.060 
hole and I'll mount it nice and flush
the<00:01:52.780> advantage<00:01:53.140> of<00:01:53.170> having<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.650> component

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
the advantage of having a component

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.580 
the advantage of having a component
setup<00:01:54.250> is<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.670> can<00:01:54.790> place<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.270> tweener<00:01:55.590> for

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
setup is you can place the tweener for

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.040 
setup is you can place the tweener for
better<00:01:56.770> imaging<00:01:57.340> now<00:01:57.730> it<00:01:58.060> really<00:01:58.330> depends<00:01:58.780> on

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
better imaging now it really depends on

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.380 
better imaging now it really depends on
the<00:01:59.260> vehicle<00:01:59.680> because<00:02:00.040> on<00:02:00.490> some<00:02:00.790> vehicles<00:02:00.970> if

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
the vehicle because on some vehicles if

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.450 
the vehicle because on some vehicles if
you<00:02:01.510> kicked<00:02:01.810> out<00:02:02.050> pods<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:03.010> would<00:02:03.190> put<00:02:03.370> it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
you kicked out pods you would put it

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.880 
you kicked out pods you would put it
closer<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.210> woofer<00:02:04.660> other<00:02:05.260> vehicles<00:02:05.740> I've

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
closer to the woofer other vehicles I've

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.500 
closer to the woofer other vehicles I've
seen<00:02:06.070> people<00:02:06.310> put<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.580> eight<00:02:06.760> pillars<00:02:07.000> or<00:02:07.300> the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
seen people put the eight pillars or the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.710 
seen people put the eight pillars or the
doors<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:08.710> only<00:02:08.950> downside<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.610> this<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.030> if

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
doors the only downside to this is if

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.440 
doors the only downside to this is if
you<00:02:11.500> put<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.040> tweeter<00:02:12.310> too<00:02:12.730> far<00:02:13.180> away<00:02:13.330> from

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
you put the tweeter too far away from

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.410 
you put the tweeter too far away from
the<00:02:13.750> woofer<00:02:14.200> at<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.100> certain<00:02:15.550> point<00:02:15.790> your<00:02:16.180> ears

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the woofer at a certain point your ears

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.720 
the woofer at a certain point your ears
will<00:02:16.600> actually<00:02:16.870> start<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.050> detect<00:02:17.730> there's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
will actually start to detect there's

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.020 
will actually start to detect there's
actually<00:02:20.040> length<00:02:21.040> difference<00:02:21.310> between<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:21.910> so

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
actually length difference between it so

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.780 
actually length difference between it so
it's<00:02:22.180> up<00:02:22.300> an<00:02:22.420> image<00:02:22.780> properly<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.190> what<00:02:24.670> you're

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
it's up an image properly so what you're

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's up an image properly so what you're
actually<00:02:24.970> supposed<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.540> get<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.810> as

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
actually supposed to do is get this as

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.870 
actually supposed to do is get this as

problem is when you're dealing with car
audio<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.090> make<00:02:31.270> compromises<00:02:31.870> you

audio you have to make compromises you
can't<00:02:32.470> always<00:02:32.770> have<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.970> preferred

in<00:02:36.640> some<00:02:36.790> vehicles<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.420> sounds<00:02:37.750> been<00:02:37.900> the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
in some vehicles this sounds been the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.199 
in some vehicles this sounds been the
door<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.500> then<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.100> sounds<00:02:39.430> really<00:02:39.790> good<00:02:39.970> on

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
door and then this sounds really good on

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.820 
door and then this sounds really good on
the<00:02:40.360> a-pillar<00:02:40.750> bouncing<00:02:41.320> off<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.590> windshield

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.590 
the a-pillar bouncing off the windshield
it<00:02:42.190> really<00:02:42.400> depends<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.850> application<00:02:43.450> and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
it really depends on the application and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.479 
it really depends on the application and
the<00:02:43.690> listener<00:02:44.500> as<00:02:44.590> well<00:02:44.800> not<00:02:45.010> everyone's

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
the listener as well not everyone's

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.600 
the listener as well not everyone's
going<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.120> every<00:02:47.080> single<00:02:47.440> setup<00:02:47.709> so

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
going to like it every single setup so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.190 
going to like it every single setup so
the<00:02:49.000> best<00:02:49.180> thing<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.390> do<00:02:49.570> is<00:02:49.690> put<00:02:50.050> in<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
the best thing you do is put in the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.560 
the best thing you do is put in the
proper<00:02:50.350> product<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.340> do<00:02:51.880> as<00:02:51.940> best<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.239> install

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
proper product and do as best of install

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.030 

another<00:02:56.900> thing<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.200> consider<00:02:57.290> when<00:02:57.920> you're

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
another thing to consider when you're

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.430 
another thing to consider when you're
buying<00:02:58.099> speakers<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.209> whether<00:02:59.930> you're<00:03:00.290> going

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
buying speakers is whether you're going

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.690 
buying speakers is whether you're going
to<00:03:00.500> be<00:03:00.560> amplifying<00:03:01.099> them<00:03:01.310> or<00:03:01.400> not

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
to be amplifying them or not

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.430 
to be amplifying them or not
if<00:03:01.760> you're<00:03:01.940> writing<00:03:02.120> components<00:03:02.599> I<00:03:02.750> highly

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
if you're writing components I highly

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.380 
if you're writing components I highly
recommend<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.010> running<00:03:04.790> with<00:03:05.000> an<00:03:05.120> amplifier

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
recommend that running with an amplifier

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.420 
recommend that running with an amplifier
because<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.349> crossover<00:03:06.800> they<00:03:06.980> were<00:03:07.040> part<00:03:07.340> of

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
because the crossover they were part of

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.220 
because the crossover they were part of
a<00:03:07.519> little<00:03:07.670> more<00:03:07.790> power<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.150> run<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:09.019> if<00:03:09.080> you're

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
a little more power to run so if you're

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.809 
a little more power to run so if you're
doing<00:03:09.349> a<00:03:09.470> non<00:03:09.680> amplified<00:03:10.250> apathetic

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
doing a non amplified apathetic

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.690 
doing a non amplified apathetic
application<00:03:11.510> these<00:03:12.470> might<00:03:13.129> actually<00:03:13.160> sound

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
application these might actually sound

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.820 
application these might actually sound
better<00:03:13.970> than<00:03:14.120> these<00:03:14.450> because<00:03:15.260> they<00:03:15.470> require

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
better than these because they require

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.559 
better than these because they require
less<00:03:15.980> power<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.280> run<00:03:16.430> these<00:03:17.180> are<00:03:17.330> all<00:03:17.420> things

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
less power to run these are all things

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.880 
less power to run these are all things
you<00:03:17.720> have<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.840> consider<00:03:17.959> in<00:03:18.349> a<00:03:18.410> perfect<00:03:18.769> world

installing these types of speakers
there's<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.180> couple<00:03:26.390> things<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.840> have<00:03:26.930> to

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
there's a couple things that you have to

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.930 
there's a couple things that you have to
consider<00:03:27.349> it<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.769> coaxial<00:03:28.280> speaker<00:03:28.670> it's

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
consider it but the coaxial speaker it's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.449 
consider it but the coaxial speaker it's
the<00:03:29.209> simplest<00:03:29.599> way<00:03:29.840> it's<00:03:30.530> technically<00:03:31.160> just<00:03:31.400> a

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
the simplest way it's technically just a

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.920 
the simplest way it's technically just a
drop<00:03:31.670> then<00:03:31.849> you<00:03:31.970> just<00:03:32.239> change<00:03:32.450> your<00:03:32.480> connector

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
drop then you just change your connector

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.690 
drop then you just change your connector
so<00:03:33.410> they<00:03:33.500> go<00:03:33.650> into<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.950> positive<00:03:34.310> and

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
so they go into the positive and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.979 
so they go into the positive and
negative<00:03:34.940> terminals<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:35.660> should<00:03:35.840> just

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
negative terminals and that should just

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.530 
negative terminals and that should just
drop<00:03:36.140> in<00:03:36.380> now<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.040> C<00:03:37.280> two<00:03:37.489> is<00:03:37.670> quite<00:03:38.269> large

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
drop in now the C two is quite large

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.150 
drop in now the C two is quite large
compared<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:38.989> lot<00:03:39.110> of<00:03:39.200> stock<00:03:39.380> speakers<00:03:39.890> so

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
compared to a lot of stock speakers so

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.289 
compared to a lot of stock speakers so
what<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:40.459> might<00:03:40.610> have<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.790> do<00:03:40.879> is<00:03:40.970> if<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.150> put

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
what you might have to do is if you put

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.390 
what you might have to do is if you put
on<00:03:41.390> an<00:03:41.510> aftermarket<00:03:41.840> ring<00:03:42.170> they<00:03:42.500> come<00:03:42.739> up<00:03:42.860> made

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
on an aftermarket ring they come up made

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.720 
on an aftermarket ring they come up made
of<00:03:43.549> mbbs<00:03:44.239> plastic<00:03:44.750> or<00:03:45.319> make<00:03:45.680> your<00:03:45.829> own<00:03:45.890> for

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
of mbbs plastic or make your own for

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.369 
of mbbs plastic or make your own for
something<00:03:47.090> able<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:47.390> see<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:48.230> newer

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
something able to see like the newer

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.039 
something able to see like the newer

the speakers so they would shake they
can<00:04:00.350> drop<00:04:00.500> in<00:04:00.680> your<00:04:00.769> new<00:04:00.889> speaker<00:04:01.190> into<00:04:01.430> that

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
can drop in your new speaker into that

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.289 
can drop in your new speaker into that

you're<00:04:16.010> doing<00:04:16.220> an<00:04:16.280> install<00:04:16.549> where<00:04:16.729> the

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
you're doing an install where the

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.870 
you're doing an install where the
speakers<00:04:17.150> exposed<00:04:17.950> when<00:04:18.950> you're<00:04:19.099> installing

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
speakers exposed when you're installing

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.940 
speakers exposed when you're installing
a<00:04:20.120> speaker<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.510> comes<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.840> grill<00:04:21.049> just<00:04:21.799> a

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
a speaker that comes to the grill just a

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.440 
a speaker that comes to the grill just a
solvent<00:04:22.340> on<00:04:22.430> top<00:04:22.669> it's<00:04:23.000> getting<00:04:23.240> your<00:04:23.300> nice

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
solvent on top it's getting your nice

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.000 
solvent on top it's getting your nice
finished<00:04:23.780> look<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.289> also<00:04:24.410> protects<00:04:24.860> the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
finished look and it also protects the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.050 
finished look and it also protects the
woofer<00:04:25.280> as<00:04:25.370> well<00:04:25.550> on<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.849> tweeters

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
woofer as well on the tweeters

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.920 
woofer as well on the tweeters
now<00:04:29.060> when<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.330> comes<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.570> installing<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
now when it comes to installing the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.570 
now when it comes to installing the
components<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.919> want<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.099> watch<00:04:31.190> my<00:04:31.400> they

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
components and want to watch my they

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.370 
components and want to watch my they
encode<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:31.940> cell<00:04:32.240> component<00:04:32.750> speakers<00:04:32.930> because

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
encode a cell component speakers because

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.279 
encode a cell component speakers because
it's<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.250> lot<00:04:34.430> more<00:04:34.580> involved<00:04:34.940> now<00:04:35.389> the

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
it's a lot more involved now the

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.830 
it's a lot more involved now the
mid-range<00:04:36.860> offer<00:04:37.430> will<00:04:37.970> install<00:04:38.240> just<00:04:38.720> like

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
mid-range offer will install just like

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.730 
mid-range offer will install just like
the<00:04:39.020> coaxial<00:04:39.470> go<00:04:39.800> in<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:39.979> factory<00:04:40.430> location

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
the coaxial go in the factory location

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.939 
the coaxial go in the factory location
but<00:04:42.729> when<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.599> install<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.139> crossover<00:04:44.319> first

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
but when you install the crossover first

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.980 
but when you install the crossover first
now<00:04:45.310> there<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:45.610> an<00:04:45.789> input<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.360> have<00:04:46.389> to<00:04:46.750> put<00:04:46.960> a

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
now there is an input you have to put a

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.350 
now there is an input you have to put a
full<00:04:47.410> range<00:04:47.650> since<00:04:47.919> this<00:04:48.280> if<00:04:48.580> you're<00:04:49.090> dealing

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
full range since this if you're dealing

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.640 
full range since this if you're dealing
with<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.509> people<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:49.900> already<00:04:50.110> has<00:04:50.440> an

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
with the people that already has an

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.559 
with the people that already has an
amplified<00:04:51.159> system<00:04:51.699> you're<00:04:52.240> gonna<00:04:52.360> have<00:04:52.479> to

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
amplified system you're gonna have to

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.240 
amplified system you're gonna have to
rewire<00:04:52.720> it<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.080> bit<00:04:53.259> because<00:04:53.560> if<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.770> only<00:04:53.889> send

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
rewire it a bit because if you only send

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.820 
rewire it a bit because if you only send
low<00:04:54.729> frequencies<00:04:55.300> through<00:04:55.599> its<00:04:55.990> own<00:04:56.259> and<00:04:56.620> put

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
low frequencies through its own and put

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.680 
low frequencies through its own and put
out<00:04:57.009> all<00:04:57.250> frequencies<00:04:57.550> so<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.330> isn't<00:04:58.509> going

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
out all frequencies so this isn't going

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.749 
out all frequencies so this isn't going
to<00:04:58.750> work<00:04:58.810> properly<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.590> vehicles<00:05:00.460> that<00:05:00.520> aren't

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
to work properly so vehicles that aren't

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.550 
to work properly so vehicles that aren't
amplified<00:05:01.270> or<00:05:01.569> you're<00:05:01.780> right<00:05:01.930> aftermarket

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
amplified or you're right aftermarket

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.800 
amplified or you're right aftermarket
amplifier<00:05:03.129> this<00:05:03.610> goes<00:05:03.879> in<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.120> lot<00:05:04.270> easier<00:05:04.659> so

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
amplifier this goes in a lot easier so

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.580 
amplifier this goes in a lot easier so
these<00:05:04.930> are<00:05:05.080> all<00:05:05.169> things<00:05:05.289> you<00:05:05.440> have<00:05:05.470> to

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
these are all things you have to

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.320 
these are all things you have to
consider<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:06.699> have<00:05:06.819> to<00:05:06.879> find<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.120> place

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
consider and you have to find a place

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.059 
consider and you have to find a place
for<00:05:07.360> this<00:05:07.659> either<00:05:08.110> put<00:05:08.470> in<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.650> door<00:05:08.860> if

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
for this either put in the door if

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.529 
for this either put in the door if
you're<00:05:09.159> going<00:05:09.280> to<00:05:09.370> put<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.580> in<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.759> door<00:05:09.940> put

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
you're going to put it in the door put
