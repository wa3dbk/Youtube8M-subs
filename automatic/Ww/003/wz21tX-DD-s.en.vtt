it's<00:02:32.440> considered<00:02:33.040> convertible<00:02:33.580> because<00:02:33.700> you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
it's considered convertible because you

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.660 
it's considered convertible because you
can<00:02:34.060> move<00:02:34.210> these<00:02:34.360> different<00:02:34.780> toes<00:02:34.960> off<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:36.460> it
