frames from the film so there was an

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.730 
frames from the film so there was an
awful<00:02:12.270> lot<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.629> work<00:02:12.900> Arnold<00:02:13.410> was<00:02:13.500> here

just<00:02:13.950> about<00:02:14.190> ten<00:02:14.550> minutes<00:02:14.880> ago<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.270> thought<00:02:15.450> I

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
just about ten minutes ago I thought I

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.890 
just about ten minutes ago I thought I

even<00:02:21.720> more<00:02:22.140> amazed<00:02:22.470> than<00:02:22.500> Arnold<00:02:23.130> because<00:02:23.760> on

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
even more amazed than Arnold because on

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.030 
even more amazed than Arnold because on
