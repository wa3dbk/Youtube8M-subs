00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.740
 why at the start of battlefield 3 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.560
 everything just i wanted to remind you that 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.320
 is a real fashionable 44 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.270
 hello dear friends again with you zombies 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.699
 rus today as I promised on my 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.490
 screens you see a guide dedicated like 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.760
 say Dice rebelled from the ashes 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.510
 Magnum 44 in battlefield 3 on Wednesdays 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.640
 the window was 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.160
 ultimatum destruction machine live 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.219
 enemy forces which possessed very 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.660
 high damage the biggest among 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.210
 automatic and semi-automatic 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.460
 weapons a good rate of fire which in 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.640
 last patch for battlefield 3 was 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.040
 nurture up to 180 shots per minute but 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.620
 even despite such tough changes 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.140
 magnum 44 was the best side orm in 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.710
 battlefield3 which was effective on 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.410
 distance and melee battlefield 4 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.659
 magnum died on put it was the most 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.850
 bad side arm and everything was connected not 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.579
 only delay between pulling the trigger 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.100
 and a shot but also with the fact that dice cut 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.350
 absolutely all the characteristics of magnum 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.479
 but with the exception of probably reloading in 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.270
 battlefield 4 we have the following 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.630
 Damage characteristics maximum 56 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.829
 minimum 37.5 maximum damage lower 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.619
 than battlefield 3 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.899
 minimum damage is equal to not understanding otherwise 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.719
 Magnum option from battlefield 3 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.200
 rate of fire just 150 shots at 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.450
 a minute 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.340
 that in my opinion just a terrible figure 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.009
 recharge is the only parameter 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.859
 which has been preserved since the battlefield 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.899
 3 and also takes you 4 seconds on the idea 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:47.020
 the last patch was to return ours 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.669
 hands magnum 44 since this patch does 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.450
 did not affect gun damage and 

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:51.489
 revolvers 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.039
 and also removed the delay between shots 

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:56.709
 I expected this patch and I can safely 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.109
 declare yes now there is no delay but 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.059
 for some reason with the magnum is still bad 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.789
 runs the fact that magnum when 

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:05.409
 going into battlefield 4 lost all 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.380
 its rate of fire which is first 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.800
 was 190 shots a minute after 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.350
 the patch was 180 and in battlefield 4 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.580
 and 50 shots per minute that we do not 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.850
 allows you to shoot even 1911 m 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.040
 about m9 deagle I will not speak also 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.660
 magnum low damage compared to 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.360
 option from battlefield 3 where is he 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.570
 gave out 60 units of maximum damage 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.120
 there are only 56 to a minimum damage higher on 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.920
 7 units but magnum is not automatic 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.170
 sniper to work with him 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.540
 long distances have some advantages 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.210
 there is simply no magnum of the better 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.670
 options for example zerorfili to horror 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.150
 digle down became bad but he doesn't care 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.490
 It works also we have a spam cannon m9 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.340
 which gives out 400 shots per minute and 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.590
 has damage of 27 units or spam 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.600
 howitzers its 40 ki oparin 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.640
 but the main achievement of battlefield 4 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.680
 became the ability to install modules 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.610
 revolvers and what can we put 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.130
 on the sink 44 absolutely nothing sight 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.900
 the original gun is very convenient if 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.730
 of course you do not try with memory 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.770
 I still recommend to put the enemy 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.080
 any collimator sight three 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.270
 multiple sight absolutely borderless 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.900
 accessory well, everything is just we put 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.580
 lc 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.180
 he now reduces scatter when shooting 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.850
 from the hip is not 25 percent and 33 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.910
 percent thank you very much the last patch 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.070
 the module slot for the barrel is left empty 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.520
 muzzle brake possible and removes 10 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.590
 percent vertical cottage is not 25 and 10 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.170
 also changes to the patch but it worsens 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.420
 scatter spread mode thickened 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.700
 the barrel will make and so beyond the limit 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.580
 more space and sex game you will 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.370
 look at the sky it would be better to have added 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.250
 we have a silencer that was Thai 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.950
 options magnum 44 of battlefield 3 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.080
 In general, the last patch removed the delay but 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.209
 didn't fix magnum rx for these 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.980
 revolvers need more powerful buffs 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.900
 who will return us most 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.150
 characteristics of battlefield 3 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.940
 but for now they were replaced by an italian brother all 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.560
 construction Oparin IKEA wiseacre unica 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.200
 after the last patch 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.299
 best side orm even knocked moron 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.549
 his throne but I think that's all thanks 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.390
 that looked subscribe 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.739
