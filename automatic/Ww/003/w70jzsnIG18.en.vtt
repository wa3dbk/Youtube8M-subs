of<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.300> soil<00:01:52.480> in<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.750> Quadro<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.230> quite

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
of the soil in the Quadro is quite

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.600 
of the soil in the Quadro is quite
drying<00:01:53.890> that's<00:01:54.520> quite<00:01:54.850> normal<00:01:55.420> because<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
drying that's quite normal because the

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.850 
drying that's quite normal because the
way<00:01:57.790> that<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.240> feeder<00:01:58.510> mats<00:01:58.810> go<00:01:59.020> in<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.590> soil

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
way that the feeder mats go in the soil

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.010 
way that the feeder mats go in the soil
at<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.070> top<00:02:00.340> levels<00:02:00.730> feel<00:02:00.940> slightly<00:02:01.300> dry<00:02:01.660> and

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
at the top levels feel slightly dry and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.390 
at the top levels feel slightly dry and
soil<00:02:02.620> down<00:02:02.950> here<00:02:03.280> but<00:02:04.230> as<00:02:05.230> I<00:02:05.440> stand<00:02:05.710> up<00:02:05.950> I'm<00:02:06.220> in

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
soil down here but as I stand up I'm in

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.150 
soil down here but as I stand up I'm in
a<00:02:06.430> normal<00:02:06.700> 6-foot<00:02:07.540> grave<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:08.350> if<00:02:08.410> we<00:02:08.530> focus<00:02:08.979> on

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
a normal 6-foot grave so if we focus on

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.990 
a normal 6-foot grave so if we focus on
meet<00:02:09.399> him<00:02:10.620> you<00:02:11.620> can<00:02:11.800> see<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.490> tomatoes

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
meet him you can see that the tomatoes

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.880 
meet him you can see that the tomatoes
in<00:02:13.209> this<00:02:13.360> quandra<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:14.020> grown<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.500> top<00:02:14.709> of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
in this quandra have grown to the top of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.260 
in this quandra have grown to the top of
the<00:02:15.040> greenhouse<00:02:15.780> up<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.080> extended<00:02:17.680> Canes<00:02:18.270> to

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
the greenhouse up the extended Canes to

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.120 
the greenhouse up the extended Canes to
the<00:02:19.390> roof<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.870> greenhouse<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.890> this

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the roof of the greenhouse and this

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.740 
the roof of the greenhouse and this
one's<00:02:21.370> actually<00:02:21.550> now<00:02:21.820> trying<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.120> go<00:02:22.270> down<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
one's actually now trying to go down the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.160 
one's actually now trying to go down the
other<00:02:23.080> side<00:02:23.550> we're<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.730> at<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.600> end<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.870> July

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
other side we're in at the end of July

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.449 
other side we're in at the end of July
so<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.400> still<00:02:27.640> have<00:02:27.910> time<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.660> actually<00:02:29.110> get

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
so you still have time to actually get

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.760 
so you still have time to actually get
even<00:02:30.459> these<00:02:30.610> tomatoes<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.450> ripen<00:02:31.630> but<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.500> would

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
even these tomatoes to ripen but I would

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.820 
even these tomatoes to ripen but I would
probably<00:02:32.950> pinch<00:02:33.430> out<00:02:33.670> after<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:34.990> what

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
probably pinch out after this so what

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.490 
probably pinch out after this so what
they<00:02:36.040> would<00:02:36.130> normally<00:02:36.310> say<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:37.110> 4<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.290> 6

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
they would normally say is 4 to 6

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.280 
they would normally say is 4 to 6
trusses<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.190> think<00:02:39.459> on<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> Quadro<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.540> quite

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
trusses I think on a Quadro you quite

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.670 
trusses I think on a Quadro you quite
easily<00:02:41.590> get<00:02:41.980> 8<00:02:42.600> sometimes<00:02:43.600> even<00:02:43.959> 10<00:02:44.200> trusses

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
easily get 8 sometimes even 10 trusses

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.759 
easily get 8 sometimes even 10 trusses
and<00:02:45.310> if<00:02:45.400> we<00:02:45.550> look<00:02:45.700> down<00:02:45.730> here<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:47.230> variety<00:02:47.709> of

so<00:04:01.959> it's<00:04:02.959> working<00:04:03.260> fantastically<00:04:04.220> my<00:04:04.430> mom

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
so it's working fantastically my mom

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.979 
so it's working fantastically my mom
says<00:04:04.910> that<00:04:04.940> she<00:04:05.380> fills<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:07.540> at<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.630> moment

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
says that she fills this at the moment

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.809 
says that she fills this at the moment
she's<00:04:09.290> doing<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.709> about<00:04:10.040> every<00:04:10.280> three<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:10.639> four

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
she's doing it about every three to four

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.550 
she's doing it about every three to four
days<00:04:10.880> because<00:04:11.420> if<00:04:11.569> you<00:04:11.660> keep<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.019> Krog<00:04:12.290> row

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
days because if you keep the Krog row

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.259 
days because if you keep the Krog row
filled<00:04:13.130> up<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.430> top<00:04:13.670> it's<00:04:13.880> much<00:04:14.030> better

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
filled up to the top it's much better

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.599 
filled up to the top it's much better
than<00:04:14.569> letting<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.959> run<00:04:15.109> right<00:04:15.380> down<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:16.340> fill

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
than letting it run right down and fill

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.670 
than letting it run right down and fill
it<00:04:16.729> again<00:04:16.930> I'm<00:04:17.930> just<00:04:18.079> going<00:04:18.229> to<00:04:18.320> go<00:04:18.440> through

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
it again I'm just going to go through

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.159 
it again I'm just going to go through
these<00:04:18.859> plants<00:04:19.340> for<00:04:19.850> my<00:04:20.450> guess<00:04:20.690> I<00:04:20.810> will<00:04:20.959> take

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
these plants for my guess I will take

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.800 
these plants for my guess I will take
off<00:04:21.490> these<00:04:22.490> bottom<00:04:22.940> leaves<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.360> other<00:04:23.510> thing

off these bottom leaves the other thing

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.900 
off these bottom leaves the other thing
that<00:04:23.840> this<00:04:24.139> nose<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:25.100> lot<00:04:25.370> more<00:04:25.610> their

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
that this nose is a lot more their

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.969 
that this nose is a lot more their

Camela one of the things I'd say about
the<00:04:45.559> queue<00:04:45.769> canola<00:04:46.069> that<00:04:46.279> we<00:04:46.429> found<00:04:46.759> is<00:04:47.749> that

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:47.809 
the queue canola that we found is that

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.139 
the queue canola that we found is that
it<00:04:48.169> creeps<00:04:48.439> much<00:04:48.709> alike<00:04:49.069> it's<00:04:49.369> actually<00:04:49.879> sort
