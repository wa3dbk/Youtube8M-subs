00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.700
 and here we are again 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.250
 to see a clock we are going to make a video 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:17.390
 more especially in this case it's a super 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:22.670
 design of the collection that came out in May 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:29.150
 of 2014 is super titanium and in this case 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:33.530
 is the model ago at 40 14 57 and in color 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:37.609
 black the dial and the box in color 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.310
 golden work to be super titanium 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.070
 gets the lightness of titanium but the 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.600
 Steel color and hardness is pretty 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.680
 harder than titanium steel scratched 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.630
 well in this we already know that he has the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.430
 bezel in golden a soft golden nothing 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.070
 shrill is very beautiful is a 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.620
 very elegant combination that combines 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.480
 also with the stripes the needles also 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.780
 they have a little bit the same tone and 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.780
 coral 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.000
 but good 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.210
 and good 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.159
 that we have then the time 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.310
 that marks us in this case the ten and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.220
 four minutes the second hand we have it 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.090
 in the sphere below we do not know how to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.429
 how watching 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.619
 and then we have the chronograph function 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.840
 that goes with the central seconds hand and 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.340
 two in this what we have is the time in 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.130
 way 34 hours that is to say we are 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.700
 saying that 10 o'clock at night 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.299
 the 22 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.340
 and this sphere in relation to the 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.119
 the chronograph every turn there are 22 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.009
 minutes up button start-up 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.190
 we see that the seconds not higher and a 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.680
 second yes no 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.960
 of 0.2 seconds you make five jumps by 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.290
 second 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.220
 with water have an accuracy of 0 20 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.470
 of 0 20 seconds and 2 tenths stop at 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.090
 the button above and reset but 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.100
 so down 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.170
 every door that he gives us 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.710
 see counting in this sphere here a 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.360
 minutes 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:17.030
 What else we see is a screw cap 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.100
 security lock computers pulse 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.410
 in titanium two colors good to be 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.880
 with the plastic we can remove the see 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.590
 as it has a bright area and another 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.120
 Matte area without gloss 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.950
 and the truth is that the clock is very 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.860
 Pretty elegant bracelet in 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.510
 sapphire crystal like everything they practice 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.330
 yum 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.549
 It is very light of course and well 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.810
 of size compared to others 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:46.260
 watches of the same category of such 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.500
 similar size as any other watch 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.739
 and well, I think it's more or less 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:58.120
 seen that this is marking us now 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.970
 same day 15 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.440
 and well, I think that is all that 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.760
 can watch the clock is solar that is 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.830
 that simply with who gives the light 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.120
 the clock that is working and in the 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.159
 if it does not give light with its 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.290
 battery will be working but so 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.030
 less six months when the battery is 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.940
 put simply download with light 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.720
 it reloads and so on until the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.459
 next is that it is a wonder the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.810
 operation of the clock and the few 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.909
 problems that it gives because it is that really 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.560
 that there has never been anyone who has 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.739
 Sorry to say the battery does not last 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.090
 It does not work for me . 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:40.420
 This aspect is a joy because it goes 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.980
 simple wonder for nothing thanks for the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.980
 video greetings and see you next time
