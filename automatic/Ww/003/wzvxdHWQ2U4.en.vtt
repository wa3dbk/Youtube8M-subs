00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550 

I<00:00:01.820> couldn't<00:00:02.820> find<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.330> wiring<00:00:03.600> diagram<00:00:03.750> for

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
I couldn't find a wiring diagram for

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.339 
I couldn't find a wiring diagram for
this<00:00:05.060> Lafayette<00:00:06.060> guitar<00:00:06.660> amplifier<00:00:07.259> circuit

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
this Lafayette guitar amplifier circuit

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.550 
this Lafayette guitar amplifier circuit
so<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> decided<00:00:11.040> I'll<00:00:11.280> just<00:00:11.849> draw<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:12.420> up<00:00:12.830> and<00:00:14.330> I

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 
so I decided I'll just draw one up and I

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.490 
so I decided I'll just draw one up and I
tried<00:00:16.560> something<00:00:16.859> new<00:00:17.250> which<00:00:18.150> I'll<00:00:18.470> show<00:00:19.470> you

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
tried something new which I'll show you

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.230 
tried something new which I'll show you
what<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> did<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.580> worked<00:00:20.789> pretty<00:00:21.090> good

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
what I did here that worked pretty good

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.140 
what I did here that worked pretty good
to<00:00:21.689> help<00:00:21.810> me<00:00:22.080> draw<00:00:22.980> up<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.250> wiring<00:00:23.609> diagram

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
to help me draw up the wiring diagram

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.890 
to help me draw up the wiring diagram
and<00:00:25.699> verify<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.689> circuit<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:29.570> took<00:00:30.570> some

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and verify the circuit I took some

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.630 
and verify the circuit I took some
pictures<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> board<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:34.430> now<00:00:35.430> this

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
pictures of the board like this now this

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.790 
pictures of the board like this now this
is<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.270> shot<00:00:36.510> from<00:00:37.340> underneath<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:40.200> foil

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is just a shot from underneath the foil

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.470 
is just a shot from underneath the foil
side<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> board<00:00:43.340> then<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.730> flipped<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
side of the board then I flipped it

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:56.200 
side of the board then I flipped it
vertically<00:00:46.910> in<00:00:48.680> Photoshop<00:00:51.379> like<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:55.190> and

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
vertically in Photoshop like this and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
vertically in Photoshop like this and
what<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.480> did<00:00:57.870> was<00:01:00.350> if<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.620> would<00:01:01.770> be

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
what that did was if it would be

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.820 
what that did was if it would be
possible<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:03.080> through<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> top<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
possible to look through the top of the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.700 
possible to look through the top of the
board<00:01:06.229> through<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.610> board<00:01:09.049> this<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
board through the board this is what you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.070 
board through the board this is what you
would<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.000> other<00:01:12.180> words<00:01:12.450> I've<00:01:12.750> made

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
would see so in other words I've made

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.100 
would see so in other words I've made
the<00:01:13.350> bottom<00:01:14.100> view<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.880> top<00:01:15.780> view<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.869> course

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the bottom view a top view and of course

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.219 
the bottom view a top view and of course
I<00:01:19.409> went<00:01:19.920> ahead<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.159> took<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.570> regular<00:01:21.570> top<00:01:21.869> view

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
I went ahead and took a regular top view

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
I went ahead and took a regular top view
of<00:01:22.939> this<00:01:24.560> circuit<00:01:25.560> board<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.909> in

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
of this circuit board and then in

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.440 
of this circuit board and then in
Photoshop<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.020> sandwich<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:28.950> together<00:01:29.450> like

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
Photoshop I sandwich them together like

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.520 
Photoshop I sandwich them together like
this<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> could<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.280> both<00:01:32.640> boards<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
this so I could see both boards and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
this so I could see both boards and
what's<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.740> top<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.549> foil<00:01:35.930> I've<00:01:39.140> changed

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
what's on top is the foil I've changed

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.690 
what's on top is the foil I've changed
the<00:01:40.380> opacity<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.299> through<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.700> then

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the opacity so I can see through it then

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.350 
the opacity so I can see through it then
I<00:01:45.119> went<00:01:45.600> ahead<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.189> erased<00:01:47.189> out<00:01:47.549> from<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
I went ahead and erased out from the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.010 
I went ahead and erased out from the
foil<00:01:48.780> side<00:01:49.759> where<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> capacitors<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
foil side where the capacitors and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.130 
foil side where the capacitors and
resistors<00:01:52.079> were<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.509> then<00:01:54.509> change<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
resistors were and then change the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.420 
resistors were and then change the
opacity<00:01:55.470> back<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.159> 100%<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.530> ended<00:01:58.950> up<00:01:59.130> with

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
opacity back to 100% and I ended up with

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.850 
opacity back to 100% and I ended up with
this<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.079> I<00:02:01.079> found<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.820> very<00:02:02.820> helpful<00:02:03.210> in

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
this and I found this very helpful in

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.590 
this and I found this very helpful in
drawing<00:02:04.860> up<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:06.149> wiring<00:02:06.600> diagram

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.700 

you

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.440 

now<00:02:17.710> something<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.430> had<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.730> be<00:02:19.000> careful

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
now something that I had to be careful

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.970 
now something that I had to be careful
of<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:20.680> since<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:22.060> made<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:23.080> top<00:02:23.590> view

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
of is since I have made this a top view

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.000 
of is since I have made this a top view
the<00:02:26.980> two<00:02:27.250> pins<00:02:27.610> count<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.930> way<00:02:31.620> now<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.680> went

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
the two pins count this way now I went

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.760 
the two pins count this way now I went
ahead<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.510> took<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.690> bunch<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:35.280> other<00:02:36.280> pictures

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
ahead and took a bunch of other pictures

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.250 
ahead and took a bunch of other pictures
to<00:02:38.770> help<00:02:38.890> me<00:02:39.180> draw<00:02:40.180> up<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.450> wiring<00:02:40.690> diagram

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
to help me draw up the wiring diagram

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.940 
to help me draw up the wiring diagram
like<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.770> power<00:02:42.280> supply<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:44.710> took

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
like this power supply and I took

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.050 
like this power supply and I took
pictures<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.530> four<00:02:47.800> capacitors<00:02:48.670> that

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
pictures of the four capacitors that

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.880 
pictures of the four capacitors that
were<00:02:49.240> on<00:02:50.080> top<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.740> board<00:02:51.570> this<00:02:52.570> was<00:02:52.900> very

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
were on top of the board this was very

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.890 
were on top of the board this was very
useful<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.610> identifying<00:02:55.320> where<00:02:56.320> things<00:02:56.710> went

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.330 

now<00:03:01.900> here<00:03:02.350> I'm<00:03:03.100> going<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.670> go<00:03:04.570> through<00:03:04.840> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
now here I'm going to go through the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.190 
now here I'm going to go through the
circuit<00:03:06.340> for<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.730> power<00:03:07.000> supply<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:10.200> those

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
circuit for the power supply and those

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.590 
circuit for the power supply and those
two<00:03:11.500> black<00:03:11.920> cylinders<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.090> see<00:03:13.360> there

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
two black cylinders that you see there

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.980 
two black cylinders that you see there
those<00:03:13.990> are<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.440> diodes<00:03:15.360> for<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.690> power

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
those are the diodes for this power

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.560 
those are the diodes for this power
supply<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.840> diodes<00:03:20.350> are<00:03:20.709> oriented<00:03:21.640> this

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
supply and the diodes are oriented this

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.610 
supply and the diodes are oriented this
way

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.750 

this<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.879> power<00:03:31.209> supply<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:33.099> I<00:03:33.549> have<00:03:33.730> a

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
this is the power supply and I have a

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.449 
this is the power supply and I have a
link<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.870> complete<00:03:35.170> circuit<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.220> show

you<00:03:45.099> can<00:03:45.159> see<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.670> we've<00:03:45.819> got<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.060> power

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
you can see that we've got a power

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.580 
you can see that we've got a power
transformer<00:03:47.829> there<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.940> we<00:03:49.690> don't<00:03:49.930> get<00:03:50.290> much

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590

being<00:04:35.530> AC<00:04:37.289> I'm<00:04:38.289> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.650> start<00:04:38.979> here<00:04:39.430> with

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
being AC I'm going to start here with

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.339 
being AC I'm going to start here with
the<00:04:40.090> cycle<00:04:40.570> being<00:04:40.870> in<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.430> situation

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
the cycle being in this situation

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.129 
the cycle being in this situation
positive<00:04:44.349> on<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:45.490> top<00:04:45.729> and<00:04:46.060> negative<00:04:46.750> on<00:04:46.960> the

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
bottom of the coil and in this situation

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.129 
bottom of the coil and in this situation
the<00:04:53.919> electrons<00:04:54.580> will<00:04:54.849> flow<00:04:54.990> from<00:04:55.990> the

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
the electrons will flow from the

negative side and charge the top

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.070 
negative side and charge the top
capacitor<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:04.139> when<00:05:05.139> that<00:05:05.320> happens<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:07.870> can

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
capacitor and when that happens you can

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.510 
capacitor and when that happens you can
consider<00:05:08.710> that<00:05:09.099> top<00:05:10.229> capacitor<00:05:11.490> like<00:05:12.490> a

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
battery now the second part of the cycle

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.379 
battery now the second part of the cycle
comes<00:05:21.190> through<00:05:21.610> on<00:05:21.849> this<00:05:22.270> AC<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:24.330> now<00:05:25.330> the

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
comes through on this AC and now the

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.890 
comes through on this AC and now the
electrons<00:05:26.580> will<00:05:27.580> flow<00:05:27.610> again<00:05:28.389> from<00:05:28.750> the

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
electrons will flow again from the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.080

the<00:05:34.930> bottom<00:05:35.349> capacitor<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:37.289> now<00:05:38.289> it<00:05:39.219> is<00:05:39.630> now

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
the bottom capacitor and now it is now

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.980 
the bottom capacitor and now it is now
like<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.909> battery

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.619 

now<00:05:46.990> if<00:05:47.139> we<00:05:47.259> take<00:05:47.470> a<00:05:47.530> look<00:05:47.830> at<00:05:48.180> those<00:05:49.180> two

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:49.629 
now if we take a look at those two

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.070 
now if we take a look at those two
charged<00:05:50.139> capacitors<00:05:51.360> acting<00:05:52.360> as<00:05:52.539> a<00:05:52.569> battery
