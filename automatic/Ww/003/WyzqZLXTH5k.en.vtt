00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.820 
love it
third<00:01:59.070> time<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.990> she<00:02:01.050> did<00:02:01.260> like<00:02:01.380> an<00:02:01.500> opera

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
third time so she did like an opera

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.290 
third time so she did like an opera
thing<00:02:02.040> last<00:02:02.280> year<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.820> didn't<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.180> work

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
thing last year that didn't really work

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.510 
thing last year that didn't really work
and<00:02:03.630> then<00:02:03.720> obviously<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.380> Facebook's<00:02:05.310> on

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and then obviously the Facebook's on

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.950 
and then obviously the Facebook's on
that<00:02:05.700> became<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.120> social<00:02:06.510> media<00:02:06.780> song

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that became the social media song

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.790 
that became the social media song
because<00:02:07.110> she<00:02:07.200> wasn't<00:02:07.350> allowed<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.620> say

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.890 
because she wasn't allowed to say
Facebook<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:08.850> mean<00:02:09.119> she<00:02:09.149> deserves<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:10.020> chance
