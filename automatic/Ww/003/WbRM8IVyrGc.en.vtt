we<00:00:43.700> just<00:00:44.150> had<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:45.200> big<00:00:45.470> meeting<00:00:45.770> of<00:00:46.070> everyone

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
we just had the big meeting of everyone

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.690 
we just had the big meeting of everyone
in<00:00:46.910> anti-doping<00:00:47.390> in<00:00:47.660> South<00:00:47.900> Africa<00:00:48.380> and<00:00:48.700> the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
in anti-doping in South Africa and the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.960 
in anti-doping in South Africa and the
new<00:00:50.000> code<00:00:50.270> has<00:00:50.480> been<00:00:50.690> finalized<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.790> new

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
new code has been finalized so the new

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.270 
new code has been finalized so the new
code<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:53.360> fantastic<00:00:54.020> but<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.950> says<00:00:55.250> nothing

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
code is fantastic but it says nothing

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.490 
code is fantastic but it says nothing
unless<00:00:56.059> we<00:00:56.239> actually<00:00:56.390> act<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:57.350> is

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
unless we actually act so this is

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.799 
unless we actually act so this is
perfectly<00:00:57.980> timed<00:00:58.220> conference<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:59.360> actually

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
perfectly timed conference to actually

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.479 
perfectly timed conference to actually
have<00:00:59.930> action<00:01:00.470> on<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.800> back<00:01:00.949> of<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.309> new

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
have action on the back of the new

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.240 
have action on the back of the new
regulations<00:01:01.790> or<00:01:02.300> come<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:02.629> in<00:01:02.750> 2015<00:01:03.590> so<00:01:04.220> I

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
regulations or come in in 2015 so I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.469 
regulations or come in in 2015 so I
think<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.610> time<00:01:04.820> for<00:01:05.000> change<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:05.330> about

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
think the time for change is about

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.750 
think the time for change is about
intelligent<00:01:06.320> testing<00:01:06.680> rather<00:01:07.190> than<00:01:07.460> just

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
intelligent testing rather than just

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.550 
intelligent testing rather than just
doing<00:01:07.910> more<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.420> same<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:08.900> there's<00:01:09.500> a

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
doing more of the same and there's a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.200 
doing more of the same and there's a
really<00:01:09.860> quite<00:01:10.250> good<00:01:10.490> consensus<00:01:11.060> on<00:01:11.180> that

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
really quite good consensus on that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.270 
really quite good consensus on that
between<00:01:11.780> all<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.140> stakeholders<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.920> Olympic

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
we have to have intelligent currently we

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.530 
we have to have intelligent currently we
are<00:01:20.869> estimating<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.610> 3<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.790> 400<00:01:23.360> million

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
are estimating that 3 to 400 million

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.780 
are estimating that 3 to 400 million
dollars<00:01:23.720> are<00:01:24.259> spent<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:25.009> fight<00:01:25.369> against

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
dollars are spent on fight against

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.249 
dollars are spent on fight against
doping<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.350> question<00:01:27.800> is<00:01:27.920> justified<00:01:29.259> do

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
doping and the question is justified do

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.430 
doping and the question is justified do
we<00:01:30.410> invest<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.250> money<00:01:31.399> in<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.880> right<00:01:32.440> efficient

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
we invest the money in a right efficient

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.219 
we invest the money in a right efficient
and<00:01:33.710> deterrent<00:01:34.340> way<00:01:34.520> so<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:35.270> are<00:01:35.390> looking<00:01:35.570> in<00:01:36.050> a

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
and deterrent way so we are looking in a

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.210 
and deterrent way so we are looking in a
possible<00:01:36.740> new<00:01:37.490> strategies<00:01:38.530> cost<00:01:39.530> effective

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
possible new strategies cost effective

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.730 
possible new strategies cost effective
and<00:01:40.399> more<00:01:40.850> deterrent<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:42.380> know<00:01:42.530> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
and more deterrent you know the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.499 
and more deterrent you know the
biological<00:01:43.450> profile<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.929> based<00:01:45.289> on<00:01:45.709> a

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
biological profile is based on a

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.870 
biological profile is based on a
longitudinal<00:01:47.509> follow-up<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:49.160> play<00:01:51.069> of<00:01:52.069> course

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
longitudinal follow-up of play of course

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.870 
longitudinal follow-up of play of course
this<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.330> one<00:01:53.810> tool<00:01:54.470> for<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.310> fight<00:01:55.520> against

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
this is one tool for the fight against

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.380 
this is one tool for the fight against
doping<00:01:56.259> when<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.500> take<00:01:57.800> doping<00:01:58.369> substance<00:01:58.940> is

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
doping when you take doping substance is

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.730 
doping when you take doping substance is
changing<00:02:00.380> your<00:02:00.849> individual<00:02:01.849> biology<00:02:02.569> so<00:02:03.410> the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
changing your individual biology so the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.940 
changing your individual biology so the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
goal of the biological profile is to see

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.630 
goal of the biological profile is to see
if<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:07.700> have<00:02:07.880> any<00:02:08.709> significant<00:02:09.709> change<00:02:10.220> in

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
if you have any significant change in

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.110 
if you have any significant change in

transfusions or Ipoh you would then

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.300 
transfusions or Ipoh you would then
measure<00:02:32.540> not<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.590> substance<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.190> they're

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
measure not the substance that they're

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.479 
measure not the substance that they're
taking<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:35.420> measure<00:02:35.630> indirectly<00:02:36.590> their

or<00:03:10.310> doctors<00:03:10.909> or<00:03:11.090> scientists<00:03:11.889> and<00:03:12.889> we<00:03:13.099> have<00:03:13.370> to

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
or doctors or scientists and we have to

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.000 
or doctors or scientists and we have to
find<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.239> way<00:03:14.389> to<00:03:14.450> act<00:03:14.780> against<00:03:15.290> them<00:03:15.500> therefore

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
find a way to act against them therefore

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.490 
find a way to act against them therefore
it<00:03:16.489> has<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:17.000> be<00:03:17.180> somewhere<00:03:17.689> kind<00:03:18.230> of

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
it has to be somewhere kind of

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.289 
it has to be somewhere kind of
centralized<00:03:19.040> database<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:19.849> think<00:03:20.090> that

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
centralized database and I think that

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.390 
centralized database and I think that
wada<00:03:20.540> would<00:03:20.810> be<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.500> best<00:03:21.709> place<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.010> have

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
wada would be the best place to have

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.289 
wada would be the best place to have
this<00:03:22.900> information<00:03:23.900> available<00:03:24.859> for

this information available for
anti-doping<00:03:26.299> authorities<00:03:26.989> so<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.290> we<00:03:27.530> can

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
anti-doping authorities so that we can

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.330 
anti-doping authorities so that we can
form<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.159> trance<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.959> keeping<00:03:29.959> on<00:03:30.340> having
