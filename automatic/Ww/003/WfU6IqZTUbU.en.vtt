tires<00:02:00.570> bulletproof<00:02:01.079> because<00:02:01.380> I'm<00:02:01.500> most

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
tires bulletproof because I'm most

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.480 
tires bulletproof because I'm most
likely<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.340> keep<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.789> car<00:02:04.009> now<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.250> for

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
likely going to keep this car now as for

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.940 
likely going to keep this car now as for
the<00:02:05.640> respray<00:02:06.090> considering<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.810> car<00:02:07.049> looks<00:02:07.830> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the respray considering this car looks a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.240 
the respray considering this car looks a
lot<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> Ferrari<00:02:08.910> 250<00:02:09.569> GTO<00:02:09.959> I'm<00:02:10.649> gonna

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
lot like a Ferrari 250 GTO I'm gonna

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.850 
lot like a Ferrari 250 GTO I'm gonna
have<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.519> paint<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> red<00:02:11.970> because<00:02:12.840> 250<00:02:13.319> GTO<00:02:13.680> s

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
have to paint it red because 250 GTO s

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.259 
have to paint it red because 250 GTO s
in<00:02:14.190> red<00:02:14.580> are<00:02:14.849> all<00:02:15.090> my<00:02:15.360> goodness<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.950> good<00:02:17.269> so

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269

below let me know what you guys think of

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.180 
below let me know what you guys think of
the<00:02:47.040> build<00:02:47.280> oh<00:02:47.810> my<00:02:48.810> goodness<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.440> Ferrari<00:02:49.890> in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the build oh my goodness that Ferrari in

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.130 
the build oh my goodness that Ferrari in
the<00:02:50.370> Ferrari<00:02:50.610> formula<00:02:51.540> red<00:02:51.890> whoo<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.900> think<00:02:54.900> it

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the Ferrari formula red whoo I think it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.770 
the Ferrari formula red whoo I think it
would<00:02:55.230> also<00:02:55.350> look<00:02:55.590> really<00:02:55.859> good<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.720> how<00:02:57.720> do

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
would also look really good in a how do

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.560 
would also look really good in a how do
they<00:02:57.930> say<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.109> Rosso<00:02:58.410> red<00:02:59.180> it's<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.269> little<00:03:00.480> bit

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
they say it Rosso red it's a little bit

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.819 
they say it Rosso red it's a little bit
darker<00:03:00.900> than<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.109> formula<00:03:01.350> right<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.769> this

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
darker than the formula right in this

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.130 
darker than the formula right in this
game<00:03:02.070> but<00:03:02.609> would<00:03:03.390> probably<00:03:03.480> look<00:03:03.780> just<00:03:04.049> as

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
game but would probably look just as

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.550 
game but would probably look just as
good<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.320> this<00:03:04.530> car<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:06.780> anyways<00:03:07.140> taking<00:03:07.500> this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
good on this car but anyways taking this

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.729 
good on this car but anyways taking this
thing<00:03:07.709> for<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> test<00:03:08.430> spin<00:03:08.989> holy<00:03:09.989> cow<00:03:10.500> this
