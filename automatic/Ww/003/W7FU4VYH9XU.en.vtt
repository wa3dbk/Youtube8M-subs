00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.050
 Ipad case to introduce today is this 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.210
 This what and 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:15.080
 It is Fukui pad case with no built-in battery . 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:21.680
 It has a built-in waste battery so far, it was an ipad case with a built-in battery 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.600
 I did not look at the sentence, so that 's how capacity is Hase ma 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.360
 8th Kyoto large 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.360
 so 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.220
 The ipad of the third generation Kedomo I Tsuketeru now 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.150
 ipad 2 can also be used 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.910
 You 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:41.160
 How much can you charge in 8000 mm to become a damn 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:46.250
 The capacity of the ipad battery from the ipad 2 has also increased considerably 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.490
 It's about the third generation and it has about 11,11 battle mm 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.829
 You can not unfortunately the enemy immediately is fully charged if 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.859
 I checked that and ipad 0% 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.970
 55% was able to charge 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:05.430
 I wonder if I can calculate it for a while 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.970
 Kanade that only about 50% were not able to charge 's fast Toka roughly three and a half hours charging time 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.930
 Absent 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.250
 Three and a half weeks 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.880
 Ipad doesn't reduce the battery quite easily if it should go to about 50 par 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.340
 is not it 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.109
 I think I know enough So another this about in 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.570
 It's a battery case, and it's hard to hit it like this kind of buttons . 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.830
 I wonder if you want to know a little burns 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.880
 But it feels like I 'll let you do my nails or a little 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.600
 A 3 It is important porter 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.280
 In the case that you have open the lakeside 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.280
 Hm this way 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.189
 smart cover too 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.440
 You can use this I'm glad I'm glad I'm happy 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.800
 We want to protect me the entire surface 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.500
 So 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.250
 In that smart cover is usable 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.159
 I think it can be used as it is great 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.499
 I can use it 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:06.710
 Happy You can also synchronize can be charged while the battery case after 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:11.510
 I think we can use with confidence in such of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:15.459
 If you are traveling for 2 days and 1 night, please check for a moment 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.459
 After lie position that I think quite convenient-to-use
