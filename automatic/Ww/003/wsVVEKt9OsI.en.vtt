then I turn it off that's the option I'm
going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> activate<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> switch

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
going to get when I activate the switch

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.139 
going to get when I activate the switch
again<00:02:04.320> it'll<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.799> right<00:02:05.040> back<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.729> want

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
again it'll go right back to that I want

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.419 
again it'll go right back to that I want
to<00:02:06.210> change<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.780> mode<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.770> simply<00:02:08.069> hold<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
to change the mode I can simply hold it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.219 
to change the mode I can simply hold it
and<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.090> point<00:02:09.270> I'm<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.690> strobing

and at this point I'm going to strobing

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.809 
and at this point I'm going to strobing
turn<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> off<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.039> then

actually have to push these in there
pretty<00:02:55.049> good<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.920> things

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
pretty good this is one of the things

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.190 
pretty good this is one of the things
this<00:02:56.970> doesn't<00:02:57.329> just<00:02:57.480> sit<00:02:57.690> right<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:58.049> there

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
this doesn't just sit right in there

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.809 
this doesn't just sit right in there
it's<00:02:58.379> really<00:02:58.500> attached<00:02:58.920> pretty<00:02:59.250> well<00:02:59.430> it's

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
it's really attached pretty well it's

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.240 
it's really attached pretty well it's
got<00:02:59.940> these<00:03:00.060> little<00:03:00.950> indentations<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.069> there

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
got these little indentations in there

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.740 
got these little indentations in there
and<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.430> really<00:03:02.639> do<00:03:02.760> have<00:03:02.879> to<00:03:03.060> sort<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.569> push

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
and you really do have to sort of push

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.479 
and you really do have to sort of push
this<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.139> there<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.409> doesn't<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.739> sit<00:03:05.310> in

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
this in there this doesn't just sit in

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.979 
this in there this doesn't just sit in
there<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.730> loosen<00:03:06.060> going<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.510> rattle<00:03:06.659> around

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
there and loosen going to rattle around

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.509 
there and loosen going to rattle around
you<00:03:07.139> really<00:03:07.230> need<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.560> give<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.310> some

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
you really need to give that some

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.879 
you really need to give that some
strength<00:03:08.879> push<00:03:09.359> in<00:03:09.540> there<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:10.680> once

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
strength push in there and then once

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.899 
strength push in there and then once
that's<00:03:11.069> in<00:03:11.310> there<00:03:11.519> we<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.359> get<00:03:12.480> our<00:03:12.659> clamps

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
that's in there we can get our clamps

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.970 
that's in there we can get our clamps
going<00:03:14.909> on<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:16.799> device<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.690> sort<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.530> set

going on the device and then sort of set

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.259 
going on the device and then sort of set
it<00:03:20.069> at<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> little<00:03:20.280> bit<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.519> an<00:03:20.609> angle<00:03:20.879> and<00:03:21.030> roll

you want to put it on the right rail so

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.309 
you want to put it on the right rail so

the trigger guards that you can reach

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.170 
the trigger guards that you can reach
them<00:03:31.579> probably<00:03:32.579> with<00:03:32.760> your<00:03:32.879> trigger<00:03:33.090> finger

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180

just<00:03:40.980> go<00:03:41.190> ahead<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.599> tighten<00:03:42.599> these<00:03:42.690> screws

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
just go ahead and tighten these screws

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.869 
just go ahead and tighten these screws
down<00:03:44.629> and<00:03:45.629> we<00:03:46.500> should<00:03:46.769> be<00:03:47.040> in<00:03:47.280> pretty<00:03:47.790> good

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
down and we should be in pretty good

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:54.240 
down and we should be in pretty good
business

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.620 

now<00:03:55.250> once<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.520> get<00:03:55.640> this<00:03:55.880> installed<00:03:56.330> of

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
now once you get this installed of

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.520 
now once you get this installed of
course<00:03:56.840> you're<00:03:56.960> going<00:03:57.050> to<00:03:57.110> want<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.290> head<00:03:57.410> out

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
course you're going to want to head out

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.650 
course you're going to want to head out
to<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.770> range<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:58.640> can<00:03:58.820> look<00:03:59.210> at<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.420> iron

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
to the range you can look at the iron

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.950 
to the range you can look at the iron
sights<00:04:00.020> first<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.740> align<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.610> red<00:04:02.300> dot<00:04:02.540> with

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
sights first and align the red dot with

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.660 
sights first and align the red dot with
the<00:04:03.200> iron<00:04:03.350> sights<00:04:03.710> using<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.190> adjustment

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
the iron sights using the adjustment

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.250 
the iron sights using the adjustment
tool<00:04:04.850> that<00:04:05.090> they<00:04:05.270> include<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.870> package

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
tool that they include in the package

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.990 
tool that they include in the package
but<00:04:06.770> obviously<00:04:07.190> you're<00:04:07.370> going<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.640> want<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:07.880> go

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
but obviously you're going to want to go

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.430 
but obviously you're going to want to go
ahead<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.300> compare<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.290> actual

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
ahead and compare that to the actual

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.830 
ahead and compare that to the actual
impact<00:04:09.980> point<00:04:10.340> live-fire<00:04:10.940> now<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.570> thing<00:04:11.810> to

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
impact point live-fire now the thing to

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.300 
impact point live-fire now the thing to
remember<00:04:12.050> when<00:04:12.290> you're<00:04:12.440> adjusting<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:13.100> laser

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
remember when you're adjusting the laser

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.030 
remember when you're adjusting the laser
is<00:04:13.550> that<00:04:14.210> it<00:04:14.450> can<00:04:14.660> only<00:04:14.780> be<00:04:14.960> on<00:04:15.350> very

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
is that it can only be on very

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.430 
is that it can only be on very
specifically<00:04:16.910> as<00:04:17.060> far<00:04:17.120> as<00:04:17.480> up<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:17.930> down<00:04:18.170> in

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
specifically as far as up and down in

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.830 
specifically as far as up and down in
one<00:04:18.500> place<00:04:19.340> at<00:04:19.700> one<00:04:19.910> range<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.570> know<00:04:20.660> the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
one place at one range you know the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.660 
one place at one range you know the
reality<00:04:21.350> is<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.530> bullets<00:04:21.830> coming<00:04:22.070> out<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.400> the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
reality is the bullets coming out of the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.490 
reality is the bullets coming out of the
barrel<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.450> laser<00:04:23.660> is<00:04:23.840> coming<00:04:24.140> from<00:04:24.290> down

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
barrel the laser is coming from down

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.050 
barrel the laser is coming from down
here<00:04:24.860> if<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:25.100> go<00:04:25.220> ahead<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.370> push<00:04:25.550> this<00:04:25.730> into

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
here if I go ahead and push this into

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.640 
here if I go ahead and push this into
battery<00:04:26.360> or<00:04:26.540> gonna<00:04:26.630> see<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:27.020> there's<00:04:27.170> some

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
battery or gonna see that there's some

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.320 
battery or gonna see that there's some
pretty<00:04:27.800> good<00:04:27.890> standoff<00:04:28.520> there<00:04:28.730> so<00:04:28.940> those<00:04:29.060> two

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
pretty good standoff there so those two

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.060 
pretty good standoff there so those two
things<00:04:29.360> are<00:04:29.810> only<00:04:29.990> going<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.350> come<00:04:30.920> together

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
things are only going to come together

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.030 
things are only going to come together
in<00:04:31.430> space<00:04:31.730> at<00:04:32.030> one<00:04:32.180> specific<00:04:32.480> place<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.290> we

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
in space at one specific place so we

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.100 
in space at one specific place so we
need<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.310> set<00:04:34.580> this<00:04:34.760> up<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.180> zero<00:04:35.510> it<00:04:35.780> for<00:04:36.080> a

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
need to set this up and zero it for a

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.050 
need to set this up and zero it for a
range<00:04:36.440> that<00:04:36.680> we<00:04:36.860> would<00:04:37.010> expect<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.520> be<00:04:37.640> using<00:04:38.000> a

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
range that we would expect to be using a

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.430 
range that we would expect to be using a
defensive<00:04:38.480> firearm<00:04:38.870> probably<00:04:39.170> somewhere

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
defensive firearm probably somewhere

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.340 
defensive firearm probably somewhere
between<00:04:39.590> nine<00:04:39.920> and<00:04:40.190> fifteen<00:04:40.280> feet<00:04:41.140> one<00:04:42.140> inch

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
between nine and fifteen feet one inch

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.660 
between nine and fifteen feet one inch
isn't<00:04:42.710> going<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.890> make<00:04:42.980> a<00:04:43.040> big<00:04:43.250> difference<00:04:43.340> if

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
isn't going to make a big difference if

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.860 
isn't going to make a big difference if
you're<00:04:43.790> shooting<00:04:44.000> at<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.240> chest<00:04:44.540> but<00:04:44.780> if

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
you're shooting at the chest but if

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.060 
you're shooting at the chest but if
you're<00:04:44.990> doing<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.260> more<00:04:45.410> precise<00:04:45.800> shot

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
you're doing a more precise shot

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.860 
you're doing a more precise shot
especially<00:04:46.760> if<00:04:47.060> you're<00:04:47.180> using<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.630> laser

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
especially if you're using that laser

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.140 
especially if you're using that laser
for<00:04:48.260> an<00:04:48.320> extended<00:04:48.860> distance<00:04:49.370> you're<00:04:49.880> going<00:04:49.910> to

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
for an extended distance you're going to

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.340 
for an extended distance you're going to
need<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.300> remember<00:04:50.510> that<00:04:50.750> if<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:50.930> zeroed<00:04:51.320> at

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
need to remember that if you zeroed at

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.990 
need to remember that if you zeroed at
fifteen<00:04:51.860> feet<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.340> now<00:04:52.460> you're<00:04:52.670> trying<00:04:52.790> to

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
fifteen feet and now you're trying to

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.540 
fifteen feet and now you're trying to
shoot<00:04:53.240> at<00:04:53.360> 25<00:04:53.750> yards<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.620> up<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.010> down<00:04:55.190> the

shoot at 25 yards the up and down the
