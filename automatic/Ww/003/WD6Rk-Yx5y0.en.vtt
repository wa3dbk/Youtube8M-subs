00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
the most fun parts of riding a

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.860 
the most fun parts of riding a
skateboard<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.730> actually<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.209> riding<00:02:24.689> just

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
skateboard is actually just riding just

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.229 
skateboard is actually just riding just
cruising<00:02:25.349> around<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.129> getting<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:27.000> good

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
cruising around and getting really good

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.030 
cruising around and getting really good
at<00:02:27.299> riding<00:02:27.689> as<00:02:28.110> soon<00:02:28.349> as<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> guys<00:02:28.709> are<00:02:28.890> good

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
at riding as soon as you guys are good

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.559 
at riding as soon as you guys are good
at<00:02:29.069> riding<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.849> your<00:02:30.000> Ollie's<00:02:30.390> down

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
at riding and you have your Ollie's down

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.229 
at riding and you have your Ollie's down
you<00:02:30.900> should<00:02:31.079> just<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.409> rolling<00:02:31.829> around

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
you should just be rolling around

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.390 
you should just be rolling around
popping<00:02:33.239> up<00:02:33.390> curbs<00:02:33.810> rolling<00:02:34.440> off<00:02:34.560> curbs<00:02:35.010> I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
popping up curbs rolling off curbs I

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.670 
popping up curbs rolling off curbs I
should<00:02:35.940> probably<00:02:36.150> make<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.390> full<00:02:36.840> video<00:02:37.379> about

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
should probably make a full video about

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.149 
should probably make a full video about
that<00:02:37.920> soon<00:02:38.750> maybe<00:02:39.750> even<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.200> landslide<00:02:40.769> skate

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
that soon maybe even a landslide skate

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.770 
that soon maybe even a landslide skate
support<00:02:41.549> or<00:02:41.640> something<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.599> yeah

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
support or something like that but yeah

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.559 
support or something like that but yeah
then<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.519> move<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:44.909> to<00:02:45.030> tricks<00:02:45.390> like

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
then you you can move on to tricks like

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.380 
then you you can move on to tricks like
180s<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.290> stuff<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:47.370> yeah<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.000> more<00:02:48.239> you're

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
180s and stuff but yeah the more you're

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.149 
180s and stuff but yeah the more you're
riding<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.049> more<00:02:49.260> you're<00:02:49.409> doing<00:02:49.739> Ollie's

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
riding and the more you're doing Ollie's

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.440 
riding and the more you're doing Ollie's
and<00:02:50.190> all<00:02:50.489> these<00:02:50.640> kinds<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:50.970> things<00:02:51.030> are<00:02:51.329> gonna

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
and all these kinds of things are gonna

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.199 
and all these kinds of things are gonna
make<00:02:51.690> these<00:02:51.930> tricks<00:02:52.290> easier<00:02:52.829> for<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.700> can

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
make these tricks easier for you you can

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.910 
make these tricks easier for you you can
basically<00:02:54.389> think<00:02:54.690> with<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.019> anything

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
basically think with like anything

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.470 
basically think with like anything
that's<00:02:56.069> gonna<00:02:56.280> make<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.670> more<00:02:56.849> comfortable

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
that's gonna make you more comfortable

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.869 
that's gonna make you more comfortable
with<00:02:57.930> your<00:02:58.170> skateboard<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.980> going<00:02:59.639> to<00:02:59.730> make

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
with your skateboard is going to make

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.240 
with your skateboard is going to make
you<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> better<00:03:00.299> skateboarder<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.709> keep<00:03:02.069> that

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
you a better skateboarder so keep that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.369 
you a better skateboarder so keep that
in<00:03:02.310> mind<00:03:02.700> now<00:03:03.329> I'm<00:03:03.599> just<00:03:03.840> gonna<00:03:03.930> break<00:03:04.230> this

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
in mind now I'm just gonna break this

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.800 
in mind now I'm just gonna break this
down<00:03:04.590> quite<00:03:04.980> simply<00:03:05.459> here<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:06.329> looks<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.690> you

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
down quite simply here it looks like you

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.300 
down quite simply here it looks like you
are<00:03:06.989> doing<00:03:07.230> most<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.769> steps<00:03:08.069> correctly

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
are doing most of the steps correctly

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.399 
are doing most of the steps correctly
and<00:03:08.790> actually<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.180> looks<00:03:09.239> like<00:03:09.420> your<00:03:09.690> 180s

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
and actually it looks like your 180s

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.220 
and actually it looks like your 180s
aren't<00:03:10.709> totally<00:03:11.159> fine<00:03:11.639> we<00:03:11.879> just<00:03:12.090> need<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.420> take

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
aren't totally fine we just need to take

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.190 
aren't totally fine we just need to take
it<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.680> streets<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:15.299> actually<00:03:15.780> think<00:03:16.049> it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
it to the streets I actually think it

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.629 
it to the streets I actually think it
will<00:03:16.349> be<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> little<00:03:16.739> easier<00:03:17.280> when<00:03:17.489> you're

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
will be a little easier when you're

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.300 
will be a little easier when you're
popping<00:03:17.879> on<00:03:18.120> regular<00:03:18.540> cement<00:03:19.019> as<00:03:19.739> opposed<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
popping on regular cement as opposed to

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.640 
popping on regular cement as opposed to
the<00:03:20.699> rocks<00:03:21.000> which<00:03:21.389> may<00:03:21.599> work<00:03:21.810> fine<00:03:22.109> they<00:03:22.530> may

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
the rocks which may work fine they may

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.379 
the rocks which may work fine they may
work<00:03:22.859> better<00:03:23.069> than<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.400> thinking<00:03:23.819> they<00:03:24.000> they

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
work better than I'm thinking they they

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.900 
work better than I'm thinking they they
do<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:25.500> yeah<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:25.980> for<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> 180<00:03:26.579> you're

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
do but yeah so for the 180 you're

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.650 
do but yeah so for the 180 you're
basically<00:03:27.540> thinking<00:03:28.139> of<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.440> like<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.650> ollie

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
basically thinking of it like a ollie

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.819 
basically thinking of it like a ollie
while<00:03:30.660> you're<00:03:30.930> turning<00:03:31.349> your<00:03:31.470> head<00:03:31.650> and

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
while you're turning your head and

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.500 
while you're turning your head and
shoulders<00:03:32.220> then<00:03:32.579> you're<00:03:32.879> going<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.180> rotate

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
shoulders then you're going to rotate

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.229 
shoulders then you're going to rotate
your<00:03:33.780> your<00:03:34.470> feet<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.040> your<00:03:35.190> board<00:03:35.459> afterwards

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
your your feet and your board afterwards

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.689 
your your feet and your board afterwards
it's<00:03:36.989> almost<00:03:37.260> like<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.590> pop<00:03:37.859> up<00:03:37.889> into<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.519> air

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
it's almost like you pop up into the air

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.789 
it's almost like you pop up into the air
and<00:03:38.970> then<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.299> realize<00:03:39.690> wow<00:03:39.989> I'm<00:03:40.049> doing<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.590> 180

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
and then you realize wow I'm doing a 180

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.770 
and then you realize wow I'm doing a 180
because<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:41.819> head<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.299> shoulders<00:03:42.629> are

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
because my head and shoulders are

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.530 
because my head and shoulders are
turning<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.949> I<00:03:43.980> guess<00:03:44.430> I'm<00:03:44.639> going<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.000> turn<00:03:45.299> my

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
turning so I guess I'm going to turn my

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.559 
turning so I guess I'm going to turn my
legs<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.500> bring<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.459> around<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.359> the

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
legs and bring it around and then do the

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.280 
legs and bring it around and then do the
180<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.410> yeah<00:03:50.389> just<00:03:51.389> like<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:51.780> here<00:03:52.109> you

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
180 so yeah just like this here you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.439 
180 so yeah just like this here you
basically<00:03:52.889> just<00:03:53.010> multiply<00:03:53.699> yourself<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.359> do

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
basically just multiply yourself and do

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.300 
basically just multiply yourself and do
a<00:03:54.480> thousand<00:03:55.079> 180s<00:03:55.470> in<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.680> row<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:56.160> you

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
a thousand 180s in a row and then you

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.059 
a thousand 180s in a row and then you
got<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:57.019> skateboarding<00:03:58.019> made<00:03:58.139> simple<00:03:58.470> vol.1

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
got it skateboarding made simple vol.1

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.939 
got it skateboarding made simple vol.1
is<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.730> best<00:03:59.970> rendition<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.290> frontside

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
is the best rendition of the frontside

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.680 
is the best rendition of the frontside
180<00:04:02.280> because<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.790> takes<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.120> through<00:04:03.299> all<00:04:03.329> the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
180 because it takes you through all the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.300 
180 because it takes you through all the
prior<00:04:03.930> steps<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.560> then<00:04:04.650> gives<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:04.919> a<00:04:04.980> ton<00:04:05.250> of

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
prior steps and then gives you a ton of

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.789 
prior steps and then gives you a ton of
steps<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.970> practice<00:04:06.419> on<00:04:06.599> that<00:04:07.169> trick<00:04:07.590> in

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
steps to practice on that trick in

a<00:04:10.230> while<00:04:10.409> but<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.769> reason<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.129> works<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:11.430> well

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
a while but the reason it works so well

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:12.020 
a while but the reason it works so well
