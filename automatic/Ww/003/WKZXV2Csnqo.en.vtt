00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 in the certain activity of such as the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.010
 mining excavation killing or 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.420
 even the felling of trees are 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.730
 activities that can be enhanced 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.009
 in many ways using this what 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.089
 autoblog with projects of any 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.379
 let's say the table 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.000
 enchantments what they allow us 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.270
 capture certain objects such as 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.289
 mature woman tool also presents 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.109
 a grew quite complicated 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.910
 needing a book the diamonds and 42 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.769
 is target once within the table 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.529
 enchantment we found the place where 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.790
 the object is deposited to capture it and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.410
 the place of appearance of the different 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.660
 successes that we can apply to the object in 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.579
 question the objects that can receive 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.809
 Enchantments are enough icons 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.520
 updates that are incorporating 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.440
 minecraft are also incorporating new 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.879
 objects to the enchantment table without 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.420
 But the most intuitive thing if at first 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.940
 seen the ax the pick and shovel thrown 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.370
 even the armor and all its parts and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.230
 even the arch but let's move on 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.699
 the really important ones for example to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.309
 put a peak the enchantment table 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.170
 attention appears to one of those options 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.579
 perhaps in the rune the rune as we are 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.010
 seeing then they are hieroglyphics that do not 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.810
 they have no meaning in and of themselves 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.149
 each corresponds to a letter 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.710
 here I leave the image so they are good 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.820
 written randomly and not 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.130
 correspond with any kind of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.509
 existence and another of the things that we 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.399
 also calls quite the attention are 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.899
 those green numbers that appear every 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.189
 green number corresponds to a 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.079
 number of levels that we must wear 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.840
 to activate for example a 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.369
 enchantment of course the greater 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.200
 be the level or the higher the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.479
 number will correspond to a greater 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.240
 spending level and therefore means 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.649
 that the enchantment has to be better yet 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.179
 well the enchantments that are applied in 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.520
 Each type of object are different between 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.229
 one and others for example the objects of 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.909
 protection can receive some kind of 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.520
 treatment as the protection that 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.509
 reduces the damage suffered protection against 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.490
 the fire that as its name indicates 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.899
 reduces the damage against fire attacks 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.340
 Explosion protection that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.319
 It also reduces the damage against 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.610
 Explosions of creepers or tnt other type 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.979
 of protection that costs is for example 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.970
 the protection against projectiles and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.740
 even this object of protection 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.479
 we can make them more breakable 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.500
 another kind of objects as well is the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.210
 weapon can receive different 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.799
 treatments like for example the increase 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.240
 of damage that we can produce when hitting 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.950
 we also find another type of 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.330
 enchantment which allows to make a 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.430
 additional push as they hit a 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.690
 enemy there is also another enchantment 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.130
 quite interesting that applies to 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.980
 weapon and that is that it gives a fire look 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.019
 thus providing fire damage and other 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.280
 kind of use other than the enchantment very 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.930
 curious that we have is that we can 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.440
 increase the European with the weapons that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.239
 we killed 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.280
 that is if we kill a clippers and we 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.080
 release one or two of gunpowder with this 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.480
 treatment may release three four or 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.819
 even five and how can we not do the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.080
 irruptive branch that I repeat to the 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.299
 most common tool to as well be the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.430
 peak the shovel or even nothing can 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.380
 increase certain attributes as it comes to 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.600
 be the efficiency is to say the speed 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.069
 of mine or collection the touch of 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.260
 silk that is also very important already 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.450
 that will allow us to catch and the object already 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.910
 directly as it comes to be the rock or 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.069
 the main stone the probability that 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.420
 of course increase the duration and the 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.980
 fortune that is so applied certain 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.660
 minerals like who makes coal 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.160
 the diamond or the emerald or even 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.349
 also the rest nor the lapis lazuli that 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.480
 for example to break one because it usually gives 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.770
 to sheet everything normal and finally 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.060
 we also have the arch 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.220
 add charms such as 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.110
 irritability also adding power 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.750
 extra for example when hitting an enemy 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.460
 it hits you harder than when 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.290
 hits an enemy because it goes back 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.820
 a lot and we also have two others very 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.200
 interesting that is for example add 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.360
 fire to the arrows that when it hits a 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.560
 enemy this one went on and the infinity 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.540
 that works as if we had 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.489
 endless dates 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.599
 even so if we want to have the greatest 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.459
 amount of enchantment possible 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.260
 we will need to put an ax for example 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.060
 ok we put it reach level 30 and 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.140
 reach for level 30 because there are many 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.180
 shelves placed around the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.469
 mansion decant what I want to give 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.909
 to understand is for example that if we put 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.439
 10 million bookshelf around 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.329
 the enchantments the level is going to 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.519
 maintain the strict maximum level by 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.290
 now so it would only be enough to put a 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.180
 small square around pro table 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.349
 Either way you know that minecraft 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.359
 it's a game that is constantly 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.680
 update and therefore the changes 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.629
 the very large enchantments table before 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.159
 from one update to another can 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.389
 have changed so much change so much 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.639
 objects as enchantments as a 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.329
 levels so there is an approximate guide 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.700
 here provided 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.700
 I hope you have enjoyed luck and chau
