00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.690
 salam aleikoum yao jian 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.220
 instead of waiting for the series of problems 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.730
 thou hast Monday I had to ask 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.860
 questions 1 on one side bigger than 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.430
 the other in 2007 on the left 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.279
 but if the developer right problem 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.380
 of asymmetry of a fiction have a lot 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:29.480
 kifech she or the table lens is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:33.540
 still undergoing muscular asymmetry 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.540
 a crook more fatter side first the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 cause the cause the junta will hand over 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.750
 bad technique program it's up to 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.370
 say it's shooting or the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.140
 push with the most dominant part 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.960
 This means if you are left-ta 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.930
 own language more than the right so 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.899
 you're right handed to push you with the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 right since the left so in bed 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:07.740
 success is a tale in range must 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.600
 experiencing problems where there is the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.560
 problem will also have used kit or the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.590
 kim debate for example bench press 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
 where the shares with a bullet always 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.890
 a decree trauma parties who dominate who 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.810
 elect because you are always 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.570
 thus using this possible 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.650
 indicates the more than the other so he wants 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.470
 to fix the problem problem 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.920
 first you have to find exercises 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.770
 what do you have to do 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.439
 we caress him like a coach and stockings 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.680
 as he can see the tests that like 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.299
 reinforcement or the detestable that we 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.570
 fascinate the exercise or the cane is 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.220
 abandoned since the left 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.479
 m example of the voices then blow on the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.689
 develop in the shoulders will leave 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.570
 barbara wade all grabbed without forgetting the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.030
 aubade range to whom m as before and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.079
 Data on likely by Aouita 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:08.030
 role and discos the fff makes it sleep 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.030
 early in the problem is everything after 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.230
 because he has a stronger reach this 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.310
 that the other he defends ben dhia months 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.290
 ben dhia at the most 90 will cost the jews 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.390
 hurts you guys so you have to find 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.879
 first the exercises and the culture 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.200
 info after you find the part the 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.629
 com com did the most so low wheat 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.950
 that you will find the problem 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.420
 so if you have someone who can 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.489
 you follow his hand as if it was the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.620
 gold version directly up to damask 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.200
 two seconds or even a problem I'm 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.329
 not the only one to kenji the guardian 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.030
 thematic seminars warning 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.129
 hints do not happen what I would be 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.629
 before you I correct you and there I 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.709
 can you explain as long as it is 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.940
 the first things were the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.950
 exercises that you do must therefore 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.440
 example is not there to the director 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.099
 so you can finally ballard some bars 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.480
 bench press develop shoulders the 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.430
 witness you will find some party 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.690
 that they think of more who goes by 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.180
 example the extensions calais jean 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.519
 beaulieu where the pressure you can not 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.260
 see because he does not know visual is 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.760
 vacant so that's the first one already the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.889
 second of things 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.510
 use one more because it's 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.109
 because we have been a complicit 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.489
 control 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:28.230
 cannibal that lay down or there a 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.239
 unilateral movement ie a 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.440
 hand or arms whenever there 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:40.500
 when you see you do the biceps 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.120
 a black each time when you 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.680
 can control a weight you go 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.120
 too much towards the first behind and you 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.620
 also have success the day before as 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.720
 know how to take time but you're going 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.250
 fix it but if you do not have you 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.310
 put in the head I'm going to take 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.690
 brought to cÃ©line kg with the key 100 kg on the back 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.260
 when it was more than we can 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.480
 have employee to have problem 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.480
 it's that your shape and your technique 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.129
 is bad if I was the right form 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.230
 there I fix you that she is probably 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.430
 the better I am for the banana so is there 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.760
 have to find a coach who see you 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:16.289
 like a little word not before so for 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.539
 summarize everything not to measure the 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.810
 results by the ability to lift 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:24.570
 turn that is to say dr el fitr she had 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.750
 without form but measuring the results 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.530
 talk 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.970
 follow-up of circumference measurements 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.940
 muscular which means symmetry 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:41.470
 you will go from asymmetry of 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:46.390
 sillery the estimate makes ugly very simple 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.000
 that or heavy take a power that you 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.450
 can control and use more 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.900
 of alter that bars and always have 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:05:01.210
 someone in front of you to see your 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.350
 voice never ever rush into 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.410
 exercise 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.730
 for the moment the trainings a minor 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.180
 why to show you how you 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:14.020
 you are training seriously 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.910
 all that's all we all have a part 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.360
 despite that you get to correct the 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.720
 problem 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.940
 we all have a party that is bigger 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.500
 that the other gala dozens of men has 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.419
 says if you even look at spring 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.680
 a dom a message that is bigger 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.500
 clues see for example said the 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:36.280
 left to consider it the left too 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:37.350
 clear the left and the right but that's 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.350
 not a problem 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.360
 you're not going to be perfect 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.810
 what will make you have to be perfect 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.880
 fla as much as possible flas nutrition 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.400
 flow recovery workouts 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.620
 every day 5 6 meals burials 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.760
 recovery everything that's what will 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.340
 give you the results waiting for you 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.700
 on weapons were going to make up for life 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.700
 from everyone
