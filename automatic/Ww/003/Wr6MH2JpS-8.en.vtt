00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.880 
so we're going to see what kind of
impact<00:01:00.339> we<00:01:00.730> have<00:01:00.760> I<00:01:01.390> have<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:03.269> mountain<00:01:04.269> range

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
impact we have I have a mountain range

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.620 
impact we have I have a mountain range
about<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:06.130> mile<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:06.760> I<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:06.940> two<00:01:07.120> miles<00:01:07.360> away

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
from my house I'm not quite sure how far

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.190 
from my house I'm not quite sure how far
these<00:01:09.729> things<00:01:09.939> in<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.180> shoot<00:01:10.420> but<00:01:10.960> we're<00:01:11.110> going

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
these things in a shoot but we're going

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.090 
these things in a shoot but we're going
to<00:01:11.259> try<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.470> give<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:11.649> a<00:01:11.740> shot

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
to try to give it a shot

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.899 
to try to give it a shot
see<00:01:12.220> if<00:01:12.280> we<00:01:12.369> can<00:01:12.490> get<00:01:12.579> all<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.790> way<00:01:12.850> the

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
see if we can get all the way the

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.039 
see if we can get all the way the
mountain<00:01:13.210> range<00:01:13.329> with<00:01:13.479> these<00:01:13.630> things<00:01:13.810> let

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
mountain range with these things let

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.990 
mountain range with these things let
gets<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.259> little<00:01:14.350> darker<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:15.700> should<00:01:15.909> be

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
gets a little darker so that should be

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.940 
gets a little darker so that should be
interesting<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.409> then<00:01:17.590> we're<00:01:17.680> going<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.829> take

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
interesting and then we're going to take

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.080 
interesting and then we're going to take
a<00:01:18.009> little<00:01:18.130> drive<00:01:18.310> around<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.759> neighborhood

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
a little drive around the neighborhood

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.120 
a little drive around the neighborhood
and<00:01:19.270> see<00:01:19.329> what<00:01:19.840> we<00:01:19.930> can<00:01:20.049> see<00:01:20.290> see<00:01:20.829> what<00:01:20.950> kind<00:01:21.100> of

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
and see what we can see see what kind of

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.800 
and see what we can see see what kind of
impact<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.729> hopefully<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.390> it'll<00:01:22.659> come<00:01:22.780> up

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
impact that hopefully the it'll come up

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.020 
impact that hopefully the it'll come up
on<00:01:23.020> video<00:01:23.110> sometimes<00:01:23.649> it<00:01:23.770> doesn't<00:01:23.950> but<00:01:24.610> that's

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
on video sometimes it doesn't but that's

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.429 
on video sometimes it doesn't but that's
okay<00:01:25.329> visually<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:25.810> could<00:01:26.020> tell<00:01:26.200> them<00:01:26.320> and

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
okay visually I could tell them and

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.880 
okay visually I could tell them and
visually<00:01:27.159> they<00:01:27.280> can<00:01:27.430> see<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:28.079> so<00:01:29.079> I<00:01:29.409> at<00:01:29.619> least<00:01:29.649> I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
visually they can see it so I at least I

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.010 
visually they can see it so I at least I
know<00:01:29.950> what's<00:01:30.310> going<00:01:30.549> on<00:01:30.640> especially<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.899> a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
know what's going on especially in a

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.410 
know what's going on especially in a
kind<00:01:32.469> of<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.590> cloudy<00:01:32.920> ish<00:01:33.189> kind<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.490> evening<00:01:33.670> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
kind of a cloudy ish kind of evening the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.910 
kind of a cloudy ish kind of evening the
bounce<00:01:34.780> off<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.049> clouds<00:01:35.289> that'd<00:01:35.560> be<00:01:35.680> kind<00:01:35.860> of

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
bounce off the clouds that'd be kind of

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.020 
bounce off the clouds that'd be kind of
cool<00:01:35.979> if<00:01:36.250> they<00:01:36.369> can<00:01:36.490> make<00:01:36.640> that<00:01:36.789> kind<00:01:36.909> of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
cool if they can make that kind of

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.120 
cool if they can make that kind of
distance<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:37.570> all<00:01:38.289> kinds<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.590> cool<00:01:38.740> stuff<00:01:38.770> so

distance so all kinds of cool stuff so

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.249 
distance so all kinds of cool stuff so
these<00:01:39.280> are<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.520> American<00:01:40.000> DJ<00:01:40.149> busy<00:01:40.750> being

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
five hours 575 watts of output per light

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.200 
five hours 575 watts of output per light
with<00:01:46.899> a<00:01:46.930> minimal<00:01:47.350> draw<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.009> we<00:01:48.759> can<00:01:48.880> plug<00:01:49.060> them

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
with a minimal draw so we can plug them

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.670 
with a minimal draw so we can plug them
into<00:01:49.329> a<00:01:49.479> right<00:01:49.810> now<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:49.960> haven't<00:01:50.200> plugged<00:01:50.500> into

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
into a right now I haven't plugged into

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
into a right now I haven't plugged into
a<00:01:50.770> 15<00:01:51.159> amp<00:01:51.310> breaker

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
a 15 amp breaker

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.719 
a 15 amp breaker
so<00:01:52.659> that's<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.200> good<00:01:53.350> thing<00:01:53.409> all<00:01:53.920> four<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.579> them

so that's a good thing all four of them

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.029 
so that's a good thing all four of them
plugged<00:01:54.909> into<00:01:55.090> one<00:01:55.270> circuit<00:01:55.630> my<00:01:56.619> computer's

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
plugged into one circuit my computer's

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.170 
plugged into one circuit my computer's
off<00:01:57.189> to<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.430> side<00:01:57.609> we're<00:01:57.820> going<00:01:57.939> to<00:01:58.000> control

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
off to the side we're going to control

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.029 
off to the side we're going to control
these<00:01:58.390> things<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.840> we'll<00:01:59.560> see<00:01:59.710> what<00:01:59.799> we<00:01:59.890> got

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
these things and we'll see what we got

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.609 
these things and we'll see what we got
going<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.420> prelim<00:02:01.869> all<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.530> we're

going so this is the prelim all so we're

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.899 
going so this is the prelim all so we're
just<00:02:02.740> going<00:02:02.859> to<00:02:02.920> try<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.039> shoot<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.340> up<00:02:03.460> make<00:02:03.880> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
I'll show you a couple scenes right now

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.880 
I'll show you a couple scenes right now
so<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.930> see<00:02:40.200> what<00:02:40.320> we're<00:02:40.440> doing<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.770> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
so you see what we're doing in the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.070 
so you see what we're doing in the
daylight<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.490> then<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.630> can<00:02:42.780> kind<00:02:43.050> of

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
daylight and then you can kind of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.210 
daylight and then you can kind of
correspond<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.740> when<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.950> gets<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.130> little

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
correspond that when it gets a little

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.330 
correspond that when it gets a little
dark<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:49.530> I'm<00:02:49.620> using<00:02:49.800> my<00:02:49.950> sweet<00:02:50.160> light

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
dark so I'm using my sweet light

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.730 
dark so I'm using my sweet light
software<00:02:50.700> right<00:02:50.850> now<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.690> program<00:02:52.530> these

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
software right now to program these

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.380 
software right now to program these
right<00:02:53.400> now<00:02:53.520> they're<00:02:53.670> all<00:02:53.910> doing<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.360> same

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
right now they're all doing the same

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.890 
right now they're all doing the same
scene<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.760> then<00:02:56.760> I'm<00:02:56.910> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.060> pan<00:02:57.420> them<00:02:57.660> out

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
scene and then I'm going to pan them out

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.170 
scene and then I'm going to pan them out
and<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:58.470> they'll<00:02:58.680> each<00:02:59.490> one<00:02:59.790> will<00:02:59.910> hit<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
and then they'll each one will hit the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.730 
and then they'll each one will hit the
same<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.720> different<00:03:00.990> step<00:03:01.200> at<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> different

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
same the different step at a different

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.340 
same the different step at a different
sequence<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.310> it'll<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:03.810> will<00:03:03.960> look<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.230> little

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
sequence so it'll it will look a little

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.300 
sequence so it'll it will look a little
different<00:03:04.770> but<00:03:06.410> sometimes<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.740> will<00:03:08.010> hit

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
different but sometimes this will hit

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.490 
different but sometimes this will hit
the<00:03:08.490> same<00:03:08.760> kind<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.360> beam<00:03:09.630> area<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:10.320> it'll

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the same kind of beam area so it'll

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.979 
the same kind of beam area so it'll
intensify<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.280> beam<00:03:11.460> even<00:03:11.700> more<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.240> pretty

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
intensify that beam even more so pretty

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.640 
intensify that beam even more so pretty
cool<00:03:13.230> stuff<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:15.020> want<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.080> fan<00:03:16.260> these<00:03:16.440> things

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
cool stuff I want to fan these things

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.540 
cool stuff I want to fan these things
out<00:03:16.770> right<00:03:16.920> now<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.160> see<00:03:17.220> what<00:03:17.280> they<00:03:17.400> look

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
out right now and see what they look

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.580 
out right now and see what they look
like

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
like

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.080 
like
just<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.739> quick<00:03:20.010> DMX

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
just a quick DMX

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.900 
just a quick DMX
change<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.050> we<00:03:22.170> can<00:03:22.320> pan<00:03:22.560> them<00:03:22.770> out<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.700> each

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
change and we can pan them out so each

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.479 
change and we can pan them out so each
one<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.300> doing<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:25.470> same<00:03:25.680> thing<00:03:25.739> but<00:03:26.310> at

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
one is doing the same thing but at

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.050 
one is doing the same thing but at
different<00:03:26.610> timing

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.850 

to<00:03:30.300> give<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.599> that<00:03:30.720> crisscross<00:03:31.110> effect<00:03:31.319> that

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
to give you that crisscross effect that

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.040 
to give you that crisscross effect that
swirling<00:03:32.310> effect

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
swirling effect

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.440 
swirling effect
also<00:03:34.830> I'm<00:03:34.920> going<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.100> speed<00:03:35.310> up<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.580> timing<00:03:36.120> so

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
also I'm going to speed up the timing so

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.850 
also I'm going to speed up the timing so
these<00:03:36.630> will<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.050> lot<00:03:37.200> quicker<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.710> let's

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
these will do it a lot quicker so let's

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.540 
these will do it a lot quicker so let's
do<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.040> now<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.500> took<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.800> from<00:03:40.890> ten<00:03:41.160> second

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
do that now so I took it from ten second

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.370 
do that now so I took it from ten second
rotation<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:42.210> five<00:03:42.420> second<00:03:42.720> rotation<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.260> I've

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
rotation to five second rotation so I've

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.360 
rotation to five second rotation so I've
doubled<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:43.800> speed<00:03:44.040> up<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:48.660> pretty<00:03:48.900> quick

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
doubled the speed up so pretty quick

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.270 
doubled the speed up so pretty quick
should<00:03:50.370> look<00:03:50.580> pretty<00:03:50.610> hot<00:03:51.090> up<00:03:51.270> in<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.450> sky<00:03:52.280> got

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
should look pretty hot up in the sky got

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.580 
should look pretty hot up in the sky got
