00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.700 
gonna find they're going to be dealing
with<00:01:41.700> subs<00:01:42.110> themselves<00:01:43.110> typically<00:01:43.590> you're

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
with subs themselves typically you're

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.770 
with subs themselves typically you're
not<00:01:43.740> properly<00:01:44.369> insured<00:01:44.600> they<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.689> no

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
not properly insured they have no

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.749 
not properly insured they have no
workers<00:01:46.140> comp<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.159> anything<00:01:47.399> should

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
workers comp and if anything should

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.690 
workers comp and if anything should
happen<00:01:48.290> frankly<00:01:49.290> there's<00:01:49.470> no<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.799> down<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
happen frankly there's no one down the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
happen frankly there's no one down the
road<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.020> better<00:01:52.380> initial

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
road to to back up that better initial

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.249 
road to to back up that better initial
warranty<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.960> deal<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
warranty so you want to deal with a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
warranty so you want to deal with a
company<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.860> deals<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.280> company

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
company that deals with company

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
company that deals with company
installers<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:58.409> leads<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> next

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
installers and that leads to the next

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.130 
installers and that leads to the next
question<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.579> does<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> company<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.899> full

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
question is does the company have a full

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.530 
question is does the company have a full
time<00:02:01.350> service<00:02:01.770> department<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.540> service

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
and last but not least you want to ask

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.920 
and last but not least you want to ask
yourself<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.310> question<00:02:22.579> which<00:02:23.540> window<00:02:23.900> is

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
yourself a question which window is

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.740 
yourself a question which window is
going<00:02:24.079> to<00:02:24.140> provide<00:02:24.470> me<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.709> best<00:02:25.040> value<00:02:25.750> what

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
going to provide me the best value what

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.880 
going to provide me the best value what
we've<00:02:26.930> learned<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.319> business<00:02:27.379> is<00:02:27.860> that

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
we've learned in this business is that

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.289 
we've learned in this business is that
the<00:02:28.220> window<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.579> might<00:02:28.730> be<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:28.879> little<00:02:29.090> bit

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
the window that might be a little bit

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.750 
the window that might be a little bit
more<00:02:29.480> money<00:02:29.659> up<00:02:29.870> front<00:02:30.049> may<00:02:31.010> actually<00:02:31.159> cost<00:02:31.579> a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
more money up front may actually cost a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.759 
more money up front may actually cost a
little<00:02:31.939> bit<00:02:32.180> less<00:02:32.420> money<00:02:32.629> over<00:02:32.780> time<00:02:33.140> and

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
little bit less money over time and

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.830 
little bit less money over time and
that's<00:02:34.700> because<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> lot<00:02:35.329> of<00:02:35.359> the<00:02:35.510> windows<00:02:35.810> that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
that's because a lot of the windows that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.670 
that's because a lot of the windows that
are<00:02:36.079> a<00:02:36.109> little<00:02:36.260> more<00:02:36.439> money<00:02:37.120> typically<00:02:38.120> have
