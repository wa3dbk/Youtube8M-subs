 listed here on the weekend heavy 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.729
 Partie against the FC liverpool in the

 as well as against west bromide albion 1 2 1 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.729
 played 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.990
 borussia dortmund here twice as 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.090
 winner of the place in the duel gone 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.939
 a tie between the two 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.710
 victory of the gunners 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.159
 So you see everything balanced 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.409
 between the two for dortmund three times 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.380
 Robert Lewandowski has been successful 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.060
 once henrik mkhitaryan once marco 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.780
 reus at arsenal striker zero with 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.920
 two goals 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.250
 recapture them with a world and remzi 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.190
 also with a bude dortmund thanks 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.980
 the victory on the last day of play 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.590
 ranked one due to the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.670
 Slightly better goal difference 63 goals at 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.670
 two victories and one defeat 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.820
 only one hit worse and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.340
 so that with five to three gates at 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.510
 tie on the second place 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.030
 and who will definitely get one? 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.370
 but very hard games what you want 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.220
 has very difficult predictably 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.100
 think that probably a one to one than 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.480
 also a 2 1-success that must be in the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.250
 The possible frames are not that 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.560
 only thing I exclude here now 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.390
 would if you have an outward success of that 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.280
 londoner but otherwise the game is 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.590
 but not so easy again 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.810
 I think it's similar but it is 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.600
 that actually all the results in it 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.670
 are lawn of course what the kommune 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.920
 The combination game actually works 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.580
 to settle much stronger than 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.480
 dortmund but definitely 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.450
 For me, all three are actually 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.010
 results so within the framework of the possible 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.959
 especially if you are so on the balance 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.959
 looks if one has won a 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.459
 wassermann won with a goal difference 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.590
 and that's why I was brave and say 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.590
 dortmund wins with 2 to 1
