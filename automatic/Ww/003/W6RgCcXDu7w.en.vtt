00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
memory card used to rig and it has to be

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
memory card used to rig and it has to be
and<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.290> number<00:01:10.770> 16<00:01:11.219> it's<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.579> best<00:01:11.759> formula

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and it's number 16 it's the best formula

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.859 
and it's number 16 it's the best formula
one<00:01:12.920> talks<00:01:13.920> about<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:15.030> beginning<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.689> like

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
normal math stuff and then when you get

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.050 
normal math stuff and then when you get
to<00:01:18.539> the<00:01:18.719> end<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.020> last<00:01:19.140> sentence<00:01:19.560> says
