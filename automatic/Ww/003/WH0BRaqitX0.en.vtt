00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
shotting people so I just decided to use

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.410 
shotting people so I just decided to use
hone<00:01:36.060> Clause<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.189> another<00:01:38.850> thing<00:01:38.939> we're<00:01:39.299> gonna

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
hone Clause so another thing we're gonna

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.050 
hone Clause so another thing we're gonna
need<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.900> note<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:41.180> that

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
need to note is that

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.830 
need to note is that
the<00:01:44.869> magnet<00:01:45.710> raised<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.280> not<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:47.420> permanent

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
the magnet raised is not a permanent

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.050 
the magnet raised is not a permanent
thing<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.680> you're<00:01:48.830> gonna<00:01:48.950> need<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.280> renew<00:01:50.030> that

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
thing so you're gonna need to renew that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.620 
thing so you're gonna need to renew that
every<00:01:50.450> once<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.840> while<00:01:50.869> I<00:01:51.369> believe<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:52.759> 4

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
every once in a while I believe it is 4

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.859 
every once in a while I believe it is 4
to<00:01:53.869> 5<00:01:54.140> turns<00:01:54.560> three<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.159> five<00:01:55.340> turns<00:01:55.700> as<00:01:56.060> you

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
to 5 turns three to five turns as you

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.870 
to 5 turns three to five turns as you
can<00:01:56.990> see<00:01:57.170> there<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:58.520> wore<00:01:59.299> off<00:01:59.479> so<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.840> reused<00:02:00.409> it

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
can see there it wore off so I reused it

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.990 
can see there it wore off so I reused it
and<00:02:04.149> yeah<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:08.440> at<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:09.590> point<00:02:09.920> no<00:02:10.550> one<00:02:10.580> can<00:02:10.880> be

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
and yeah so at this point no one can be

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.250 
and yeah so at this point no one can be
it<00:02:11.090> no<00:02:11.420> one<00:02:11.540> can<00:02:11.750> attack<00:02:12.620> me<00:02:12.920> really<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.930> can

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
it no one can attack me really and I can

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.410 
it no one can attack me really and I can
just<00:02:15.500> raise<00:02:16.190> my<00:02:16.430> special<00:02:16.790> attack

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
just raise my special attack

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.790 
just raise my special attack
I<00:02:17.450> could<00:02:17.720> attack<00:02:18.019> them<00:02:18.290> one<00:02:18.470> by<00:02:18.650> one<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:20.800> just

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
I could attack them one by one and just

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.930 
I could attack them one by one and just
to<00:02:22.010> prove<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:26.769> -<00:02:27.769> entire<00:02:28.040> tops<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.550> going<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
to prove this - entire tops is going to

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.229 
to prove this - entire tops is going to
use<00:02:29.150> an<00:02:29.450> earth-type<00:02:29.780> attack<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.910> as<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.090> can

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
use an earth-type attack and as you can

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.140 
use an earth-type attack and as you can
see<00:02:32.300> there<00:02:32.810> as<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:35.420> can<00:02:35.569> see<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.870> second

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
see there as you can see in a second

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.839 
see there as you can see in a second
just<00:02:38.150> let<00:02:38.560> -<00:02:39.560> arrow<00:02:39.769> tops<00:02:39.980> use<00:02:40.370> it

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.199 

okay<00:02:43.900> anyway<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.400> bulldoze<00:02:46.400> would<00:02:46.909> not<00:02:47.060> have

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
okay anyway so bulldoze would not have

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.479 
okay anyway so bulldoze would not have
done<00:02:47.359> any<00:02:47.599> damage<00:02:47.840> due<00:02:48.379> to<00:02:48.409> magnet<00:02:49.310> rise

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
done any damage due to magnet rise

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.030 
done any damage due to magnet rise
meaning<00:02:49.969> that<00:02:50.090> ground<00:02:50.959> type<00:02:51.200> moves<00:02:51.500> would<00:02:51.829> not

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
meaning that ground type moves would not

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.899 
meaning that ground type moves would not
hit<00:02:52.340> him<00:02:53.230> which<00:02:54.230> means<00:02:54.439> that<00:02:54.829> electrons<00:02:55.730> right

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
hit him which means that electrons right

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.020 
hit him which means that electrons right
now<00:02:56.090> has<00:02:56.359> absolutely<00:02:57.040> no<00:02:58.450> weaknesses<00:02:59.450> so

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
now has absolutely no weaknesses so

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.089 
now has absolutely no weaknesses so
wonder<00:03:02.030> guard<00:03:02.299> a<00:03:02.629> lot<00:03:03.170> makes<00:03:03.469> it<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:03.920> he

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
wonder guard a lot makes it so that he

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.420 
wonder guard a lot makes it so that he
cannot<00:03:04.340> take<00:03:04.519> damage<00:03:04.840> now<00:03:05.840> as<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.370> see

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
cannot take damage now as you can see

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.580 
cannot take damage now as you can see
here<00:03:07.819> there<00:03:08.000> is<00:03:08.030> one<00:03:08.450> thing<00:03:08.719> that<00:03:08.750> can<00:03:09.139> damage

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
here there is one thing that can damage

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.500 
here there is one thing that can damage
him<00:03:09.620> well<00:03:09.950> actually<00:03:10.099> there's<00:03:10.430> multiple<00:03:10.909> one

another thing that would be able to

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.899 
another thing that would be able to
damage<00:03:24.319> Electro's<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.189> if<00:03:25.340> he<00:03:25.489> was<00:03:25.579> poisoned

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
damage Electro's is if he was poisoned

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.339 
damage Electro's is if he was poisoned
or<00:03:26.480> burned<00:03:27.549> now

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
there it is right there Mew use

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.710 
there it is right there Mew use
transform<00:03:49.909> on<00:03:50.209> electrons<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.139> also<00:03:52.099> took

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
transform on electrons and also took

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.319 
transform on electrons and also took
electrolysis<00:03:54.220> wonder<00:03:55.220> guard<00:03:55.489> as<00:03:55.729> well<00:03:56.030> as<00:03:56.150> all

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
electrolysis wonder guard as well as all

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.259 
electrolysis wonder guard as well as all
of<00:03:56.359> his<00:03:56.510> attacks<00:03:56.840> meaning<00:03:57.349> that<00:03:57.729> mu<00:03:58.729> is<00:03:59.030> now

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
of his attacks meaning that mu is now

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.119 
of his attacks meaning that mu is now
also<00:03:59.829> invincible<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:02.840> this<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.500> probably

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
also invincible so this is probably

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.390 
also invincible so this is probably
gonna<00:04:04.340> end<00:04:04.430> up<00:04:04.699> leaving<00:04:04.939> us<00:04:05.269> at<00:04:05.449> a<00:04:05.479> stalemate

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400

yeah<00:04:10.400> as<00:04:10.729> you<00:04:11.599> can<00:04:11.629> see<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:12.470> can<00:04:13.459> finish<00:04:13.669> off<00:04:13.909> all

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
yeah as you can see I can finish off all

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.939 
yeah as you can see I can finish off all
of<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:14.299> pokemon<00:04:14.870> they<00:04:15.109> can't<00:04:15.409> really<00:04:15.590> hurt

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
of this pokemon they can't really hurt

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.490

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
me but there is one major problem now mu

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.480 
me but there is one major problem now mu
is<00:04:21.500> invincible

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
is invincible

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.810 
is invincible
I<00:04:22.759> can<00:04:23.690> try<00:04:23.930> raising<00:04:24.169> my<00:04:24.560> attack<00:04:24.949> he<00:04:25.220> can<00:04:25.550> try

raising his attack but - arrow tops

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.200 
raising his attack but - arrow tops
looks<00:04:30.320> like<00:04:30.560> he<00:04:30.710> may<00:04:31.099> be<00:04:31.130> winning<00:04:31.849> this<00:04:31.970> one

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
looks like he may be winning this one

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.070 
looks like he may be winning this one
I'm<00:04:32.360> not<00:04:32.599> sure

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
here is shiny new using transform

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.410 
here is shiny new using transform
transforms<00:04:42.220> into<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.490> shiny<00:04:42.790> version<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.330> the
