 The Bauhaus Dessau became a center of ideas in the 1920s 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.219
 Kaderschmiede for designers architects and artists of the budding twentieth

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.269
 his 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.560

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:12.519
 anyone 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.650

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.559
 to maybe a bit more to cover up his shame 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.559

 I get my own apartment and that's why I say my game 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.669

 Cooling is no longer just about captivating things, it's not just about how it works 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:14.849
