hose cap off and put the hose just like
you<00:01:48.720> would<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.430> dump<00:01:50.430> any<00:01:50.670> other<00:01:50.880> way<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.689> there

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you would to dump any other way so there

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.600 
you would to dump any other way so there
we<00:01:51.960> go

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
we go

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.800 
we go
next<00:01:53.610> we're<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> open<00:01:54.390> up<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.750> little

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
next we're going to open up this little

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.350 
next we're going to open up this little
vent<00:01:55.290> valve<00:01:55.710> over<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.280> without<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:57.090> being

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
vent valve over here without it being

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.639 
vent valve over here without it being
vented<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.810> would<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:57.990> very<00:01:58.170> hard<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.469> dump<00:01:59.540> and

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
vented it would be very hard to dump and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:13.010 
vented it would be very hard to dump and
that's<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.219> time<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.520> dump<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.060> go

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.930 

yeah<00:02:16.830> okay<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:17.860> now<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.460> slowed<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.910> a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
yeah okay and now that that slowed to a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:27.320 
yeah okay and now that that slowed to a
trickle<00:02:19.000> close<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.080> dump<00:02:20.260> valve<00:02:23.340> disconnect

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.470

tote now over here we're going to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.170 
tote now over here we're going to
reattach<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.880> event<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:47.850> we're<00:02:48.850> done

the<00:02:51.040> dump<00:02:51.280> or<00:02:51.489> in<00:02:51.580> my<00:02:51.700> case<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.150> sewer

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
the dump or in my case the sewer

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.979 
the dump or in my case the sewer
clean-out

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
clean-out

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.560 
clean-out
now<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.830> handle<00:02:54.310> has<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.640> kind<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.330> unique

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
now this handle has a kind of unique

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.210 
now this handle has a kind of unique
feature<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:56.860> hook<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.130> over

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
feature and that you can hook it over

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.300 
feature and that you can hook it over
the<00:02:57.459> trailer<00:02:58.360> hitch<00:02:58.510> ball<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.800> won't<00:03:00.190> be

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
the trailer hitch ball so I won't be

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.800 
the trailer hitch ball so I won't be
doing<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.180> my<00:03:01.300> side<00:03:01.510> yard

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
doing that just to get to my side yard

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.900 
doing that just to get to my side yard
but<00:03:02.050> just<00:03:02.380> know<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.650> can<00:03:02.860> we're<00:03:03.670> off<00:03:03.760> to

going to need these two extra
accessories<00:03:24.270> first<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:25.050> double<00:03:25.530> pin

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
accessories first is a double pin

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.790 
accessories first is a double pin
adapter<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.750> 90-degree<00:03:27.750> elbow<00:03:27.930> these<00:03:28.560> will

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
adapter and 90-degree elbow these will

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.440

allow you to dump in the same way you
dump<00:03:30.780> with<00:03:30.960> a<00:03:30.990> regular<00:03:31.380> RV<00:03:31.890> dump<00:03:32.100> us<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.880> let's

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
dump with a regular RV dump us so let's

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.680 
dump with a regular RV dump us so let's
get<00:03:33.180> started

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
get started

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.800 
get started
first<00:03:34.500> we're<00:03:34.830> going<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.010> attach<00:03:35.880> these<00:03:36.240> like

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
first we're going to attach these like

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.050 
first we're going to attach these like
so<00:03:38.390> then<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:39.900> are<00:03:39.990> going<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.380> release<00:03:41.250> the

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
so then we are going to release the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.600 
so then we are going to release the
sewer<00:03:42.240> hose<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.900> take<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.140> cap<00:03:43.320> off<00:03:43.530> now<00:03:44.280> at

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
sewer hose and take the cap off now at

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.080 
sewer hose and take the cap off now at
this<00:03:44.820> point<00:03:45.210> it's<00:03:46.140> very<00:03:46.260> important<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.940> you

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
this point it's very important that you

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.110 
this point it's very important that you
keep<00:03:48.330> this<00:03:48.690> little<00:03:49.410> thing<00:03:49.770> attached<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
keep this little thing attached in the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.670 
keep this little thing attached in the
upright<00:03:51.480> position<00:03:51.660> because<00:03:52.170> as<00:03:52.200> soon<00:03:52.440> as<00:03:52.560> this

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
upright position because as soon as this

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.200 
upright position because as soon as this
falls<00:03:52.950> down<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.430> tank<00:03:53.580> is<00:03:53.730> going<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:53.970> start<00:03:54.180> to

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
falls down the tank is going to start to

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.110 
falls down the tank is going to start to
empty<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.650> we<00:03:56.100> take<00:03:56.850> our<00:03:57.060> adaptors<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:59.120> we

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
empty so we take our adaptors and we

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.150 
empty so we take our adaptors and we
twist<00:04:00.330> them<00:04:00.510> on<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:03.650> we<00:04:04.650> are<00:04:04.740> going<00:04:04.980> to

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
twist them on like so we are going to

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.210 
twist them on like so we are going to
attach<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.240> dump<00:04:06.810> pose<00:04:07.020> to<00:04:07.830> our<00:04:07.980> sewer

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
attach the dump pose to our sewer

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.760 
attach the dump pose to our sewer
connection<00:04:09.050> keeping<00:04:10.050> this<00:04:10.170> little<00:04:10.410> arch<00:04:10.560> in

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
connection keeping this little arch in

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.830 
connection keeping this little arch in
the<00:04:10.860> hose<00:04:11.060> next<00:04:12.060> thing<00:04:12.180> we're<00:04:12.300> going<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.630> is

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
the hose next thing we're going to do is

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.880 
the hose next thing we're going to do is
we're<00:04:12.990> going<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.140> release<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.650> vent

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
we're going to release the vent

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.130 
we're going to release the vent
so<00:04:16.890> now<00:04:16.980> we<00:04:17.040> can<00:04:17.220> vent<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.930> here's<00:04:18.930> how<00:04:19.080> we

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
so now we can vent and here's how we
