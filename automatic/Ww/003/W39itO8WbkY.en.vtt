00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
from what I understand Preston's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.279 
from what I understand Preston's
resources<00:02:01.789> are<00:02:01.940> limited<00:02:02.330> I<00:02:02.750> think<00:02:02.959> we've<00:02:03.080> got

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
resources are limited I think we've got

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.590 
resources are limited I think we've got
so<00:02:03.560> quite<00:02:03.920> small<00:02:04.190> squad<00:02:04.610> or<00:02:04.880> something<00:02:04.910> low

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
so quite small squad or something low

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.150 
so quite small squad or something low
experience<00:02:06.170> levels<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.740> thing<00:02:06.920> that<00:02:06.950> was

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
experience levels and the thing that was

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160 
experience levels and the thing that was
always<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.429> danger<00:02:07.640> once<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.270> complete<00:02:08.929> our

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
always a danger once a complete our

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.770 
always a danger once a complete our
players<00:02:09.470> get<00:02:09.740> injured<00:02:10.160> trying<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.330> carry<00:02:11.630> on
