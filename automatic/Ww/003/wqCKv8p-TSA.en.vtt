00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
back-to-school I know that seems pretty

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.200 
back-to-school I know that seems pretty
impossible<00:00:38.930> but<00:00:39.920> with<00:00:40.460> these<00:00:40.580> steps<00:00:40.940> I<00:00:41.180> think

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
impossible but with these steps I think

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.600 
impossible but with these steps I think
it<00:00:41.630> could<00:00:41.809> make<00:00:42.020> quite<00:00:42.559> magical<00:00:42.739> a<00:00:43.040> little<00:00:43.430> bit

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
it could make quite magical a little bit

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.860 
it could make quite magical a little bit
better<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:44.059> a<00:00:44.120> little<00:00:44.150> bit<00:00:44.390> easier<00:00:44.720> I

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
better and a little bit easier I

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.150 
better and a little bit easier I
personally<00:00:45.440> never<00:00:45.620> seen<00:00:45.770> one<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.100> these

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160
