 we have the mind two more cases their 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.630
 symmetrical that is 4 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840
 I'm unemployed with the most

 basic I know how to do 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.259
 when the 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.169
 Instantly 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.169
 is 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.740
 side and the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.010
 migration corner 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.140
 The front 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.380
 in the month of October the case of the left 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.110
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.430
 how joseba the bread 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.070
 here the battering ram 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.790
 Tehran 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.190
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.730
 at its headquarters in its center 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.929
 here the 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.390
 He is a finalist, so be it 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.490
 ahead 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.490
 That is, this does not work for me 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.770
 when the one is wrong 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.430
 this serves me 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.470
 i this case is 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.000
 there are quite simply 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.700
 i will solve without 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 in the first 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.150
 press 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 lebrija 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.810
 pretty simple 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.260
 aaron porter 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.220
 the case on side 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.560
 in fact 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.320
 the same as him 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.410
 percent 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.830
 previously 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.300
 it will be solved if 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
 a premium rpp r premium 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.050
 other 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.470
 in maryland 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.900
 is 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.870
 r a bonus 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.870
 closed efe rfg premium 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.600
 The difference is that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.010
 it is armed as / 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.360
 I wanted to insert from this one 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.549
 way 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.839
 percent for 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:11.940
 does the moral 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.839
 behind 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:14.779
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.399
 for this case of nothing 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:22.399
 right if those who exclude us come back here and left 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.039
 it's this 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.709
 a bonus premium 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 the premium epu 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.959
 and at the same time the side of the left when we come by 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.279
 serra shots solve like this 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.179
 premium 1 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:43.389
 r uu 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.349
 a primate represses pujerra 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.119
 do not go 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.059
 we go with the foot 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.059
 case they are not 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:03:00.049
 this is when the activist being with her color hina corners looks towards him 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.679
 for example this excel from the side 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.819
 This right 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.099
 I send her to solve it, it's just 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.269
 r r premium or r r premium 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.810
 again r is to look for represses a red bull primate to be repeated 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.889
 what is done is basically 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.089
 in turn that reduces the premiums are premiums and 100 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.389
 and there is 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.629
 the case of these simple Haitian dilemmas 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.539
 Ferrero in Rome 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.539
 the same is valid 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.619
 left 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:46.029
 here it is 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.999
 the epr and macu prima l 1 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.999
 inconsistent and announces the easiest case 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.849
 hamas 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.799
 suppose what on Monday 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.089
 Singapore 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.179
 percent this this test detects that there are people this 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.579
 as you can see nothing adicae will present with your 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.519
 with its center 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.619
 corner 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.619
 here is the color you want 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.319
 for when this havana 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:20.169
 the right 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.930
 will be solved without r premium a bonus r is to play repress compress war 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.240
 now we add that it reaches us is because he side and if I wanted to say so 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.990
 with its indra center 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.789
 corner asia 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.909
 that side are just like that the premium cousin 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.719
 l prima 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:45.800
 and good 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.210
 that com 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.610
 so concludes 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.110
 this part of 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.729
 neither 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.240
 tutorial 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.770
 we see him in it the next video bye bye
