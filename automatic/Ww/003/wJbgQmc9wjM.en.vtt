00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello today we are going to talk about the cares 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.290
 that reptiles need we all know 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.490
 that reptiles are blood animals 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.170
 cool 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.590
 in the ambient temperature of your 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.650
 terrarium will regulate your metabolism your 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.869
 breathing your digestion and everything 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 your whole environment then it is very 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.600
 important that all reptiles 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.800
 let's put the appropriate 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.369
 temperature according to the type of reptile 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.760
 for that we have foci plates and rocks 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.550
 thermals within the foci we have 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 example this type of focus is uv rays 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.170
 baby 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 in general there are two types v &amp; v to this one 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.899
 baby will help them get calcium 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.070
 the uvea rays remain in your bones 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.010
 They are like more to give warmth and light 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.220
 reptiles need both foci is 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.290
 important that you read what kind of little 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.180
 be and you inform yourself before having 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.800
 any kind of reptile old iguanas 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.840
 tarantulas although they are not reptiles 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.870
 they also need to be kind of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.780
 temperature 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.420
 of snakes turtles it is important that 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.150
 at what temperature and humidity should 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.350
 being is very important now all 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.470
 these types are few 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.550
 they bring here a base that tells you what type 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.980
 of how many degrees of light cloud will you see for 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.430
 the vision of the reptile when you see 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.680
 normal light and if they give heat or not based on 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.070
 this is going to be healing with the amount of 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.120
 focuses that you are going to put this one is important 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.920
 and it is for the day the rays of a baby 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:50.640
 we also have this type of spotlights that 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 as the sun says they are so light 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.030
 It is important to insist also that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.100
 check the images of the few many 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.200
 few already tell you what kind of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.880
 animals are here we can see a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.880
 equality a python 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.830
 then they always bring instructions that 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.080
 we can read and that will help us 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.330
 a lot to know what kind of little 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.230
 put the projectiles 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.930
 these bulbs are heat 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.820
 these are sunbaths there are animals of 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.410
 septic who need much more 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.080
 amount of sun in certain hours of life 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.000
 this little bit is for them to be turtles 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.920
 are some types of reptiles for us 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.380
 they need this type of coconut 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.480
 specifically 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.990
 we also handle this which is a focus 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.600
 infrared that give heat and light this is 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.150
 can also put at night some 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.030
 reptiles also need to see at night 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.890
 to hunt for example from cats the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.810
 becos normally leave at night to 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.870
 hunt and then they have to have certain 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.550
 kind of light this only give birth 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.250
 humidity and heat too 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.680
 This is managed as indicated by 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.050
 night and it 's precisely how we have 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.569
 here the image where to place it goes to 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.250
 maintain the temperature of the canary 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.950
 will always 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.700
 at night it is very black and the bass of 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.700
 late elche 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.690
 another kind of for example for what they are 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.910
 these pawns labeled the teeth that 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.069
 if they need a little type but they are 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.490
 more on floor almost all the time is in 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.740
 floor 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.530
 you can complement it with what they are 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.409
 technical plates 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.900
 there are also plants allowed for 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:48.140
 tropical animals that do not have as much 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.810
 meanwhile they do not need so much heat or to 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.909
 animals up close it is important that 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.760
 checks this before placing the plant 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.769
 the plates always go on glass 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.890
 never increase on the plastic 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.710
 professional languages 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.620
 these crazy thermal that is not something else 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.930
 they have a resistance inside 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.690
 connects and these surfaces so that what 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.209
 useful do not burn can be used a lot 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.880
 as you can see for some summers 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.519
 and for some snakes because certain 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.690
 parts of the day like to be on the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.820
 hot part of your terrarium 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:29.529
 this we tell you that you can use it 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.899
 from the plate ends depending 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:34.179
 to know the right temperature 

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:36.339
 you should always use a thermometer that 

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:38.889
 is going to be stuck in the fish tank in the 

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:41.070
 terrarium if your thermal plate is in 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.890
 this area and the dog 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.170
 something like this big has to go to 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.480
 less to a hand of 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.120
 equally a unifier 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.790
 this topic measures a hydrometer but this 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.370
 will measure the amount of moisture that 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.830
 your desert reptile must have 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.290
 they really have less an iguana a 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.180
 Chameleon that are from tropical climates 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.710
 they need between 60 and 80 percent of 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.270
 humidity that's what you're going to achieve with 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.820
 moisten the terrarium with an atomizer 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.390
 several times a day or with a system of 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.390
 rain 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.390
 this is the basics to keep marine 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.470
 behind
