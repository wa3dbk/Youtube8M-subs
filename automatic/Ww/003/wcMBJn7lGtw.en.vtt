00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 warmed up they encouraged me to keep going 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.810
 and good this triumph dedicated us once 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.540
 more than more than 30 million 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.330
 Peruvians that today rose to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.040
 6 in the morning to see this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.660
 important competition of the games 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.810
 Pan American Games and especially what is 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.180
 marathon of course gladys to beat a 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.820
 Pan-American record 233 013 the brand 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.710
 officer who has just registered the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.060
 tejeras with Pan-American record imagined 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.880
 the chest will explode you 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.470
 you got extreme and dye and you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.760
 knees you for the emotion more than for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.430
 fatigue like that is I think that from the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.670
 principle had the clear objective and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.219
 defined and always went out to win is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.980
 always the louis trainings of 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.420
 cost the intention to be able to win 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.460
 imagining myself was among the first 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.280
 imagining being on the top of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.559
 podium and I always work with that mind 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.260
 with that psychology and above all also 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.270
 thank my coach that these 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.579
 last month mainly supported me a lot 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.489
 very much and also to his wife wife 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.659
 which is one of the marathoners one of 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.149
 the good marathoners 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.329
 she has mexico and she also supported me 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.490
 lot of physics and psychologically what 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.670
 which I believe that with all faith is the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.130
 experience of two great coaches 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.520
 of two great athletes as is the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.340
 Rodolfo Gomez course and did not support me 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.590
 lots to be able to have this goal and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.349
 the truth I did not expect it to be able to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.530
 beat another Pan-American record and also 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:36.840
 do not take the gold and it is a very 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.549
 big conect of Peru now tells you 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.899
 who wants to say agreement but is not 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.060
 Excited with what you have achieved 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.920
 the day definitely raised the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.869
 cee the early morning we have left 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.369
 live just with your career 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.899
 All Peru awakened by what you have 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.780
 achieved there are no words to thank you 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.909
 just this this achievement this gold and a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.260
 spectacular record a shame he urinates 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.330
 they are fine 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.700
 and the truth 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.610
 I believe that in a competition they can 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.690
 spend a lot of things nothing is said 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.330
 until you can even be convinced 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.660
 the arrival until the goal over 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.630
 everything but I think that Peru has a 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.240
 great potential what is in the fondismo 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.120
 and I believe we will continue to demonstrate 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.160
 many athletes that go with this with 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.080
 this kind of ideas with this kind of 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.930
 objective and I think that the whole Peru is going 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.520
 to grow little by little and someday I 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.240
 I think we 're going to do power 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.450
 global command believe in that we believe in 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.250
 I really did not expect it, I did not 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.290
 I expected this record the truth is that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.690
 I was going for the gold medal but maximum 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.260
 for the record but and things happened 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.480
 definitely from kilometer 19 already 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.370
 I had to define and live live 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.800
 For all Peru, Francisco is coming 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.300
 boza Pan-American medalist takes the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.100
 of gold also from france and with its 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.780
 specialty means of our 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.760
 compatriot pancho is watching us all 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.709
 the peru with gladys tejeda record 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.340
 Pan-American emotion overwhelms us 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.640
 Christian 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.720
 The truth is that they are not only working 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.770
 with the master's program 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.190
 decentralized after 2012 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.920
 and this is the truth that the triumph is 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.450
 she inés worried about lines because 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.010
 in two days of his strong test of 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.740
 10,000 meters and we are sure that they are going 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.360
 to give the best the best but there are already two 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.150
 gold medals something historic from 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.100
 buenos aires 51 was not achieved and we are 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.170
 god through I do not know or that we have a 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.910
 more because this is a program this is 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.370
 a work plan and you have to think about 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.170
 long term you have to think big and 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.760
 nobody has been shown to be a great 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.770
 Athlete true that goal and walking is 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.170
 we have raúl pacheco that comes we have 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.940
 only guide nor kid cup so god 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.590
 by luck accompany us the 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.900
 10,000 to enjoy another medal now 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.490
 do not go francisco and gladys is from there 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.830
 is also this Pan-American with the one of 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.150
 gold two golds for all the Peru 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.770
 they have given us immense joy 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.240
 spectacular really that emotion 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.800
 Life overwhelms us has made us 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.790
 let's make world powers is 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.860
 with this discipline 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.600
 I believe that not only in this but the plan 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.770
 Pan American Lima 2019 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.380
 you have to invest a lot and in 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.660
 marathoners the program is giving its 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.280
 results I think that 's something that 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.940
 When you work long term to 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.150
 consciousness and with investment 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.010
 and with the right technicians being on 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.959
 all with the sports of the athletes 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.910
 and the leaders were moved from 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.710
 athlete roberto but we are to go 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.510
 by the athletes now nobody how much 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.790
 cost this gold medal the people do not 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.650
 Maybe you know the time that gets you up 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.900
 hour you train how many times between 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.390
 more often people are unaware of the 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.390
 sacrifice that he had justly 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.670
 one of them I trust very much that everything 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.640
 is in the mentality I think if one 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.400
 it is in this discipline what is the 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.600
 one marathon already from the moment you 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.030
 starts to perform this sport 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.940
 you already have everything that is already 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.490
 mentalized the great sacrifice the pain 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.560
 what will this sport cost us? 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.260
 true the marathon can not do it 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.270
 any one is a very special sport is 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.420
 a long-winded sport and I think 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.060
 that I have here what effectively 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.010
 everything is going to be defined, I think the 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.440
 inner strength that one has the 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.500
