00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.930 
looking at a pitch shifter and smart
harmony<00:00:17.770> so<00:00:18.770> previously<00:00:19.310> we've<00:00:19.490> looked<00:00:19.699> at

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
harmony so previously we've looked at

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.300 
harmony so previously we've looked at
crunch<00:00:20.480> tones<00:00:20.810> we've<00:00:21.590> looked<00:00:21.800> at<00:00:21.949> high<00:00:22.070> gain

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
crunch tones we've looked at high gain

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.150 
crunch tones we've looked at high gain
tones<00:00:22.609> we<00:00:22.820> look<00:00:22.939> to<00:00:23.060> clean<00:00:23.269> tones<00:00:23.769> all<00:00:24.769> of

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
tones we look to clean tones all of

edit and this is all about how to tweak
great<00:00:32.960> tones<00:00:33.260> really<00:00:33.980> quickly<00:00:37.150> so<00:00:38.150> let's<00:00:38.480> get

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
great tones really quickly so let's get

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.650 
great tones really quickly so let's get
straight<00:00:39.110> in<00:00:39.470> to<00:00:39.860> it<00:00:40.850> let's<00:00:41.060> go<00:00:41.180> back<00:00:41.360> to<00:00:41.480> where

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
straight in to it let's go back to where

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.480 
straight in to it let's go back to where
we<00:00:41.780> left<00:00:41.960> off<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:42.470> we've<00:00:42.590> got<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:42.920> crunch<00:00:43.370> the

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
we left off so we've got the crunch the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.700 
we left off so we've got the crunch the
metal<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.000> clean<00:00:44.150> tones<00:00:44.480> all<00:00:45.290> of<00:00:45.560> which

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
metal and the clean tones all of which

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.220 
metal and the clean tones all of which
are<00:00:45.800> going<00:00:45.890> to<00:00:45.980> be<00:00:46.070> on<00:00:46.190> custom<00:00:46.580> tone<00:00:46.820> com<00:00:47.330> you

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
are going to be on custom tone com you

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.620 
are going to be on custom tone com you
can<00:00:48.410> obviously<00:00:48.530> download<00:00:49.130> them<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:50.480> what

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
can obviously download them and what

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.510 
can obviously download them and what
we're<00:00:50.750> going<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.900> do<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.230> start<00:00:51.500> with<00:00:51.650> we're

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
we're going to do to start with we're

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.840 
we're going to do to start with we're
going<00:00:52.700> to<00:00:52.760> copy<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:53.960> first<00:00:54.710> crunch<00:00:55.130> tone<00:00:55.430> so

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
going to copy the first crunch tone so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.420 
going to copy the first crunch tone so
if<00:00:56.150> you<00:00:56.270> select<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:56.750> hold<00:00:56.930> down<00:00:57.110> control<00:00:57.530> drag

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
if you select it hold down control drag

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.760 
if you select it hold down control drag
it<00:00:58.610> over<00:00:58.790> here<00:00:59.590> then<00:01:00.590> what<00:01:00.770> it<00:01:00.890> should<00:01:01.100> do<00:01:02.770> is

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
it over here then what it should do is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.270 
it over here then what it should do is
give<00:01:04.220> us<00:01:04.400> that's<00:01:04.759> it<00:01:04.909> it<00:01:05.330> should<00:01:05.570> give<00:01:05.780> us<00:01:05.960> a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
give us that's it it should give us a

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.940 
give us that's it it should give us a
starting<00:01:07.280> point<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:09.560> what<00:01:09.710> we're<00:01:09.830> going

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
starting point and so what we're going

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.859 
starting point and so what we're going
to<00:01:09.979> do<00:01:10.220> is<00:01:10.490> we're<00:01:11.149> going<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:13.240> basically<00:01:14.240> turn

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
to do is we're going to basically turn

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.149 
to do is we're going to basically turn
off<00:01:15.020> some<00:01:15.200> of<00:01:15.259> these<00:01:15.320> other<00:01:15.530> effects<00:01:15.859> that<00:01:16.070> we

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
off some of these other effects that we

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:26.859 
off some of these other effects that we
had<00:01:22.689> turn<00:01:23.689> on<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.929> pitch<00:01:24.079> glide<00:01:25.539> and<00:01:26.539> what<00:01:26.749> we

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
had turn on the pitch glide and what we

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:38.039 
had turn on the pitch glide and what we
want<00:01:29.710> is<00:01:31.659> 50%<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:34.880> want<00:01:35.119> heal<00:01:35.679> so<00:01:36.679> i<00:01:36.740> want<00:01:36.979> to--

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
want is 50% we want heal so i want to--

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.630 
want is 50% we want heal so i want to--
to<00:01:39.049> be

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
totally +12 won't heal to be minus 12

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.300 
totally +12 won't heal to be minus 12
and<00:01:55.030> there<00:01:56.030> we<00:01:56.150> go<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:57.590> let's<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:57.830> listen<00:01:58.130> see

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
you've kind of got a nope never harmony

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.290 
you've kind of got a nope never harmony
going<00:02:06.680> on<00:02:06.770> there<00:02:06.980> but<00:02:07.160> if<00:02:07.250> we<00:02:07.490> put<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:07.880> mix<00:02:08.119> up

going on there but if we put the mix up
to<00:02:08.450> full<00:02:08.720> you'll<00:02:09.380> just<00:02:09.710> hear<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.369> pitch<00:02:10.870> glide

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
to full you'll just hear the pitch glide

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.810 
to full you'll just hear the pitch glide

going to just move the position and all

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.720 
going to just move the position and all
that's<00:02:20.390> doing<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.960> it's<00:02:21.410> kind<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.800> if<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.580> like

that's doing is it's kind of if you like
moving<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.330> foot<00:02:23.480> controller<00:02:23.840> for<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.290> at

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
moving the foot controller for you so at

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.260 
moving the foot controller for you so at
the<00:02:24.440> moment<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.770> position<00:02:25.160> 0<00:02:25.490> which<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.940> full

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
the moment the position 0 which is full

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.000 
the moment the position 0 which is full
heel<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.290> move<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.650> hundred<00:02:27.950> percent

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
heel so move to a hundred percent

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.920 
heel so move to a hundred percent
that'll<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.520> full<00:02:28.760> toe<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.390> imagine<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.810> know

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
that'll be full toe so imagine you know

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
expression pedal moving up to pushing

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.650 
expression pedal moving up to pushing
your<00:02:33.380> toes<00:02:33.650> down<00:02:34.060> okay<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.120> I'll<00:02:35.330> just<00:02:35.390> play<00:02:35.630> a

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
note and then I'll move that position

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:49.619 
note and then I'll move that position
and<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.730> can<00:02:37.760> hear<00:02:38.000> what<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.180> sounds<00:02:38.450> like

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.880 
do and with that and so we'll call that
one<00:03:39.010> FX<00:03:40.010> warm<00:03:40.960> then<00:03:41.960> what<00:03:42.080> we'll<00:03:42.230> do<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.650> we'll

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
smart harmony I'm going to pick B let's

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.940 
smart harmony I'm going to pick B let's
try<00:04:09.950> minor<00:04:10.220> B<00:04:10.940> minor<00:04:10.970> fifth<00:04:11.600> let's<00:04:12.530> have<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.709> at

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.190 
try minor B minor fifth let's have it at
50%<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.940> then<00:04:14.300> it's<00:04:14.480> exactly<00:04:14.959> half<00:04:15.170> the

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
50% and then it's exactly half the

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.789 
50% and then it's exactly half the
original<00:04:15.440> signal<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.160> half<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.519> harmony<00:04:20.799> so

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
original signal and half the harmony so

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
harmony you know if you like dragonforce

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.620 
harmony you know if you like dragonforce
then<00:04:59.610> he'll<00:04:59.730> be<00:04:59.820> able<00:04:59.910> to<00:05:00.030> play<00:05:00.150> some<00:05:00.390> of<00:05:00.480> their

then he'll be able to play some of their
kind<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:01.020> orange<00:05:01.680> great<00:05:01.920> stuff<00:05:02.220> if<00:05:02.490> you're<00:05:02.610> if

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
kind of orange great stuff if you're if

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:44.939 
kind of orange great stuff if you're if
you're<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.030> better<00:05:03.210> player<00:05:03.330> than<00:05:03.480> iron<00:05:03.780> those

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:52.600 

so<00:05:47.620> let's<00:05:48.620> call<00:05:48.830> that<00:05:49.039> FX<00:05:49.520> -<00:05:50.770> unless<00:05:51.770> send<00:05:52.400> that

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
so let's call that FX - unless send that

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.870 
so let's call that FX - unless send that
to<00:05:52.789> the<00:05:52.910> M<00:05:53.590> okay<00:05:54.590> so<00:05:54.650> they're<00:05:55.039> obviously<00:05:55.400> quick

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
to the M okay so they're obviously quick

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.000 
to the M okay so they're obviously quick
looks<00:05:56.180> at<00:05:56.449> different<00:05:56.960> effects<00:05:57.410> hopefully

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
looks at different effects hopefully

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.620 
looks at different effects hopefully
after<00:05:58.130> this<00:05:58.340> you<00:05:58.490> can<00:05:58.520> see<00:05:58.820> it<00:05:59.030> really<00:05:59.270> isn't

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
after this you can see it really isn't

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.390 
after this you can see it really isn't
difficult<00:05:59.930> at<00:06:00.169> all<00:06:00.380> it's<00:06:00.650> really<00:06:01.039> easy<00:06:01.220> just

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
difficult at all it's really easy just

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.390 
difficult at all it's really easy just
to<00:06:01.639> click<00:06:02.419> a<00:06:02.449> few<00:06:02.690> buttons<00:06:02.750> and<00:06:03.410> then<00:06:04.039> you<00:06:04.250> can

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
to click a few buttons and then you can

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.379 
to click a few buttons and then you can
just<00:06:04.580> start<00:06:04.729> playing<00:06:04.970> it<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.240> you've<00:06:05.360> got

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
just start playing it and you've got

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.020 
just start playing it and you've got
these<00:06:05.660> these<00:06:06.080> really<00:06:06.590> cool<00:06:06.800> sounds<00:06:07.580> some

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
these these really cool sounds some
