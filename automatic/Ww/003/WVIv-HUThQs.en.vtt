like<00:00:29.460> an<00:00:29.640> indicator<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.660> Sun<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.140> they

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
like an indicator for the Sun so they

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.139 
like an indicator for the Sun so they
are<00:00:31.320> called<00:00:31.619> Sun<00:00:31.949> Decatur's<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.759> they<00:00:32.910> let

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
are called Sun Decatur's and they let

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
are called Sun Decatur's and they let
you<00:00:33.329> know<00:00:33.480> when<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> reapply<00:00:34.500> your

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you know when you have to reapply your

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.709 
you know when you have to reapply your
sunscreen<00:00:34.850> which<00:00:35.850> i<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.210> really<00:00:36.360> cool

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
sunscreen which i think is really cool

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.240 
sunscreen which i think is really cool
and<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.989> first<00:00:37.230> heard<00:00:37.440> about<00:00:37.559> them<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.950> thought

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and I first heard about them I thought

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
and I first heard about them I thought
maybe<00:00:38.879> they're<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
maybe they're just on kind of like a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.560 
maybe they're just on kind of like a
timer<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.739> after<00:00:41.070> 30<00:00:41.309> minutes<00:00:41.610> then<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.270> like

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
timer like after 30 minutes then it like

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.180 
timer like after 30 minutes then it like
kind<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.960> fades<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.590> that's<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.920> true

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
kind of fades out but that's not true

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.100 
kind of fades out but that's not true
they<00:00:44.399> actually<00:00:44.610> let<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.329> based<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
they actually let you know based on the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.139 
they actually let you know based on the
sun<00:00:46.320> exposure<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.950> you're<00:00:47.129> getting<00:00:47.280> when

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
sun exposure that you're getting when

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.450 
sun exposure that you're getting when
you<00:00:48.539> actually<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.469> need<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> reapply<00:00:50.370> your

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you actually do need to reapply your

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
you actually do need to reapply your
sunscreen<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> think<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.629> really<00:00:51.809> good

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
sunscreen so I think it's really good

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
sunscreen so I think it's really good
for<00:00:52.379> kids<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.949> adults<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.239> you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
for kids and adults because you know you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
for kids and adults because you know you
can<00:00:54.629> lose<00:00:54.809> track<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> time<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.410> forget<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
can lose track of time and forget to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.279 
can lose track of time and forget to
reapply<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.489> sunscreen<00:00:57.020> especially<00:00:58.020> kids

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
reapply your sunscreen especially kids

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.810 
reapply your sunscreen especially kids
like<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.039> kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.399> gauge<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
like they can kind of gauge it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
like they can kind of gauge it
themselves<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.600> they're<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.590> where

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
themselves or if they're at can where

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.380 
themselves or if they're at can where
they're<00:01:02.039> having<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.370> day<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.670> wave<00:01:02.940> pool<00:01:03.210> or

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
they're having a day at the wave pool or

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
they're having a day at the wave pool or
something<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:04.320> love<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.830> full<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.309> can

something I love the way full that can

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.640 
something I love the way full that can
remind<00:01:05.760> them<00:01:06.090> or<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.750> went<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> reapply<00:01:07.590> your

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.859 
remind them or you went to reapply your
sunscreen<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.880> case<00:01:08.909> me<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.689> my

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
sunscreen but in my case me and my

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.690 
sunscreen but in my case me and my
husband<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.439> are<00:01:10.530> awful<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.220> reapplying

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
husband we are awful with reapplying

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
actually we reapply way too much and I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.580 
actually we reapply way too much and I
don't<00:01:15.240> think<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.110> people<00:01:16.200> have

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
don't think that a lot of people have

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.399 
don't think that a lot of people have
that<00:01:16.619> problem<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.390> obsessive<00:01:19.229> about

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
that problem but we are obsessive about

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
that problem but we are obsessive about
it<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> protect<00:01:21.180> our

it because we really want to protect our

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
it because we really want to protect our
skin<00:01:21.570> from<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.960> Sun<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.560> want<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> protect

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
skin from the Sun but we want to protect

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.609 
skin from the Sun but we want to protect
it<00:01:23.250> from<00:01:23.369> aging<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> skin<00:01:24.240> cancer<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.590> also

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
