00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.790
 hello good friends in this tutorial os 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.980
 I want to talk about the features 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.080
 basic or at least features 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.060
 my I like that I needed to 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.830
 they have to have the spinning rod with 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.140
 which we are going to fish in the ante and the 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.820
 videos I showed the spinning reel the 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.230
 features the characteristics of 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.689
 same forgiveness and now I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.610
 good street what I always tell you in 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.050
 my videos I repeat a lot that I 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.850
 characteristics that I give you are not the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.770
 better nor am I the best simply 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.230
 are the ones that work and with only one 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.230
 I transmit to you good 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.750
 the cane defines that you can choose the vais 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.200
 to find in enough measure always 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.090
 I say that you had to look for them 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.620
 As it is more suited to 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.680
 you for example we can 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.239
 Find 180 out of 240 of 260 out of 3 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.440
 meters maybe up to four meters 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.750
 you can get to find the reeds of 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.490
 spinning how is to adapt for example 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.020
 we can say that a spider of 240 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.790
 we could use it in one place for 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.860
 example in a peak of a collar that 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.240
 we would work well once and for 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.070
 example of four meters in a site in 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.170
 that we have access to fishing 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.759
 the dam once hosted for 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.500
 recover the one that is quite difficult 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.500
 we need to save that distance 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.000
 at the time of choosing 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.390
 which is what I advise you 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.920
 that is to say telescopic or of sections I 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.570
 I can say that both have things 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.490
 good and bad things because the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.760
 telescopic that are the ones that are going 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.280
 taking out parts is easy to deal with is 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.200
 transport is easy to assemble but 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.820
 has in my opinion has some 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.590
 some problems the problems that 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.520
 have is that having several sections 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.540
 the possibility of breaking is higher at 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.280
 greater place where they do not fold and in my 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.830
 opinion and what I advise you is that 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.020
 I take this stretch in this case in my 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.420
 cane is two sections because of two 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.690
 stretches because it overlaps that is two 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.520
 sections the force is distributed better this 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.520
 It is also very important 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.070
 when we talk about the action the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.680
 advance of the cane we can find 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.410
 diverse actions but the action goes in 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.420
 function of the weight that you are going to 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.620
 advance for example my cane or I want it 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:40.140
 show has a function of 728 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:45.650
 728 grams there you have it is the key 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.650
 concept spin 902 is not a rod 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.120
 it's a not a super rod so 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.819
 say it is a cane is a good material 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.489
 and that I can tell you that it has given me 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.200
 good results of doing what to what 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.300
 I mean with 728 grams 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.760
 good is like the surf casting you 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.170
 you can throw weight but on the street yes 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.030
 which is more important than in your casting 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.250
 since in the south casting you throw the weight 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.130
 maximum that can damage accept and it 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.569
 finished but in the spinning is more 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.860
 complicated since that weight you have to 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.260
 work what I know that that without it 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.910
 reflects in an artificial is not saying 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.709
 a lead is a ramp you have to 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.709
 give it life if you pass so to speak 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.680
 me that has not already said what has 728 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.630
 grams and that I put is a burst of 40 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.910
 grams clear that could throw it not 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.040
 should but could could but already 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.930
 would throw hard ballast well yes no 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.810
 I could hit him really hard and also 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.970
 would launch with weight that is to say at the time of 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.860
 I would have a hard time working 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.290
 so heavy to cost ballast you could 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.200
 give the movements because I think for 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.989
 me is the best of 7 28 degrees because 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.920
 can I fish from like a vinyl 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.740
 with a plumb head 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.140
 of 10 grams and have all the touch that 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.170
 I need to give life to use 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.140
 a light gin of 18 grams that sure 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.569
 a sardine could also give you the 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.510
 ice movement or how much I use 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.270
 the heaviest use is this branch which 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.730
 the tournament water that has 28 grams and 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.350
 with 28 degrees stuck I wonder what it is 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.690
 is the maximum of the nissan action already 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.100
 works although I work a little strada 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.340
 but I give him all the movement that 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.340
 I want 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.900
 well the ringing that you can find in 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.419
 the reeds I always say that if you 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.949
 choose the best ally I mean when 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.770
 I say the best ally I mean that 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.270
 they will be of ceramic quality you can choose 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.949
 those of other qualities and I guess that 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.560
 it would also help us though my advice 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.610
 it is ceramic quality how many rings 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.129
 you have to have your cane 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.470
 this is always relative but at a lower 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.090
 ringed more costs my rod has 11 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.620
 rings to go you can see them 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.270
 has 11 miles that is the good thing 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.599
 has to have 11 rings and when the 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.020
 cane tends to bend over the catch or 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.180
 the strength of a predator all that weight 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.960
 does not fall on a ring or on two relapses 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.599
 all the rings and that makes like 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.120
 you see the seeds are 11 goes more 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:13.630
 smaller to larger, increasing the 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.530
 size and thus increasing the strength of a 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.530
 the time to share 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:26.950
 well when he 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:31.070
 the people looking for asked me I come the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:34.160
 mangoes are the cork or 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.500
 I always support the truth. 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.100
 works better elevates since it is synthetic 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.800
 and you have to use less because if not 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.470
 you have to worry less about him already 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.360
 that the cork itself tends to get wet 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.129
 get dirty now that even going to 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.409
 deteriorate enough 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:55.139
 good as a final complement I can 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:58.379
 say that there is something very important in the 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.789
 cane they are is the hitch so that they 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.439
 this hook that you can see well I do not know 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.080
 if I did not sign it quite well the camera 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:05.309
 but good this coupling serves for the 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.809
 time to travel as we have to 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:08.819
 move a lot with the coast line if 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:11.369
 we have to move to a point 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.769
 so that they do not go to the ramp giving 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:15.449
 So, here it is here where 

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:16.979
 I would get hooked in this way 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.319
 for example you can see it with the jeep 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:21.899
 that you have shown me before 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.189
 would hook like that under pressure because in the 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:25.800
 line would be up and you will not 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:28.139
 would move it seems like this seems silly 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.719
 but it is something very important the truth is 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.089
 that are small details that work 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:36.569
 pretty good up here everything 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:38.189
 that I can tell you as I always say 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.439
 I hope you liked it I hope that 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:43.379
 serve us more or less what is already a thing 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:45.719
 that I can say or yes if you liked it 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:49.210
 I like to subscribe to my channel 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:51.690
 and a greeting from your barbaric friend 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.690
 Y
