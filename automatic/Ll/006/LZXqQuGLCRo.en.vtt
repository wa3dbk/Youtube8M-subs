wouldn't you want a flood there's a
couple<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:04.030> reasons<00:02:04.210> perhaps<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.590> wouldn't

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
couple of reasons perhaps you wouldn't

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.700 
couple of reasons perhaps you wouldn't
want<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.070> flood<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:07.450> all<00:02:07.689> really<00:02:08.020> has<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.590> do

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
want a flood and it all really has to do

want a flood and it all really has to do
with<00:02:08.860> detail<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.610> loss<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.270> resolution<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.590> if

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
with detail and loss of resolution so if

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.000 
with detail and loss of resolution so if
the<00:02:12.370> ink<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.880> very<00:02:13.150> thin<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:14.500> flooding

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
the ink is very thin and it's flooding

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.520 
the ink is very thin and it's flooding
out<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.340> detail<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.570> might<00:02:16.750> decide<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.260> you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
out the detail you might decide that you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.470 
out the detail you might decide that you
know<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:18.070> don't<00:02:18.340> need<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.520> flood<00:02:18.880> stroke<00:02:19.210> all<00:02:19.450> I

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
know I don't need a flood stroke all I

do a stroke like that or if you're a a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.690 
do a stroke like that or if you're a a
pusher<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.080> am<00:02:28.260> maybe<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.100> leave<00:02:29.340> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
pusher like I am maybe you leave a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.090 
pusher like I am maybe you leave a
little<00:02:30.060> bit<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.300> ink<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:30.720> here<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.200> then<00:02:31.770> you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
little bit of ink up here and then you

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.580 
little bit of ink up here and then you
just<00:02:32.310> grab<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.030> ink<00:02:33.180> up<00:02:33.390> here<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.050> do<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> print

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
just grab the ink up here and do a print

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.030 
just grab the ink up here and do a print
stroke<00:02:35.240> okay<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.230> case<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> would

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
stroke okay so in that case what I would

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.190 
stroke okay so in that case what I would
do<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.550> my<00:02:38.730> first<00:02:39.060> two<00:02:39.330> tests<00:02:39.570> Frank<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.050> would

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
do is my first two tests Frank I would

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.950 
do is my first two tests Frank I would
flood<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.640> would<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.240> test<00:02:42.510> print<00:02:42.810> but

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
flood and I would do the test print but

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.870 
flood and I would do the test print but
I'm<00:02:43.050> gonna<00:02:43.170> leave<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.530> bunch<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.130> ink<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.550> here

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
I'm gonna leave a bunch of ink up here

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.530 
I'm gonna leave a bunch of ink up here
for<00:02:45.630> me<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.170> use<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:47.310> print<00:02:47.610> without<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> flood

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
for me to use to print without a flood

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.770 
for me to use to print without a flood
stroke<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.680> now<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.940> next<00:02:51.120> print

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
stroke so now on the next print

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.720 
stroke so now on the next print
I<00:02:51.810> wouldn't<00:02:52.770> flood<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.070> could<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:53.550> come<00:02:53.700> up

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
I wouldn't flood I could just come up

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.910 
I wouldn't flood I could just come up
here<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.150> take<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> little<00:02:54.540> ink<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.140> go<00:02:55.740> like

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
here and take a little ink and go like

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.570 
here and take a little ink and go like
that<00:02:56.600> okay<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:57.740> this<00:02:58.740> might<00:02:59.010> come<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.400> handy

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that okay so this might come in handy

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.280 
that okay so this might come in handy
when<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:01.830> need<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.430> reduce<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.630> amount<00:03:03.900> of

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
when you need to reduce the amount of

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.550 
when you need to reduce the amount of
ink<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.280> printing<00:03:06.050> physically<00:03:07.050> through

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
ink that is printing physically through

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.760 
ink that is printing physically through
your<00:03:07.770> flood<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.220> stroke<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:10.470> know<00:03:10.590> like

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
your flood and stroke and you know like

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.140 
your flood and stroke and you know like
I<00:03:10.800> said<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.190> could<00:03:11.370> be<00:03:11.400> any<00:03:11.640> number<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:12.030> reasons

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
I said it could be any number of reasons

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.350 
I said it could be any number of reasons
but<00:03:12.660> most<00:03:12.900> often<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.470> has<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.830> do<00:03:14.010> with<00:03:14.190> how<00:03:14.940> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
but most often it has to do with how the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.199 
but most often it has to do with how the
ink<00:03:15.570> is<00:03:15.840> printing<00:03:16.380> if<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.130> ink<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.490> very<00:03:17.790> thin

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
ink is printing if the ink is very thin

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.060 
ink is printing if the ink is very thin
and<00:03:18.450> maybe<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.050> put<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.410> on<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.530> higher<00:03:19.770> mesh

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
and maybe you put it on a higher mesh

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.460 
and maybe you put it on a higher mesh
count<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:21.120> probably<00:03:21.570> don't<00:03:21.870> need<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.140> do<00:03:22.440> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
count you probably don't need to do a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.840 
count you probably don't need to do a
flood<00:03:22.860> stroke<00:03:23.280> okay<00:03:24.240> so<00:03:24.300> basically<00:03:25.110> all<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:26.820> is

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
flood stroke okay so basically all it is

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.150 
flood stroke okay so basically all it is
is<00:03:27.300> just<00:03:27.390> if<00:03:27.930> you're<00:03:28.320> gonna<00:03:28.500> print<00:03:28.890> without

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
is just if you're gonna print without

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.259 
is just if you're gonna print without
the<00:03:29.580> flood<00:03:29.820> stroke<00:03:30.209> all<00:03:30.900> you're<00:03:31.140> gonna<00:03:31.290> do<00:03:32.269> one

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
the flood stroke all you're gonna do one

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.280 
the flood stroke all you're gonna do one
way<00:03:33.420> or<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.660> other<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.989> you're<00:03:34.110> going<00:03:34.230> to

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
way or the other is you're going to

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.840 
way or the other is you're going to
leave<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> little<00:03:34.650> ink<00:03:34.860> here<00:03:35.160> or<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> little<00:03:35.580> ink

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
leave a little ink here or a little ink

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.940 
leave a little ink here or a little ink
here<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.360> when<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.110> go<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.680> print

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
here and when you go to do the print

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.680 
here and when you go to do the print
stroke<00:03:38.250> you're<00:03:38.519> either<00:03:38.670> gonna<00:03:38.880> grab<00:03:39.209> some<00:03:39.660> of

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
stroke you're either gonna grab some of

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.410 
stroke you're either gonna grab some of
the<00:03:39.900> ink<00:03:40.080> from<00:03:40.380> here<00:03:40.850> or<00:03:41.850> you're<00:03:42.030> gonna<00:03:42.120> grab

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
the ink from here or you're gonna grab

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.870 
the ink from here or you're gonna grab
some<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.019> ink<00:03:43.170> from<00:03:43.380> here<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.130> just<00:03:44.640> push

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
some of the ink from here and just push

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.590 
some of the ink from here and just push
it<00:03:44.910> over<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.570> see<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:46.340> okay<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:48.060> is

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
it over you see it okay so that is

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.070 
it over you see it okay so that is
simply<00:03:49.500> how<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.400> would<00:03:50.670> do<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:51.209> print<00:03:51.750> stroke

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
simply how you would do a print stroke

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.880 
simply how you would do a print stroke
without<00:03:52.769> flooding<00:03:53.160> it's<00:03:53.610> very<00:03:53.910> simple<00:03:54.450> just

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
without flooding it's very simple just

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.440 
without flooding it's very simple just
just<00:03:55.890> take<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.190> little<00:03:56.610> bit<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.000> ink<00:03:57.180> and

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
just take a little bit of the ink and

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.380 
just take a little bit of the ink and
you<00:03:57.660> might<00:03:57.989> even<00:03:58.140> have<00:03:58.470> at<00:03:58.890> times<00:03:59.190> like<00:03:59.790> with<00:04:00.360> a

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
you might even have at times like with a

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.229 
you might even have at times like with a
really<00:04:00.750> thin<00:04:01.050> black<00:04:01.440> ink<00:04:01.800> or<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.310> red<00:04:02.820> ink<00:04:03.030> or

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
really thin black ink or a red ink or

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.300 
really thin black ink or a red ink or
something<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:04.110> might<00:04:04.320> even<00:04:04.500> have<00:04:04.769> enough<00:04:05.100> ink

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
something you might even have enough ink

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.979 
something you might even have enough ink
right<00:04:05.610> on<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.910> squeegee<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.540> all<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.900> have

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
right on the squeegee and all you have

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.050 
right on the squeegee and all you have
to<00:04:07.140> do<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.500> angle<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.920> down<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> little<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.580> pull

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
to do is angle it down a little and pull

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.910 
to do is angle it down a little and pull
it<00:04:09.180> right<00:04:09.330> over<00:04:09.500> okay<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:12.470> doing<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.620> print

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
it right over okay so doing a print

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.330 
it right over okay so doing a print
stroke<00:04:14.280> without<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:15.030> flood<00:04:15.360> can<00:04:16.229> be<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.620> useful

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
stroke without the flood can be a useful

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.729 
stroke without the flood can be a useful
tactic<00:04:18.150> when<00:04:18.660> you're<00:04:18.840> dealing<00:04:19.080> with<00:04:19.290> very
