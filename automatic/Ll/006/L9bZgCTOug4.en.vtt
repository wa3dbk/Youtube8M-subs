00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
if you can't move them out at a time go

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.990 
if you can't move them out at a time go
to<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.510> marketplace<00:00:38.430> sell<00:00:39.430> them<00:00:39.610> all<00:00:39.760> for

to the marketplace sell them all for
gold<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.800> then<00:00:41.940> within<00:00:42.940> half<00:00:43.270> an<00:00:43.390> hour<00:00:43.480> of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
that attack buy resources back with that

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.380 
that attack buy resources back with that
gold<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:47.920> will<00:00:48.070> take<00:00:48.190> a<00:00:48.220> half<00:00:48.670> an<00:00:48.790> hour<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:49.180> get

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
gold it will take a half an hour to get

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.260 
gold it will take a half an hour to get
from<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:50.170> market<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.770> your<00:00:50.890> city<00:00:51.190> so<00:00:52.060> that's

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
from the market to your city so that's

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.220 
from the market to your city so that's
basically<00:00:54.720> eliminating<00:00:55.720> him<00:00:55.870> from<00:00:56.110> getting

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
basically eliminating him from getting

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.650 
basically eliminating him from getting
anything<00:00:56.680> from<00:00:56.829> your<00:00:56.950> city<00:00:57.190> besides<00:00:57.540> maybe<00:00:58.540> a

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
anything from your city besides maybe a

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.450 
anything from your city besides maybe a
few<00:00:58.870> thousand<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.350> have<00:00:59.530> rebuilt<00:01:00.040> since

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
few thousand that have rebuilt since

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.460 
few thousand that have rebuilt since
then<00:01:00.670> so<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.800> tutorial<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.489> mainly<00:01:04.059> about

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
then so this tutorial is mainly about

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.499 
then so this tutorial is mainly about
dealing<00:01:05.470> with<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.829> attack<00:01:06.360> surprising<00:01:07.360> him

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
dealing with the attack surprising him

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.570 
dealing with the attack surprising him
and<00:01:07.780> making<00:01:08.320> him<00:01:08.440> lose<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.860> ridiculous<00:01:09.340> amount

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
and making him lose a ridiculous amount

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.050 
and making him lose a ridiculous amount
of<00:01:09.670> troops<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:12.640> he's<00:01:12.760> going<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:12.940> do

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
of troops what he's going to do

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.810 
of troops what he's going to do
beforehand<00:01:13.600> generally<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.290> Scout<00:01:14.820> obviously

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
beforehand generally is Scout obviously

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.000 
beforehand generally is Scout obviously
he<00:01:16.090> wants<00:01:16.300> to<00:01:16.360> find<00:01:16.540> out<00:01:16.690> what's<00:01:16.900> there<00:01:17.200> this

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
he wants to find out what's there this

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.710 
he wants to find out what's there this
tutorial<00:01:18.580> is<00:01:18.790> under<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.150> assumption<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.600> he

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
tutorial is under the assumption that he

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.190 
tutorial is under the assumption that he
scouted<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:21.210> he<00:01:22.210> sent<00:01:22.540> an<00:01:22.780> attack

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
scouted you and he sent an attack

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.580 
scouted you and he sent an attack
accordingly<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:24.340> what<00:01:24.370> you<00:01:24.610> have<00:01:25.470> keep<00:01:26.470> in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
accordingly to what you have keep in

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.070 
accordingly to what you have keep in
mind<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.979> gate<00:01:27.190> situation<00:01:27.909> if<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:28.750> scattered

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
mind the gate situation if you scattered

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.899 
mind the gate situation if you scattered
you<00:01:29.170> with<00:01:29.290> your<00:01:29.440> gates<00:01:29.620> closed<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.670> want<00:01:30.850> to

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
you with your gates closed you want to

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.310 
you with your gates closed you want to
keep<00:01:31.000> them<00:01:31.210> closed<00:01:31.479> because<00:01:31.810> he's<00:01:32.080> going<00:01:32.260> to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
keep them closed because he's going to

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.870 
keep them closed because he's going to
Scout<00:01:32.500> again<00:01:32.770> before<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.369> hits<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.640> what<00:01:36.760> you

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
Scout again before it hits so what you

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.730 
Scout again before it hits so what you
want<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.090> do<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.229> want<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.409> look<00:01:38.530> at<00:01:38.650> the

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
want to do is you want to look at the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.120 
want to do is you want to look at the
attack<00:01:39.010> you<00:01:39.790> see<00:01:39.970> it<00:01:40.060> incoming

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
attack you see it incoming

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
attack you see it incoming
you'd<00:01:41.610> go<00:01:41.760> where<00:01:41.940> it's<00:01:42.060> coming<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:42.720> go

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you'd go where it's coming from you go

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960 
you'd go where it's coming from you go
where<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:44.550> go<00:01:44.670> when<00:01:44.850> it's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
where it's going to and you go when it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270 
where it's going to and you go when it's
going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.150> hit<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.290> also<00:01:46.409> see<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.040> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
going to hit you can also see if you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.700 
going to hit you can also see if you
have<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.729> appropriate<00:01:48.000> power<00:01:48.870> level<00:01:49.320> what's

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
have the appropriate power level what's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.160 
have the appropriate power level what's
coming<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.820> smaller<00:01:51.600> track<00:01:51.900> for

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
coming this is a smaller track for

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.940 
coming this is a smaller track for
example<00:01:52.740> purposes<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:56.250> time<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.119> there

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
example purposes but that time on there

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.040 
example purposes but that time on there
is<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.220> be<00:01:59.310> key<00:01:59.630> because<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.750> far<00:02:00.900> as<00:02:00.960> he

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
is going to be key because as far as he

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.070 
is going to be key because as far as he
knows<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.440> now<00:02:01.619> you're<00:02:02.160> offline<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:03.080> don't
