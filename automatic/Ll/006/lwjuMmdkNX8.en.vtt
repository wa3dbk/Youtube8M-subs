00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.460
 We will be presenting how to configure 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.590
 his studio m 4 to start the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.750
 computer to which you are going to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.599
 connect your study m you have to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.119
 have an intel core 2 duo or a 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.390
 2.2 giga hertz processor or 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.180
 equivalent 2 gigabytes of ram and a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.760
 usb port 2.0 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.480
 now connect connects in your m's 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.480
 studio 4 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.750
 good after having connected your m 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.350
 from study 4 to the computer what 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.240
 will automatically detect before this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.430
 they have to have uninstalled everything 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.070
 controller they have on their computer 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.030
 since they only have to have 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.910
 installed those that we will provide 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.950
 Then you have to clarify that the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.800
 Acid controller that is on the page 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.800
 de berenguer does not work for the virtual dj 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.549
 these are both the two files 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.110
 attachments that we will send to you for 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.110
 background so you have the operation 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.850
 correct your studio m 4 to start 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.850
 they have to extract them 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.030
 since they extract them they have to place them 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.850
 in their corresponding folders for the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.759
 correct for the correct use 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.130
 Well the next thing is that they have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.659
 correctly installed the virtual dj 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.850
 pro 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.030
 when they are installed the virtual dj 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.640
 the default program creates a 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.310
 folder in documents called virtual dj 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.509
 which is where they will place the next ones 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.509
 following files 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.840
 this file goes to thorices the folder of 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.840
 Bises must copy it and paste it there 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.320
 this next file goes to amateurs 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.900
 Then you must install the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.900
 formal action program 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.819
 and they should select all three of them 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.819
 configurations that he gives them 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.820
 very well since they have installed the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.240
 program correctly have to 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.240
 open it 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.870
 and select the part that says the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.870
 configuration that says cmd 44 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.849
 now they have to open the virtual dj pro 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.010
 since they have it open they go 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.939
 directly to configurations 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.980
 in this part pay close attention 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:53.340
 they have to be have to select in 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.340

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.470
 that has detected me do not return to the 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.470
 normal configuration 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.720
 and here they select 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.880
 this configuration 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.460

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.660
