four guys working on another
blacksmithing<00:00:27.760> project<00:00:28.300> today<00:00:28.590> I'm<00:00:29.590> trying

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
blacksmithing project today I'm trying

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.780 
blacksmithing project today I'm trying
to<00:00:29.860> make<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.010> spoon<00:00:30.400> knife<00:00:30.640> from<00:00:31.240> an<00:00:31.420> old<00:00:31.570> file

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
to make a spoon knife from an old file

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.729 
to make a spoon knife from an old file
got<00:00:33.790> started<00:00:34.210> on<00:00:34.300> it<00:00:34.449> last<00:00:34.660> night<00:00:34.809> and

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
got started on it last night and

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.549 
got started on it last night and
basically<00:00:36.610> it<00:00:37.570> started<00:00:37.900> out<00:00:38.050> with<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.230> file

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
basically it started out with a file

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.850 
basically it started out with a file
very<00:00:39.010> similar<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.489> this<00:00:39.610> one<00:00:39.820> I<00:00:40.530> put<00:00:41.530> it<00:00:41.650> in<00:00:41.770> the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
very similar to this one I put it in the

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.360 
very similar to this one I put it in the
fire

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
fire

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.810 
fire
for<00:00:42.610> a<00:00:42.640> few<00:00:42.850> hours<00:00:42.970> to<00:00:43.420> normalize<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.199> steel

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
for a few hours to normalize the steel

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.720 
for a few hours to normalize the steel
then<00:00:45.820> I<00:00:45.910> started<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.360> shape<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:47.670> try<00:00:48.670> to

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
then I started to shape it try to

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.590 
then I started to shape it try to
flatten<00:00:49.149> out<00:00:49.210> this<00:00:49.480> side<00:00:49.720> or<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.649> blade<00:00:50.890> and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
flatten out this side or the blade and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.930 
flatten out this side or the blade and
turn<00:00:52.600> this<00:00:52.809> end<00:00:53.079> into<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.500> rat<00:00:53.770> tail<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:54.790> I<00:00:54.820> can

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
turn this end into a rat tail so I can

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.740 
turn this end into a rat tail so I can
put<00:00:55.090> a<00:00:55.120> handle<00:00:55.420> on<00:00:55.540> it

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
put a handle on it

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.560 
put a handle on it
I<00:00:56.280> still<00:00:57.280> got<00:00:57.430> a<00:00:57.460> bit<00:00:57.640> more<00:00:57.790> work<00:00:58.030> to<00:00:58.149> do<00:00:58.270> I<00:00:58.300> got

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
I still got a bit more work to do I got

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.979 
I still got a bit more work to do I got
to<00:00:58.770> flatten<00:00:59.770> this<00:00:59.860> out<00:01:00.040> more<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.629> bit<00:01:01.809> too

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
to flatten this out more it's a bit too

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.240 
to flatten this out more it's a bit too
thick<00:01:02.290> for<00:01:02.320> blade<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.700> what<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.479> could<00:01:04.750> do<00:01:04.960> is

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
thick for blade and what I could do is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.920 
thick for blade and what I could do is
finish<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.399> rest<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.060> off<00:01:07.270> mainly<00:01:07.780> with

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
finish the rest of this off mainly with

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.830 
finish the rest of this off mainly with
my<00:01:08.080> grinder<00:01:08.530> but<00:01:08.970> that's<00:01:09.970> no<00:01:10.210> fun<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.479> want<00:01:10.750> to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
my grinder but that's no fun I want to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:24.200 
my grinder but that's no fun I want to
hammer<00:01:11.410> on<00:01:11.680> this<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.890> little<00:01:11.979> bit<00:01:12.190> more

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 

just<00:01:24.660> waiting<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:24.990> my<00:01:25.110> fire<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.650> die<00:01:25.770> down<00:01:25.980> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just waiting for my fire to die down to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.580 
just waiting for my fire to die down to
get<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.580> good<00:01:26.730> coals<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.300> I<00:01:28.140> set<00:01:28.440> up<00:01:28.470> this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
get some good coals so I set up this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.360 
get some good coals so I set up this
little<00:01:29.150> bending<00:01:30.150> jig<00:01:30.680> for<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:31.830> I'm<00:01:31.920> ready<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
little bending jig for when I'm ready to

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:54.050 
little bending jig for when I'm ready to
bend<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.910> blade

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:17.050 

ah

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.100 

I've<00:02:18.060> been<00:02:18.239> shaping<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> little

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
I've been shaping this for a little

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.710 
I've been shaping this for a little
while<00:02:19.260> now<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.709> got<00:02:20.220> my<00:02:20.370> blade<00:02:20.760> area<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.390> lot

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
while now I got my blade area a lot

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.699 
while now I got my blade area a lot
thinner<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.290> flatter<00:02:23.360> got<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> rat<00:02:24.690> tail<00:02:24.989> bit

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
thinner and flatter got the rat tail bit

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.030 
thinner and flatter got the rat tail bit
longer<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.659> I<00:02:27.659> could<00:02:27.870> use<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.170> file<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.799> start

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
longer and I could use a file and start

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.289 
longer and I could use a file and start
shaping<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.519> but<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.760> think<00:02:29.940> I'm<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.060> going

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
shaping this but I think I'm just going

00:02:30.299 --> 00:03:06.039 
shaping this but I think I'm just going
to<00:02:30.390> use<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> grinder<00:02:30.989> instead

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.339 

okay<00:03:07.049> guys<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.650> where<00:03:07.830> I'm<00:03:07.890> at<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.489> far

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
okay guys this is where I'm at so far

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.770 
okay guys this is where I'm at so far
after<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.379> lot<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.590> grinding<00:03:11.599> starting<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.690> look

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
after a lot of grinding starting to look

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.660 
after a lot of grinding starting to look
like<00:03:12.930> something<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.909> have<00:03:14.909> it<00:03:16.159> put<00:03:17.159> an<00:03:17.280> edge<00:03:17.459> on

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
like something I have it put an edge on

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.559 
like something I have it put an edge on
both<00:03:17.849> sides<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:19.470> can<00:03:19.590> see<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.950> rat<00:03:20.220> tail

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
both sides you can see this rat tail

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.180 
both sides you can see this rat tail
made<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.599> bunch<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.900> bumps<00:03:22.200> in<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.620> when<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.799> I

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
made a bunch of bumps in it so when I I

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.190 
made a bunch of bumps in it so when I I
do<00:03:23.910> put<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.540> wood<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:24.900> going<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.080> have

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
do put it in the wood it's going to have

00:03:25.200 --> 00:05:14.180 
do put it in the wood it's going to have
a<00:03:25.230> lot<00:03:25.500> better<00:03:25.709> bite

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.730 

so<00:05:15.190> here's<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.520> finished<00:05:15.669> product<00:05:16.620> it's<00:05:17.620> my

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
so here's the finished product it's my

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.230 
so here's the finished product it's my
first<00:05:18.010> time<00:05:18.190> making<00:05:18.460> one<00:05:18.700> of<00:05:18.790> these<00:05:18.850> it<00:05:19.090> turned

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
first time making one of these it turned

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.370 
first time making one of these it turned
out<00:05:19.389> pretty<00:05:19.510> good<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:21.780> could<00:05:22.780> sit<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.080> work<00:05:23.200> on

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
out pretty good I could sit and work on

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.629 
out pretty good I could sit and work on
the<00:05:23.470> hand<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.740> little<00:05:23.889> bit<00:05:24.010> more<00:05:24.220> but<00:05:24.400> I<00:05:24.430> think

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
the hand a little bit more but I think

00:05:24.639 --> 00:06:00.519 
the hand a little bit more but I think
that's<00:05:24.790> good<00:05:24.940> enough

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.589 

you
