00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello to you with you and this is 54 series 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.170
 on industrial craft 2 experiments in 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.690
 which tell you about the jet pack 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.130
 and electric jetpack main thing 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.410
 their difference from each other is that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.870
 one works on electricity and the other 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.609
 on fuel to brighten up 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.430
 electric jet pack us 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.410
 iron glowing dust needed 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.750
 sheath improved circuitry and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.820
 energo keeper after you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.199
 electric jetpack 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.449
 it needs to be charged 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.450
 you can charge it in any energy 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.489
 the keeper just put his court and he 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.579
 maximum will flirt 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.559
 the amount of energy that can feed 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.050
 yourself jet pack is 30 thousand 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.610
 units of electricity 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.950
 after you charge it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.620
 must be placed in the chest slot and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.690
 press the default jump button this 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.629
 space 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.710
 here we see I flew up 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.570
 maximum height which can 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.460
 climb electric jetpack 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:06.080
 equal to 191 192 blocks above this height he 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.460
 up can not even be able to say 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.850
 everything is about a hundred and ninety blocks 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.240
 190 is also not in the energy 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.520
 jetpack and 10 soaring mode he 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.700
 activated when you hold the space bar and 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.390
 press the m button by default here we are 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.159
 see i'm slowly going down also if you 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.220
 hold down the pro white you will hold the button 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.390
 forward you will fly a little up and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.390
 forward if you just release the space and for 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.729
 press the button forward you will smoothly 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.920
 I do not press any buttons you go down 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.490
 you will just fly down with him big 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.880
 speed you can also it 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.090
 activate and deactivate you then 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.100
 on 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.489
 again you will calmly fly and up 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.289
 fast and down for example this mode can 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:02:05.450
 activate about the earth itself not to 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:08.209
 break up later or activate principle 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.379
 jetpack works the same as 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.760
 and electric jet pack but 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.069
 I cannot show it to him because 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.739
 the simple reason that I failed him 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.140
 fill that is how I would not try 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.010
 what mechanisms did not use to fill 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.650
 I failed him 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.950
 Kraft it so pretty simple 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.269
 for this we need red dust 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.629
 iron shell of the rector scheme and 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.760
 canister if someone managed to fill 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.739
 jetpack in industrial craft 2 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.319
 experiments then please be sure 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.120
 write in the comments and i will add this 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.730
 information to video 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.950
 and so I already have it charged 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.799
 but I got it with this one 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.110
 the panel has a maximum height of 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:55.250
 which he can lift you equals 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.080
 cylinder 20 40 block that is more than that 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.129
 energy jetpack and 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.260
 he also has a hover mode which 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.000
 activated by the m button and clamped 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.909
 space here is almost 140 something blocks 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.530
 a bit short of 250 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.890
 too when you have we activate 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.370
 hover mode here we can see it 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.129
 in the same way deactivate and then 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.909
 not to activate itself and here we are 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:30.680
 so people broke up on it all thanks 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.780
