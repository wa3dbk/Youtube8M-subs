00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
missing a whole section of the concrete

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.440 
missing a whole section of the concrete
I'm<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.429> saying<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.819> went<00:02:09.000> all<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.149> way<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
