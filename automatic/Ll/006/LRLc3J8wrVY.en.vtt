motorcycle clubs that were associated

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.040 
motorcycle clubs that were associated
with<00:05:11.310> have<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.180> even<00:05:12.509> if<00:05:12.599> it<00:05:12.720> were<00:05:12.810> true

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
with have and so even if it were true

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.839 
with have and so even if it were true
that<00:05:13.169> once<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.680> were<00:05:13.770> considered<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.310> gang<00:05:14.550> you

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
that once you were considered a gang you

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.580 
that once you were considered a gang you
don't<00:05:15.240> have<00:05:15.449> these<00:05:15.660> protections<00:05:16.050> because

don't have these protections because

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.170 
don't have these protections because
certainly<00:05:17.190> I<00:05:17.250> think<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.580> that's<00:05:17.669> true<00:05:17.970> once

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
certainly I think that that's true once

you've considered a criminal

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.659 
you've considered a criminal
organization<00:05:19.650> by<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:20.070> letter<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.580> law

organization by the letter of the law

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.760 
organization by the letter of the law
then<00:05:21.419> you<00:05:21.539> don't<00:05:21.750> argue<00:05:21.960> for<00:05:22.229> the<00:05:22.289> protections

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
then you don't argue for the protections

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.350 
then you don't argue for the protections
the<00:05:22.979> rest<00:05:23.130> of<00:05:23.250> society<00:05:23.370> gets<00:05:23.880> but<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.180> has
