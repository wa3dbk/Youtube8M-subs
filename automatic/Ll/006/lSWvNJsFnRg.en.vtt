00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.400 

I<00:05:11.630> were<00:05:12.230> feeling<00:05:12.590> I<00:05:12.650> don't<00:05:12.950> want<00:05:13.160> to<00:05:13.220> know<00:05:14.410> yeah

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
I were feeling I don't want to know yeah

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.630 
I were feeling I don't want to know yeah
I<00:05:15.470> really<00:05:15.830> can't<00:05:16.100> tell<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.430> could<00:05:16.550> be

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
I really can't tell it could be

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.750 
I really can't tell it could be
something<00:05:16.850> above<00:05:17.270> me

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.970 

but<00:05:22.390> I<00:05:22.420> move<00:05:22.750> slightly<00:05:23.080> positive<00:05:23.830> that's

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
but I move slightly positive that's

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.660 
but I move slightly positive that's
later<00:05:24.400> also<00:05:25.560> spiders<00:05:26.560> are<00:05:26.710> not<00:05:26.920> hostile<00:05:27.460> in

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
later also spiders are not hostile in

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.900 
later also spiders are not hostile in
the<00:05:28.150> daytime<00:05:28.540> so<00:05:29.350> we<00:05:29.470> see<00:05:29.680> one<00:05:29.890> it<00:05:30.700> would

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
the daytime so we see one it would

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.420 
the daytime so we see one it would
probably<00:05:31.180> be<00:05:31.440> unless<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:32.590> want<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.890> string<00:05:33.190> I

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
probably be unless you want the string I

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.720 
probably be unless you want the string I
don't<00:05:33.640> see<00:05:34.000> any<00:05:34.120> reason<00:05:35.130> and<00:05:36.130> attacking<00:05:36.430> it

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
don't see any reason and attacking it

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.280 
don't see any reason and attacking it
because<00:05:37.000> it<00:05:37.120> won't<00:05:37.300> attack<00:05:37.570> you<00:05:37.780> unless<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:38.230> i

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
because it won't attack you unless you i
