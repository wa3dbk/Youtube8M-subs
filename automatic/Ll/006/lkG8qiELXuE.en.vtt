00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.050
 so today I'm going to show you 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.640
 how to make the gooseberry point this 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.350
 little point you see that is that they 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.080
 form small balls it's a 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.930
 point which is sure to rank in fact the 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.700
 only two true to the difficulty this is 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.239
 a moment is going to see his sides 5 miles in 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.190
 one is sure we will have increased 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.210
 5 my rank behind it will have to do 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.380
 decreases that are a little 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.150
 particular so that's what I'm going 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.330
 so show you the first rank that's 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.530
 a place rank so he has already done so 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:51.950
 we move on we will alternate in 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.420
 made a mesh places and the famous 5 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.130
 miles in a so in fact it's at 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.730
 upside 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:01.250
 we are going to make a green jersey and there we do not 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.230
 do not drop the brown kg and on 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.479
 left oils have made a game you are 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.290
 so we're actually wrapping our son 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.740
 around the mesh 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.259
 we make a stitch upside down 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.110
 so we have three we add one added 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.720
 it makes us 4 and the glass mesh and 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.880
 this time we drop the brown that 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.119
 we are 5 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.399
 we have five stitches in place of a 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.840
 then a mesh place we do it 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.959
 the five miles in one so players 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.789
 show a mesh in green have done 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:38.240
 are thrown we roll around 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:42.500
 the happy eel a mesh back to re 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:48.410
 throw it back a glass mesh and so 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.940
 that down to the end of the row troubles having 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:56.830
 rights we always keep one 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.830
 android mesh between the 2 2 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:12.670
 4,5 and a mesh to the right and one 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:16.030
 restart the cinema 2.5 and finish 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.730
 by the right means then the rank 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.290
 next he's all upside down so everything 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.520
 upside down so that no difficulty 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.970
 particular you know how to make 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.850
 green jerseys 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.590
 if you ever did not know we're going to look 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.820
 the video he has with because otherwise this 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.709
 would be complicated so there suddenly 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.810
 motivate it's a motive he knows about a 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.110
 multiple of 4 plus a straw 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.660
 you see as soon as we made the blue rank 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.030
 with the increases we have everything from 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.990
 following a lot a lot more trouble so 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.550
 that's why I took a little 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.650
 number of miles work it is too much 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.959
 small to show you because otherwise 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.959
 were not returned to the unemployed 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.930
 so we knit well all the means 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.190
 even throw it while sorting them falling 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.350
 so at first I had mounted nine 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.620
 mallet knowing that you have increased 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.820
 one stitch on 2.5 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.310
 I let you do the math but you 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.530
 understand why by following he takes 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.200
 a little more time but then everything 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.900
 it's mike honda augmented will have to 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.420
 decrease it's going to be the goal during 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.420
 next we actually alternate with 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.549
 increases a rank without anything 1 - with 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.239
 decrease a rank without anything and we 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.180
 pick up there I come to the end all the 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.319
 world 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.959
 I showed you the other difficulty 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.340
 particular from this point and after a 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.090
 time you know how to do it's from there 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.420
 has nothing more to know so I'm on 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.760
 my next wine so here I attack the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.850
 decreases so I'm going to make a 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.500
 mesh place and that's where we go 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.430
 attack the decreases I pass 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.890
 my son in front of me slip mesh with 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.200
 my son in front and the three corn 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.500
 next I'm going to catch them together 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.880
 Well, it's a little not obvious 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.200
 it's like me shake you a little too much 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.730
 stir if he wanted to squeeze not really 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.730
 problem and it fast 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:26.610
 I firstly it works and we have our 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.570
 three my that we will knit together to 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:37.229
 backwards but the past my son but here 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:38.789
 I come out but three lambert masts and I 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.320
 do not see what we do on their side and 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.200
 the two mike we had slipped we're going 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.729
 fold over the hand it is appropriate 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.729
 to knit so a 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.550
 and two of the sudden we have a number more 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.220
 only one stitch and that's what 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.370
 make up the little storm dumpling 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.139
 gooseberries 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:02.000
 so here we make a mesh place they 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.120
 are you worth the trick so no 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.210
 his son having to drop a stitch 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:15.400
 slip the second note reminded 3 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:19.150
 next if she wants satrapi 3 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.120
 we are very happy upside down together 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.229
 Greek 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.400
 I'm actually going back right now 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.810
 son on the other side like that I'm in 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.860
 good position for that side my 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.740
 according to it it's easier for 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:36.979
 catch the ways to beat I flap 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:41.810
 one mesh game flap to the next one 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.310
 I knit a knit or flat and so that 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.720
 we will repeat it until the end of the row 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.110
 you see this is what shaped us 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.110
 little balls 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.280
 ah ah
