00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.799 

so<00:00:08.650> so<00:00:09.650> you<00:00:10.190> know<00:00:10.280> very<00:00:10.309> possibly<00:00:11.299> I<00:00:11.540> would

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
so so you know very possibly I would

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.709 
so so you know very possibly I would
have<00:00:12.080> started<00:00:12.559> you<00:00:13.129> know<00:00:13.249> with<00:00:13.429> the<00:00:13.639> head<00:00:13.940> so

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
have started you know with the head so

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.070 
have started you know with the head so
the<00:00:14.900> head<00:00:17.650> again<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.400> neck<00:00:20.080> stretching

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
the head again so the neck stretching

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.160 
the head again so the neck stretching
out<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:22.220> side<00:00:22.519> is<00:00:22.730> bending<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:23.900> if<00:00:23.990> we're

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
out this side is bending so if we're

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.950 
out this side is bending so if we're
seeing<00:00:24.439> the<00:00:24.679> neck<00:00:25.090> so<00:00:26.090> what<00:00:26.269> happens<00:00:26.720> in<00:00:26.869> a

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
seeing the neck so what happens in a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.990 
seeing the neck so what happens in a
bend<00:00:27.349> is<00:00:28.630> that<00:00:29.630> is<00:00:29.869> that<00:00:30.470> one<00:00:30.830> side<00:00:31.250> has<00:00:31.279> to<00:00:31.820> let

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
bend is that is that one side has to let

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.860 
bend is that is that one side has to let
go<00:00:32.270> in<00:00:32.660> order<00:00:33.560> to<00:00:33.890> let<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.130> other<00:00:34.460> side<00:00:34.880> Bend

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
go in order to let the other side Bend

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.040 
go in order to let the other side Bend
and<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:37.070> what<00:00:37.400> you'll<00:00:37.550> quite<00:00:38.120> often<00:00:38.330> see<00:00:38.780> then

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
and so what you'll quite often see then

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.630 
and so what you'll quite often see then
are<00:00:39.350> little<00:00:40.060> creases<00:00:41.060> that<00:00:42.310> indicate<00:00:43.310> to<00:00:43.520> you

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
are little creases that indicate to you

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.460 
are little creases that indicate to you
that<00:00:43.850> a<00:00:43.880> bend<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:44.360> taking<00:00:44.780> place<00:00:45.490> so<00:00:46.840> so<00:00:47.840> that's

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
that a bend is taking place so so that's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.380 
that a bend is taking place so so that's
what<00:00:48.770> I<00:00:48.800> know<00:00:48.920> has<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.550> be<00:00:49.640> happening<00:00:50.090> on<00:00:50.180> that

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
what I know has to be happening on that

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.350 
what I know has to be happening on that
neck<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.020> in<00:00:51.500> fact<00:00:51.830> if<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.520> get<00:00:52.700> over<00:00:53.150> and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
neck and in fact if you get over and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.330 
neck and in fact if you get over and
really<00:00:53.840> look<00:00:54.050> at<00:00:54.200> this<00:00:54.380> drawing<00:00:54.710> you'll<00:00:55.010> see

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
really look at this drawing you'll see

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.850 
really look at this drawing you'll see
just<00:00:55.610> those<00:00:56.120> same<00:00:56.480> lines<00:00:56.810> so<00:00:57.290> this<00:00:57.500> side<00:00:57.710> of

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
just those same lines so this side of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.100 
just those same lines so this side of
the<00:00:57.950> neck<00:00:58.130> is<00:00:58.310> letting<00:00:58.670> go<00:00:58.850> this<00:00:59.660> side<00:00:59.900> is

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
the neck is letting go this side is

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.270 
the neck is letting go this side is
bending<00:01:01.240> very<00:01:02.240> very<00:01:02.510> simple<00:01:02.990> but<00:01:03.230> a<00:01:03.470> real

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
bending very very simple but a real

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.099 
bending very very simple but a real
universal<00:01:05.619> thing<00:01:06.700> okay<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.630> same<00:01:08.869> thing

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
universal thing okay so the same thing

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.219 
universal thing okay so the same thing
is<00:01:09.229> happening<00:01:09.409> in<00:01:09.920> in<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.850> body<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.020> what's

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
is happening in in the body so what's

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.370 
is happening in in the body so what's
happening<00:01:12.649> is<00:01:12.799> that<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.219> side<00:01:13.929> this<00:01:14.929> side<00:01:15.200> of

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
happening is that this side this side of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.340 
happening is that this side this side of
the<00:01:15.469> body<00:01:15.649> is<00:01:16.520> letting<00:01:16.999> go<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.630> it's

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
the body is letting go and it's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.279 
the body is letting go and it's
important<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.189> when<00:01:19.759> you<00:01:22.810> that<00:01:23.810> when<00:01:24.020> you

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
important that when you that when you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.700 
important that when you that when you
begin<00:01:24.890> that<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:25.670> really<00:01:26.119> see<00:01:26.600> allow<00:01:27.229> yourself

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
begin that you really see allow yourself

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.660 
begin that you really see allow yourself
to<00:01:27.859> make<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.039> sweep<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:30.039> gestural<00:01:31.039> line<00:01:31.340> that

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
to make a sweep a gestural line that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.510 
to make a sweep a gestural line that
describes<00:01:32.179> what's<00:01:32.509> happening<00:01:33.020> because<00:01:34.009> what

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
describes what's happening because what

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.819 
describes what's happening because what
will<00:01:34.700> happen<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.450> any<00:01:35.840> kind<00:01:36.170> of<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:36.319> band<00:01:36.560> is

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
will happen in any kind of a band is

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.819 
will happen in any kind of a band is
that<00:01:37.039> one<00:01:37.249> side<00:01:37.579> has<00:01:37.609> to<00:01:37.999> let<00:01:38.179> go<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.829> then

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
that one side has to let go and then

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.340 
that one side has to let go and then
what<00:01:40.399> happens<00:01:40.819> is<00:01:40.999> that<00:01:41.030> all<00:01:41.329> this<00:01:41.719> complex

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
what happens is that all this complex

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.219 
what happens is that all this complex
information<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.780> shoulders<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:46.869> all<00:01:47.869> the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
information of the shoulders and all the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.499 
information of the shoulders and all the
anatomical<00:01:48.979> information<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.850> going<00:01:50.329> to<00:01:50.389> be

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
anatomical information is going to be

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.889 
anatomical information is going to be
doing<00:01:50.719> something<00:01:51.560> very<00:01:51.889> predictable<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.719> what

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
doing something very predictable so what

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.349 
doing something very predictable so what
happens<00:01:54.319> is<00:01:54.499> that<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.950> side<00:01:55.219> is<00:01:55.490> going<00:01:55.999> to<00:01:56.060> is

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
happens is that this side is going to is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.309 
happens is that this side is going to is
going<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.369> bend<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:59.420> hip<00:01:59.689> is<00:01:59.899> actually

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
going to bend the hip is actually

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.989 
going to bend the hip is actually
overlapping<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.590> what<00:02:03.829> we<00:02:03.950> have<00:02:04.189> is<00:02:04.369> this<00:02:04.639> this

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
overlapping so what we have is this this

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.449 
overlapping so what we have is this this
feeling<00:02:05.359> of<00:02:05.450> one<00:02:05.689> side<00:02:05.990> letting<00:02:06.319> go<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:07.189> side

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
feeling of one side letting go this side

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.350 
feeling of one side letting go this side
bending<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:10.130> fact<00:02:10.400> that<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.640> hip<00:02:10.850> is<00:02:11.000> coming

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
bending the fact that the hip is coming

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.780 
bending the fact that the hip is coming
over<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:12.230> part<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.340> ribcage

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
over this this part of the the ribcage

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.440 
over this this part of the the ribcage
then<00:02:14.909> we<00:02:15.150> know<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.849> front<00:02:18.180> of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
then we know that this is in front of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.899 
then we know that this is in front of
that<00:02:18.689> so<00:02:19.620> that's<00:02:19.799> a<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:20.159> simple<00:02:20.549> thing<00:02:20.700> it's

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
that so that's a very simple thing it's

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.050 
that so that's a very simple thing it's
telling<00:02:21.299> us<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:22.109> know<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:23.129> could<00:02:23.159> follow<00:02:23.579> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
telling us you know you could follow the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.649 
telling us you know you could follow the
the<00:02:24.590> center<00:02:25.590> line<00:02:25.799> there<00:02:26.129> which<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.049> spine

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
the center line there which is the spine

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.740 
the center line there which is the spine
and<00:02:31.430> then<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.269> we're<00:02:33.450> seeing

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
and then and then what we're seeing

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.899 
and then and then what we're seeing
because<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.409> whole<00:02:35.180> toch<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.450> tilted<00:02:37.079> up

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
because the whole toch is tilted up

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.839 
because the whole toch is tilted up
we're<00:02:38.909> seeing<00:02:39.980> underneath<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.459> underneath

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
we're seeing underneath this underneath

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:48.740 
we're seeing underneath this underneath
plane<00:02:42.659> of<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.739> tush<00:02:45.109> so<00:02:46.370> then<00:02:47.370> we<00:02:47.579> come<00:02:47.879> round

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
plane of the tush so then we come round

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.420 
plane of the tush so then we come round
out<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.290> tush<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:51.799> again<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.430> we're<00:02:53.609> seeing

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
out the tush and again so we're seeing

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.830 
out the tush and again so we're seeing
underneath<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.909> then<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.239> becomes<00:02:57.689> this

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
underneath so then that becomes this

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.659 
underneath so then that becomes this
whole<00:02:58.049> plane<00:02:58.439> we're<00:02:58.829> looking<00:02:59.189> up<00:02:59.400> up

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
whole plane we're looking up up

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.909 
whole plane we're looking up up
underneath<00:03:00.419> it<00:03:02.419> the<00:03:03.419> sacrum<00:03:04.049> very<00:03:04.650> very

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
underneath it the sacrum very very

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:10.520 
underneath it the sacrum very very
simple<00:03:07.519> bring<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:08.700> down<00:03:09.329> just<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.230> just

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
simple bring this down just just a just

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.809 
simple bring this down just just a just
a<00:03:10.709> tad<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:13.099> know<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.310> then<00:03:14.459> what<00:03:14.669> would

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
a tad you know and then what would

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.629 
a tad you know and then what would
happen<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.950> attaching<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.099> so<00:03:17.280> you're<00:03:17.459> taking

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
happen in attaching it so you're taking

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.099 
happen in attaching it so you're taking
all<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.389> very<00:03:19.079> complex<00:03:19.799> information<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
all this very complex information and

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.710 
all this very complex information and
simplifying<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.970> what's<00:03:24.120> happening<00:03:24.569> is

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
simplifying it so what's happening is

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.569 
simplifying it so what's happening is
that<00:03:24.900> then<00:03:25.109> this<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.769> all<00:03:26.639> going<00:03:26.940> back<00:03:27.329> so<00:03:28.079> that

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
that then this is all going back so that

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.640 
that then this is all going back so that
that<00:03:29.579> part<00:03:29.909> of<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> leg<00:03:30.299> all<00:03:30.659> going<00:03:31.109> back<00:03:31.349> and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
that part of the leg all going back and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.780 
that part of the leg all going back and
then<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:32.040> part<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.669> leg<00:03:32.959> coming<00:03:33.959> forward

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
then this part of the leg coming forward

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:44.539 
then this part of the leg coming forward
so<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:36.000> order<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:37.260> create<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.919> feeling<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:43.549> the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
so in order to create the feeling of the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.610 
so in order to create the feeling of the
fact<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.879> that's<00:03:45.090> going<00:03:45.569> back<00:03:45.750> that's<00:03:46.229> going

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
fact that that's going back that's going

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.860 
fact that that's going back that's going
back<00:03:46.829> this<00:03:47.159> is<00:03:47.370> coming<00:03:47.699> forward<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.359> have<00:03:48.659> to

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
back this is coming forward you have to

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.469 
back this is coming forward you have to
really<00:03:49.229> believe<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.639> in<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.940> way<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.120> you

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
really believe it in the way that you

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.309 
really believe it in the way that you
draw<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.109> is<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:54.239> be<00:03:54.329> thinking<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.049> as<00:03:55.290> a

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
draw it is to be thinking of this as a

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.050 
draw it is to be thinking of this as a
cylinder<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.190> thinking<00:03:56.579> of<00:03:56.669> that<00:03:56.849> as<00:03:57.030> a

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
cylinder and thinking of that as a

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.569 
cylinder and thinking of that as a
cylinder
