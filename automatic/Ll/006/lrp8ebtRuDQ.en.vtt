 car on the server will not cost 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.910
 will depend on the demand for that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.030
 or another brand 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.620
 the mall is local then prices are nothing 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.690
 different from all others but 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.360

 I myself did a restaurant myself but 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.390
 the most interesting people come here 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.760
 order something and eat 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.280

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.190

 Naturally only the driver and looks 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.320
 I don't know if it is quite adequate 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.570
 be after some time and get bored 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.730
 first impression is extremely positive 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.830
 as for the site 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.470
 main buns to help grp 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.940

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.260

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.020
 because online distributed by day 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.850
 but this is all dear friends in 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.590
 the last thing I would like to say so 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.990
 this is what administrators are here at all 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.390
 do not climb into the game all the leaders are appointed and 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.170
