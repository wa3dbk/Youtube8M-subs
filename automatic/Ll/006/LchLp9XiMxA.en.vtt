distortion<00:03:29.400> pedal<00:03:29.640> in<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.850> bridge<00:03:30.090> position

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
distortion pedal in the bridge position

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.230 
distortion pedal in the bridge position
it<00:03:31.260> kind<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.620> does<00:03:31.800> get<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.460> little<00:03:32.610> bit<00:03:32.850> heavier

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
it kind of does get a little bit heavier

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.120 
it kind of does get a little bit heavier
in<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.780> bridge<00:03:34.140> then<00:03:34.440> doesn't<00:03:34.770> hang<00:03:34.950> other

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
in the bridge then doesn't hang other

00:03:35.130 --> 00:04:19.890 
in the bridge then doesn't hang other
pick<00:03:35.310> up

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.059 

definitely<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:21.109> would<00:04:21.199> use<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.440> bridge<00:04:21.799> con

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:22.069 
definitely I would use that bridge con

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.610 
definitely I would use that bridge con
more<00:04:22.340> towards<00:04:22.789> a<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.750> who<00:04:23.930> when<00:04:24.229> everything

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
more towards a the who when everything

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.050 
more towards a the who when everything
because<00:04:24.860> Pete<00:04:25.039> Townsend<00:04:25.400> does<00:04:25.580> actually<00:04:25.759> use

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
because Pete Townsend does actually use

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.550 
because Pete Townsend does actually use
this<00:04:26.300> specific<00:04:26.810> set<00:04:27.050> in<00:04:27.289> a<00:04:27.830> Stratocaster

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
this specific set in a Stratocaster

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.990 
this specific set in a Stratocaster
normally<00:04:30.560> I<00:04:30.650> can't<00:04:30.919> find<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.430> right<00:04:31.610> set<00:04:31.970> of

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
normally I can't find the right set of

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.059 
normally I can't find the right set of
strata<00:04:32.479> cups<00:04:32.810> i'm<00:04:32.960> not<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.139> huge<00:04:33.349> strap<00:04:33.650> person

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
strata cups i'm not a huge strap person

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.070 
strata cups i'm not a huge strap person
so<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.520> has<00:04:34.699> to<00:04:34.729> be<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.210> right<00:04:35.240> set<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.720> pickups

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
so it has to be the right set of pickups

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.080 
so it has to be the right set of pickups
and<00:04:36.349> i<00:04:37.069> was<00:04:37.190> actually<00:04:37.370> thinking<00:04:37.550> of<00:04:37.789> a<00:04:37.880> set<00:04:38.060> of

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
and i was actually thinking of a set of

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.730 
and i was actually thinking of a set of
texas<00:04:38.419> specials<00:04:38.840> but<00:04:38.930> i<00:04:38.990> think<00:04:39.259> this<00:04:39.410> does

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
texas specials but i think this does

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.999 
texas specials but i think this does
what<00:04:40.099> the<00:04:40.190> text<00:04:40.430> specials<00:04:41.229> do<00:04:42.229> in<00:04:42.530> my<00:04:42.680> opinion

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
what the text specials do in my opinion

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.249 
what the text specials do in my opinion
or<00:04:43.220> when<00:04:43.370> i've<00:04:43.460> heard<00:04:43.840> maybe<00:04:44.840> with<00:04:45.169> a<00:04:45.199> little

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
or when i've heard maybe with a little

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.140 
or when i've heard maybe with a little
bit<00:04:45.590> more<00:04:45.770> of<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:46.039> bell-like<00:04:46.280> sound<00:04:46.520> so<00:04:47.030> it's

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
bit more of a bell-like sound so it's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.770 
bit more of a bell-like sound so it's
like<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.330> text<00:04:47.690> special<00:04:47.960> set<00:04:48.590> mixed<00:04:49.370> in<00:04:49.520> with<00:04:49.699> a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
like a text special set mixed in with a

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.620 
like a text special set mixed in with a
something<00:04:50.780> like<00:04:50.900> a<00:04:51.070> 5762<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.789> give<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:53.270> a<00:04:53.419> kind

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
something like a 5762 to give it a kind

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.620 
something like a 5762 to give it a kind
of<00:04:53.780> bell<00:04:54.740> like<00:04:55.039> sailing<00:04:55.550> from<00:04:55.729> a<00:04:55.880> 50s<00:04:56.270> set<00:04:56.539> of

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
of bell like sailing from a 50s set of

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
sort of a change i do think i would

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.339 
sort of a change i do think i would
change<00:05:24.320> it<00:05:24.560> out<00:05:24.680> for<00:05:25.070> maybe<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.340> lace<00:05:25.610> sensor

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
change it out for maybe a lace sensor

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.689 
change it out for maybe a lace sensor
one<00:05:27.349> of<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.530> ones<00:05:27.710> modeled<00:05:28.130> after<00:05:28.250> i<00:05:28.400> think<00:05:28.639> a

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
one of the ones modeled after i think a

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.760 
one of the ones modeled after i think a
fifties<00:05:29.180> humbucker<00:05:29.720> in<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.900> bridge<00:05:30.139> or<00:05:30.349> p9

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
fifties humbucker in the bridge or p9

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.999 
fifties humbucker in the bridge or p9
but<00:05:31.430> overall<00:05:31.699> I<00:05:31.820> may<00:05:32.030> have<00:05:32.349> it<00:05:33.349> does<00:05:33.620> get<00:05:33.830> me

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
but overall I may have it does get me

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.439 
but overall I may have it does get me
the<00:05:34.159> kind<00:05:34.370> of<00:05:34.460> vintage<00:05:34.639> kind<00:05:35.000> of<00:05:35.180> strange

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
the kind of vintage kind of strange

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.779 
the kind of vintage kind of strange
sound<00:05:35.750> that<00:05:35.870> I<00:05:35.930> wanted<00:05:36.320> so<00:05:37.280> if<00:05:37.370> you're<00:05:37.520> in<00:05:37.669> the

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
sound that I wanted so if you're in the

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.580 
sound that I wanted so if you're in the
ballpark<00:05:37.969> looking<00:05:38.479> for<00:05:38.630> something<00:05:38.960> towards<00:05:39.349> a

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
ballpark looking for something towards a

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.770 
ballpark looking for something towards a
new<00:05:39.800> Clapton<00:05:40.370> signature<00:05:40.820> strat<00:05:41.120> uses<00:05:41.509> this

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
new Clapton signature strat uses this

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.020 
new Clapton signature strat uses this
and<00:05:42.969> Pete<00:05:43.969> Townsend<00:05:44.680> also<00:05:45.680> uses<00:05:46.039> this<00:05:46.190> top<00:05:46.940> my

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
and Pete Townsend also uses this top my

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.689 
and Pete Townsend also uses this top my
head<00:05:47.060> I<00:05:47.240> knew<00:05:47.449> okay<00:05:47.780> Dan<00:05:48.320> Gilmore<00:05:48.680> uses<00:05:49.159> it<00:05:49.280> to

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
head I knew okay Dan Gilmore uses it to

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.129 
head I knew okay Dan Gilmore uses it to
somewhere<00:05:50.000> along<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.360> lines<00:05:50.539> of<00:05:50.690> those<00:05:50.870> kind

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
somewhere along the lines of those kind

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:52.689 
somewhere along the lines of those kind
of<00:05:51.169> strata<00:05:51.440> tens<00:05:51.770> and<00:05:52.039> I<00:05:52.099> think<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:52.400> can<00:05:52.430> get<00:05:52.669> a

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
of strata tens and I think you can get a

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.279 
of strata tens and I think you can get a
decent<00:05:53.380> dire<00:05:54.380> straits<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:55.009> knopfler<00:05:55.490> sound<00:05:56.289> out

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289

of<00:05:57.349> these<00:05:57.560> two<00:05:57.830> I'm<00:05:57.949> nothing<00:05:58.280> technically

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
of these two I'm nothing technically

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.140 
of these two I'm nothing technically
