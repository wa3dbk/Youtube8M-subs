 I hope you are well 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.759
 we find ourselves quickly guys for 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.250
 a video that will last about two 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.630
 minutes not even it's actually 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.619
 I was careful I intend to 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.490
 do that it's often now that 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.170
 make small videos like this in 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.340
 made 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.170
 and it's going to be what in fact I'm just going 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.030
 take a small parcel at home at 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.220
 our boyfriend barix him who often has 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.290
 subscribers who asks me what is 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.300
 I doubted there how I got this weapon 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.379
 the nani machine so we save then 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.089
 all the time instead of repeating and 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.230
 answer fifteen thousand 15 thousand 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.950
 comments to fifteen thousand times the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.239
 same things 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.090
 well what will really follow me down 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.469
 they will simply see it so the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.430
 first time I had done it I 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.500
 have only done once for now 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.190
 I had to taste it the scout in 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.859
 to say of the bagna the scout of 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.000
 the veteran jail and I'm doing them 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.800
 a second time I did a bac 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.570
 I did not make a video I did I did 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.770
 makes offer simply because I 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.780
 do not know it was just before leaving 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.690
 taf smiles at him dlc stuff dananÃ© 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.880
 so i was gt gt fast actually a 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.619
 do not lie to you I have not thought about 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.119
 make the video so there for the third 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.950
 we will do it together so we go 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.689
 go there without further ado why yeah 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.549
 I wanted to why first open the 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.020
 package before taking the torso 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.079
 because I'm still 33 years old does the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.460
 his finish the 32nd and the 34th of the 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.159
 prison frankly the 34 I have 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.509
 kiffed he really is he and I took 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.420
 two three videos do not worry I 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.299
 wanted to post 34 I really did 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.310
 gets off well but I told myself prefer 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.159
 first open a package will know 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.270
 never if I buy the top is that 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.009
 well I have the luck or misfortune to re 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.060
 reopen the package is grabbed a doctor this 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.710
 I will have the same 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 so here we are referring directly to 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.649
 the parcel so to see together what I 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.640
 will catch but less than luck 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.100
 that I have I guess I'm going to have 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.130
 a tear 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.270
 that's okay listen and you know what 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.740
 this is the second time you have 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.990
 did you have the thresher I had it 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.269
 do it off video and that's it 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.239
 will teach me I have the thresher for a 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.989
 second time simply so we're going 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.430
 to say that I have a little balls 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.629
 I really really have the same balls 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.250
 yellow slam a matrix of weapons and 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.290
 armor low for shit 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.459
 no I showed you quickly that's where 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.970
 is simply what is 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.200
 the one I had already tasted so and 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.459
 the stability of the baule we can not 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.510
 see well but the first ability 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.590
 what is its stability of the emba allows 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.620
 to be improved simply 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.819
 after we load loads increased 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.410
 simply heat great cape 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.510
 we have the striped cannon that acquit 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.819
 increase the range we have the monster 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.049
 adjusted which further increases the stability 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.640
 so you can really have a very 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.000
 very good stability knowing that already from 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.549
 basis for good stability is 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.680
 and the third bah you have a chance 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.120
 to stun fallen captain including a 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.859
 very very very good ability that can 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.870
 really be very very useful especially 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.250
 in the veterans prison so here you go 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.829

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.540
