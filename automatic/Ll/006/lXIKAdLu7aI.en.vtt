00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.500 
are fairly even with the Thunder so I'm
not<00:03:23.430> going<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.640> complain<00:03:23.820> about<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.269> one's

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
not going to complain about that one's

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.710 
not going to complain about that one's
too<00:03:24.690> much<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.890> bowls<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.610> feel<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.570> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
too much and the bowls I feel like the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.470 
too much and the bowls I feel like the
Bulls<00:03:27.900> have<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.230> potential<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:29.070> be<00:03:29.370> ahead<00:03:29.519> but

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
Bulls have the potential to be ahead but

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.850 
Bulls have the potential to be ahead but
at<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.720> start<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.200> season<00:03:31.470> after

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
at the start of the season after

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.979 
at the start of the season after
finishing<00:03:32.459> off<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> bit<00:03:33.209> underwhelming<00:03:33.810> Lee

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
finishing off a bit underwhelming Lee

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.020 
finishing off a bit underwhelming Lee
last<00:03:34.230> season<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:34.860> my<00:03:35.220> opinion<00:03:35.519> they<00:03:35.760> should<00:03:35.790> be

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
last season in my opinion they should be

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.830 
last season in my opinion they should be
third<00:03:36.390> if<00:03:36.690> not<00:03:37.140> third<00:03:37.470> at<00:03:37.860> least<00:03:38.340> forth<00:03:39.150> but

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
third if not third at least forth but

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.840 
third if not third at least forth but
you<00:03:39.989> know<00:03:40.110> what<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.709> what<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.549> next

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850

Charlotte Hornets at number 10 now my

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.300 
Charlotte Hornets at number 10 now my
first<00:03:50.790> question<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.570> where<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.680> world<00:03:52.950> or

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
first question is where in the world or

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.400 
first question is where in the world or
the<00:03:53.489> Toronto<00:03:53.970> Raptors<00:03:54.450> they<00:03:54.930> were<00:03:55.109> ranked

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
the Toronto Raptors they were ranked

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.440 
the Toronto Raptors they were ranked
third<00:03:55.650> in<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.890> East<00:03:56.070> last<00:03:56.310> season<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.120> MEA

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
third in the East last season in the MEA

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.479 
third in the East last season in the MEA
and<00:03:57.900> don't<00:03:58.200> get<00:03:58.290> me<00:03:58.350> wrong<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.829> understand<00:03:59.370> that

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
and don't get me wrong I understand that

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.069 
and don't get me wrong I understand that
the<00:03:59.549> Eastern<00:03:59.880> Conference<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.540> weaker<00:04:01.049> than

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
the Eastern Conference is weaker than

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.110 
the Eastern Conference is weaker than
the<00:04:01.320> Western<00:04:01.709> Conference<00:04:01.859> so<00:04:02.519> being<00:04:02.700> third<00:04:03.000> in

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
the Western Conference so being third in

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.370 
the Western Conference so being third in
the<00:04:03.180> West<00:04:03.390> means<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.720> lot<00:04:03.870> more<00:04:04.049> than<00:04:04.109> being

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
the West means a lot more than being

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.680 
the West means a lot more than being
third<00:04:04.620> in<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.859> East<00:04:05.100> but<00:04:05.670> still<00:04:06.000> there's<00:04:06.299> got

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
third in the East but still there's got

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.870 
third in the East but still there's got
to<00:04:06.870> be<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:07.019> spot<00:04:07.650> for<00:04:07.859> them<00:04:07.980> somewhere<00:04:08.579> here

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
to be a spot for them somewhere here

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.150 
to be a spot for them somewhere here
putting<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.600> Hornets<00:04:10.079> above<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.440> rappers<00:04:10.890> I

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
putting the Hornets above the rappers I

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.610 
putting the Hornets above the rappers I
don't<00:04:11.790> understand<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.480> I'm<00:04:12.720> not<00:04:13.140> too<00:04:13.350> sure

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
don't understand that I'm not too sure

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.830 
don't understand that I'm not too sure
the<00:04:14.220> Mavericks<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.910> Grizzlies<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.510> Miami

the Mavericks the Grizzlies the Miami

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.380 
the Mavericks the Grizzlies the Miami
Heat<00:04:16.019> those<00:04:16.530> are<00:04:16.739> all<00:04:16.769> debatable<00:04:17.489> but<00:04:18.150> at

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
Heat those are all debatable but at

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.599 
Heat those are all debatable but at
least<00:04:18.810> above<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.350> Hornets<00:04:19.859> at<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.250> very

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
least above the Hornets at the very

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.940 
least above the Hornets at the very
least<00:04:20.820> put<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.870> Toronto<00:04:22.260> Raptors<00:04:22.620> above<00:04:22.860> the

least put the Toronto Raptors above the
Hornets

Hornets

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.320 
Hornets
my<00:04:23.860> opinion<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.430> think<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.729> Grizzlies<00:04:25.120> might

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
my opinion I think the Grizzlies might

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.029 
my opinion I think the Grizzlies might
drop<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:25.660> little<00:04:25.930> bit<00:04:26.169> from<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.410> number<00:04:26.740> seven

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
drop a little bit from the number seven

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.650 
drop a little bit from the number seven
spot<00:04:27.069> I<00:04:27.580> don't<00:04:27.910> think<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.180> they'll<00:04:28.419> be<00:04:28.449> able

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
spot I don't think that they'll be able

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.330 
spot I don't think that they'll be able
to<00:04:28.780> keep<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.020> up<00:04:29.289> for<00:04:29.500> too<00:04:29.680> long<00:04:29.889> during<00:04:30.130> the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
to keep that up for too long during the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.309 
to keep that up for too long during the
season<00:04:30.759> but<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.330> know<00:04:31.449> what<00:04:31.660> anything<00:04:32.229> can

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.319 
season but you know what anything can

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.200

happen<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.949> by<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.280> way<00:04:33.460> don't<00:04:33.490> get<00:04:33.880> me<00:04:34.000> wrong

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
happen and by the way don't get me wrong

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.420 
happen and by the way don't get me wrong
the<00:04:34.449> people<00:04:34.780> at<00:04:34.930> 2k<00:04:35.169> they<00:04:35.949> know<00:04:36.130> what<00:04:36.280> they're
