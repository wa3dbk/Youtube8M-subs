00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
in my wardrobe and that's because i am

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
decided to incorporate it with my

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.850 
decided to incorporate it with my
sleeveless<00:03:44.940> cardigan<00:03:45.660> which<00:03:45.900> was<00:03:46.110> also<00:03:46.440> vent

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
sleeveless cardigan which was also vent

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.090

which<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.280> also<00:03:47.459> vintage<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.560> think<00:03:49.860> it

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100
