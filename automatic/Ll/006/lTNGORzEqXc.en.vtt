00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.669
 no more seriously then the bias of the villas madeleine haut-de-seine ok 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.210
 for the piano I presume of course that the pianos of the years 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.470
 80 so I do not know whether to apply them to water 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.489
 we do not know too much 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.669
 but they are other instruments like the others 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:26.760
 it was 90 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.410
 absolutely super 95 makes people think a little bit reminds a few 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.359
 scenes of this pact 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.350
 while he is not unaware that in this state of affairs closely by 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.360
 yamaha in the years 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.910
 78 'I think 79 yesterday it was marc touati absolutely wrong so it was good 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 certainly it weighed not at all 25 kilos he had real ropes and hammer 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.770
 but no ski crossbar it's true it was 80 years old we find by 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 example 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.340
 this stage of small foster good you hear you more now but 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.070
 gbagbo was in the Basque 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.440
 he came into play 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.440
 pokora greece got a little bit 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.150
 class is really 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.320
 completely modeling resumption and a sample of these 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.810
 80 but more 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.360
 all have its acoustic vibration has been recreated is modeled 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.460
 we really have exactly the behavior of a single 80 like the days the hours 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 for example by the potato 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.420
 we will find here zero 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.780
 so the horror scenes are a treat and during this time we're 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.479
 really hears all the hardware the small slats zinaida but that there 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.110
 he has to October 10 and must not be in front line because sfr come 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.210
 people 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.329
 p 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.060
 here is modeling we can have a whole series of brands 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.069
 absolutely 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.409
 so it's very funny because you can even have a factor 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.620
 does not exist we can say that we can 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.900
 for example a year to redo his client would be a price in addition to a fan 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.150
 of 73 with a speaker all a reverb and hop and 1 and a chorus in 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.230
 the country that if he does not intend to buy iti 816 dedications 7 rebounds lover annie 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.160
 have fun composing a virtual keyboard that only exists in your dreams 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.529
 and mine 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.299
 but of course it's so yes yes me too it's very funny there is the return 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.509
 by force of the fact the 80s with this attack of synthesis fm 6 em 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.509
 so special 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.829
 one o'clock 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.359
 mullein 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:46.360
 I suppose 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.690
 obviously we have his traditional string that should not see 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.010
 every two weeks while it's about 300 rooms so the rest 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.580
 sound frames are wmc sampling found on the 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.209
 bank reasons for some tariffs and others that can make 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.239
 we just need to have a few shots behind 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.239
 this is a way to raise awareness and mobilize a symphony orchestra 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.239
 increased by strings 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.029
 m 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.030
 on the other hand interesting is the speed 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.800
 to go mix of meanings that is to say that to the management between the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.589
 cp 80 pairs barnes 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:28.589
 it's tomorrow sunday in 32nd its best 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.909
 while I still specify that you make fun of me 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.129
 we have more to know about visible text than it was just now 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.379
 lucian grainge deafness 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.209
 even though you have to talk to me about my terminal lorient I want to say that the 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.159
 skull is extremely visible 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.069
 the screen and not only visible by all the contexts say that precisely 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.749
 it's a stage book if I put a big red designer as we sometimes 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:00.150
 table on keyboards who are who got a little right at the bottom of the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.279
 stage and pianists 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:04.599
 with groups today the company lcd screens you see what I want 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.419
 to say quickly this is the galley such score there at least the seven screens there by 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.239
 all the time everywhere the lights it appears it is visible it is 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.799
 extremely clever it's very good for these people and big button for you 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.039
 wells etcheverry wire weeks absolutely absolutely in real time in 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.569
 Valais we'll go have fun apart I take a fan of gold who will play it 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.210
 shifted a small people the position of the microphone the point of hitting the hammer 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.099
 percent less than ten boats 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.849
 and each time the parameters are offered with ransom they will not go 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.159
 instrument that we expect the same parameters on a piano 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.339
 acoustic on a fan of the bail to this hecatomb each time it's 

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:38.379
 the time it really belongs to the field of the instrument that was a 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.889
 model here
