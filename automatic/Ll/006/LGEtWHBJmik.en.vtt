00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.450
 Yes, I would like to briefly explain the last two slides 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:15.420
 In a 6 a 16th slide but here 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:18.810
 I'm word wood is in and then try to change there Dechotto slide of pipe 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:25.180
 Now it's a title and bullet type 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:29.670
 Change to the title only at the layout of the home tab 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.670
 WordArt inserted in there 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.200
 ー ー ー I input like this and go to the numerical part a little 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:01:03.210
 It can be said that it is encouraging to put in a machine which is a sense if you put a demon 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:06.470
 Put in where the place of here, click because it is equipped with a start effect that the zoom 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.470
 Animation 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.390
 I think I'm going to go out with a start effect and feel like a zoomer 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.220
 The horizontal slide is ok with this 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.020
 In Dearimasu first in crowded make generally not be the end of the slide 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.730
 For example it better here hey bought this 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:35.270
 Good look and presentation materials creation here came out of my head 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:38.820
 Place here at was is put out those put out in the by now are written in a text box 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.030
 An animation effect is attached with 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:48.360
 Animation effect in the s ride in was Takara 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.070
 I think that it was attached in the form of because I finished making all the slides with this 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.540
 Run a slideshow later 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.280
 And in the preparation of handouts a 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:03.250
 Images and then Well 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:09.030
 If you want to put something like this into an image or a graph then how about the material 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.030
 I would like to talk about such things as whether you will do so
