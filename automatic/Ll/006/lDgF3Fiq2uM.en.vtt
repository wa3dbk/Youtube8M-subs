second counts hey there so rifle with a
shotgun<00:02:29.019> attachment<00:02:29.410> would<00:02:30.310> actually<00:02:30.849> be

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
shotgun attachment would actually be

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.880 
shotgun attachment would actually be
pretty<00:02:31.269> useful<00:02:31.690> now<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.500> course<00:02:32.650> would<00:02:32.860> be

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
pretty useful now of course would be

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.610 
pretty useful now of course would be
limitations<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.790> compare<00:02:34.630> like<00:02:34.930> with<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.440> on

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
limitations to a compare like with a on

limitations to a compare like with a on
regular<00:02:36.010> shock<00:02:36.280> gonna<00:02:36.550> probably<00:02:36.849> be<00:02:37.060> about

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
regular shock gonna probably be about

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.990 
regular shock gonna probably be about
maybe<00:02:37.540> five<00:02:37.989> or<00:02:38.349> six<00:02:38.830> bullets<00:02:39.250> now<00:02:39.549> this<00:02:39.760> guy

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
maybe five or six bullets now this guy

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
fucking x-man last and now that was the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.170 
fucking x-man last and now that was the
issue<00:02:44.349> for<00:02:44.680> me<00:02:44.830> right<00:02:45.040> there<00:02:45.069> now<00:02:45.700> let's<00:02:45.940> say

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
issue for me right there now let's say

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.000 
issue for me right there now let's say
if<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.330> were<00:02:46.540> SWAT<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.230> attachment<00:02:47.709> could

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
if you were SWAT this attachment could

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.650 
if you were SWAT this attachment could
actually<00:02:48.160> be<00:02:48.370> pretty<00:02:48.610> useful<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.450> actually

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
actually be pretty useful you actually

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.600 
actually be pretty useful you actually
shoot<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.200> attachment<00:02:50.739> on<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.890> ground<00:02:51.310> and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
shoot the attachment on the ground and

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.449 
shoot the attachment on the ground and
it<00:02:51.819> will<00:02:51.970> censor<00:02:52.630> all<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.769> passing<00:02:54.280> by

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
it will censor all of the passing by

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.430 
it will censor all of the passing by
players<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.360> let's<00:02:55.390> say<00:02:55.660> if<00:02:55.720> you're<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:56.170> the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
players so let's say if you're on the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.259 
players so let's say if you're on the
other<00:02:56.470> side<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.280> map<00:02:57.549> there<00:02:58.000> will<00:02:58.120> be<00:02:58.150> a

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
other side of the map there will be a

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.420 
other side of the map there will be a
picture<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:59.170> will<00:02:59.260> pop<00:02:59.500> up<00:02:59.530> like<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.130> little

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
picture that will pop up like a little

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.309 
picture that will pop up like a little
screen<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:00.940> side<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.810> will<00:03:01.989> show<00:03:02.260> you

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
screen on the side and it will show you

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.319 
screen on the side and it will show you
all<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.890> red<00:03:03.099> dots<00:03:03.130> moving<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.150> will<00:03:04.299> have

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
all the red dots moving so you will have

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.710 
all the red dots moving so you will have
lumps<00:03:04.989> on<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.739> enemy<00:03:05.920> team<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:07.120> would<00:03:07.480> be

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
lumps on the enemy team that would be

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.620 
lumps on the enemy team that would be
