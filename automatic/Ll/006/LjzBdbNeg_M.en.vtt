00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
nokia and this is the main reason for

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.970

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
jobs overlap each other um and you'd

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.040 
jobs overlap each other um and you'd
have<00:00:53.280> two<00:00:53.550> people<00:00:53.760> doing<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.390> person's<00:00:54.840> job
