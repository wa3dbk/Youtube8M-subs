kronos<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.660> previous<00:00:34.170> records<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.950> guess<00:00:35.160> which

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
kronos is previous records I guess which

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.920 
kronos is previous records I guess which
is<00:00:35.850> more<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.180> four<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.630> four<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.899> half

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
is more like four to four and a half

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530 
is more like four to four and a half
minutes<00:00:37.170> typically<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.550> by<00:00:38.850> far<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
minutes typically so by far this is the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.920 
minutes typically so by far this is the
new<00:00:39.840> king<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.230> stamina<00:00:41.180> there<00:00:42.180> again<00:00:42.480> forty

stamina type and on the right side here

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.690 
stamina type and on the right side here
is<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> attack<00:01:04.110> type<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:05.070> switch<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> modes

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
is the attack type you switch the modes

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.899 
is the attack type you switch the modes
by<00:01:05.880> flipping<00:01:06.210> over<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.530> middle<00:01:08.040> wheel<00:01:08.189> so

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
by flipping over the middle wheel so

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.980 
by flipping over the middle wheel so
we'll<00:01:09.210> take<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> look<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.689> ones<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.869> get

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
we'll take a look at that ones we get

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.859 
we'll take a look at that ones we get
unboxed<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:11.250> look<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> status<00:01:12.240> if

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
unboxed there's look at the status if

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.570 
unboxed there's look at the status if
you're<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.260> stamina<00:01:13.710> mode<00:01:13.950> versus<00:01:14.310> attack

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you're in stamina mode versus attack

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.249 
you're in stamina mode versus attack
mode<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.540> still<00:01:15.720> not<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> whole<00:01:16.020> lot<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
mode it's still not a whole lot of

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
mode it's still not a whole lot of
attack<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.530> anything<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.189> either<00:01:17.939> way<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
attack or anything but either way it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.359 
attack or anything but either way it
could<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> very<00:01:18.840> heavily<00:01:19.350> stamina<00:01:20.189> type

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
could be a very heavily stamina type

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.789 
could be a very heavily stamina type
base<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.659> there's<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.200> recommended

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
base so and there's the recommended

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.390 
base so and there's the recommended
combo<00:01:23.189> which<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.970> believe<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.450> scythe<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.110> RAF

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
combo which I believe is scythe to RAF

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.940 
combo which I believe is scythe to RAF
so<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.960> guess<00:01:27.960> nothing<00:01:28.439> else<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.829> them

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
so I guess nothing else to do them

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
so I guess nothing else to do them
besides<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.729> opened<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> take<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> closer

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
besides get opened up and take a closer

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.800 
besides get opened up and take a closer
look<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> bay<00:01:31.740> itself<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.240> let's<00:01:33.479> go

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
look at the bay itself then so let's go

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.899 
look at the bay itself then so let's go

very<00:03:51.920> cool<00:03:52.280> it's<00:03:53.090> got<00:03:53.239> a<00:03:53.320> dark<00:03:54.320> phyla<00:03:54.799> -<00:03:55.040> purple

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
very cool it's got a dark phyla - purple

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.710 
very cool it's got a dark phyla - purple
you<00:03:58.130> can<00:03:58.519> see<00:03:58.730> it's<00:03:58.910> kind<00:03:59.090> of<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.359> think<00:03:59.540> it's

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
you can see it's kind of I think it's

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.539 
you can see it's kind of I think it's
got<00:03:59.840> some<00:03:59.989> glitter<00:04:00.500> kind<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:01.040> in<00:04:01.160> there<00:04:01.310> some

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
got some glitter kind of in there some

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.319 
got some glitter kind of in there some
sparkle<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:03.680> then<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:04.340> metal<00:04:05.000> frame

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
sparkle to it and then the metal frame

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.770 
sparkle to it and then the metal frame
and<00:04:05.600> core<00:04:06.609> look<00:04:07.609> I<00:04:07.940> assume<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.329> core<00:04:08.510> can<00:04:08.660> come

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
and core look I assume the core can come

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.899 
and core look I assume the core can come
out<00:04:10.390> its

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.550 

there<00:04:15.909> we<00:04:16.000> go<00:04:16.120> all<00:04:16.660> right<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:16.959> there<00:04:17.229> is<00:04:17.380> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
there we go all right so there is the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.509 
there we go all right so there is the
metal<00:04:18.340> frame<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:19.829> this<00:04:20.829> is<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.220> core

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
metal frame and this is the core

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.249 
metal frame and this is the core
together<00:04:22.090> they<00:04:22.210> form<00:04:22.389> the<00:04:22.419> four<00:04:22.750> D<00:04:22.900> metal

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
together they form the four D metal

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.730 
together they form the four D metal
wheel<00:04:24.180> that's<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.360> can't<00:04:26.169> tell<00:04:26.440> if<00:04:26.560> it's

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
wheel that's you can't tell if it's

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.350 
wheel that's you can't tell if it's
let's<00:04:27.160> take<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.400> down<00:04:27.430> they're<00:04:27.729> just<00:04:28.180> some

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
let's take it down they're just some

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.650 
let's take it down they're just some
symbols<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:28.900> think<00:04:29.520> mag<00:04:30.520> is<00:04:30.729> exactly<00:04:31.120> sure<00:04:31.449> I

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
symbols I think mag is exactly sure I

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.150 
symbols I think mag is exactly sure I
think<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:31.870> just<00:04:31.990> some<00:04:32.169> symbols<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:32.889> don't

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
think it's just some symbols I don't

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.830 
think it's just some symbols I don't
think<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.340> says<00:04:33.460> anything<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.389> Japanese

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
think it says anything but and Japanese

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.580 
think it says anything but and Japanese
it<00:04:34.990> does<00:04:35.610> so<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:37.120> wheel<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:37.750> quite<00:04:38.050> heavy<00:04:38.350> in

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
it does so this wheel is quite heavy in

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.529 
it does so this wheel is quite heavy in
my<00:04:38.740> opinion<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.280> will<00:04:39.580> exact<00:04:40.030> weight<00:04:40.180> offhand

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
my opinion I will exact weight offhand

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.230 
my opinion I will exact weight offhand
but<00:04:40.630> as<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.740> can<00:04:41.830> probably<00:04:42.009> see<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:43.030> does<00:04:43.210> have

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
but as you can probably see it does have

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.240 
but as you can probably see it does have
indents<00:04:43.780> on<00:04:44.020> both<00:04:44.289> sides<00:04:44.530> this<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.070> part

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
indents on both sides this is the part

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.189 
indents on both sides this is the part
that<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.669> flip<00:04:46.240> over<00:04:46.389> to<00:04:46.599> change<00:04:46.810> from<00:04:46.930> stand

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
that you flip over to change from stand

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.860 
that you flip over to change from stand
out<00:04:47.289> to<00:04:47.410> attack<00:04:47.620> mode<00:04:47.889> and<00:04:48.300> then<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.570> course

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
out to attack mode and then of course

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.909 
out to attack mode and then of course
the<00:04:50.349> 4dd<00:04:51.039> bottom<00:04:51.690> which<00:04:52.690> actually<00:04:53.560> spins

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
the 4dd bottom which actually spins

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.879 
the 4dd bottom which actually spins
separate<00:04:54.430> there<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.080> can<00:04:56.169> see<00:04:56.320> I<00:04:56.349> have

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
separate there so you can see I have

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.499 
separate there so you can see I have
stolen<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:57.220> part<00:04:57.460> stationary<00:04:57.880> but<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
stolen that part stationary but the

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.779 
stolen that part stationary but the
bottom<00:04:58.810> part<00:04:58.990> can<00:04:59.139> spin<00:04:59.410> freely<00:04:59.710> so<00:05:00.639> that's

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
bottom part can spin freely so that's

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:01.439 
bottom part can spin freely so that's
pretty<00:05:00.970> cool

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
pretty cool

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.390 
pretty cool
got<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.470> couple<00:05:02.650> screws<00:05:02.919> in<00:05:03.039> there<00:05:03.250> which

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
got a couple screws in there which

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.930 
got a couple screws in there which
probably<00:05:03.639> add<00:05:03.789> a<00:05:03.820> little<00:05:04.090> weight<00:05:04.210> as<00:05:04.330> well<00:05:04.860> so

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
probably add a little weight as well so

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.189 
probably add a little weight as well so
let's<00:05:06.940> put<00:05:07.090> this<00:05:07.180> baby<00:05:07.360> together<00:05:07.539> then<00:05:07.810> and

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
let's put this baby together then and

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.260 
let's put this baby together then and
take<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.620> look<00:05:08.770> at<00:05:08.889> fully<00:05:09.220> assembled<00:05:10.259> let's<00:05:11.259> see

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
take a look at fully assembled let's see

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.379 
take a look at fully assembled let's see
if<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.389> can<00:05:13.539> tell<00:05:13.720> which<00:05:13.900> way<00:05:14.080> this<00:05:14.289> is<00:05:14.530> then

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
if I can tell which way this is then

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.629 
if I can tell which way this is then
taking<00:05:16.389> a<00:05:16.449> look<00:05:16.479> here<00:05:16.949> it<00:05:17.949> looks<00:05:18.130> like<00:05:18.340> this

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
taking a look here it looks like this

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.070 
taking a look here it looks like this
mode<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.210> way<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.330> have<00:05:19.449> it<00:05:19.479> currently<00:05:19.840> is

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
mode the way I have it currently is

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.529 
mode the way I have it currently is
stamina<00:05:20.680> mode<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:21.849> if<00:05:21.940> I<00:05:22.060> had<00:05:22.180> flipped<00:05:22.389> over

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
stamina mode and if I had flipped over

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.149 
stamina mode and if I had flipped over
like<00:05:22.750> this<00:05:22.930> that'd<00:05:23.169> be<00:05:23.289> attack<00:05:23.590> mode

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
like this that'd be attack mode

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:27.000 
like this that'd be attack mode
I<00:05:24.240> did<00:05:25.240> have<00:05:25.449> to<00:05:25.570> change<00:05:25.780> it<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.990> parts<00:05:26.260> so<00:05:26.440> good

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
I did have to change it to parts so good

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.000 
I did have to change it to parts so good
missus<00:05:27.280> stamina<00:05:27.760> we<00:05:28.419> got<00:05:28.599> I<00:05:28.870> don't<00:05:29.740> want<00:05:29.860> to

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
missus stamina we got I don't want to

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.890 
missus stamina we got I don't want to
describe<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.639> parts<00:05:30.909> but<00:05:31.120> if<00:05:31.539> you<00:05:31.630> see<00:05:31.750> that

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
describe the parts but if you see that

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.330 
describe the parts but if you see that
part<00:05:32.139> on<00:05:32.289> top<00:05:32.669> then<00:05:33.669> you're<00:05:34.210> in<00:05:34.389> stamina<00:05:34.780> mode

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
part on top then you're in stamina mode

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.700 
part on top then you're in stamina mode
but<00:05:36.340> then<00:05:36.550> if<00:05:36.639> we<00:05:36.699> switch<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.060> up<00:05:37.270> here<00:05:37.630> I<00:05:37.810> can

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
but then if we switch it up here I can

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.990 
but then if we switch it up here I can
pop<00:05:38.860> this<00:05:39.010> back<00:05:39.220> out<00:05:40.560> there<00:05:41.560> we<00:05:41.680> go

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.480 

like<00:05:46.650> so<00:05:49.020> okay<00:05:50.400> there<00:05:51.400> we<00:05:51.490> go<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:54.190> then<00:05:54.310> this

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
like so okay there we go and then this

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.409 
like so okay there we go and then this
would<00:05:54.669> be<00:05:54.789> attack<00:05:55.240> mode<00:05:56.159> where<00:05:57.330> it's<00:05:58.330> the

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
would be attack mode where it's the

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.080 
would be attack mode where it's the
design<00:05:58.690> as<00:05:58.840> you<00:05:58.930> can<00:05:59.050> see<00:05:59.229> here<00:05:59.789> so<00:06:00.789> I'm<00:06:00.970> gonna

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
design as you can see here so I'm gonna

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.850 
design as you can see here so I'm gonna
keep<00:06:01.240> it<00:06:01.330> in<00:06:01.419> stamina<00:06:01.690> mode<00:06:01.960> since<00:06:02.349> it<00:06:02.470> is<00:06:02.590> the

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
keep it in stamina mode since it is the
