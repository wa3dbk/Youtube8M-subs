00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.660
 I think you've been through this 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 situation 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.430
 want to go out with your bike to prepare 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.910
 if equipped and in the hour h 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.910
 to start 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.590
 Where is the battery unfortunately? 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.779
 motorcycle rider only remembers the importance of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.269
 maintenance of your motorcycle battery in the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.520
 moment of a break but know that keeping 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.500
 the battery in order and even increase 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.190
 its useful life does not require much 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.440
 job 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.110
 according to experts the durability 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.960
 of this important component of your bike 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.390
 average of three years of life if it is 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.899
 sealed type and one year if it is of the type 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.899
 conventional 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.410
 and attention to installation 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.620
 trackers and alarms is not well done 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.870
 current may leak and the battery 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:12.390
 will not have the strength to make the engine give 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:15.870
 the start and place in the same borges 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:22.710
 several terminals the power leak is 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:25.560
 sure but then what to do if you 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.340
 uses his motorcycle only at the end of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.470
 week 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 know that the ideal is not to leave the stop 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.630
 for a long time because it runs at least 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.970
 five kilometers a day can extend 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.880
 the battery life for up to four 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:44.070
 years in the case of traps stopped motorcycles 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.350
 more than three months have already shown signs of 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.540
 fatigue and worth noting that it is more 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.790
 cheap to follow some advice than 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.759
 having to change for a new battery 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.800
 let's go to them if the stop is inevitable 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.020
 for a long time how does a piece of 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.539
 rubber or wood at rest 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.880
 side or on the center stand if your 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.130
 motorcycle is that these pieces of iron or 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.310
 steel creates a current in contact with the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.050
 ground and in this contact the energy will 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.030
 dissipate slowly 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.840
 Now, if you're gonna stay for a long time. 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.730
 disconnect the battery cables 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.460
 only answer disconnect first-cable 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.700
 negative and then the positive so that 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.060
 a positive short has always occurred 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.819
 a protective rubber cap for 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.900
 mount makes the reverse first positive and 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.900
 then the negative 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.040
 the terminals may be 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.800
 Oxidation to oxidation occurs with 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.350
 navabi has not received any gifts yet 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.560
 then clean with warm water and 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.960
 firmly reinsert any blends 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.830
 such as oil or honey to avoid 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.830
 this oxidation 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.920
 in winter your attention should be 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.560
 redoubled as oil becomes more 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.470
 thick because of the ambient temperature 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:26.190
 the motor will require more battery power 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.080
 to make it spin and if it is to travel do 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.989
 an inspection in the workshop of your trust 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.330
 to know if the battery is good 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.970
 recharged and if there is no current leakage 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.760
 in a specialist workshop we can 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.760
 test and promote proper recharge 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.349
 remembering that your battery depends 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.069
 too much of the load system of your 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.500
 moto 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.849
 in this case specifically it will not 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.849
 never carry
