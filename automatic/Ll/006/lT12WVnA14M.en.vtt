00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello guys how are we health in 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.450
 line today we are going to open how to update 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.740
 that poster because then they have problems 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.960
 to login to what the game is in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.420
 several 4 today in general it would seem that 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.850
 jay's servers hate them and they 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.699
 terminate the connections but before 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.609
 install with booster let's make sure 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.189
 we do this or do the following 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.140
 let's leave our session we 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.630
 we left our session in the neighborhood 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.270
 log we enter again and here I already have 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.370
 my data captured blah blah blah 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.250
 email my password that obviously never 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.860
 I will teach you gentlemen and we will 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.379
 Try again to enter 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.270
 servers in case there is not 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 functioned to that it gives us case that there is not 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.860
 worked that then we're going to 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.870
 Update pong booster in two ways 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.910
 number one the two are considered 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.690
 manual but there is one shorter than the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.130
 another one the longest is to go to event 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.949
 balance 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:08.190
 to this dotcom balance we enter and here 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.170
 You are on the page as punk booster 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.930
 what we are going to do we are going to click on 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.570
 here in download pib and setup 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.670
 let's see this let's find our 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.130
 version usually this is done in 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.190
 windows let's click here for 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.600
 windows game we expected it to come back and 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.070
 We hope we return a code and 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.020
 then we get this page from 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.850
 security let's put the letters that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.710
 he asks us are always different letters 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.440
 to check that you 're not a dog or 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.229
 a cat obviously we are going to give you this 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.290
 code and we will click on download 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.869
 now since we are not there since we have 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.000
 given click we are going to download a 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.360
 small zip file that we are going to have 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.060
 to open but then we have the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.399
 file and let's make a new 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.570
 folder let's put the name of the 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.940
 typical name that we are going to put 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.240
 always to everything clear that yes like that 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.320
 we do not open it and we put here the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.060
 program or you can place it 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.110
 directly on the desk without any 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.119
 problem 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.660
 you're going to grab, you're going to click right and 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.440
 you will click on execute as 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.530
 administrator 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.420
 a contract appears on the screen 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.550
 obviously we are going to click on that if 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.540
 we agree with the contract we are going to 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.460
 send a notice to tell us that you are going to 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.710
 update to the latest version and 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.640
 then this may take a while 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.560
 but he's going to get this little screen out to me 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.990
 it took me about two minutes when 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.390
 I got the screen out so do not have 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.040
 fear and do not hurry obviously I do not know 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.170
 what has been happening lately with 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.810
 booster button but has been doing it 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.580
 been exhibiting that behavior so 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.720
 well since we're here we 're going to give it 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.940
 click here on this button and let's go 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.620
 to find the game that we 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.690
 obviously all these games are interested 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.430
 are supported for the pong booster and 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.820
 let's click on the one that we 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.660
 interesting in my case is several thousand four 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:10.600
 ready to this several 4 and here it says to you in 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.490
 where it was installed had game in die 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.920
 if it was not true, you give it 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.710
 here navigate and you go to the place where 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.600
 is installing since we do not have as well as 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.630
 the game that you wanted to impose 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.240
 you are going to give in up 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.050
 since they tell game is going to start 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:32.620
 look for the updates come out 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:35.940
 as you can see it is going down 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.060
 ivory things and 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.190
 in English working 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.010
 to have to wait for this whole process 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.080
 there are times that it starts automatically 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.030
 and there are times that you have to 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.010
 do manually what he did was in 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.160
 given if the program has 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.380
 wanted to do it automatically in 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.380
 previous versions your selected 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.050
 the neighborhood and you click on check 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.269
 update very well that is one of the 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.140
 manual ways or that this way long 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.550
 the short way is that I have to say 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.050
 all the ways because late or 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.390
 early you will have to try each one 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.910
 of them and then we're going to do the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.840
 second the second passive version that is 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:23.010
 go to what is the hard drive and go to 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.470
 find the route where a 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:31.169
 game in this case this files from 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:33.630
 program x86 origin game mario fill 4 and 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.169
 here you get this little program that 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.210
 is psv that we are going to click here 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.639
 to run as administrator click 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.069
 right we should know that if the 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.879
 screen is coming out and here is 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:51.460
 let's put what is install or 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.810
 reinstall the punk booster service 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.180
 let's click on next 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.270
 let's click here on the agreement 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.580
 that is going to start checking all the 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.840
 services very well since we have 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.360
 drying we are going to click on next 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.560
 and will see how things are in a 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.720
 case that was not installed by a 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.720
 poster will install it 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.050
 very well we are still waiting 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:32.819
 and he says he's ready now that's how he 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.690
 install is so guys like that have the 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:38.789
 way to update pong booster there is no 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.770
 another way to do it is a little bit 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.199
 complicated I think the easiest would be 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.120
 the second part the where we're going 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.400
 to locate the file name and we're going to 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.110
 click and run as administrator 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.970
 right click digital as administrator 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.319
 and that's the way one 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.819
 update pong booster nothing else 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.490
 I remember that he has been half slow in 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:59.550
 these days and the updates could 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.949
 take them a little bit so I hope that 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.180
 these tips of is has served as something 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.340
 for those who have problems with 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.440
 your pong booster and every time there is a 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.360
 detail on servers that do not 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.509
 let in they are going to have to do this 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.220
 same always and this has happened since now 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.680
 it's been a long time since this happened 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.150
 but those are the steps to follow 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.240
 I can enter servers well it's something 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.129
 of my session and introduction again and 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.710
 if that does not work, then update 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:27.900
 I put astro ok it 's a bit pathetic to have 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.460
 that depend on another program but so 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.560
 is how these guys work I hope that 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.210

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.540
 they still have problems between 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.190
 servers and anything we are in 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.930
