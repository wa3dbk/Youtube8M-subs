00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.440
 At dawn in the early morning, the mother was dressing up: 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.880
 "Go, daughter, look for fate" - so she told me. 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:43.040
 "Go to the bottom and dress, look for fate, develop." 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:54.740
 "Come on, lady, and dress, look for fate, develop." 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.340
 And I'll go into the world that my mother said; 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.120
 I find the will, the power and the fate that the Earth has given. 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:20.560
 And I will go and sing my fate to develop! 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:32.720
 And I will go and sing my fate to develop! 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:56.780
 And I will go and sing my fate to develop! 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.480
 And I will carry hands to the heavens to pray, 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.920
 For my family, I will beg for God in the land of Ukraine: 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 "Give God the light will to develop our destiny!" " 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:34.460
 Give God the light will to develop our destiny! 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:45.760
 Give God the light will to develop our destiny! 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.820
 Our Will! 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.640
 Our Fate !!!
