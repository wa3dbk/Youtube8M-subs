viewpoint

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.480 

I<00:01:25.660> say<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.780> open<00:01:27.050> fives<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.650> do<00:01:28.130> run<00:01:28.340> these

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
I say the open fives you do run these

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.310 
I say the open fives you do run these
events<00:01:28.760> in<00:01:28.940> pretty<00:01:29.150> much<00:01:29.210> all<00:01:29.480> weathers<00:01:29.870> so

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320
