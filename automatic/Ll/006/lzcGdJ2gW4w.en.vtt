I<00:00:37.879> first<00:00:38.090> came<00:00:38.300> out<00:00:38.449> but<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:39.710> ratios<00:00:40.160> were

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.470 
some reason I don't I don't know why I'm
hoping<00:00:48.019> that<00:00:48.079> that's<00:00:48.410> not<00:00:48.679> necessarily<00:00:49.100> case

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
hoping that that's not necessarily case

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.209 
hoping that that's not necessarily case
but<00:00:50.480> because<00:00:50.719> I<00:00:50.809> only<00:00:50.960> opened<00:00:51.140> like<00:00:51.589> I<00:00:51.829> don't

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
but because I only opened like I don't

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.319 
but because I only opened like I don't
remember<00:00:52.309> exactly<00:00:52.550> what<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:52.910> was<00:00:52.969> two<00:00:53.239> or

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
remember exactly what it was two or

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.000

three<00:00:53.480> boxes<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:53.989> know<00:00:54.050> in<00:00:54.230> one<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.559> boxes<00:00:54.679> I

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
three boxes I know in one of the boxes I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.130 
three boxes I know in one of the boxes I
didn't<00:00:55.190> even<00:00:55.249> get<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.460> secret<00:00:55.929> it's<00:00:56.929> kind<00:00:57.050> of
