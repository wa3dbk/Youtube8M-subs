being<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.220> cell<00:00:23.490> phone<00:00:23.699> obviously<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.330> video

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
being a cell phone obviously the video

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.269 
being a cell phone obviously the video
quality<00:00:24.840> isn't<00:00:25.350> great<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:25.890> I'm<00:00:25.980> sure<00:00:26.010> you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
quality isn't great and as I'm sure you

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.859 
quality isn't great and as I'm sure you
picked<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.880> audio<00:00:27.060> quality<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.779> this

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
picked up the audio quality on this

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.890 
picked up the audio quality on this
thing<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.230> not<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.680> good<00:00:28.769> at<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.869> but<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
thing is not very good at all but I

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
thing is not very good at all but I
think<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.619> fairly<00:00:31.890> suitable<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> cell

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
think it's fairly suitable for a cell

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
think it's fairly suitable for a cell

detailed tests using different areas of
by<00:00:37.739> Rome<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.030> now<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.480> are

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
by Rome as you can see right now we are

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.569 
by Rome as you can see right now we are
looking<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.320> white<00:00:40.680> raw<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.219> darker

looking at a white raw with darker

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.490 
looking at a white raw with darker
electronics<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.390> front<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.230> we'll<00:00:43.350> see

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
electronics in front of it so we'll see

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
electronics in front of it so we'll see
how<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.620> handles<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.129> contrast<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.180> now

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
how it handles that contrast and now

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.229 
how it handles that contrast and now
we're<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> look<00:00:46.520> directly<00:00:47.520> into<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
we're going to look directly into a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.459 
we're going to look directly into a
light<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.410> how<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> does<00:00:51.350> that's<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> very

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
light and see how it does that's a very

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.990 
light and see how it does that's a very
difficult<00:00:52.829> shop<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.370> any<00:00:53.489> camera<00:00:53.760> right

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
difficult shop for any camera right

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
difficult shop for any camera right
there<00:00:54.110> now<00:00:55.110> we're<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> look<00:00:55.559> into<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
there now we're going to look into a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
there now we're going to look into a
computer<00:00:56.640> monitor<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.570> portable<00:00:57.840> or

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
computer monitor and that is portable or

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.569 
computer monitor and that is portable or
not<00:00:58.410> issues<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> support<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.340> art<00:00:59.489> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
not issues that support of a art so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.840 
not issues that support of a art so
that's<00:00:59.730> ixtapa<00:01:00.149> mexico<00:01:01.460> now<00:01:02.460> let's<00:01:02.640> take<00:01:02.789> a

see<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.920> i'm<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.210> kind<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.390> middle<00:01:06.510> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
see here i'm a kind of in the middle of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.950 
see here i'm a kind of in the middle of
my<00:01:06.720> late<00:01:07.380> spring<00:01:07.830> cleaning<00:01:08.630> up<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:09.869> bit

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
to be a little bit jerky which could be

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.410 
to be a little bit jerky which could be
expected<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:28.130> well<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.759> out<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.119> cell

the window see it's kind of a cloudy day
and<00:01:41.310> i<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.759> dirty<00:01:41.939> window<00:01:43.970> see

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
and i have kind of a dirty window see

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
and i have kind of a dirty window see
what<00:01:45.090> handles<00:01:45.360> there<00:01:45.540> now<00:01:46.320> we're<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
what handles there now we're going to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
what handles there now we're going to
walk<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> an<00:01:47.640> area<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.149> brighter

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
walk in here to an area that's brighter

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.789 
walk in here to an area that's brighter
and<00:01:48.899> has<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> lot<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.439> contrast<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.220> lot<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.579> color
