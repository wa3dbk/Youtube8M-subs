00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.859
 find parents tell you about your 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.299
 chronic just a little wink 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.740
 because it's your first chronicle 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.190
 what are we waiting for since you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.949
 can not but just a guy 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.779
 yeah I tired but I've learned since 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.070
 several years certain some 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.930
 stuff some little things that have me 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.800
 helped increase my level of vitality 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.150
 who have an energy 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.880
 that 's what I 'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.130
 people it succeeds elbows we will go to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.960
 through the storm of little sleep I 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.149
 tell me that maybe z at home 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 if you have one of the groups went well 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.399
 busy busy or little agendas 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.960
 matter the level of energy in life 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.600
 quite so much if not 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 because today in our period 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.379
 modern unfortunately it's very 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.860
 sad but we dig our time with 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.440
 it's true but if it's now 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.430
 a generalized male and I thought I 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.199
 however, I want to share today 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.879
 two three tips point to help you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.469
 increase your energy level 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.329
 but first of all I get up share 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.530
 basic knowledge at the dock by 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.149
 relation to health place and not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.830
 things with no concepts with 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.540
 opinions and positions 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.890
 okay scientific facts and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.299
 tangling press very close to the docks 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.260
 okay so the first charge of 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.090
 ask a question is what you know that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.220
 is what constitutes the human body in 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.280
 much of the main material of the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.770
 human body of water what percentage to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.700
 your costs no it's not true you were 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.920
 not far anyway 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.600
 we say that the body is formed between 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 70 and 75% water ok I stop when we 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.920
 think of these gigantic the senate waltz 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.500
 three quarters of the human body 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
 made of water and so the first thing 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.979
 that I share with sex people often 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.500
 says when we are tired we have 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.450
 migraines it hurts our joints little 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.009
 it does not even matter how hungry it is 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.500
 not really finally we imagine that we 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.020
 hungry because you are dehydrated 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.060
 it's a widespread societal sickness have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.860
 beautiful pass of water so so the first 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.470
 basic concept has increased its level 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.850
 of energy learns to drink a little bit 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.500
 more of the moment there it is that the in 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.820
 the holidays should drink two liters and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 half to 3 liters of water per year 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.229
 it's really gigantic me I you 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.909
 please arrange for water 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.590
 especially do not know it's not great 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.270
 inspiring 4 said like that but you can 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.200
 namely s' were dehydrated by 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.420
 color of your urine 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.280
 the more these people she is dehydrated more 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.470
 is clear plus it's worth your affable 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.209
 good access I was working a stanza 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.709
 florian well of my coach in these 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.690
 feeding tips a thing that 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.950
 told me it's a glass of water on waking 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.420
 first thing to learn by getting 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.670
 waking up in the morning is anvers so 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.540
 more than this gesture I hope that time 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.400
 to talk to you about it in the end I'm going to 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.989
 talk about the ph of the human body bad in itself 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.989
 but I was talking about doctor fuhrmann 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.970
 leaving a large specialist 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.440
 doctor of health in the united states who 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.209
 recognized him for his work at the 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.810
 of the human system and management in 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.190
 high level well yes immune she I 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.720
 was looking for kom ombo I was going to get there 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.430
 same thing that you 're going to be holding strong 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.110
 in the immune system and he 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.150
 obviously his specialty is to help 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.819
 people to prevent diseases and he has 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.890
 concocted a list of the most 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.700
 beneficial and the most toxic for 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.780
 the Greek human being 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.640
 today I released the five 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.709
 best the five countries who say that 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.630
 we then have that number one this 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.980
 are green leafy vegetables 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.500
 the crisis is what you're not right of 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.209
 better in the world for your body obviously 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.890
 do not go into the history of GMOs 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.959
 pesticides and insecticides 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.160
 I will finish more than the organic products of 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.750
 those who are significantly better but 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.489
 just starting to eat vegetables 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.720
 large makes a big difference to 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.220
 first the second ones are the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.440
 leafless greens as per 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.079
 example the broccoli gyula the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.660
 third it's the beat it be so 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.150
 fresh blueberries raspberry and treated with 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.970
 berry bed in fourth one does not read 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.200
 five ok unfortunately that there is a 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.090
 side effect to eat faults 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.829
 pro just to be together but it smells 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.380
 health too and then finally the 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.730
 ok mushrooms for bny reason I 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.690
 will go through and so the pressure on 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.850
 happens in the five 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.230
 Yes - well, I say to you before I do 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.579

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.109
 already but will send no but I can not 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.340
 albeit all that the first father 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.090
 most toxic foods for 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.049
 the body 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.609
 the unsold ice cream is sad and 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.730
 yes it's risky if you want it 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.019
 the image 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.280
 trans fats so so all that is 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.750
 crazy crazy ii are all told beauty 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.819
 things like that the bugs 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.280
 the company adobe nitrites joke 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.650
 mitrac there of a viscera of animals to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.910
 deserved study to eat that I did not 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.669
 ate that in life and then finally 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.390
 fried foods so these are the countries 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.530
 the best things 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.530
 me what I'm telling you for example by 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.700
 report to sausset do not fool me crazy 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.930
 I think at one point the momentum 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.580
 wearing this is my ultimate thing it's 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.470
 to learn to zigzag that is to say 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.150
 you have an ultimate goal that health 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.440
 to be healthy but you have to be 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.910
 able to allow you to eat 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.260
