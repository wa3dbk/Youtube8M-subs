00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello everyone, I'm John today 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.069
 we will start talking a little about 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.740
 difference and how to recognize one 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.849
 stem from a root the first stages of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.160
 development 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.859
 we will talk for now as always about 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.199
 phalenopsis then there is to say that much 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.869
 often especially when they are still 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.210
 so very small indeed 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.939
 the very first stages of development is difficult 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.550
 say if what is growing is one 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.080
 stem or a root 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.120
 many say that the stems do 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 they recognize why they come out between the armpits 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 of the leaves but in reality I have seen 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 some roots come out foreign among the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.629
 axils of the leaves so not always 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.460
 some people still apply as a rule 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.530
 maybe they are a beginner with 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.789
 orchids and maybe they only have one 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.289
 orchid for them is difficult 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.030
 recognize a new stem from a root 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.449
 even once they are already a little longer 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.829
 developed are facebook groups 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.550
 orchids what a passion I recommend 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.040
 often one day I found a post where 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.220
 one person asked if those in the picture 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.799
 they were stems or roots and the photo was mine 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.020
 notice it's really pretty one why not 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.110
 I had never seen roots that live 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.479
 treated as styles and two because it shows 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.119
 just that sometimes it's not like that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.270
 discounted for everyone to recognize 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.400
 differences between root stars I put the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.369
 photo on the video and as you can see 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.689
 there is an airy root rooted as if 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.700
 it was a stem 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.460
 and it is precisely for this reason that in the video of 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.900
 today I would like to concentrate mainly 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.820
 on the roots 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.770
 maybe already a little pushed for growth 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.110
 let us take these roots as an example 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.610
 as you can see we have the pinnacle 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.070
 growing of a beautiful green 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.829
 brilliant but not always this 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.380
 coloring a few times at the apex can 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.750
 be darker or inside the vase too 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.750
 more clear, however, as we see clearly 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.390
 there is the difference 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.210
 of color between the growing apex 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.090
 the body of the root than on the stems 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.060
 there is no you can see that these roots 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.340
 they are waiting to go almost out 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.620
 from the vase and in another video we will talk 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.600
 of their aerial roots 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.490
 characteristics and maybe even of the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.830
 growth behavior they have 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.510
 phalenopsis roots in general 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.400
 now if we look at the photo I have 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.459
 shown at the beginning you can see the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.590
 similarity in the way of growing 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.680
 that is, we have a kind of ta headphones 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.110
 bright green and not seen as yes 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.500
 he sees well instead of the stems a little already 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.410
 developed nudes and say and also 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.290
 the slightly irregular apex should 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.630
 they almost see hints of 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.310
 small and buds we can say here 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.320
 Here is an example of a stem like I told you 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.780
 seen showing root styles already a little 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.720
 pushed into growth here as you can 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.209
 see there is a knot or rather two knots e 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.060
 look at the apex is completely different 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.880
 from that of the roots the root to some 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.450
 this regularity in growth and 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.450
 sometimes it is the growth apex e 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.750
 speckled with light specks now vi 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.549
 I show another photo instead in 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.840
 this case of a stem that has been 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.000
 published in these days in another 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.360
 group orchids wonder of the world 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.769
 however I leave the link of the groups in 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.910
 description also in this case the 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.519
 post question was stem now says e 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.640
 as we have already said in the videos when 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.549
 we see naked is definitely a stem there is 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.870
 really sure one hundred percent star 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.910
 one hundred percent 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.370
 now to finish but the more we will see so many 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.070
 other examples of star roots I make you 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.739
 quickly see something else a little 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.170
 less boost in growth and in my opinion 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.890
 after what we said and we have 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.720
 since you are already able to tell me what 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.850
 you see it 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.310
 we say that it is very simple even if there 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.840
 coloring of the growth apex 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.550
 in proxy with a bit reddish tip 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.310
 staked as I told you not always of 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.800
 a beautiful green 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.000
 many however it is easy to understand are 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.459
 of the roots 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.250
 now in this case as and 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.290
 will grow the tip will continue with 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.980
 this color until it stops 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:27.030
 the growth instead the back will take man 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.620
 hand a typical silver coloring from 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.150
 aerial root 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.010
 just like in the picture I took of you 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.470
 see at the beginning is that I do 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.560
 unfortunately I haven't seen again 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.490
 the post on facebook where this was 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.110
 photo 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.000
 I wanted to ask permission from 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.860
 owner to use it however little 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.930
 the opportunity now to thank you 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.270
 whoever you are because thanks to yours 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.370
 photo that I came up with to do 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.460
 this video and I also thank the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.310
 person of the orchid group wonder 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.910
 of the world for the photo on the stem plus the 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.530
 we will see other stems and other roots 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.650
 maybe we'll even do a video for the ones 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.560
 cd or however orchids comp siedo bulbi 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.440
 in that case we will see the difference between 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.210
 new pseudo bulbs and stems that 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.530
 it is usually the one in a while 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.940
 deceit with them 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.650
