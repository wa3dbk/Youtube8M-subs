scores you're going to come out to be
and<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.939> will<00:01:45.119> give<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.329> some<00:01:45.509> power<00:01:45.750> when

and this will give you some power when

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
and this will give you some power when
you're<00:01:46.280> bragging<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.520> friends<00:01:47.909> and

which one is invariably better of course
so<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:56.219> getting<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.490> good<00:01:56.640> idea<00:01:56.939> here<00:01:57.180> we

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
so it's getting a good idea here we

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.560 
so it's getting a good idea here we
should<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:58.200> seen<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.680> come<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.210> it<00:02:00.210> does<00:02:00.420> really

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
should be seen it come up it does really

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.420 
should be seen it come up it does really
matter<00:02:00.780> how<00:02:00.960> fast<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.469> process<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.920> program

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
matter how fast they process the program

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
matter how fast they process the program
themselves<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.659> really<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.049> comes<00:02:04.170> down<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
themselves it really just comes down to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.930 
themselves it really just comes down to
what<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> program<00:02:05.340> scores<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.329> at<00:02:06.450> so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
what the program scores them at so

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.760 
what the program scores them at so
this<00:02:07.150> is<00:02:07.300> in<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.540> matter<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.810> who<00:02:08.380> gets<00:02:08.530> there

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
this is in a matter of who gets there

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.940 
this is in a matter of who gets there
first<00:02:08.800> now<00:02:09.869> 3206<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> score<00:02:11.530> we're<00:02:11.710> seeing

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
first now 3206 is a score we're seeing

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.430 
first now 3206 is a score we're seeing
on<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.400> samsung<00:02:12.970> s4<00:02:13.270> I've<00:02:13.720> seen<00:02:14.050> its<00:02:14.200> core

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
on the samsung s4 I've seen its core

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.060 
on the samsung s4 I've seen its core
much<00:02:14.650> higher<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.470> sometimes<00:02:17.830> just

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
much higher so you know sometimes just

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.410 
much higher so you know sometimes just
varies<00:02:18.460> there's<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> whole<00:02:18.910> lot<00:02:19.030> going<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
varies there's a whole lot going in the

this<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> kind<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.380> lower<00:02:23.620> score<00:02:23.860> actually

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
this is a kind of a lower score actually

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.130 
this is a kind of a lower score actually
for<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> HTC<00:02:25.030> one<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.540> normally<00:02:25.630> see

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
for the HTC one that I normally see

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.770 
for the HTC one that I normally see
normally<00:02:26.830> see<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.070> in<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.250> 2700<00:02:28.060> s<00:02:28.270> but

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
normally see this in the 2700 s but

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.340 
normally see this in the 2700 s but
there's<00:02:29.020> almost<00:02:29.290> 500<00:02:30.870> difference<00:02:31.870> between

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
there's almost 500 difference between

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.470 
there's almost 500 difference between
these<00:02:32.710> two<00:02:32.770> phones<00:02:33.310> which<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.120> really<00:02:34.300> weird

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
these two phones which is really weird

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.060 
these two phones which is really weird
because<00:02:34.720> they're<00:02:35.050> not<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.350> far<00:02:35.590> apart<00:02:35.680> when

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
because they're not that far apart when

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.490 
because they're not that far apart when
it<00:02:36.160> comes<00:02:36.370> down<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:37.270> processor<00:02:37.630> speed<00:02:37.690> so

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
it comes down to the processor speed so

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.610 
it comes down to the processor speed so
for<00:02:39.190> fun<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:40.090> games<00:02:40.570> let's<00:02:41.080> go<00:02:41.260> ahead<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.500> try

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
for fun in games let's go ahead and try

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.980 
for fun in games let's go ahead and try
them<00:02:41.830> again<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.990> see<00:02:44.950> if<00:02:44.980> we<00:02:45.160> get<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:46.480> second

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
them again and see if we get this second

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.630 
them again and see if we get this second
time<00:02:47.140> around<00:02:47.170> see<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.040> maybe<00:02:48.190> we<00:02:48.250> get<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.460> better

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
time around see if maybe we get a better

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.340 
time around see if maybe we get a better

score but the android phones there's a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.480 
score but the android phones there's a
million<00:02:50.560> things<00:02:50.710> going<00:02:50.950> on<00:02:51.310> in<00:02:51.430> the

million things going on in the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
background and everything else you try

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.880 
background and everything else you try
and<00:02:55.030> turn<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.270> much<00:02:55.450> as<00:02:55.630> if<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:56.110> down<00:02:56.650> or

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890

and turn as much as if you can down or
off<00:02:57.070> but<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.910> know<00:02:58.570> these<00:02:58.840> files<00:02:59.050> are<00:02:59.140> crazy

everything<00:03:04.240> else<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.690> let's<00:03:05.320> see<00:03:05.560> how<00:03:05.590> we<00:03:05.800> come

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
everything else so let's see how we come

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.470 
everything else so let's see how we come
out<00:03:06.130> with<00:03:06.280> our<00:03:06.430> second<00:03:06.790> time<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> scores

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
out with our second time of the scores

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.380 
out with our second time of the scores
and<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:08.290> course<00:03:08.530> up<00:03:09.250> 3<00:03:11.280> 2014<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.459> samsung

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
and of course up 3 2014 the samsung

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.430 
and of course up 3 2014 the samsung
galaxy<00:03:13.810> s4<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.940> looks<00:03:15.940> like<00:03:16.120> with<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.840> HTC

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
galaxy s4 and looks like with the HTC

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.710 
galaxy s4 and looks like with the HTC
One<00:03:18.660> we're<00:03:19.660> going<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.870> come<00:03:20.170> out<00:03:20.410> at<00:03:21.239> 26<00:03:22.239> 34

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
One we're going to come out at 26 34

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.920 
One we're going to come out at 26 34
much<00:03:23.200> lower<00:03:23.440> okay<00:03:24.010> well<00:03:24.190> interesting<00:03:24.459> so<00:03:25.420> just

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
much lower okay well interesting so just

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.380 
much lower okay well interesting so just
for<00:03:26.080> fun<00:03:26.320> let's<00:03:26.560> take<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.430> go<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.910> antutu

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
for fun let's take and go to the antutu

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.250 
for fun let's take and go to the antutu
benchmark<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.530> see<00:03:29.890> how<00:03:30.100> both<00:03:30.700> these<00:03:30.910> phones

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
benchmark and see how both these phones

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.460 
benchmark and see how both these phones
did<00:03:32.260> on<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.709> antutu<00:03:33.220> benchmark<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.600> let's

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
did on the antutu benchmark so let's

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.680 
did on the antutu benchmark so let's
take<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.709> look<00:03:36.040> at<00:03:36.160> that<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:37.300> is<00:03:37.450> another

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
take a look at that this is another

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.259 
take a look at that this is another
popular<00:03:38.340> benchmarking<00:03:39.340> app<00:03:39.580> that<00:03:40.000> we<00:03:40.120> can

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
popular benchmarking app that we can

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.259 
popular benchmarking app that we can
take<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.480> look<00:03:40.780> at<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.489> doing<00:03:42.519> will<00:03:43.090> be

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
take a look at and in so doing will be

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.530 
take a look at and in so doing will be
able<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.510> figure<00:03:43.780> out<00:03:44.340> maybe<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.820> trueness<00:03:46.300> to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
able to figure out maybe the trueness to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.570 
able to figure out maybe the trueness to
the<00:03:46.630> nature<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.019> how<00:03:47.650> fast<00:03:48.010> each<00:03:48.340> of<00:03:48.489> these

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
the nature of how fast each of these

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.470 
the nature of how fast each of these
devices<00:03:49.030> truly<00:03:50.019> are<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:50.980> in<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.220> end<00:03:51.480> 22

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
devices truly are so in the end 22
