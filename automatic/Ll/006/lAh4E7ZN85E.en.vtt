00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
okay guys this video is going to just

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.839 
okay guys this video is going to just
kind<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.660> give<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.839> guys<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.020> quick<00:00:07.519> show<00:00:08.519> on

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
kind of give you guys a quick show on

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.240 
kind of give you guys a quick show on
how<00:00:11.540> Eric<00:00:12.540> from<00:00:12.690> rising<00:00:12.900> rpms<00:00:13.440> intake

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
how Eric from rising rpms intake

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.790 
how Eric from rising rpms intake
manifold<00:00:14.700> adapter<00:00:15.120> works<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.230> what<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.590> get

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
manifold adapter works and what you get

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.250 
manifold adapter works and what you get
with<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.100> when<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.520> order<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.810> this<00:00:18.810> adapter

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
with it when you order it this adapter

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.060 
with it when you order it this adapter
allows<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.770> run<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.160> third<00:00:20.520> generation

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
allows you to run a third generation

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.359 
allows you to run a third generation
upper<00:00:23.070> intake<00:00:23.460> manifold<00:00:24.380> on<00:00:25.380> either<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.890> series

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
upper intake manifold on either a series

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.040 
upper intake manifold on either a series
4<00:00:26.580> or<00:00:26.789> series<00:00:27.180> 5<00:00:27.390> lower<00:00:28.140> intake<00:00:28.470> manifold

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
4 or series 5 lower intake manifold

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.730 
4 or series 5 lower intake manifold
basically<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.260> order<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.529> you're<00:00:31.650> going

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
basically when you order it you're going

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.280 
basically when you order it you're going
to<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:33.079> aluminum<00:00:34.079> spacer<00:00:35.059> that<00:00:36.059> has<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
to get the aluminum spacer that has the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.530 
to get the aluminum spacer that has the
transitions<00:00:38.100> already<00:00:39.059> machined<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.570> them

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
transitions already machined into them

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.299 
transitions already machined into them
which<00:00:42.540> allows<00:00:42.920> obviously<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.070> smooth

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
which allows obviously for smooth

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.520 
which allows obviously for smooth
transition<00:00:44.879> between<00:00:45.030> these<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.050> manifolds

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
transition between these two manifolds

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.819 
transition between these two manifolds
because<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> holes<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:48.230> intake<00:00:49.230> port<00:00:49.649> holes

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
because the holes the intake port holes

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.229 
because the holes the intake port holes
are<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> little<00:00:50.160> bit<00:00:50.340> different<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:50.969> far<00:00:51.059> as

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
are a little bit different as far as

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.630 
are a little bit different as far as
their<00:00:51.420> spacing<00:00:51.840> between<00:00:51.960> each<00:00:52.230> other<00:00:52.640> you're

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
their spacing between each other you're

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.900 
their spacing between each other you're
also<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> get<00:00:54.120> four<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:55.800> these<00:00:56.370> offset

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
also going to get four of these offset

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.049 
also going to get four of these offset
studs<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> holes<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.969> when<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
studs because the holes here when you

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.599 
studs because the holes here when you
bolt<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.359> manifold<00:01:00.809> down<00:01:01.100> are<00:01:02.100> different

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
bolt this manifold down are different

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.700 
bolt this manifold down are different
than<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> holes<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:04.369> FC<00:01:05.369> manifolds<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
than the holes on the FC manifolds so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.320 
than the holes on the FC manifolds so
these<00:01:07.710> studs<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> said<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
these studs like I said they have a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.350 
these studs like I said they have a
little<00:01:09.540> offset<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.830> tell<00:01:11.360> so

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
little offset there if you can tell so

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
little offset there if you can tell so
you<00:01:12.810> install<00:01:13.200> them<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:14.970> way<00:01:16.100> they're<00:01:17.100> all

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you install them that way they're all

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.440 
you install them that way they're all
labeled<00:01:18.740> on<00:01:19.740> I'll<00:01:20.729> show<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.939> guys<00:01:21.090> our<00:01:21.180> liquid

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
labeled on I'll show you guys our liquid

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.830 
labeled on I'll show you guys our liquid
on<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> other<00:01:21.810> side<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:23.130> says<00:01:23.189> s5<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.880> 4s<00:01:24.479> five

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
on the other side it says s5 I 4s five

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.539 
on the other side it says s5 I 4s five
because<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.590> an<00:01:25.680> s5<00:01:26.009> lower<00:01:26.280> intake

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
because I have an s5 lower intake

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.569 
because I have an s5 lower intake
manifold<00:01:26.970> series<00:01:27.540> five<00:01:27.720> inner<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.460> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
manifold series five inner and which is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.670 
manifold series five inner and which is
these<00:01:29.729> two<00:01:29.939> inner<00:01:30.150> studs<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:30.720> these<00:01:31.470> one

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
these two inner studs here these one

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.510 
these two inner studs here these one
says<00:01:31.890> say<00:01:32.369> s<00:01:32.750> 504<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.780> outer<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:37.520> basically

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
says say s 504 the outer and basically

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.920 
says say s 504 the outer and basically
you<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.850> thread<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.210> down<00:01:41.630> when<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.750> do

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
you just thread that down when you do

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.679 
you just thread that down when you do
put<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.229> down<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.740> final<00:01:44.210> for<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
put this down for the final for the you

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
put this down for the final for the you
know<00:01:45.780> final<00:01:46.380> fit<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.619> finish<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.860> everything

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
know final fit and finish and everything

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.319 
know final fit and finish and everything
you<00:01:47.250> also<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.520> me<00:01:47.579> put<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> gasket<00:01:48.060> down

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
you also see me put the gasket down

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.490 
you also see me put the gasket down
before<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.600> put<00:01:48.720> these<00:01:48.810> studs<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.259> because

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
before you put these studs on because

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.980 
before you put these studs on because
the<00:01:49.590> gasket<00:01:49.950> will<00:01:49.979> not<00:01:50.189> fit<00:01:50.369> over<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> studs

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
the gasket will not fit over the studs

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.359 
the gasket will not fit over the studs
but<00:01:51.990> I'm<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.200> showing<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.500> guys<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:53.189> for

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
but I'm just showing you guys here for

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.649 
but I'm just showing you guys here for
all<00:01:53.430> intents<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.820> purposes<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.479> quick

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
all intents and purposes just a quick

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.770 
all intents and purposes just a quick
video<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.290> how<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.649> goes<00:01:55.740> together<00:01:56.780> so

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
video of how it goes together so

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.999 
video of how it goes together so
basically<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.799> wrench

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
basically they don't have to be wrench

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.410 
basically they don't have to be wrench
tight<00:01:59.250> when<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.549> put<00:01:59.700> these<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.850> because<00:02:00.240> you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
tight when you put these on because you

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.550 
tight when you put these on because you
are<00:02:00.479> gonna<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.930> tweak<00:02:01.170> them<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> little

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
are gonna have to tweak them a little

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.709 
are gonna have to tweak them a little
bit<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:01.860> they're<00:02:02.250> offset<00:02:02.520> obviously<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
bit because they're offset obviously and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.709 
bit because they're offset obviously and
those<00:02:04.399> need<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.490> fit<00:02:05.670> inside<00:02:05.909> these<00:02:06.450> holes

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
those need to fit inside these holes

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.820 
those need to fit inside these holes
that<00:02:07.020> he<00:02:07.140> has<00:02:07.259> made<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:08.090> so

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
that he has made here so

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.200 
that he has made here so
it'll<00:02:11.250> slide<00:02:11.700> on<00:02:11.940> here<00:02:14.870> basically<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.410> you

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
it'll slide on here basically and you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.340 
it'll slide on here basically and you
among<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.330> four<00:02:18.510> studs<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.900> also<00:02:19.020> comes<00:02:19.290> with

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
among the four studs it also comes with

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.140 
among the four studs it also comes with
a<00:02:19.500> center<00:02:19.800> stud<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:23.730> don't<00:02:23.850> have<00:02:23.970> to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
a center stud here so you don't have to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.030 
a center stud here so you don't have to
use<00:02:24.300> your<00:02:24.450> factory<00:02:24.960> bolt<00:02:25.260> anymore<00:02:25.740> obviously

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
use your factory bolt anymore obviously

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.170 
use your factory bolt anymore obviously
you<00:02:26.130> can't<00:02:26.340> use<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.580> because<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:26.850> not<00:02:27.000> long

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you can't use it because it's not long

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.830 
you can't use it because it's not long
enough<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:30.090> once<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.480> them<00:02:30.570> all<00:02:30.630> lined

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
enough but once you get them all lined

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:45.200 
enough but once you get them all lined
up<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.650> should<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.950> course<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.520> take<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.970> video

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
up it should of course I take the video

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.660 
up it should of course I take the video
don't<00:02:45.630> want<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.810> work<00:02:45.960> oh<00:02:48.950> there<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.040> go<00:02:50.190> so

don't want to work oh there we go so

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.160 
don't want to work oh there we go so
yeah<00:02:50.790> slides<00:02:51.300> down<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.660> there<00:02:51.750> perfectly<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:54.170> do

yeah slides down on there perfectly I do

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.140 
yeah slides down on there perfectly I do
want<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.560> point<00:02:55.770> out<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.220> not<00:02:56.400> gasket

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
want to point out I have not gasket

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.110 
want to point out I have not gasket

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
not but they're perfectly gasket matched

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.780 
not but they're perfectly gasket matched
there's<00:03:10.620> no<00:03:10.770> need<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:10.980> do<00:03:11.100> any<00:03:11.250> porting<00:03:11.670> on

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
there's no need to do any porting on

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.570 
there's no need to do any porting on
these<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.150> make<00:03:12.300> them<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.860> same<00:03:14.040> size<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
gaskets unlike the FD manifold which

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.850 
gaskets unlike the FD manifold which

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
does need to be gasket matched you can

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.440 
does need to be gasket matched you can
actually<00:03:23.010> see<00:03:23.430> from<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.790> residue<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.269> on

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
actually see from the residue that's on

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.400 
actually see from the residue that's on
here<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:27.600> space<00:03:27.870> between<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
here this is the space between the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.479 
here this is the space between the
gasket<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.540> manifold<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:31.489> actually

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
gasket and the manifold that actually

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.240 
gasket and the manifold that actually
could<00:03:32.640> be<00:03:32.810> ported<00:03:33.810> out

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
could be ported out

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.470 
could be ported out
so<00:03:35.250> there's<00:03:35.430> maybe<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:35.940> an<00:03:36.120> eighth<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.360> an

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
so there's maybe like an eighth of an

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.870 
so there's maybe like an eighth of an
inch<00:03:36.540> all<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.840> way<00:03:36.959> around<00:03:37.050> that<00:03:37.470> can<00:03:37.620> be

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
inch all the way around that can be

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.920 
inch all the way around that can be
poured<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:38.940> out<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.180> gasket<00:03:39.510> matching<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
poured it out for gasket matching the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.900 
poured it out for gasket matching the
adapter<00:03:43.500> already<00:03:43.680> has<00:03:43.950> been<00:03:44.280> gasket<00:03:44.730> matched

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
adapter already has been gasket matched

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.540 
adapter already has been gasket matched
so<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:46.620> don't<00:03:46.769> need<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.920> do<00:03:47.010> any<00:03:47.190> porting<00:03:47.489> to

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
so you don't need to do any porting to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.220 
so you don't need to do any porting to
this<00:03:47.670> or<00:03:47.850> anything<00:03:48.120> basically<00:03:48.780> install<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
this or anything basically install the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.310 
this or anything basically install the
studs<00:03:49.530> as<00:03:49.830> so<00:03:50.519> put<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.510> adapter<00:03:51.780> plate<00:03:52.080> on

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
studs as so put the adapter plate on

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.830 
studs as so put the adapter plate on
with<00:03:52.500> your<00:03:52.620> gaskets<00:03:54.200> just<00:03:55.200> slide<00:03:55.560> on<00:03:59.090> the<00:04:00.090> c6

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
with your gaskets just slide on the c6

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.290 
with your gaskets just slide on the c6
manifold<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.730> boom<00:04:03.239> there<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:05.150> all<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
manifold and boom there it is all the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.690

intake<00:04:06.570> ports<00:04:06.870> are<00:04:07.019> in<00:04:07.530> perfect<00:04:08.040> transition

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
intake ports are in perfect transition

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.370 
intake ports are in perfect transition
with<00:04:08.820> each<00:04:08.940> other<00:04:09.239> there's<00:04:09.690> no<00:04:09.810> machining<00:04:10.260> to

do other than some gasket matching with

do other than some gasket matching with

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.640 

I'm<00:04:17.910> not<00:04:18.359> really<00:04:18.510> sure<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.080> horsepower

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
I'm not really sure of the horsepower

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.170 
I'm not really sure of the horsepower
gains<00:04:20.100> you're<00:04:20.280> gonna<00:04:20.370> get<00:04:20.580> with<00:04:20.820> running<00:04:21.090> a

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
heard there was some guy that did some

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.170 
heard there was some guy that did some
flow<00:04:25.210> testing<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:26.620> showed<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.879> FT

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
flow testing that showed that the FT

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.059 
flow testing that showed that the FT
manifold<00:04:28.599> a<00:04:29.069> little<00:04:30.069> better<00:04:30.250> than<00:04:32.069> FC

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069 
manifold a little better than FC

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.490 
manifold a little better than FC
manifolds<00:04:33.669> but<00:04:34.090> I<00:04:34.300> have<00:04:34.539> yet<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.780> find<00:04:35.229> that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
manifolds but I have yet to find that

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.649 
manifolds but I have yet to find that
but<00:04:36.039> other<00:04:36.909> than<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.240> fact<00:04:37.419> that<00:04:37.479> they<00:04:37.629> I

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
but other than the fact that they I

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:38.999 
but other than the fact that they I
think<00:04:37.750> they<00:04:37.930> look<00:04:38.169> ten<00:04:38.379> times<00:04:38.409> better<00:04:38.680> than

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
think they look ten times better than

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.730 
think they look ten times better than
the<00:04:39.539> FC<00:04:40.539> manifold<00:04:40.960> so<00:04:41.259> I'm<00:04:41.319> just<00:04:41.590> going<00:04:41.710> to

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
the FC manifold so I'm just going to

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.309 
the FC manifold so I'm just going to

trust up the car a little bit once I get

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:50.610 
trust up the car a little bit once I get
them<00:04:44.409> all<00:04:44.500> powder-coated<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:47.020> can<00:04:47.229> order<00:04:49.620> you
