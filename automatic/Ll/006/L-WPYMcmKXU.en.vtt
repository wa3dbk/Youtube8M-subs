00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.300
 insomnia games studio desperately unlucky 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.029
 with shooters 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.079
 resistance series created exclusively 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 for playstation 3 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.939
 despite the best efforts of the developer and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.739
 the publisher never became a hit but the game 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.140
 about daredevils ratchet and clank 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.829
 and the dragon spyro is constantly in 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.960
 top sales 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.000
 others would have spat on these 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.280
 shooters and do what you like 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.590
 audience but insomnia games decided 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.930
 try again and presented 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.239
 audience fyuz cooperative postrelushki 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.039
 designed for four players in 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.289
 commercials developers rush, 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.449
 joked characters exchanged caustic 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.309
 replicas and everything is strong 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.899
 resembled ratchet and clank only 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.629
 completely different genre 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.879
 no shrill severity of times 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.469
 resistance is not left which of this 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.449
 It turned out in the end you will find out from the video 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.449
 reviews and us on the site playground.ru 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.900
 do not hope for serious 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.180
 thoughtful plot 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.220
 Scriptwriters have tried to surprise them in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.620
 resistance but the players somehow did not appreciate 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.690
 their efforts therefore taste does not try 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.750
 affect global issues like world 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.100
 after a pandemic the struggle of mutant people 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 everything is easier and more banal here 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.030
 there is an alien fusion substance with 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.040
 through which sly scientists have created 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.560
 cool guns have a terrorist group 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.390
 who wants to erase everyone and everything with 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.070
 faces of the planet is a group of mercenaries 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.500
 which confronts them 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.080
 that's actually the whole story here 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.180
 only in the script around are huge gaping 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.700
 holes and no one even patched 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.040
 trying how people got it 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 alien substance and where then its 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.720
 creators why all the main villains 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.229
 look like operetta clowns from 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.440
 television show 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.300
 sold-out sold out why terrorists in general 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.330
 all this is necessary if the ultimate goal 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.160
 turn the earth into a dead desert though 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.840
 maybe it's for the best that nobody 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.840
 questions don't even try to answer 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.730
 okay hell with her employees 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.230
 insomnia games this time did not promise 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.020
 no universal drama 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.540
 but the interesting shootout promised and 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.030
 even did a lot to perform 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.440
 batch assigned task to start 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.600
 brought four heroes 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.880
 endowed with unique abilities and 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.070
 Dalton weapons can display a shield 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.600
 which protects him from the bullets of the enemy and when 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.650
 this increase firepower 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.690
 firearms 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.760
 that is, if you play with friends in 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.010
 cooperative mode then one of you 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.110
 sure to be behind dalton's back and 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.840
 safer and more damage to enemies 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.910
 apply also this character can 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.730
 let the waves of energy that 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.590
 ripping enemies apart on i'm local 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.120
 assassin can literally in front of 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.220
 the amazed public dissolve into 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.230
 the air it helps her get into 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.200
 camp of the enemy and arrange there uniform 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.230
 thread got a super reception black hole i 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.530
 generally silent destructively deadly 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.630
 beautiful jake armed with great 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.040
 crossbow yes yes lately we 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.530
 we meet almost every second 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.959
 the game but interesting in what other game 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.310
 crossbow able to catch enemies 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.709
 turning them into stinking slush 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.590
 there is still Isabel whose gun 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.390
 we glue on the enemies of viscous viscous 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.700
 fluid which is blink of an eye 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.920
 turns them crystal and then 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.560
 just a couple of bullets just to make enemies 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.840
 crumbled when I play with friends and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.519
 It uses these chips in some of the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.470
 fusion is impossible to put down 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.420
 but worth trying single 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.580
 passing like it all fast 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.769
 rolls into pieces you immediately understand 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.110
 that you were fooled by the nose 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.569
 The fact is that insomniac games is essentially 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.760
 nothing but these trunks and specials 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.100
 Opportunities and enemies did not come up here 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.410
 solid blunt sheep that even 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.880
 the highest level of difficulty is not 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.010
 able to render significant 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.750
 resistance they become just 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.610
 thicker but no smarter 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.880
 they take the same route 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.220
 they are frankly substituted for bullets I 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.569
 I'm not talking about the local stealth who 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.970
 why did you decide to add to the game 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.790
 developers but yes you can kill 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.040
 someone from the corner but why suffer in 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.019
 it makes no sense especially when you see 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.150
 how are your partners managed 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.609
 artificial intelligence walk right on 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.700
 mind of the enemies and they didnâ€™t 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.520
 reacts like that here stealth and yes 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.070
 such companions here are their artificial 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.870
 select shows no sign of life if you 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.039
 play gave tone unwrap 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.770
 energy shield and 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.990
 and do not understand why no one except you 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.610
 no use don't be surprised it 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.729
 ok you are doing everything right 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.350
 just your computer friends don't know 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.289
 how to respond to them 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.970
 if you play for it was not one 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.370
 do not think to shoot and smash 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.590
 crystallize enemies well here 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.539
 seriously well, at least someone could 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.669
 make it so single 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.880
 the passage is completely meaningless 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.830
 only with friends just like that if u 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.289
 you are not three friends ready to buy views 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.690
 then you shouldn't waste your 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.210
 money after all even if you find these 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.979
 most friends convince them that in the end everything 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.669
 equal to get at least 7 hour 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.830
 journey 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.930
 more like beautiful races 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.870
 sewer corridor and corridors corridors 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.550
 corridors here and there 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.720
 cloned rooms bosses are rebels in 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.580
 In general, all that is needed 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.580
 if the game was about 7 years ago 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.800
 Alas 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.260
 insomnia games failed again 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.910
 there are 3 part of the resist was good 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.100
 shooter but just the series itself is not 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.470
 caught on the market the views explicit 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.910
 live to figure 3 in the title is not 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.980
 means the game has failed 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.020
 just on absolutely sharpened under 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.000
 cooperative passing and even when 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.280
 provided that you will pass exactly 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.290
 so and precisely with friends they with randomly 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.390
 found in xbox live by people who 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.340
 often not much more efficient than bots 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.660
 even in this case, the memory of her 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.820
 disappear the day after 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.710
 passing it is faceless 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.500
 not bad but just nothing 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.110
 memorable a for the game is death 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.670
 like on it all good luck and see you 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.670
