wood<00:00:59.430> to<00:01:00.050> be<00:01:01.050> able<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> whole<00:01:01.739> gig<00:01:02.629> this

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
wood to be able to do the whole gig this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.530 
wood to be able to do the whole gig this
is<00:01:03.809> an<00:01:03.930> 8<00:01:04.110> by<00:01:04.320> 8<00:01:04.939> right<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.240> made

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
is an 8 by 8 right here I just made

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
is an 8 by 8 right here I just made
outside<00:01:09.049> that's<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.500> um<00:01:10.799> screwed<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
outside that's I just um screwed it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
outside that's I just um screwed it
together<00:01:12.290> it's<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.320> those

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
together it's all I do you can use those

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
together it's all I do you can use those
fancy<00:01:17.570> deck<00:01:18.570> brackets<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.590> of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
fancy deck brackets and that kind of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.899 
fancy deck brackets and that kind of
stuff<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:20.520> shorter

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
stuff and then you can use shorter

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.270 
stuff and then you can use shorter
screws<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:22.549> already<00:01:23.549> had<00:01:23.820> those<00:01:25.280> exterior

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
screws but I already had those exterior

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.940 
screws but I already had those exterior
screws<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.909> anyway<00:01:29.909> um<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.950> choices

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
screws so anyway um and the the choices

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.100 
screws so anyway um and the the choices
are<00:01:36.560> 16<00:01:37.560> inches<00:01:37.829> apart<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:41.570> pretty<00:01:42.570> much<00:01:42.750> when

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
are 16 inches apart and pretty much when

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.420 
are 16 inches apart and pretty much when
I<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:46.430> decking

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
I get that on there then the decking

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.390 
I get that on there then the decking
goes<00:01:47.610> down<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.119> top<00:01:48.360> part

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
goes down the top part

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.120 
goes down the top part
pretty<00:01:51.400> much<00:01:51.579> it<00:01:51.820> I'm<00:01:52.030> using<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.590> handy<00:01:53.920> block

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
because it's pretty level right now it

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.110 
because it's pretty level right now it
just<00:02:51.099> has<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.430> little<00:02:51.910> bit<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.299> fall<00:02:52.989> towards<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
just has a little bit a fall towards the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.150 
just has a little bit a fall towards the
towards<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.269> yard<00:02:55.510> out<00:02:55.690> there<00:02:55.930> because<00:02:56.440> it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
towards the yard out there because it

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.449
