of wood facing on one side that's the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.090 
of wood facing on one side that's the
top<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.630> pallet<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.109> that's<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.859> wood

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
top of the pallet and that's the wood

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.359 
top of the pallet and that's the wood
and<00:00:17.250> inside<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> root<00:00:18.180> cellar<00:00:18.590> but<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
and inside of the root cellar but on the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.220 
and inside of the root cellar but on the
outside<00:00:20.850> where<00:00:21.510> I'm<00:00:21.600> assembling<00:00:22.140> them

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
outside where I'm assembling them

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.640 
outside where I'm assembling them
together<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.619> start<00:00:22.980> by<00:00:24.019> drilling<00:00:25.019> holes<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
together I start by drilling holes and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.859 
together I start by drilling holes and
putting<00:00:25.859> these<00:00:25.920> bolts<00:00:26.310> through<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:27.449> cinch

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
putting these bolts through to cinch

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.320 
putting these bolts through to cinch
everything<00:00:28.320> together<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.340> then<00:00:29.970> I'm<00:00:30.179> gonna

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
everything together and then I'm gonna

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.830 
everything together and then I'm gonna
put<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> end<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.969> then<00:00:32.969> after

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
put this one on the end and then after

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.130 
put this one on the end and then after
that's<00:00:33.960> done<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:35.579> next<00:00:35.880> step<00:00:36.090> will<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.329> before

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that's done the next step will be before

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
that's done the next step will be before
I<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.500> pour<00:00:37.710> concrete<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> put<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
I can pour concrete I have to put a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.150 
I can pour concrete I have to put a
layer<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.600> something<00:00:39.840> against<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
layer of something against so that the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.979 
layer of something against so that the
concrete<00:00:41.399> won't<00:00:41.730> lose<00:00:41.969> out<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.360> holes<00:00:42.570> here

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
concrete won't lose out these holes here

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.860 
concrete won't lose out these holes here
and<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.670> down<00:00:44.940> when<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.480> down<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and so that down when it's down in the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
and so that down when it's down in the
ground<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:46.980> take<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> whole<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.789> put

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
ground then take the whole thing and put

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.270 
ground then take the whole thing and put
it<00:00:48.000> down<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> ground<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.899> I'm<00:00:49.020> done<00:00:49.280> I

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it down in the ground and I'm done I

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
it down in the ground and I'm done I
don't<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.820> too<00:00:51.239> much<00:00:51.449> moisture<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
don't want too much moisture on the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
don't want too much moisture on the
inside<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.829> nice<00:00:53.550> wooden<00:00:53.969> wall<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
inside of this nice wooden wall I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.330 
inside of this nice wooden wall I
probably<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.750> mildewed<00:00:55.170> anyway<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.250> I'm

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
probably get mildewed anyway but I'm

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.189 
probably get mildewed anyway but I'm
gonna<00:00:56.489> put<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> vapor<00:00:56.940> barrier<00:00:57.090> keep<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
gonna put a vapor barrier keep the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.680 
gonna put a vapor barrier keep the
concrete<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.190> inside<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.820> keep<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
concrete on the inside and keep it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
concrete on the inside and keep it
hopefully<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> dryer<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.789> inside<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
hopefully a dryer on the inside of the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
hopefully a dryer on the inside of the
root<00:01:03.270> cellar<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> outside<00:01:04.949> when<00:01:05.220> I'm

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
root cellar on the outside when I'm

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
root cellar on the outside when I'm
planning<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.119> some<00:01:06.270> steel<00:01:06.570> roofing<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
planning to use is some steel roofing to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.820 
planning to use is some steel roofing to
create<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.430> form<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> concrete<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.590> pour

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
create a form for the concrete to pour

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.490 
create a form for the concrete to pour
down<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.570> then<00:01:12.570> after<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.020> done<00:01:13.229> it'll

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
down in and then after it's done it'll

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.070 
down in and then after it's done it'll
be<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:14.130> good<00:01:14.250> water<00:01:14.939> barrier<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.930> keep

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
be a really good water barrier to keep

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.010 
be a really good water barrier to keep
the<00:01:16.229> moisture<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:18.180> between<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.869> gonna

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the moisture out and in between is gonna

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.520 
the moisture out and in between is gonna
be<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> lot<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.580> steel<00:01:20.750> reinforced<00:01:21.750> bar<00:01:21.990> rebars

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
be a lot of steel reinforced bar rebars

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.649 
be a lot of steel reinforced bar rebars
then<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.460> gonna<00:01:23.580> lash<00:01:23.820> together<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
then I'm gonna lash together and at the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
then I'm gonna lash together and at the
very<00:01:24.869> end<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.950> top<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.640> dome

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
very end the top is going to be dome

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.440 
very end the top is going to be dome
shaped<00:01:27.330> out<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.259> rebar<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.670> four<00:01:29.939> inch<00:01:30.119> thick

concrete ceiling the whole thing is

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.940 
concrete ceiling the whole thing is
gonna<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.090> firmed<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.380> won't<00:01:34.530> even<00:01:34.710> see
