00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.070 
Tom's brand but he has us taking Tom's
three<00:02:15.030> times<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.630> day<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:17.220> think<00:02:17.819> it's<00:02:17.940> 500<00:02:18.300> mg<00:02:18.810> s

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
three times a day I think it's 500 mg s

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.330 
three times a day I think it's 500 mg s
each<00:02:20.069> time<00:02:20.900> throughout<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.989> day<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.220> have

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
each time throughout the day so you have

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.430 
each time throughout the day so you have
to<00:02:23.430> take<00:02:23.549> three<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.880> these<00:02:24.049> for<00:02:25.049> three<00:02:25.260> weeks

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
to take three of these for three weeks

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.070 
to take three of these for three weeks
he<00:02:26.310> recommends<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.239> then<00:02:27.330> after<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.750> you

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
he recommends and then after that you

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.150 
he recommends and then after that you
can<00:02:28.110> switch<00:02:28.500> over<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:29.269> calcium<00:02:30.269> citrate<00:02:31.160> which

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
you can get chewable online or you can

just get the pill at the beginning you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.630 
just get the pill at the beginning you
could<00:02:37.440> crush<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.799> up<00:02:37.920> if<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.370> would<00:02:38.519> be<00:02:38.610> easier
