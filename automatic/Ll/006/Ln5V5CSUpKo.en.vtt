00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
response I've discovered there are three

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
response I've discovered there are three
ways<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> teach<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> game<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.270> can

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
ways to teach in the game one is you can

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.749 
ways to teach in the game one is you can
simply<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.960> an<00:01:19.049> instructor<00:01:19.580> right<00:01:20.580> there

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
simply have an instructor right there

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.100 
simply have an instructor right there
with<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.240> when<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> make<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> mistake<00:01:21.810> they

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
with you so when you make a mistake they

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.170 
with you so when you make a mistake they
can<00:01:22.259> tap<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> head<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.009> ruler<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
can tap you on the head with a ruler and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
can tap you on the head with a ruler and
they<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.509> say<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.720> know<00:01:24.930> let's<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> right

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
they can say you know let's get it right

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.070 
they can say you know let's get it right
so<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.159> speak<00:01:26.490> another<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.420> would<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.930> take

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so to speak another way would be to take

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
so to speak another way would be to take
a<00:01:28.110> video<00:01:28.320> camera<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.920> videotape<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.610> game

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850

change<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.799> because<00:01:44.009> you're<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.340> gonna

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
change it because you're not gonna

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.039 
change it because you're not gonna
listen<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> past<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
listen because it is in the past and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.499 
listen because it is in the past and
that<00:01:46.140> filming<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> brought<00:01:47.880> us<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> kind

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that filming so I brought us up to kind

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
that filming so I brought us up to kind
of<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.659> present<00:01:49.049> day<00:01:49.140> mode<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.590> learning<00:01:49.770> where

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
of a present day mode of learning where

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.010 
of a present day mode of learning where
you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.729> teach<00:01:50.909> yourself<00:01:51.060> very<00:01:51.509> easily<00:01:51.659> we

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you can teach yourself very easily we

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.270 
you can teach yourself very easily we
actually<00:01:52.409> would<00:01:52.530> pretend<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.979> were<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.189> your

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
actually would pretend you were in your

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.510 
actually would pretend you were in your
bedroom<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.960> would<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> mirror<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.430> your

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
bedroom you would have a mirror on your

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.819 
bedroom you would have a mirror on your
dresser<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.360> anywhere<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.380> put<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> mirror

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
dresser or anywhere you can put a mirror

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.200 
dresser or anywhere you can put a mirror
you<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.159> do<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.520> your<00:01:59.549> pool<00:01:59.880> table<00:02:00.030> if

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
you could do it at your pool table if

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.789 
you could do it at your pool table if
you<00:02:00.299> wanted<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.350> other<00:02:01.469> end<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you wanted to at the other end of the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.459 
you wanted to at the other end of the
table<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> would<00:02:03.149> there's<00:02:03.810> two<00:02:03.990> stages<00:02:04.259> to

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
table so you would there's two stages to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.530 
table so you would there's two stages to
this<00:02:04.770> process<00:02:05.250> number<00:02:05.579> one<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.420> would

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
this process number one is you would

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.819 
this process number one is you would
first<00:02:06.719> know<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.930> would<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:07.380> chalking

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
first know you would do your chalking

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.969 
first know you would do your chalking
process<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.390> saw<00:02:09.989> yourself<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.530> chalking

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
process if you saw yourself not chalking

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.140 
process if you saw yourself not chalking
in<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.160> mirror<00:02:11.370> then<00:02:11.520> you'd<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.849> work<00:02:12.030> on

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
in a mirror then you'd have to work on

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.200 
in a mirror then you'd have to work on
chalking<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.720> mirror<00:02:12.930> server

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
chalking in the mirror server

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.270 
chalking in the mirror server
time<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.600> your<00:02:13.750> brain<00:02:13.960> would<00:02:14.170> see<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.860> it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
time so your brain would see that and it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.370 
time so your brain would see that and it
would<00:02:15.400> make<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.700> implant<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.720> technique<00:02:17.200> of

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
would make that implant a technique of

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.530 
would make that implant a technique of
chalking<00:02:18.070> every<00:02:18.280> time<00:02:18.490> once<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.270> have<00:02:19.420> that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
chalking every time once you have that

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.180 
chalking every time once you have that
down<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.810> would<00:02:20.140> step<00:02:20.350> into<00:02:20.500> your<00:02:20.680> shot<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
down you would step into your shot and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.950 
down you would step into your shot and
as<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.730> step<00:02:21.940> into<00:02:22.120> your<00:02:22.210> shot<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.780> see

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
as you step into your shot if you see

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.420 
as you step into your shot if you see
yourself<00:02:23.320> stepping<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.800> straight<00:02:24.190> with

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
yourself stepping in straight with

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.220 
yourself stepping in straight with
acoustic<00:02:24.850> under<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.210> shoulder<00:02:25.630> you'll<00:02:26.110> be

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
acoustic under your shoulder you'll be

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.720 
acoustic under your shoulder you'll be
able<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.470> see<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.040> mirror<00:02:27.280> now<00:02:27.400> since

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
able to see that in the mirror now since

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.860 
able to see that in the mirror now since
you're<00:02:27.880> looking<00:02:28.120> at<00:02:28.210> this<00:02:28.390> straight<00:02:28.660> through

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
you're looking at this straight through

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.540 
you're looking at this straight through
the<00:02:28.960> camera's<00:02:29.380> lens<00:02:29.440> you're<00:02:30.250> going<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.430> be

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
the camera's lens you're going to be

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.100 
the camera's lens you're going to be
able<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.730> see<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.240> cue<00:02:31.570> stick<00:02:31.780> under<00:02:31.990> your

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
able to see that cue stick under your

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.170 
able to see that cue stick under your
shoulder<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.710> there's<00:02:33.370> no<00:02:33.520> reason<00:02:33.940> why<00:02:34.150> you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
shoulder and there's no reason why you

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.120 
shoulder and there's no reason why you
would<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.080> make<00:02:35.230> any<00:02:35.410> adjustments<00:02:35.530> but

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
would have to make any adjustments but

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.100 
would have to make any adjustments but
let's<00:02:36.280> assume<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:37.000> when<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.600> stepped<00:02:37.900> into

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
let's assume that when you stepped into

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.510 
let's assume that when you stepped into
the<00:02:38.290> cue<00:02:38.500> ball<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:38.980> could<00:02:39.100> actually<00:02:39.250> put

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
the cue ball and you could actually put

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.370 
the cue ball and you could actually put
an<00:02:39.670> apple<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.240> your<00:02:40.300> dresser<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:40.900> your<00:02:41.020> bedroom

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
an apple on your dresser in your bedroom

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.020 
an apple on your dresser in your bedroom
if<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.890> took<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.100> broom<00:02:42.340> handle<00:02:42.580> anything

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
if you took a broom handle anything

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.460 
if you took a broom handle anything
straight<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.510> stepped<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.960> if<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.200> saw<00:02:44.350> your

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
straight and stepped in if you saw your

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.680 
straight and stepped in if you saw your
stuff<00:02:44.680> self<00:02:45.070> step<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.490> like<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.540> can

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
stuff self step in like this you can

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.120 
stuff self step in like this you can
obviously<00:02:46.990> see<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.320> cue<00:02:47.500> stick<00:02:47.560> out<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
obviously see the cue stick out to the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.280 
obviously see the cue stick out to the
side<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.460> your<00:02:48.550> shoulder<00:02:48.760> like<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:50.170> it's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
side of your shoulder like this so it's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.530 
side of your shoulder like this so it's
not<00:02:50.470> into<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.950> plumb-bob<00:02:51.190> effect<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.360> you'd

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
not into the plumb-bob effect so you'd

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.990 
not into the plumb-bob effect so you'd
get<00:02:52.690> back<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.520> come<00:02:54.520> in<00:02:54.610> again<00:02:54.880> with

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
get back up you come in again with

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.120 
get back up you come in again with
closer<00:02:55.300> but<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.840> see<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.290> close<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.860> time

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
closer but you see it to close this time

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.550 
closer but you see it to close this time
you'd<00:02:57.700> get<00:02:57.910> back<00:02:58.090> up<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:59.020> keep<00:02:59.200> coming

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
you'd get back up and you keep coming

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.960 
you'd get back up and you keep coming
down<00:02:59.680> you<00:02:59.860> keep<00:03:00.070> making<00:03:00.430> these<00:03:00.520> up-and-down

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
down you keep making these up-and-down

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.240 
down you keep making these up-and-down
adjustments<00:03:01.660> until<00:03:02.350> finally<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.980> had<00:03:03.100> your

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
adjustments until finally you had your

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.980 
adjustments until finally you had your
cue<00:03:03.400> stick<00:03:03.580> under<00:03:03.790> your<00:03:03.910> shoulder<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:04.750> you're

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
cue stick under your shoulder so you're

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.140 
cue stick under your shoulder so you're
you're<00:03:05.290> your<00:03:05.740> visual<00:03:06.250> perspective<00:03:06.520> of<00:03:07.000> the

don't swing crooked and you'll

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.080 
don't swing crooked and you'll
eventually<00:03:43.900> convince<00:03:44.440> yourself<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.160> you're

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
actually muscle memory has been

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.140 
actually muscle memory has been
programmed<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.740> swing<00:03:48.010> crooked<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:48.910> can

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
programmed to swing crooked so you can

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.210 
programmed to swing crooked so you can
deprogram<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.080> by<00:03:50.290> telling<00:03:50.530> yourself<00:03:50.800> and

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
deprogram that by telling yourself and

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.350 
deprogram that by telling yourself and
you'll<00:03:51.310> be<00:03:51.400> listening<00:03:51.580> yourself<00:03:52.060> in<00:03:52.240> the

you'll be listening yourself in the
mirror<00:03:52.600> just<00:03:52.780> like<00:03:53.260> when<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.710> get<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.370> extra
