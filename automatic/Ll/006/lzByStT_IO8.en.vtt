00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
drives me crazy about this game and

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.900 
drives me crazy about this game and
super<00:05:38.900> r-type<00:05:39.080> in<00:05:39.500> particular<00:05:39.770> is<00:05:40.430> that<00:05:40.700> when

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
super r-type in particular is that when

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.630 
super r-type in particular is that when
you<00:05:41.060> die<00:05:41.420> it<00:05:42.350> restarts<00:05:42.950> you<00:05:43.070> at<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.250> beginning

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
you die it restarts you at the beginning

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.790 
you die it restarts you at the beginning
of<00:05:43.730> a<00:05:43.820> level<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.510> even<00:05:45.170> if<00:05:45.290> you<00:05:45.380> die<00:05:45.560> while

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
of a level and even if you die while

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.950 
of a level and even if you die while
fighting<00:05:46.010> an<00:05:46.220> end<00:05:46.400> boss<00:05:46.640> it<00:05:47.270> restarts<00:05:47.780> you<00:05:47.870> at

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
fighting an end boss it restarts you at

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.150 
fighting an end boss it restarts you at
the<00:05:48.050> beginning<00:05:48.440> of<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.650> level<00:05:48.920> so<00:05:49.040> it's

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
the beginning of the level so it's

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.710 
the beginning of the level so it's
challenging<00:05:49.370> in<00:05:49.790> that<00:05:49.910> respect<00:05:50.300> but<00:05:50.450> I<00:05:50.480> also

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
challenging in that respect but I also

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.830 
challenging in that respect but I also
find<00:05:51.170> it<00:05:51.320> irritating<00:05:51.920> and<00:05:52.340> frustrating

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
find it irritating and frustrating

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.900 
find it irritating and frustrating
because<00:05:53.840> I<00:05:54.290> hate<00:05:54.560> losing<00:05:55.010> at<00:05:55.130> work<00:05:55.340> and<00:05:55.640> it's

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
because I hate losing at work and it's

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.150 
because I hate losing at work and it's
as<00:05:56.090> if<00:05:56.300> you've<00:05:56.510> lost<00:05:56.540> all<00:05:57.080> your<00:05:57.200> work<00:05:57.470> your

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
as if you've lost all your work your

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.950 
as if you've lost all your work your
hard<00:05:58.430> work<00:05:58.670> in<00:05:58.880> that<00:05:59.030> level<00:05:59.420> especially<00:05:59.600> if

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
hard work in that level especially if

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.020 
hard work in that level especially if
you've<00:06:00.110> pounded<00:06:00.920> an<00:06:01.010> end<00:06:01.220> boss<00:06:01.490> for<00:06:01.850> five

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
you've pounded an end boss for five

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.030 
you've pounded an end boss for five
minutes<00:06:02.300> and<00:06:02.600> then<00:06:03.140> it<00:06:03.290> dies<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:03.890> just

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
minutes and then it dies and just

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.270 
minutes and then it dies and just
restarts<00:06:04.640> you<00:06:05.080> and<00:06:06.080> my<00:06:06.200> personal<00:06:06.770> preferences

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
restarts you and my personal preferences

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.010 
restarts you and my personal preferences
is<00:06:07.460> subjective<00:06:08.060> I<00:06:08.180> think<00:06:08.690> that's<00:06:08.840> where

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
is subjective I think that's where

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.660 
is subjective I think that's where
thunderforce<00:06:09.530> gives<00:06:10.370> you<00:06:10.490> an<00:06:10.550> advantage

thunderforce gives you an advantage

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.790 
thunderforce gives you an advantage
because<00:06:11.270> you<00:06:11.420> die<00:06:11.600> you<00:06:11.660> just<00:06:12.170> restart<00:06:12.620> where

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
because you die you just restart where

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.130 
because you die you just restart where
you<00:06:12.920> died<00:06:13.330> you<00:06:14.330> know<00:06:14.390> you<00:06:14.540> blink<00:06:14.810> it<00:06:14.930> and<00:06:15.080> you

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
you died you know you blink it and you

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.080
