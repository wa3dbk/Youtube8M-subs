00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.399
 at Porto 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.969
 the Marburger Bund 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.690
 the raccoon dog which is also called the immigrant is his home 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:16.930
 is East Asia 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.859
 from East Siberia via Manchuria and North Vietnam after the op 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.020
 you have to look very closely 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.730
 so you do not mistake him for a raccoon 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.749
 because he has a similar face mask as the raccoon 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.509
 but his simple rule is not low you good ones 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.219
 white clearly go as no rivets 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.219
 So a dog-like 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.980
 he is a little smaller than a fox the pool and the body act on the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.940
 strikingly short runs up to 75 inches long 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.550
 the route up to 30 centimeters 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.550
 the shoulder height is about 20 centimeters and the weight beach 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.550
 between five and ten kilograms 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.460
 the valley of the iMac is long and 20 of it carries the very dense 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.490
 undercoat 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.630
 The color is dark brown to dark gray women 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
 and has a touch of Schwartz 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.580
 He loves dense forests where he finds good cover 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.910
 he feels well in wetlands and even in swamps 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.490
 at any rate, his habitat in his loan books looks like she had Chen's home 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.280
 out 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.040
 whether this does not meet the seven biotope claims are still known 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.320
 not exactly 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.729
 Similar to the fox or badger he goes looking for food 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.600
 During the day he hides a deserted fox or badger builds or digs 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.950
 even a tree 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.150
 In the reeds he builds himself a kind of more and holds as the sole representative of 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.420
 Federal Association winter rest 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.520
 although he belongs to the family of the canine, he does not keep 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.400
 the mating season is in February and March 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.250
 the gestation period lasts around nine weeks 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.780
 then the martens in India throws 6 to 8 worlds 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.999
 the young dogs are fully grown after about half a year 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.479
 but they do not become sexually mature until the second year of life
