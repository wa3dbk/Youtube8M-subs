00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
thought he handled it exceptionally well

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.139 
thought he handled it exceptionally well
but<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.579> a<00:01:00.710> incredible<00:01:01.710> MVP<00:01:02.309> type<00:01:02.550> player<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
but as a incredible MVP type player as a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.570 
but as a incredible MVP type player as a
guy<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> concentrated<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.220> winning<00:01:05.489> a

championship
I<00:01:06.540> thought<00:01:07.260> he<00:01:07.409> answered<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.830> well<00:01:08.159> because

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
I thought he answered that well because

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.920 
I thought he answered that well because
there<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.470> more<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:12.119> 48<00:01:12.630> minutes<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
there is more to the 48 minutes of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.649 
there is more to the 48 minutes of
basketball<00:01:13.100> than<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> fourth<00:01:15.299> quarter

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
basketball than just the fourth quarter

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.740 
basketball than just the fourth quarter
the<00:01:15.780> intangibles<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.860> mean<00:01:17.130> something<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.939> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the intangibles do mean something and I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.670 
the intangibles do mean something and I
thought<00:01:18.930> he<00:01:19.020> handed<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.380> question

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
thought he handed that question

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
thought he handed that question
exceptionally<00:01:20.100> well<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> man<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
exceptionally well as a man in the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.359 
exceptionally well as a man in the
competitor<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.380> don't<00:01:22.799> want<00:01:22.920> people<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> try

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
you like that he just got tried by that
reporter<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:26.070> thought<00:01:26.220> he<00:01:26.400> kept<00:01:26.640> his<00:01:26.790> cool

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000

reporter and I thought he kept his cool
and<00:01:27.390> answered<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> question<00:01:28.140> well<00:01:28.290> well<00:01:28.740> I

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and answered the question well well I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.490 
and answered the question well well I
said<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.369> early<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:30.180> don't<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
said this early I really don't at the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.960 
said this early I really don't at the
end<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> day<00:01:31.920> he<00:01:32.100> might<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.369> content<00:01:32.759> with

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
end of the day he might be content with

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
end of the day he might be content with
with<00:01:33.930> those<00:01:34.110> those<00:01:35.090> accusations<00:01:36.200> as<00:01:37.200> long<00:01:37.439> as

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
with those those accusations as long as

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.980 
with those those accusations as long as
they<00:01:37.680> win<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> title<00:01:38.159> yeah<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
they win a title yeah but I think the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.050 
they win a title yeah but I think the
competitor<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.490> would<00:01:41.670> argue<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
competitor in you that would argue a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
competitor in you that would argue a
little<00:01:42.360> bit<00:01:42.450> no<00:01:42.600> matter<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:43.049> no<00:01:43.200> matter<00:01:43.229> who
