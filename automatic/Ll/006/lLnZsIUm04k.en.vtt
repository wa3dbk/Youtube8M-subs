and<00:00:54.520> here's<00:00:54.880> problem

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.930 

which<00:00:57.800> pedal<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:58.820> goes<00:00:59.000> near

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.509 

breaking<00:01:03.239> whoa

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
breaking whoa

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.830 
breaking whoa
which<00:01:04.850> is<00:01:05.000> barely<00:01:05.390> not<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.690> slow<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:05.960> be<00:01:06.140> open

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
which is barely not the slow to be open

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:20.600 
which is barely not the slow to be open
stuff

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.280 

so<00:01:21.610> rubbing<00:01:21.940> noise<00:01:22.090> grinding<00:01:22.750> noise<00:01:22.900> like

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
so rubbing noise grinding noise like

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.340 
so rubbing noise grinding noise like
your<00:01:23.500> brakes<00:01:23.920> are<00:01:24.100> going<00:01:24.310> bad<00:01:24.520> in<00:01:25.050> this<00:01:26.050> rear

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
your brakes are going bad in this rear

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.370 
your brakes are going bad in this rear
wheel<00:01:26.560> here<00:01:26.860> on<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.280> driver's<00:01:27.610> side

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

she's<00:01:29.380> brakes<00:01:29.650> up<00:01:29.860> less<00:01:30.010> than<00:01:30.040> 25,000<00:01:30.970> miles

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
she's brakes up less than 25,000 miles

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.610 
she's brakes up less than 25,000 miles
on<00:01:31.300> them<00:01:31.480> so<00:01:31.600> she<00:01:31.660> shouldn't<00:01:32.020> be<00:01:32.200> grinding

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
on them so she shouldn't be grinding

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.270 
on them so she shouldn't be grinding
getting<00:01:33.580> hurt<00:01:33.670> he'd<00:01:33.790> take<00:01:33.940> that<00:01:33.970> tire<00:01:34.270> off<00:01:34.540> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
getting hurt he'd take that tire off and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.490 
getting hurt he'd take that tire off and

video was the intake gasket repair where
I<00:01:46.570> had<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.020> leaking<00:01:47.770> antifreeze<00:01:48.130> down<00:01:48.400> the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
I had the leaking antifreeze down the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.090 
I had the leaking antifreeze down the
front<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.790> block<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.530> five<00:01:50.830> or<00:01:50.860> six

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
front of the block got a five or six

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.050 
front of the block got a five or six
part<00:01:51.490> video<00:01:51.760> online<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.290> also<00:01:54.060> along

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
part video online of that also along

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.790 
part video online of that also along
with<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.270> heater<00:01:55.420> core<00:01:55.660> repair<00:01:55.990> video<00:01:58.800> so

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
with the heater core repair video so

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.680 
with the heater core repair video so
this<00:02:00.010> would<00:02:00.100> be<00:02:00.190> part<00:02:00.460> one<00:02:01.860> before<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:03.690> tear

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
this would be part one before I tear

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.230 
this would be part one before I tear
into<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.110> brake<00:02:05.350> issue<00:02:05.640> as<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.760> can<00:02:06.910> see<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
into the brake issue as you can see the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.960 
into the brake issue as you can see the
fluid<00:02:08.070> is<00:02:09.070> near<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.700> max<00:02:09.940> line<00:02:10.590> um<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.190> brake

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
fluid is near the max line um so brake

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.420 
fluid is near the max line um so brake
issue<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.360> don't<00:02:13.570> believe<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:13.959> losing<00:02:14.950> fluid

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
issue I don't believe it's losing fluid

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.960 
issue I don't believe it's losing fluid
anywhere<00:02:15.820> as<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:17.170> yet

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
anywhere as of yet

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.400 
anywhere as of yet
no<00:02:18.970> fluids<00:02:19.300> been<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.660> ground<00:02:19.900> or<00:02:20.260> anything

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
no fluids been on the ground or anything

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.070 
no fluids been on the ground or anything
like<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.300> check<00:02:22.900> each

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
like that but that the check each

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.750 
like that but that the check each
individual<00:02:23.650> brake<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.160> make<00:02:24.280> sure<00:02:24.430> it's<00:02:24.640> not

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
individual brake and make sure it's not

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.410 
individual brake and make sure it's not
leaking<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.390> then<00:02:26.820> from<00:02:27.820> there<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.060> decide

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
leaking and then from there I decide

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.800 
leaking and then from there I decide
maybe<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.590> master<00:02:29.950> cylinder<00:02:30.340> bad<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.850> sensor

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
maybe it's master cylinder bad a sensor

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.709 
maybe it's master cylinder bad a sensor
or<00:02:32.200> booster
