00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
underneath my lip as well to make a look

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.220 
underneath my lip as well to make a look
a<00:02:31.130> little<00:02:31.220> bit<00:02:31.520> bigger<00:02:31.730> there's<00:02:32.450> no<00:02:32.569> real<00:02:32.810> tech

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
a little bit bigger there's no real tech

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.590 
a little bit bigger there's no real tech
I<00:02:33.500> guess<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.069> technique<00:02:34.550> with<00:02:34.850> this<00:02:35.060> one<00:02:35.300> is

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
I guess the technique with this one is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.590 
I guess the technique with this one is
to<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.440> go<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:37.100> with<00:02:37.430> what<00:02:37.820> not<00:02:38.120> too<00:02:38.390> much

to just go in with what not too much
products<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.440> lightly<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.130> then<00:02:40.160> blend<00:02:40.880> it

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000

out afterwards and to you now going in

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.020 
out afterwards and to you now going in

all my lashes and I have quite long
lashes<00:07:19.590> so<00:07:20.009> they<00:07:20.520> kind<00:07:20.789> of<00:07:20.880> usually<00:07:21.240> go

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419
