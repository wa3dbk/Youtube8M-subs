00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.929 
first step toward getting better it's
getting<00:01:54.810> an<00:01:55.110> HDPVR<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.430> I'm<00:01:56.610> hoping<00:01:56.880> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
getting an HDPVR and I'm hoping that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.730 
getting an HDPVR and I'm hoping that
people<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.329> take<00:01:57.540> me<00:01:57.689> seriously<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:58.200> before

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
people will take me seriously now before

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.740 
people will take me seriously now before
people<00:01:59.189> would<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.520> me<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> had<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> dazzle

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
people would see me that I had a dazzle

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.139 
people would see me that I had a dazzle
and<00:02:00.930> they<00:02:01.409> would<00:02:01.560> say<00:02:01.590> oh<00:02:01.860> you're<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.520> you're

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and they would say oh you're not you're

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
and they would say oh you're not you're
not<00:02:03.180> into<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.869> much<00:02:04.049> as<00:02:04.079> other<00:02:04.890> people

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
not into this as much as other people

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.609 
not into this as much as other people
are<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.240> want<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> big

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
are if you want to be like with the big

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.350 
are if you want to be like with the big
guns<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.129> gotta<00:02:08.280> step<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.580> your<00:02:08.729> game<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.209> get

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
guns you gotta step up your game and get

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.330 
guns you gotta step up your game and get
a<00:02:09.390> better<00:02:09.539> quality

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
a better quality

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.770 
a better quality
and<00:02:10.459> before<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.239> didn't<00:02:11.480> have<00:02:11.599> enough

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
and before that I didn't have enough

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.380 
and before that I didn't have enough
money<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:12.230> do<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:13.129> recently<00:02:13.519> I've<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:14.060> got

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
money to do that but recently I've I got

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.839 
money to do that but recently I've I got
a<00:02:14.420> new<00:02:14.569> job<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.200> I've<00:02:16.010> had<00:02:16.160> work<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.519> lot<00:02:16.700> more

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
a new job and I've had work a lot more

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.449 
a new job and I've had work a lot more
hours<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.500> I've<00:02:18.500> been<00:02:18.680> able<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.920> afford<00:02:19.250> one

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
hours and I've been able to afford one

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.790 
hours and I've been able to afford one
so<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.390> figured<00:02:20.500> what<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.560> hell<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:23.660> mean<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.470> had

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
so I figured what the hell I mean I had

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.369 
so I figured what the hell I mean I had
nothing<00:02:25.099> else<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.519> spend<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.150> money<00:02:26.330> on<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.840> i

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
nothing else to spend the money on and i

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.630 
nothing else to spend the money on and i
figured<00:02:27.680> i<00:02:27.769> would<00:02:27.890> be<00:02:28.010> able<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.220> make<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.430> back

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
figured i would be able to make it back

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.970 
figured i would be able to make it back
in<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:28.910> couple<00:02:29.030> weeks<00:02:29.299> so<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.620> was<00:02:30.799> worth<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
in a couple weeks so it was worth the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.130 
in a couple weeks so it was worth the
investment<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.730> i<00:02:31.819> definitely<00:02:32.120> think<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.019> was

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
investment and i definitely think it was

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.020 
investment and i definitely think it was
worth<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.319> investment<00:02:33.530> i'm<00:02:34.310> not<00:02:34.459> saying<00:02:34.760> that

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
worth the investment i'm not saying that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.490 
worth the investment i'm not saying that
i'm<00:02:35.239> just<00:02:35.510> gonna<00:02:35.690> go<00:02:35.900> out<00:02:35.989> spend<00:02:36.290> my<00:02:36.379> money

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
i'm just gonna go out spend my money

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.100 
i'm just gonna go out spend my money
