the ends of the hair we're going to take
that<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.420> see<00:02:47.080> how<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.380> wants<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:48.010> curl<00:02:48.459> on<00:02:48.760> its

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
that and see how it wants to curl on its

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.780 
that and see how it wants to curl on its
own<00:02:49.709> ok<00:02:51.269> we're<00:02:52.269> going<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.450> let<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.630> do<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.790> in

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
own ok we're going to let it do that in

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
fact we're going to let it do that so

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.390 
fact we're going to let it do that so
much<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.180> curls<00:02:58.630> up<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:59.110> itself<00:02:59.739> like<00:02:59.980> so

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
much that it curls up on itself like so

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.370 
much that it curls up on itself like so
you're<00:03:00.700> going<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.850> position<00:03:01.030> that<00:03:01.480> curl<00:03:01.900> and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
you're going to position that curl and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.960 
you're going to position that curl and
I'm<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:02.739> holding<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.160> with<00:03:03.280> my<00:03:03.340> finger<00:03:03.850> in

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970

bull beep in you're going to slip it
right<00:03:13.180> onto<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.959> curl<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.370> then<00:03:15.730> if<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:15.970> need

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
right onto the curl and then if you need

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.640 
right onto the curl and then if you need
to<00:03:16.390> go<00:03:17.019> ahead<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.530> slip<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.310> another<00:03:18.730> beep<00:03:19.420> in

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
to go ahead and slip in another beep in

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.890 
to go ahead and slip in another beep in
so<00:03:20.650> our<00:03:20.860> bangs<00:03:21.130> are<00:03:21.519> done<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.390> let's<00:03:22.540> get<00:03:22.720> those

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.610 
little bit in and I'm going to lay it
right<00:03:58.760> into<00:03:59.420> the<00:04:01.120> part<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.300> my<00:04:02.480> hair<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.140> push

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
right into the part of my hair and push

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.410 
right into the part of my hair and push
it<00:04:03.770> forward<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.459> a<00:04:04.550> little<00:04:04.580> bit<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.300> it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
it forward just a little bit so it

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.620 
it forward just a little bit so it
doesn't<00:04:05.720> look<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:06.019> know<00:04:06.110> completely<00:04:06.530> tight

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
doesn't look you know completely tight

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.500 
doesn't look you know completely tight
you'll<00:04:08.630> both<00:04:08.780> be<00:04:08.930> pin<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.989> pin<00:04:12.850> then<00:04:13.850> just

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
you'll both be pin and pin then just

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.940 
you'll both be pin and pin then just
make<00:04:14.690> sure<00:04:14.720> those<00:04:15.050> curls<00:04:15.440> kind<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.830> get

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
make sure those curls kind of get

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.599 
make sure those curls kind of get
distributed<00:04:16.310> in<00:04:17.799> what<00:04:18.799> I<00:04:18.829> like<00:04:19.040> about<00:04:19.070> doing

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
distributed in what I like about doing

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.930 
distributed in what I like about doing
that<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.419> kind<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.890> gets<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:22.040> more<00:04:22.310> curl<00:04:22.669> up

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
that is it kind of gets you more curl up

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.700 
that is it kind of gets you more curl up
towards<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.480> top<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:24.169> this<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.590> great

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
towards the top and this is a great

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.530 
towards the top and this is a great
trick<00:04:25.190> for<00:04:25.220> those<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.790> don't<00:04:25.940> really<00:04:26.210> have<00:04:26.510> a

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
trick for those that don't really have a

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.570 
trick for those that don't really have a
lot<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.840> layers<00:04:27.140> is<00:04:27.590> really<00:04:27.980> kind<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.250> pinning

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
lot of layers is really kind of pinning

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.340 
lot of layers is really kind of pinning
it<00:04:28.700> up<00:04:28.820> brings<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.270> hair<00:04:29.480> up<00:04:29.660> farther<00:04:30.020> and

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
it up brings the hair up farther and

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.460 
it up brings the hair up farther and
kind<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.740> makes<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.520> look<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.790> bit<00:04:31.940> curlier<00:04:32.470> then

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
kind of makes it look a bit curlier then

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.900 
kind of makes it look a bit curlier then
on<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:33.680> side<00:04:33.740> we're<00:04:34.100> going<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.280> do<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.550> same

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
on this side we're going to do the same

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.850 
on this side we're going to do the same
thing<00:04:35.390> just<00:04:35.419> taking<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:36.050> little<00:04:36.080> bit<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.650> hair

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860
