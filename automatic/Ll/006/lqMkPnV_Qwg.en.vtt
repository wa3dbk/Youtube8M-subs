00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
this panel here and I had this problem

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.840 
this panel here and I had this problem
in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.959> fab<00:02:04.170> ear<00:02:04.319> as<00:02:04.499> well<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:05.340> which<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.609> one

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
in the fab ear as well now which is one

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240 
in the fab ear as well now which is one
of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.969> reasons<00:02:06.299> why<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.139> know<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.469> find<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.100> a

of the reasons why you know I find it a

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.050 
of the reasons why you know I find it a
little<00:02:08.400> difficult<00:02:08.610> over<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> long<00:02:09.750> period

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060

the<00:02:15.640> time<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.180> other<00:02:16.270> fact<00:02:16.569> is<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.780> for<00:02:17.080> some

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
the time the other fact is that for some

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.750 
the time the other fact is that for some
