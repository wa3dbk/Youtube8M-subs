00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:14.160
 8171 working helium you may notice that this 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.120
 its color is because it is not 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.570
 of steel 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.430
 aluminum is all this frame here a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.750
 special league and a year ago remains 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.099
 just like drum drum is 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.040
 essential that it be kept in steel 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.070
 the pressure of the explosion of the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.250
 I shoot the gases at the projectile firing 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.539
 it has a rubber cable facilitated is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.539
 a very soft and soft rubber car is 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.170
 a gun with the cable we call 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.309
 soft-sized small bag designer 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.300
 backup 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.559
 we have his photos on our site and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.640
 ankle 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.830
 You can identify it as a good weapon. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.409
 laptop on the ankle 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.970
 here you note well his drum is 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.820
 slightly larger than the drum of the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.869
 traditional revolvers because he 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 seven more ammunition than the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.460
 revolvers six shots 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.770
 logically it is a little bigger than 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.830
 the five-shot revolvers of two 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.100
 in those names also called 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.340
 of small balls and if you have one 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.860
 body little bigger frame has to 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.860
 be larger due to tumor size 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.560
 You see seven ammo here. 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.399
 advertised on site with 625 candles 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:58.189
 but I just weighed in the balance of 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:02:00.180
 our store 600 grams 598 well levinho 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.310
 easy to handle 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 his footprint is different when you 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.039
 touches the weapon stuff it 's different 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.610
 is different 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.800
 the drum and barrel itself 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.050
 also has a painting 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.200
 to look like the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.720
 material of his frame alone 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.660
 holding the hand to understand does not solve 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.960
 simple lightweight and easy to handle the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.990
 traditional revolvers system 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.990
 are already simple or double here 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.730
 pulling the trigger normally this 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.640
 revolver is different from revolvers 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.510
 traditional stainless steel or that 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.200
 rusty is the paint design matte 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.410
 so you may notice that he is brand new 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.840
 you may notice that it is a certain 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.340
 perfection here in ultra light writing 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.880
 it's natural it's part of the kind of painting 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.960
 of the material type of this water 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:13.680
 This revolver here is very good for postage. 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.500
 it can be loaded with bosses 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.080
 traditional london are already taken out of 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.040

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.060
