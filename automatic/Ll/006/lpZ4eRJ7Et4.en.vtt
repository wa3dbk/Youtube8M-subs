00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.150
 in 2008 Krasnoyarsk became the second 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.630
 city ​​in Russia after Vladivostok 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.740
 number of cars per thousand inhabitants 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.750
 daily traffic tension 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.630
 already significantly hinders the development of the city and 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.500
 urban comfort 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.059
 existing quantity and quality 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.190
 city ​​roads are not 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.019
 capable of safely within even an hour 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.260
 deliver the city dweller from work and 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.260
 to work 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:51.320
 and if you look at the development of the city 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.850
 as on agglomeration with joining 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.379
 Big adjacent to Krasnoyarsk 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.360
 settlements settlements and 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.790
 Grad's type scale problems 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.320
 becomes very significant especially 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.790
 if we consider the capital costs of 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.510
 building a fourth bridge across 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.489
 Yenisei 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.470
 possible completion of the metro 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.180
 launching a high-speed tram line and 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.070
 annually and expansion and repair 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.740
 existing roads and settings 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.479
 movement on them is a possible way out of 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.340
 the current difficult situation could 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.869
 become the launch of commuter trains 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.030
 on the inside urban routes 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.130
 the more so because the railway and so 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.770
 passes within the city in other words 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.210
 basic infrastructure is necessary 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.759
 mark rail 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.410
 is environmentally friendly safe 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.350
 speediest and most comfortable for 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.210
 passengers currently services 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.190
 commuter trains enjoy an average 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.479
 19 thousand people per day 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.259
 urban public transport 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.369

 electric trains 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.180
 also concerns the way from the neighborhood

 northern besides the obvious temporary 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.209
 advantages of intracity 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.400
 electric train still has a number 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.520
 advantages namely everything acts

 Krasnoyarsk budget 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.060
 but if you count the cost of capital

 building and maintaining road 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.960
 funds and lost remedies from

 standing by a huge number of people and 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.590
 cars in daily traffic jams that loss is not 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.480
 seems so big 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.520
 considering the comfort gained and 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.110
 Citizen safety and solution 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.410
 key problems developing

 agglomeration of transport accessibility to 1 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.670
 the suburb has enough experience and 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.800
 resources needed for the organization 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.450
 movement of electric trains is essentially speech 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.290
 is about starting an extra pair 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.780
 electric trains 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.910
 as well as the desire of the city authorities to solve 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.910
 acute transport problem of Krasnoyarsk
