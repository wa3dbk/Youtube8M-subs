00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
be a little bit more durable which is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.469 
be a little bit more durable which is
nice<00:01:59.460> because<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.909> put<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> bottom

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
nice because they put it on the bottom

which is where you're going to want you
know<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.310> durable<00:02:02.790> as<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.299> because

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
know as durable as you can get because

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.609 
know as durable as you can get because
this<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> part<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.020> gonna<00:02:04.200> get<00:02:04.409> rough

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
this is the part that's gonna get rough

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.350 
this is the part that's gonna get rough
if<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.920> put<00:02:05.100> down<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> rocks<00:02:05.670> gonna<00:02:06.180> be

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
if you put down on the rocks gonna be

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.360 
if you put down on the rocks gonna be
scratching<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.930> everything

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
scratching up on everything

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.190 
scratching up on everything
slated<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.760> think<00:02:07.940> about<00:02:08.150> that<00:02:08.300> when<00:02:08.540> putting

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
slated to think about that when putting

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.050 
slated to think about that when putting
it<00:02:09.380> all<00:02:09.470> together<00:02:09.650> so<00:02:10.520> just<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.760> tell<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:10.940> a

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
it all together so just to tell you a

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.580 
it all together so just to tell you a
little<00:02:11.090> bit<00:02:11.330> about<00:02:11.540> these<00:02:11.720> stretch<00:02:11.990> mesh

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
little bit about these stretch mesh

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.220 
little bit about these stretch mesh
pockets<00:02:13.160> it's<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.300> lot<00:02:14.540> better<00:02:14.720> quality<00:02:15.200> than

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
pockets it's a lot better quality than

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.020 
pockets it's a lot better quality than
your<00:02:15.440> standard<00:02:15.650> mesh<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.460> know<00:02:16.550> kind<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.910> how

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
your standard mesh you know kind of how

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.210 
your standard mesh you know kind of how
the<00:02:17.090> mesh<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.450> usually<00:02:17.780> kind<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.050> wide<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.530> you

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
the mesh is usually kind of wide and you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.800 
the mesh is usually kind of wide and you
can<00:02:19.370> get<00:02:19.520> stuff<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.910> their<00:02:20.090> stuff<00:02:20.330> gets<00:02:20.540> caught

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
can get stuff in their stuff gets caught

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.030 
can get stuff in their stuff gets caught
it's<00:02:21.110> really<00:02:21.350> annoying<00:02:21.560> when<00:02:21.710> you're<00:02:21.890> going

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
it's really annoying when you're going

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.370 
it's really annoying when you're going
through<00:02:22.160> tight<00:02:22.520> crevices<00:02:23.090> trees<00:02:23.570> twigs<00:02:24.170> that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
through tight crevices trees twigs that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.600 
through tight crevices trees twigs that
kind<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.650> thing<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:24.950> getting<00:02:25.220> stuff<00:02:25.370> caught

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
kind of thing just getting stuff caught

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.520 
kind of thing just getting stuff caught
on<00:02:25.730> your<00:02:25.820> backpack<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.540> eliminates<00:02:27.440> that

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
on your backpack so this eliminates that

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.560 
on your backpack so this eliminates that
not<00:02:28.490> only<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.820> it<00:02:29.000> still<00:02:29.180> gives<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
not only that it still gives you the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.440 
not only that it still gives you the
breathability<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.230> mesh<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.520> also<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.240> is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
breathability of mesh and also this is

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.780 
breathability of mesh and also this is
unlike<00:02:33.020> most<00:02:33.320> mesh<00:02:33.650> it's<00:02:33.860> really<00:02:34.130> stretchy<00:02:34.490> so

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
unlike most mesh it's really stretchy so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.460 
unlike most mesh it's really stretchy so
you<00:02:34.880> can<00:02:35.060> actually<00:02:35.210> fit<00:02:35.600> into<00:02:35.810> these<00:02:35.990> pockets

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
you can actually fit into these pockets

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.310 
you can actually fit into these pockets
a<00:02:36.650> lot<00:02:37.250> more<00:02:37.460> than<00:02:37.670> you'd<00:02:37.790> even<00:02:37.910> imagine<00:02:38.480> has

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
a lot more than you'd even imagine has

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.410 
a lot more than you'd even imagine has
it<00:02:39.470> on<00:02:39.560> each<00:02:39.740> side<00:02:40.040> um<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.790> know<00:02:40.880> obviously<00:02:41.060> a

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
it on each side um you know obviously a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.900 
it on each side um you know obviously a
good<00:02:41.540> place<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.840> put<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:41.990> water<00:02:42.200> bottle<00:02:42.440> here

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
good place to put a water bottle here

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.910 
good place to put a water bottle here
also<00:02:43.910> has<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:44.960> top<00:02:45.230> here<00:02:45.530> what's<00:02:45.740> nice
