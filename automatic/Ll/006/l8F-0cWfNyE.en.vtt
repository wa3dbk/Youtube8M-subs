00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.180

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.180
 this for me in kaisen shades with tomato 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.940
 my real name is that although I am 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.770
 Spanish father and mother 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.070
 I was born in Barcelona and lived there until 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.550
 14 years since then 9 years ago 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.650
 we wrote the Canary Islands live in 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.110
 a very small island there are centers 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.790
 commercials there's no starbucks and up 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.559
 recently there was no mcdonald's and 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.550
 when they opened it was a huge stir 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.860
 still this is a this operation from 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.070
 I 've always had pets since dogs 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.269
 and cats up rats snakes iguanas 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.170
 parrots and mice I do not know if I said it already 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.760
 I've had everything together 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.560
 I learned to draw before I knew 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.690
 write and since then I could 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.640
 leave it focused my life action in front 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.370
 to drawing and right now I'm an illustrator 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.920
 I have been a student absolutely 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.960
 terrible not for fools but for rebellious 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.119
 obviously now with perspective 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.390
 done things differently children 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.250
 they study I adore the manga the sleeve 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.259
 drawn not so much the anime because 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.640
 considered that in the anime they change the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.160
 stories and you lose a bit the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.900
 real intention of the author my hand 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.690
 favorite is naughty nor author 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.369
 favorite flour tanimura although I was 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.470
 in more than five years without seeing it by the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.400
 distance retains my best friend since 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.400
 I was five years old 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.630
 I have nothing of memory I am a commodore 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.520
 so my planner notebook agenda 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.429
 it's like a book extension 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.350
 I am very spontaneous everything I have to 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.439
 have organized in advance and hate 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.500
 very much to have to improvise in spite 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.910
 to be very organized I am extremely 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.430
 messy although in my case it 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.980
 find the order and podio the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.239
 surprises of truth do not give me any 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.720
 it's never obvious, a lot, I'm 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.720
 addicted 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.450
 whenever I have no obligations 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.250
 daytime I want my schedule to be 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.439
 I wake up during the night my mind 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.329
 works a lot better, but always 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.610
 I end up with jet lag every time I have to 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.019
 do something during the good I am 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.909
 synesthetic for those who do not 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.220
 I practiced this is that in your brain 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.230
 we are all senses come together and mix 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.359
 the sensations in my case I can notice 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.549
 the texture of the voices and associated the 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.250
 colors with sensations and with numbers 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.650
 my favorite musical styles are the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.859
 drum and 20 in chile this electro swing 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.780
 in the field and rock I do not hear anything from 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.030
 pop music unless it's on the radio 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.850
 and I never hear about the news 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.980
 I see nothing zilch to 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.650
 television so I have no idea 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.260
 nothing about famoseo celebrity 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.510
 I do not have a level despite not seeing the 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.159
 television to move series and movies and 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.170
 favorite series to a parishioner Julian 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.730
 yan and about movies the most 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.769
 they like are these that make you break the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.870
 brain thinking because they are so rare or 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.210
 they have a super intricate plot and 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.860
 strange 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.450
 I buy the internet of 99.9 of things 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.640
 I love making little things by hand and I have a 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.410
 small jewelry shop online as well 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.610
 if you want to take a look I'm going to 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.490
 leave the link in the box 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.170
 information I'm not addicted to 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.700
 Smartphones sometimes speak to me 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.140
 whatsapp and I do not know even inside 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.390
 one week 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.950
 and an extremely lonely person 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.990
 I've come to spend weeks or even 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.930
 whole months without seeing anyone because in 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.550
 my mind of the needy can not stand to 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.000
 too shallow people 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.680
 I feel that they are a shell canes the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.540
 people then know me think that 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.610
 I'm a contribution because I seem to be 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.190
 very serious when I'm quiet then I 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.840
 they know and it happened to them I have ideals 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.420
 somewhat retrograde for the days in the 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.100
 that we are but in spite of that always 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.540
 I try to meet people before 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.969
 judge them 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.859
 I love the eccentricity anything 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.750
 always leave the established thing and 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.039
 when it's because it 's genuine and not because 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.610
 is a kind of wake- up call 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.860
 really what then 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.120
 as a rule I hate to travel to 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.050
 exception of the destinations that I 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.939
 I would love to meet USA and Japan 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.439
 I like to design my own clothes like this 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.169
 that this year he has learned how to sew 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:39.060
 to be able to carry what I have the head 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.650
 I have a good handful of wigs and it's that 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.569
 I love too much to change color 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.110
 of the hair I started to mess with the 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.330
 makeup when I was 13 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.070
 the dream of my life would be to be able to live in 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.680
 a wooden house lost in a forest 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.930
 dark and discs I have a special 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.330
 fixation by mineral crystals 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.430
 trunks and bones I love the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.860
 organic forms of such a nature 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.290
 that collections I am a lover 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.060
 determined of the animals a year ago 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.960
 without realizing I started to stop 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.990
 eat meat and sometimes I would say that even 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.780
 science I put people apart 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.400
 of drawing also of tuna I have a 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.440
 wonderful family and I have always been 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.680
 supported in all my projects and follies 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.030
 however rare they are the first channel of 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.920
 youtube that I subscribed to was the 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.990
 technical tutorial is done 4 or 5 years ago 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.750
 I learned youtube everything I know about 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.640
 makeup I started on youtube for 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.460
 try to focus makeup as something 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.710
 creative and not just like something beautiful 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.009
 I am not a very talkative girl I prefer 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.449
 spend saliva to what is just and necessary 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.860
 probably for that reason I've 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.470
 always better with men than 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.030
 with women if I had not thrown by the 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.160
 sure artistic side that would have 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.979
 studied psychology I'm passionate about 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.960
 paths of the mind I am publishing a 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.699
 comic book for free on the internet though 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.380
 I'm moving erratically because 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.030
 it's such an important story for me 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.229
 that only the drawing when really 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.250
 I feel like I have to draw, I explain 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.650
 I leave the link in the box 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.430
 information the color violets not 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.470
 obsess 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.580
 I do not have everywhere but it's because 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.229
 unconsciously he has given him a 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.409
 meaning and now every time I see it 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.629
 it induces certain sensations 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.809
 despite living in a subtropical kingdom 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:25.110
 I hate the sun the beach and the water if it were 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:27.639
 for me I would say in a Nordic country with a 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.280
 fireplace and a lover is 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.139
 even so it gets a whopper even in 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.270
 August we have blankets on the bed 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.550
 and I keep drinking my coffee burning 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.200
 afternoons 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.060
 has not sought leave me too 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.410
 I prefer a thousand times to stay with 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.970
 someone to take accident to a 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:46.620
 really interesting conversation if 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.240
 you have arrived here thank you very much 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:53.240
 and tell me your tools in the 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:56.110
 comment box a little kiss chao 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.110
 what heat 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.250
 look
