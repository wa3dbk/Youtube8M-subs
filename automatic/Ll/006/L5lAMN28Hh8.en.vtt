00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
game sucked but how Sabre interactive

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.140 
game sucked but how Sabre interactive
was<00:02:10.830> involved<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.370> halos<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.000> they

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
was involved with halos that they

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.330 
was involved with halos that they
initially<00:02:12.510> were<00:02:13.050> involved<00:02:13.650> with<00:02:13.770> porting

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
initially were involved with porting

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.890 
initially were involved with porting
they<00:02:14.790> were<00:02:14.850> involved<00:02:15.270> with<00:02:15.330> halo<00:02:15.630> combat

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
they were involved with halo combat

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.020 
they were involved with halo combat
Evolved<00:02:16.380> Anniversary<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:17.400> they<00:02:17.520> did<00:02:17.790> is

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
Evolved Anniversary what they did is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.360 
Evolved Anniversary what they did is
that<00:02:18.150> they<00:02:18.270> ported<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.080> Xbox<00:02:19.680> version<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
that they ported the Xbox version to the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.330 
that they ported the Xbox version to the
360<00:02:20.820> version<00:02:21.240> for<00:02:22.050> halo<00:02:22.290> combat<00:02:22.530> Evolved<00:02:23.160> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
360 version for halo combat Evolved and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.800 
360 version for halo combat Evolved and
then<00:02:23.880> he<00:02:23.970> took<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.380> 360<00:02:25.380> port<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.880> port<00:02:27.180> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
then he took that 360 port of a port to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.170 
then he took that 360 port of a port to
port<00:02:28.080> into<00:02:28.680> Master<00:02:29.100> Chief<00:02:29.310> collection<00:02:29.340> they

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
port into Master Chief collection they

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.150 
port into Master Chief collection they
poured<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> port<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.110> port<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.740> obviously

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
poured the port of a port so obviously

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.910 
poured the port of a port so obviously
you<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.490> probably<00:02:32.790> see<00:02:33.090> some<00:02:33.540> weird<00:02:34.500> things

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
you can probably see some weird things

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.130 
you can probably see some weird things
happening<00:02:35.490> with<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.360> then<00:02:36.780> what<00:02:37.020> they

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
happening with that and then what they

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.050 
happening with that and then what they
also<00:02:37.290> did<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.770> they<00:02:37.920> ported<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.580> PC

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
also did is that they ported the PC

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.080 
also did is that they ported the PC
multiplayer<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.320> Xbox<00:02:40.890> one<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.760> then<00:02:41.940> we

Microsoft<00:02:58.770> Studios<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.850> with<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.180> port

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
Microsoft Studios and with this port

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.570 
Microsoft Studios and with this port
they<00:03:00.870> then<00:03:01.080> ported<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.710> over<00:03:02.130> for<00:03:02.490> the

they then ported that over for the

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.400 
they then ported that over for the
Master<00:03:02.880> Chief<00:03:03.090> collection<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:04.020> basically

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
Master Chief collection to basically

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.830 
Master Chief collection to basically
just<00:03:04.740> do<00:03:04.920> their<00:03:05.100> graphical<00:03:05.760> modifications<00:03:06.600> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
just do their graphical modifications to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.420 
just do their graphical modifications to
the<00:03:06.960> game<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.350> make<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.620> look<00:03:07.800> all<00:03:07.980> nice<00:03:08.190> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
the game to make it look all nice and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.750 
the game to make it look all nice and
pretty

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
pretty

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.450 
pretty
so<00:03:09.300> then<00:03:09.570> 343<00:03:10.170> involves<00:03:10.740> involved<00:03:11.160> with<00:03:11.280> that

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
so then 343 involves involved with that

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.370 
so then 343 involves involved with that
Sabre<00:03:12.060> interactive<00:03:12.750> did<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.080> heavy<00:03:13.230> lifting

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
Sabre interactive did the heavy lifting

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.280 
Sabre interactive did the heavy lifting
certain<00:03:14.370> affinity<00:03:14.670> helped<00:03:15.240> out<00:03:15.390> as<00:03:15.600> well<00:03:15.930> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
certain affinity helped out as well and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.080 
certain affinity helped out as well and
also<00:03:16.470> don't<00:03:16.709> forget<00:03:16.920> we<00:03:17.100> had<00:03:17.220> blur<00:03:17.520> studios

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
also don't forget we had blur studios

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970 
also don't forget we had blur studios
and<00:03:18.300> doing<00:03:18.540> all<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.959> cutscene<00:03:19.470> work<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:19.920> the

and doing all the cutscene work for the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.370 
and doing all the cutscene work for the
game<00:03:20.130> which<00:03:20.310> as<00:03:20.430> I'd<00:03:20.580> say<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.480> shining<00:03:22.080> gem

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
game which as I'd say is the shining gem

three<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.580> my<00:04:17.729> personal<00:04:18.270> favorite

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
three is my personal favorite

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.050 
three is my personal favorite
and<00:04:19.199> I<00:04:19.410> can't<00:04:19.859> play<00:04:20.009> the<00:04:20.190> multiplayer<00:04:20.579> because

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
and I can't play the multiplayer because

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.499 
and I can't play the multiplayer because
they<00:04:21.329> completely<00:04:21.900> screwed<00:04:22.139> up<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
they completely screwed up the

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.580 
they completely screwed up the
horizontal<00:04:24.509> sensitivity<00:04:25.139> in<00:04:25.350> their

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
horizontal sensitivity in their

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.200 
horizontal sensitivity in their
political<00:04:25.860> sensitivity<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.699> horizontal

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
political sensitivity the horizontal

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.110 
political sensitivity the horizontal
sensitivity<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.289> way<00:04:29.070> higher<00:04:29.490> than<00:04:29.820> the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
sensitivity is way higher than the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.150 
sensitivity is way higher than the
vertical<00:04:30.330> sensitivity<00:04:31.169> so<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.740> makes<00:04:31.949> it<00:04:32.039> just

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
vertical sensitivity so it makes it just

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.640 
vertical sensitivity so it makes it just
incredibly<00:04:33.060> hard<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.509> aim<00:04:33.720> new<00:04:34.199> yeah<00:04:34.350> if<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.590> can

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
incredibly hard to aim new yeah if I can

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.320 
incredibly hard to aim new yeah if I can
just<00:04:34.860> spend<00:04:35.100> time<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:35.400> playing<00:04:35.880> Halo<00:04:36.060> 3<00:04:36.300> I

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
just spend time just playing Halo 3 I

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.850 
just spend time just playing Halo 3 I
can<00:04:36.509> probably<00:04:36.690> get<00:04:36.930> used<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.440> but<00:04:37.740> then

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
can probably get used to it but then

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.170 
can probably get used to it but then
when<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:38.009> try<00:04:38.190> jumping<00:04:38.430> over<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.610> another<00:04:38.880> game

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
when I try jumping over to another game

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.240 
when I try jumping over to another game
it's<00:04:39.630> as<00:04:39.870> my<00:04:40.110> aims<00:04:40.380> gonna<00:04:40.530> be<00:04:40.590> completely<00:04:41.100> off

Master Chief collection you just hop
between<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.419> decade's<00:04:46.169> worth<00:04:46.289> of<00:04:46.710> Halo<00:04:47.070> games

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
between a decade's worth of Halo games

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.060 
between a decade's worth of Halo games
at<00:04:47.789> any<00:04:48.330> time<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.080> can't<00:04:49.470> do<00:04:49.620> that<00:04:49.770> but

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
at any time and you can't do that but

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.890 
at any time and you can't do that but
the<00:04:50.520> halo<00:04:50.699> 3<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.120> completely<00:04:51.570> screwed

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
the halo 3 is just completely screwed

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.719 
the halo 3 is just completely screwed
it's<00:04:52.289> like<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.740> quality<00:04:53.160> for<00:04:53.280> hell<00:04:53.430> 3<00:04:53.610> is<00:04:53.669> just

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
it's like the quality for hell 3 is just

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.460 
it's like the quality for hell 3 is just
got<00:04:54.060> not<00:04:54.300> there<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:54.960> can<00:04:55.050> think<00:04:55.199> roughly

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
got not there so you can think roughly

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.020 
got not there so you can think roughly
and<00:04:55.680> games<00:04:55.860> for<00:04:56.100> ruining<00:04:56.310> my<00:04:56.400> favorite<00:04:56.850> Halo

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
game and then finally we have the

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.909 
game and then finally we have the
interface<00:04:59.039> which<00:04:59.400> was<00:04:59.610> designed<00:05:00.180> by<00:05:00.479> 343<00:05:01.229> but

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
interface which was designed by 343 but

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.640 
interface which was designed by 343 but
then<00:05:02.070> they<00:05:02.250> hired<00:05:02.580> United<00:05:03.330> Front<00:05:03.690> Games<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.500> do

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
then they hired United Front Games to do

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.860 
then they hired United Front Games to do
the<00:05:04.800> work<00:05:05.010> but<00:05:05.220> United<00:05:05.610> Front<00:05:05.850> games<00:05:06.090> actually

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
the work but United Front games actually

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.330 
the work but United Front games actually
has<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.020> pretty<00:05:07.320> decent<00:05:07.410> track<00:05:07.800> record<00:05:08.130> they

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
has a pretty decent track record they

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.159 
has a pretty decent track record they
work<00:05:08.490> on<00:05:08.639> sleeping<00:05:09.120> dogs<00:05:09.300> or<00:05:09.750> well-received

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
game they worked on Little Big Planet

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.310 
game they worked on Little Big Planet

karting and Tomb Raider the definitive
edition<00:05:16.740> as<00:05:17.070> well<00:05:17.180> certainly<00:05:18.180> no<00:05:18.389> small<00:05:18.449> feat

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
edition as well certainly no small feat

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.659 
edition as well certainly no small feat
when<00:05:19.320> I<00:05:19.349> came<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.710> those<00:05:19.800> games<00:05:20.039> and<00:05:20.280> so<00:05:20.370> most

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
when I came to those games and so most

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.460 
when I came to those games and so most
of<00:05:20.759> the<00:05:20.849> lecture<00:05:21.270> really<00:05:21.660> well<00:05:21.840> received<00:05:22.199> and

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
of the lecture really well received and

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.890 
of the lecture really well received and
the<00:05:22.860> functionality<00:05:23.669> of<00:05:23.849> the<00:05:24.030> interface<00:05:24.419> for

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
the functionality of the interface for

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.510 
the functionality of the interface for
the<00:05:24.990> message<00:05:25.229> objection<00:05:25.710> actually<00:05:26.280> works

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
the message objection actually works

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.040 
the message objection actually works
when<00:05:27.030> I<00:05:27.060> say<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.449> the<00:05:27.510> interface<00:05:27.870> is

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
when I say that the interface is

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
when I say that the interface is
actually<00:05:28.199> good

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
actually good

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.850 
actually good
no<00:05:29.460> because<00:05:29.789> 343<00:05:30.720> was<00:05:30.900> involved<00:05:31.199> with<00:05:31.410> it<00:05:31.710> so

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
no because 343 was involved with it so

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.260 
no because 343 was involved with it so
we<00:05:31.979> had<00:05:32.130> three<00:05:32.280> four<00:05:32.490> three<00:05:32.580> industry<00:05:33.030> as<00:05:33.120> they

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
we had three four three industry as they

this<00:05:35.880> work<00:05:36.150> we<00:05:36.300> came<00:05:36.479> to<00:05:36.599> actually<00:05:36.770> messing

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
this work we came to actually messing

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.500 
this work we came to actually messing
with<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:38.099> games<00:05:38.340> so<00:05:38.909> what<00:05:39.060> does<00:05:39.180> that<00:05:39.240> leave

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
with the games so what does that leave

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.270 
with the games so what does that leave
three<00:05:39.720> or<00:05:39.810> four<00:05:39.960> three<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.289> do<00:05:40.440> well<00:05:40.830> all<00:05:41.010> three

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
three or four three to do well all three

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.680 
three or four three to do well all three
four<00:05:41.490> three<00:05:41.580> had<00:05:41.789> to<00:05:41.880> do<00:05:42.000> was<00:05:42.330> just<00:05:42.510> the

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
four three had to do was just the

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.300 
four three had to do was just the
networking<00:05:43.080> maze<00:05:43.409> had<00:05:43.680> all<00:05:43.949> they<00:05:44.039> had<00:05:44.130> to<00:05:44.159> do

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
networking maze had all they had to do

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.490 
networking maze had all they had to do
was<00:05:44.490> just<00:05:44.639> connect<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.240> games<00:05:45.449> together<00:05:45.900> to

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
was just connect the games together to

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.990 
was just connect the games together to
have<00:05:46.680> them<00:05:46.770> all<00:05:46.949> work<00:05:47.190> seamlessly<00:05:47.550> for

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
have them all work seamlessly for

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.270 
have them all work seamlessly for
everybody<00:05:48.330> to<00:05:48.419> play<00:05:48.449> and<00:05:48.960> that<00:05:49.530> was<00:05:49.740> the<00:05:49.919> major

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
everybody to play and that was the major

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.730 
everybody to play and that was the major
flaw<00:05:50.849> of<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.599> Master<00:05:51.930> Chief<00:05:52.080> collection

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
flaw of the Master Chief collection

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.460 
flaw of the Master Chief collection
there<00:05:52.919> was<00:05:53.070> no<00:05:53.250> networking<00:05:54.229> basically<00:05:55.229> for

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
there was no networking basically for

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.320 
there was no networking basically for
the<00:05:55.530> game<00:05:55.680> when<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:55.830> was<00:05:55.949> released<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.669> kinda

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
the game when it was released it kinda

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.760 
the game when it was released it kinda
works<00:05:57.599> now<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:58.229> mean<00:05:58.349> they'd<00:05:58.470> be<00:05:58.500> games

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
works now I mean they'd be games

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.070 
works now I mean they'd be games
functioning<00:05:59.550> at<00:05:59.820> the<00:06:00.060> moment<00:06:00.419> I<00:06:00.599> wouldn't<00:06:00.930> say

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
functioning at the moment I wouldn't say

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.170 
functioning at the moment I wouldn't say
it<00:06:01.229> works<00:06:01.500> now<00:06:02.070> when<00:06:02.159> I<00:06:02.280> say<00:06:02.460> three<00:06:02.760> four<00:06:02.789> three

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
it works now when I say three four three

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.510 
it works now when I say three four three
I'm<00:06:03.389> not<00:06:03.510> talking<00:06:03.840> about<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:04.169> entire<00:06:04.520> studio
