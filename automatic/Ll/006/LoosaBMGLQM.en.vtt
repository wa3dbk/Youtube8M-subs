joints<00:00:08.250> just<00:00:08.519> like<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.910> real<00:00:09.090> thing<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.870> is

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
joints just like the real thing this is

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.860 
joints just like the real thing this is
a<00:00:10.889> quick<00:00:11.370> little<00:00:11.550> demonstration<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.750> you'll

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
a quick little demonstration that you'll

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.230 
a quick little demonstration that you'll
be<00:00:13.049> able<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.440> see<00:00:13.710> where<00:00:14.130> those<00:00:14.820> particular

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
be able to see where those particular

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.170 
be able to see where those particular
pipes<00:00:15.900> actually<00:00:16.500> work<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.490> working<00:00:17.910> pipe

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
pipes actually work the working pipe

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.269 
pipes actually work the working pipe
joints<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.380> below<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:21.590> hose<00:00:22.590> that

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
joints are just below the hose that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.910 
joints are just below the hose that
bends<00:00:23.730> up<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.449> connects<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.740> two

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
bends up and and connects the two

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.830 
bends up and and connects the two
engines<00:00:26.400> there<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:27.800> we<00:00:28.800> move<00:00:29.099> those<00:00:29.840> engines

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
engines there as we move those engines

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.000 
engines there as we move those engines
from<00:00:31.140> side<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.410> side<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:33.510> actually<00:00:33.690> see

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
from side to side you can actually see

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.350 
from side to side you can actually see
the<00:00:35.010> mechanical<00:00:35.610> pipe<00:00:35.940> joints<00:00:37.940> flex<00:00:38.940> back<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the mechanical pipe joints flex back and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.190 
the mechanical pipe joints flex back and
forth<00:00:40.040> so<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> two<00:00:41.780> pipes<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.110> are

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
forth so that the two pipes that are

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.619 
forth so that the two pipes that are
connected<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> way<00:00:44.160> remain<00:00:44.879> connected<00:00:45.270> as

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
connected that way remain connected as

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.940 
connected that way remain connected as
the<00:00:45.840> engine<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:47.190> around<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> curves

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
the engine is going around on the curves

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.689 
the engine is going around on the curves
so<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.190> fully<00:00:50.489> functional<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:53.309> take<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
so it's fully functional you take it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.790 
so it's fully functional you take it
apart<00:00:54.350> with<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> single<00:00:56.120> one<00:00:57.120> millimeter<00:00:57.800> hex

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
apart with a single one millimeter hex

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.510 
apart with a single one millimeter hex
head<00:00:59.129> screw<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:00.480> simply<00:01:01.289> screws<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.859> where

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
head screw that simply screws out where

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.229 
head screw that simply screws out where
I'm<00:01:02.730> pointing

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I'm pointing

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929 
I'm pointing
and<00:01:03.680> then<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> whole<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.369> drop<00:01:05.670> down

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and then the whole thing will drop down

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.719 
and then the whole thing will drop down
that<00:01:06.299> way<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.930> take<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> two<00:01:08.369> engines

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that way you can take the two engines

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.250 
that way you can take the two engines
apart<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.299> need<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.990> same

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
apart if you need to this is the same

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.230 
apart if you need to this is the same
assembly<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.250> slightly<00:01:14.549> different<00:01:14.850> angle

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
assembly from a slightly different angle

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
assembly from a slightly different angle
so<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.170> gain<00:01:16.830> some<00:01:17.130> appreciation

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so that you can gain some appreciation

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.300 
so that you can gain some appreciation
for<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.270> notice<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> pipe<00:01:19.170> that's<00:01:19.560> behind<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
for it notice the pipe that's behind the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.940 
for it notice the pipe that's behind the
front<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.479> moves<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.020> same<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
front one that moves the same way as the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.539 
front one that moves the same way as the
front<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:24.650> there<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.799> flexible<00:01:26.220> hoses

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
front one there are flexible hoses

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.760 
front one there are flexible hoses
connecting<00:01:27.299> other<00:01:27.450> pipes<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.500> well

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
connecting other pipes there as well

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.520 
connecting other pipes there as well
this<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> type<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> connection<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
this is the type of connection that the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.630 
this is the type of connection that the
sp<00:01:32.460> used<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.299> these<00:01:33.720> big<00:01:34.020> ACS<00:01:37.009> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.460> right

side of the engine is another of those
three<00:01:41.579> rotating<00:01:42.570> joint<00:01:42.950> flexible<00:01:43.950> pipe

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
three rotating joint flexible pipe

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.370 
three rotating joint flexible pipe
assemblies<00:01:44.909> where<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.750> see<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> moving

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
assemblies where you can see it moving

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.039 
assemblies where you can see it moving
now<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:47.579> perhaps<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.210> easier<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> see

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
now it's perhaps a little easier to see

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.760 
now it's perhaps a little easier to see
how<00:01:49.079> they<00:01:49.470> work<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.759> side<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> engine

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
how they work on this side of the engine

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.560 
how they work on this side of the engine
because<00:01:52.770> there's<00:01:53.310> only<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.880> them<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.420> not

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
because there's only one of them and not

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.230 
because there's only one of them and not
quite<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.990> many<00:01:55.140> overlapping<00:01:55.770> pipes<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
quite as many overlapping pipes that you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.780 
quite as many overlapping pipes that you
can<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.049> swing<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.740> rear<00:01:59.100> engine<00:01:59.340> from

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
can see as I swing the rear engine from

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.219 
can see as I swing the rear engine from
side<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.329> side<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:02.759> allows<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.899> pipes

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
side to side now that allows the pipes

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.700 
side to side now that allows the pipes
to<00:02:04.590> flex<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.369> maintain<00:02:06.210> their<00:02:06.619> continuity

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.100 

there<00:02:13.710> are<00:02:13.830> three<00:02:14.130> rotating<00:02:14.820> joints<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.840> these

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
there are three rotating joints in these

and then this one that butts in to the
end<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.190> pipe<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:37.380> way<00:02:37.650> those<00:02:38.250> both

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
end of the pipe this way those both

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.570 
end of the pipe this way those both
rotate<00:02:39.150> as<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:39.990> see<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.620> then<00:02:41.340> there's

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
rotate as you can see and then there's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.260 
rotate as you can see and then there's
another<00:02:41.730> rotating<00:02:42.720> joint<00:02:43.640> right<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.820> here

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
another rotating joint right up here

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.260 
another rotating joint right up here
under<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.720> lubricator<00:02:46.550> that<00:02:47.550> allows<00:02:47.850> for

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
under the lubricator that allows for

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.360 
under the lubricator that allows for
further<00:02:48.450> motion<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.320> see<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.770> rotating

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
further motion you can see it rotating

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.920 
further motion you can see it rotating
at<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.490> same<00:02:50.610> time<00:02:52.700> again<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.910> comes<00:02:54.150> apart<00:02:54.540> by

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
at the same time again it comes apart by

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.400 
at the same time again it comes apart by
simply<00:02:55.320> removing<00:02:55.709> one<00:02:56.550> mill<00:02:57.450> one<00:02:57.959> millimeter

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
simply removing one mill one millimeter

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.440 
simply removing one mill one millimeter
screw<00:02:58.800> right<00:02:59.040> there<00:03:01.580> this<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.640> another<00:03:02.940> view

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
screw right there this is another view

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.630 
screw right there this is another view
of<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.630> same<00:03:04.140> joint<00:03:04.530> on<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.920> right<00:03:05.130> side<00:03:05.459> of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
of that same joint on the right side of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.670 
of that same joint on the right side of
the<00:03:05.730> engine<00:03:05.940> from<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.870> different<00:03:07.080> angle

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
the engine from a different angle

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.570 
the engine from a different angle
so<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.490> can<00:03:08.700> get<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> better<00:03:09.510> idea<00:03:10.580> by

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
so you can get a better idea by

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.790 
so you can get a better idea by
combining<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.270> various<00:03:12.660> views<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.320> exactly

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
combining the various views of exactly

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.600 
combining the various views of exactly
how<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.250> work<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:18.860> these<00:03:19.860> joints<00:03:20.370> will<00:03:20.489> be

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
how they work and these joints will be

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.890 
how they work and these joints will be
done<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.030> way<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> production<00:03:21.840> model

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
done that way on the production model

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.470 
done that way on the production model
finally<00:03:24.900> we'll<00:03:25.080> take<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.290> view<00:03:25.680> from<00:03:26.070> above<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
finally we'll take a view from above the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.199 
finally we'll take a view from above the
engine<00:03:27.660> looking<00:03:28.200> down<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.800> that<00:03:29.040> joint<00:03:29.760> as<00:03:30.060> it

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
engine looking down on that joint as it

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.960 
engine looking down on that joint as it
moves<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.590> can<00:03:31.890> see<00:03:32.160> just<00:03:32.190> how<00:03:32.760> much

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
moves so you can see just how much

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.930 
moves so you can see just how much
motion<00:03:33.510> there<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.380> those<00:03:34.830> joints<00:03:35.489> that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
motion there is in those joints that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.410 
motion there is in those joints that
allows<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.930> engine<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.680> go<00:03:37.890> around<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.459> 72<00:03:39.390> inch

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
allows the engine to go around a 72 inch

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.070 
allows the engine to go around a 72 inch
or<00:03:39.989> perhaps<00:03:40.920> even<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.519> lesser<00:03:41.940> radius<00:03:42.780> than

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
or perhaps even a lesser radius than

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.290 
or perhaps even a lesser radius than
that
