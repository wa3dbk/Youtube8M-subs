alright<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:31.580> compared<00:00:32.000> to<00:00:32.119> this<00:00:32.210> scar<00:00:32.690> heavy

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
alright so compared to this scar heavy

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.990 
alright so compared to this scar heavy
which<00:00:33.590> is<00:00:33.739> a<00:00:33.770> different<00:00:34.130> version<00:00:34.400> of<00:00:34.610> this<00:00:34.730> gun

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
which is a different version of this gun

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.450 
which is a different version of this gun
euskara<00:00:35.870> light<00:00:36.080> is<00:00:36.290> much<00:00:36.559> lighter<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.160> has<00:00:37.430> a

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
euskara light is much lighter and has a

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.180 
euskara light is much lighter and has a
much<00:00:37.820> faster<00:00:38.059> reload<00:00:38.510> rate<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:39.710> power<00:00:39.920> is

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
much faster reload rate the power is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.650 
much faster reload rate the power is
decent<00:00:40.580> on<00:00:40.670> this<00:00:40.790> gun<00:00:41.000> about<00:00:41.270> four<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:41.629> five

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
decent on this gun about four to five

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.229 
decent on this gun about four to five
shots<00:00:42.230> ought<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.620> do<00:00:42.739> it<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.879> course<00:00:43.910> a

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
shots ought to do it and of course a

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.040 
shots ought to do it and of course a
one-shot<00:00:44.600> headshot<00:00:46.030> it's<00:00:47.030> going<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.270> kill<00:00:47.900> in

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
one-shot headshot it's going to kill in

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.290 
one-shot headshot it's going to kill in
one<00:00:48.199> shot<00:00:48.440> in<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.680> head<00:00:48.800> by<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.699> firing<00:00:50.120> rate

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
one shot in the head by the firing rate

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.299 
one shot in the head by the firing rate
it's<00:00:50.750> decent<00:00:51.170> it's<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.500> little<00:00:51.769> bit<00:00:51.860> faster

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
it's decent it's a little bit faster

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.240 
it's decent it's a little bit faster
than<00:00:52.460> an<00:00:52.600> ak-47<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:54.559> think<00:00:54.890> it's<00:00:55.040> a<00:00:55.159> little

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
than an ak-47 and I think it's a little

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.040 
than an ak-47 and I think it's a little
bit<00:00:55.400> slower<00:00:55.760> than<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.059> scar<00:00:56.390> heavy<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:56.900> don't

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
bit slower than the scar heavy but don't

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.320 
bit slower than the scar heavy but don't
quote<00:00:57.170> me<00:00:57.350> on<00:00:57.379> that<00:00:57.500> is<00:00:57.830> just<00:00:58.280> what<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:58.640> think<00:00:59.000> it

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
quote me on that is just what I think it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.200 
quote me on that is just what I think it
is<00:00:59.710> alright<00:01:00.710> I'll<00:01:01.010> reload<00:01:01.519> rate<00:01:01.760> its<00:01:02.000> average

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
is alright I'll reload rate its average

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.869 
is alright I'll reload rate its average
it<00:01:03.050> looks<00:01:03.320> like<00:01:03.500> it's<00:01:03.680> fast<00:01:04.010> because<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.760> know

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
it looks like it's fast because you know

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.960 
it looks like it's fast because you know
a<00:01:05.120> lot<00:01:05.390> of<00:01:05.420> things<00:01:05.570> are<00:01:05.750> going<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:07.729> it's

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
a lot of things are going on and it's

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.730 
a lot of things are going on and it's
about<00:01:08.450> similar<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.470> an<00:01:09.590> m4<00:01:10.100> in<00:01:10.340> speed<00:01:11.740> the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
about similar to an m4 in speed the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.149 
about similar to an m4 in speed the
accuracy<00:01:13.280> is<00:01:13.310> great<00:01:13.760> it's<00:01:14.090> almost<00:01:14.720> an<00:01:15.260> ak-47

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
accuracy is great it's almost an ak-47

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.270 
accuracy is great it's almost an ak-47
but<00:01:16.790> without<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.299> recoil<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:18.890> almost<00:01:19.130> as

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
but without the recoil so it's almost as

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.370 
but without the recoil so it's almost as
accurate<00:01:19.729> as<00:01:19.850> an<00:01:19.940> ak-47<00:01:20.750> for<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.020> first<00:01:21.229> few

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
accurate as an ak-47 for the first few

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.600 
accurate as an ak-47 for the first few
shots<00:01:21.850> but<00:01:22.850> after<00:01:23.000> that<00:01:23.740> it's<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.340> spray

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
shots but after that it's the spray

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.709 
shots but after that it's the spray
isn't<00:01:26.000> as<00:01:26.119> bad<00:01:26.299> as<00:01:26.600> making<00:01:26.810> 47<00:01:27.380> spray<00:01:27.619> is<00:01:28.719> okay

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
isn't as bad as making 47 spray is okay

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.660 
isn't as bad as making 47 spray is okay
like<00:01:30.439> it<00:01:30.560> will<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.860> spray<00:01:31.100> it's<00:01:31.369> not<00:01:31.520> too

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
like it will the spray it's not too

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.310 
like it will the spray it's not too
shabby<00:01:31.880> it's<00:01:32.240> definitely<00:01:32.659> not<00:01:32.750> as<00:01:32.899> bad<00:01:33.049> as<00:01:33.079> in

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
shabby it's definitely not as bad as in

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.880 
shabby it's definitely not as bad as in
AK<00:01:33.740> but<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.210> controllable<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.530> if<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:36.710> had

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
AK but it is controllable so if you had

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.980 
AK but it is controllable so if you had
to<00:01:37.100> spray<00:01:37.369> you<00:01:37.609> could<00:01:37.850> control<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.299> although<00:01:38.750> I

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
to spray you could control it although I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.420 
to spray you could control it although I
found<00:01:39.439> that's<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.710> little<00:01:40.060> erotic<00:01:41.060> at<00:01:41.329> times

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
found that's a little erotic at times

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.340

mid-match<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:23.150> similar<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.720> m4<00:02:24.110> in

count<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:39.530> it's<00:02:39.650> definitely<00:02:39.800> going<00:02:40.190> to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
count but it's definitely going to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.760 
count but it's definitely going to
consider<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.910> consider<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:42.230> if<00:02:42.560> you're

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
consider so consider that if you're
