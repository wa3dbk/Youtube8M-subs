00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.169

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.480
 we already saw in other chapters of this 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.790
 same series 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.190

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.230

 waiting for you to have stands and lulú 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.730
 and we also have a possible new skin 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.030
 that they take out inside their mouthpiece a 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.400
 summer because it's already over for 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.110
 we go those from the southern hemisphere 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.260

 the sap skin to party the pool 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.910

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.400
 to all the champions who also have 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.710
 your skins of this subject we have to 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.330
 fidel space tries to transmit the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.900
 sticks we have to lie is already 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.200
 katarína and in the upper right 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.590
 from the picture we can see Wayne and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.590
 tristan 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.360
 in this splash is your artist and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.130
 he discovers what he carries on his back 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.800
 Wears tropical tan solar cream 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.020
 from táriq that has very very little 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.470
 Sunscreen is probably English 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.140
 bandaged up to the face because it has 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.790
 burned because it carries so little protection 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.170
 solar is the done 2 now that we have 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.990
 whole body and I have to take everything 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.360
 bandaged also a note on the table 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.710
 Zinc is now in translation 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.990
 literally is the water table mark 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.369
 bilges and bilges in Spanish 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.200
 means a dirty water with a lot 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.780
 filth and a lot of dirt with a lot 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.790
 bad smell that would be what it is going 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.790
 while pulling poisons people 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.769
 is to displace is the lumberjack sion is a 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.560
 tribute to a typical character of 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.420
 American folklore is called folk funjan 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.020
 or bunyan I do not know how they pronounced it 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.290
 they 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.000
 if you do not know who it is, it has come out 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.710
 example in chapters of the simpson well 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.030
 that if you look for it, sure what 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.880
 you find is a pretty chapter 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.270
 fun and good I tell you a little bit 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.370
 the history of poland and that is that you 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.100
 grants to the creation for example of the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.930
 ten of the ten thousand minnesota lakes 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.960
 from his footprints since it was a 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.530
 very big name and is accompanied by his 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.030
 web that is called baby gave I go blue in 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.130
 this case they have not put the blue boy 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.530
 simply that blue convulsions have 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.630
 merged into the two you will also be 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.640
 grants to the creation of the Grand Canyon 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.400
 because dust was no longer wearing 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.670
 his ax crawled and that's why he made a 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.730
 great canyon and also the mist of the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.890
 west coast because this lumberjack 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.959
 like water in a pipe was such a pipe 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.320
 great that the smoke did not dissipate and 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.120
 created this haze in this corner that 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.310
 is to veigar gray beard is a tribute to 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.350
 gandalf the lord of the rings who 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.480
 sure you know him all in fact he's going 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.550
 mounted on one of the eagles that save 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.350
 by the civilian actor and the tower of 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.900
 saruman one of the first times that 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.420
 eagles appear in this room in 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.610
 this one is one of the most recent 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.850
 is the perspective of the skin splash of 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.830
 pool tips and several 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.230
 champions sunbathing here you have them 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.510
 and lioness also appears but in this 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.300
 case the party skin has not been put on 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.000
 the pool as you see carries the little ears 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.070
 that brings the protection to the headband that 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.650
 so carry on those who original too 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.690
 in the water appears in catarina driven and 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.200
 they run away from fix because it's going to 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.990
 pull and as a point in the tower of 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.239
 lifeguards 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.620
 it was badly put because from the 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.970
 perspective of those that interconnect 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.580
 would have to be on the right and in 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.050
 this case is on the left in this no 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.510
 There is a lot to say but good to call the 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.670
 attention that in the corner 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.560
 william santa claus appears we are 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.290
 leaving the house as if it were the 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.000
 cuckoo clock and in this is the one 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.010
 we have put in the previous 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.569
 spotlight or in the previous chapter 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.779
 of 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.429
 to move and if you look at the 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:44.589
 bottom of the pool appears the face of 

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:46.270
 ur so we know that we are 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:49.899
 from the perspective of the head of a 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.809
 and tics are looking at the animal and ccoo and 

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:55.779
 finally in the move of james 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:58.749
 mafia as you see appear good is 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:00.939
 has not yet left in the official already 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:03.270
 when you see her here you have her 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:06.580
 when you see it, you will complain more 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.709
 you also have tweets and my fortune 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.529
 of magic and we have at the bottom of the 

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:14.110
 image a character that we create 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.309
 that furrowed that they will still get a skin 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.139
 of magic of ur bots 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:19.360
 but we're not sure so if 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.039
 you have some idea you need to leave it in 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.659
 the comments so that people what 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:27.240
 know and well this is all like you subscribed 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.860
 if you are not 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.860
 and nothing until the next video
