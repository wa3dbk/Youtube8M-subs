 the Koreans in the president I recommend that we declare war immediately 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.310
 If it were a leash, there would be 200,000 troops crossing the area 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.690
 demilitarized maybe it was an accident did an exercise a test 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.010

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:36.350
 believe that the ship has suffered an electronic warfare attack 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.200
 impregnable bag systems are not possible 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.000
 the central golf system are designed by the cards that 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.060
 They identified two of the greatest experts in computer theory 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.299
 one of them appeared dead in Peru last week 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.299

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.110

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.040
 but d what 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.500

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.659

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.589
 that's good for your business 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:22.789
 What are you doing here I'm looking for a guy named Milan injured I think it works for you 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.729
 many people work for me 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.379
 you have not heard 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.239
 the first security firm to enter Fort 500 if you are looking for work already 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.819
 I'm serious if you keep doing what they do is you'll be like the soldier 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.019
 unknown did not seek fame 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.189
 I took with the ips is not clean 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.780
 valencia 3 oct unlike others I do not get away from the problems 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.259
 if you have evidence against my people 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:52.889
 I'll help you catch him but I'm not going to sink anyone in the mud just for 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.009
 gas title I understand 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.809
 but do not get in my way 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.299
 thanks for the advice 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.299
 If you change your mind 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.789
 if we present ourselves to which state will be a war before 24 hours 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.280
 you have to bring it to be yes but look since you have taken it down 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.439
 to protect it 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.829
 I do not know if sector is involved but I want to know 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.769
 Whatever happens, I do not want your personal friendship to interpose 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.899
 start certain coincidences 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:31.169
 I know that if he is the only living person who could organize the sinking of the guayas 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.400
 although he had launched Korea, he would have needed the help of being 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.149
 yes to reach the boat 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:41.529
 and this matter of quispicanchis is so I prefer that to hear it but I think that 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.409
 that plan is involved 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.680
 the kidnapping of Martin jol the transfer of being that if after the blackout 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:51.969
 Apparently displays rented all the shelter 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.209
 it's a quiet place do not expect high technology 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.429
 you will find sentinels alert to the environment 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.679
 you will have to resort to more traditional methods personal contact the farc 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:08.189

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.670
 while I will be japan 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.079
 yesterday we discovered that displays hired this shelter and our agents have 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.680
 placed microphones on it unfortunately we had not anticipated the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.390
 importance of that place and those microphones can be detected by 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.860
 conventional tools it goes without saying that displays should not 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.789
 find the 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.259
 fratti to be 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.099

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.669
