the<00:02:01.590> snv's<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.340> ridiculous<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:03.000> this

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the snv's are just ridiculous in this

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.569 
the snv's are just ridiculous in this
game<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.570> i'm<00:02:03.960> using<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.409> MSMC<00:02:04.860> which<00:02:05.369> in

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
game and i'm using the MSMC which in

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.370 
game and i'm using the MSMC which in
case<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.909> guys<00:02:06.060> didn't<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.659> hands-down

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
case you guys didn't know is hands-down

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.710 
case you guys didn't know is hands-down
my<00:02:07.500> favorite<00:02:07.729> SMG<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.599> with

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
my favorite SMG and I like it with

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.320 
my favorite SMG and I like it with
silencer<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.009> fast<00:02:11.430> mags<00:02:11.700> attachment

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
silencer and the fast mags attachment

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.370 
silencer and the fast mags attachment
the<00:02:12.420> fast<00:02:12.720> mag

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the fast mag

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.530 
the fast mag
allows<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> reload<00:02:14.610> faster<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.450> my

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
allows you to reload faster and in my

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.790 
allows you to reload faster and in my
opinion<00:02:15.630> allows<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.380> little<00:02:16.620> bit

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
opinion allows you to be a little bit

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.490 
opinion allows you to be a little bit
more<00:02:16.950> aggressive<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.520> your<00:02:17.670> game<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:19.260> top

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
more aggressive in your game so on top

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.870 
more aggressive in your game so on top
of<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.800> if<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.190> are<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.730> for

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
of that if you are going for

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.840 
of that if you are going for
specifically<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:21.990> nuclear<00:02:22.410> first<00:02:23.040> first<00:02:23.700> of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
specifically for nuclear first first of

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.070 
specifically for nuclear first first of
all<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:23.940> would<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.330> say<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> don't

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
all I would like to say that I don't

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.630 
all I would like to say that I don't
think<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.530> should<00:02:25.560> actually<00:02:25.950> go<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.580> a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
think you should actually go for a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.420 
think you should actually go for a
nuclear<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> think<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.920> kind<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.250> just

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
nuclear because I think you kind of just

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.040 
nuclear because I think you kind of just
happen<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.820> get<00:02:29.970> them<00:02:30.180> sometimes<00:02:30.630> when<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.900> do

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
happen to get them sometimes when you do

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.900 
happen to get them sometimes when you do
go<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.350> big<00:02:31.710> streak<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.250> didn't<00:02:32.520> expect

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
go on a big streak like I didn't expect

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.210 
go on a big streak like I didn't expect
to<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.600> nuclear<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.290> game<00:02:34.560> until<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.890> wat

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
to get a nuclear this game until I wat

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.740 
to get a nuclear this game until I wat
rewatch<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> gameplay<00:02:36.120> I'm<00:02:36.240> like<00:02:36.390> oh<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.510> got<00:02:36.720> a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
rewatch the gameplay I'm like oh I got a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.900 
rewatch the gameplay I'm like oh I got a
nuclear<00:02:37.140> but<00:02:37.650> yeah<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.460> don't<00:02:38.490> try

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
nuclear but yeah so you know don't try

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.490 
nuclear but yeah so you know don't try
to<00:02:39.060> go<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.480> one<00:02:39.630> but<00:02:39.780> if<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.990> really<00:02:40.380> really

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500

helped me be a little bit more

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.900 
helped me be a little bit more
aggressively<00:03:01.350> they<00:03:02.040> play<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> little<00:03:02.610> bit<00:03:02.790> more

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
aggressively they play a little bit more

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
aggressively when I have them up I could

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.320 
aggressively when I have them up I could
rush<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.710> little<00:03:05.010> bit<00:03:05.100> more<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.340> etc<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:06.180> yeah

rush a little bit more and etc but yeah
you<00:03:06.390> know<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.840> would<00:03:07.080> just<00:03:07.890> suggest<00:03:08.010> those

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
you know I would just suggest those

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.760 
you know I would just suggest those
lower<00:03:08.640> streaks<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.600> can<00:03:09.990> support<00:03:10.380> your<00:03:10.500> team

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
lower streaks that can support your team

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.500 
lower streaks that can support your team
and<00:03:11.040> yourself<00:03:11.520> in<00:03:11.700> other<00:03:11.880> ways<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.420> allow

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
and yourself in other ways that allow

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.690 
and yourself in other ways that allow
you<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.750> get<00:03:12.960> as<00:03:13.110> many<00:03:13.260> gun<00:03:13.560> kills<00:03:13.830> as<00:03:14.070> possible

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
you to get as many gun kills as possible

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.950 
you to get as many gun kills as possible
because<00:03:15.030> that's<00:03:15.240> what<00:03:15.390> you're<00:03:15.510> trying<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.810> do

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
because that's what you're trying to do

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.020 
because that's what you're trying to do
when<00:03:16.260> going<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.710> nuclear<00:03:16.920> metal<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.460> as

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
when going for a nuclear metal and as

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.430 
when going for a nuclear metal and as
for<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.270> rest<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.540> my<00:03:18.600> kill<00:03:18.840> streak<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.230> use

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
for the rest of my kill streak I use

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.460 
for the rest of my kill streak I use
first<00:03:19.710> /<00:03:19.890> agreed<00:03:20.190> with<00:03:20.520> silencer<00:03:21.150> and

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
first / agreed with silencer and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.540 
first / agreed with silencer and
silencer<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:22.620> not<00:03:22.740> even<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.980> perk<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.400> just

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
silencer it's not even a perk I just

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.670 
silencer it's not even a perk I just
invented<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:24.120> purse<00:03:24.360> silencer<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.320> first<00:03:25.560> part

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
invented a purse silencer the first part

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.860 
invented a purse silencer the first part
goes<00:03:26.040> hard<00:03:26.370> line<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.510> wouldn't<00:03:27.780> really

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
goes hard line and I wouldn't really

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.570 
goes hard line and I wouldn't really
recommend<00:03:27.960> using<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.650> hard<00:03:28.770> line<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.220> mean<00:03:29.430> it's

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
recommend using a hard line I mean it's

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.760 
recommend using a hard line I mean it's
still<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.790> good<00:03:29.970> perk<00:03:30.270> no<00:03:30.450> matter<00:03:30.630> what<00:03:30.930> but<00:03:31.470> if

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
still a good perk no matter what but if

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.140 
still a good perk no matter what but if
you're<00:03:31.980> going<00:03:32.130> for<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.370> nuclear<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.880> probably

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
you're going for a nuclear you probably

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.460 
you're going for a nuclear you probably
want<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.450> take<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.780> out<00:03:33.840> for<00:03:34.080> something<00:03:34.260> else

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
want to take that out for something else

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.020 
want to take that out for something else
I<00:03:34.620> don't<00:03:34.740> know<00:03:34.800> maybe<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.070> do<00:03:35.220> want<00:03:35.250> hardline

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
I don't know maybe you do want hardline

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.580 
I don't know maybe you do want hardline
then<00:03:36.210> that's<00:03:36.360> fine<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.900> just<00:03:37.290> wouldn't

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
then that's fine but I just wouldn't

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.850 
then that's fine but I just wouldn't
recommend<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.130> second<00:03:39.120> perk<00:03:39.360> greed<00:03:39.990> scavenger

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
recommend it second perk greed scavenger

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.980 
recommend it second perk greed scavenger
toughness<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.520> third<00:03:41.880> perk<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.360> like<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.840> use

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
toughness and third perk I like to use

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.130 
toughness and third perk I like to use
tak<00:03:43.320> mask<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.330> is<00:03:45.330> my<00:03:45.480> general<00:03:45.660> class

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
tak mask so that is my general class

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.570 
tak mask so that is my general class
setup<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.740> can<00:03:46.860> use<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.160> with<00:03:47.340> pretty

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
setup and you can use that with pretty

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.520 
setup and you can use that with pretty
much<00:03:47.700> any<00:03:47.940> setup<00:03:48.270> but<00:03:48.930> yeah<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:49.320> if<00:03:49.380> we're

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
much any setup but yeah so if we're

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.080 
much any setup but yeah so if we're
going<00:03:49.709> for<00:03:49.830> nuclear<00:03:50.160> you<00:03:50.400> want<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.790> remain<00:03:51.030> a

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
going for nuclear you want to remain a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.940 
going for nuclear you want to remain a
little<00:03:51.480> bit<00:03:51.630> defensive<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.320> know<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.440> noticed

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
little bit defensive you know I noticed

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.730 
little bit defensive you know I noticed
that<00:03:53.130> as<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.900> started<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.020> game<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.350> started<00:03:55.620> off

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
that as I started a game I started off

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.460 
that as I started a game I started off
really<00:03:55.980> aggressively<00:03:56.550> but<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.360> slowly<00:03:58.020> little

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
really aggressively but I slowly little

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.160 
really aggressively but I slowly little
by<00:03:58.620> little<00:03:58.709> work<00:03:59.610> towards<00:03:59.970> us<00:04:00.120> more<00:04:00.570> defensive

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
by little work towards us more defensive

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.690 
by little work towards us more defensive
play<00:04:01.320> style<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:01.740> i<00:04:01.770> think<00:04:01.890> i'm<00:04:02.010> out<00:04:02.130> like<00:04:02.160> 10<00:04:02.490> 8

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
play style so i think i'm out like 10 8

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.550 
play style so i think i'm out like 10 8
