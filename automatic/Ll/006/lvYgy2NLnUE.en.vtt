00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:11.280
 Hi Shintaro I am in today's video Daily habits that make my hair worse 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:18.270
 We will deliver about things to be aware of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.470
 I think that most people with a vague hair quality care about their own distinctive hair quality 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.070
 I just care about prevention 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.410
 We've stretched the habit of exacerbating the habit 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:33.590
 Such people may also be inside 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:40.190
 In this video you will be asked if your daily habits are causing your hair to ignite 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:45.530
 By all means to introduce their own training ship and here in the has become an indicator for 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.400
 Whether or not there is a point to be improved and I compared the habit to cell GEO worse 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.840
 Please try to reference 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.760
 Hmm 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.050
 Then we will introduce the habit of making hair worse immediately. 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.199
 First of all, I sleep with that one hair I got used to 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:07.399
 This is the first bad habit 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:09.170
 Wet hair is very weak and in the teacher state, so if you are in the habit of sleeping with your hair wet, 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.750
 Need attention 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.020
 Wet hair is rubbed by turning over and head 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:24.460
 It will be easily damaged by pressure by weight etc. 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:31.020
 The hair from the wet state was dried naturally this order would the habit in the presence of Umeri 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:35.969
 If you have a habit like this, please make sure to lend Kamioka before going to bed and then go to bed 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:43.710
 Not dry the hair followed by dryer in two eyes a bath 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:45.719
 This is the second bad habit. The bad habit and the reason that it sleeps in the wet condition as mentioned above . 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.010
 Will be the same but 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:53.550
 In When the hair will naturally dry in the wet state of swell state 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.200
 It will be easier to connect to your back 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:05.790
 So please make sure to dry your hair firmly after bath 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:09.380
 At this time , instead of lending him using a dryer immediately, wrap the hair gently with a towel 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:15.890
 Please try to drain on feeling 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:18.320
 Escape the heat applied to the hair dryer from the root after the semi-dry state with a towel 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.070
 While shaking the voice actor in the image 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.050
 It is the point of scolding 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:30.500
 Straight palm with staring iron 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:33.800
 Basically, if you use straight perms and hair straightening well 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:39.560
 It's a very effective way to fix hair 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.260
 However, if you do this too much , your hair will be damaged and it will become pasapasa. 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.349
 It becomes 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:51.720
 The time has passed since the cuticle on the hair surface will melt and disappear if you use an iron 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:57.960
 It leads to stronger habit when the hair is damaged 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:03.569
 So let's be careful about the frequency of straight perms using iron 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:09.480
 And lastly the salt of the hair care products 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:12.299
 Shampoos and treatments containing coatings and additives adhere to the pores 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:18.299
 The swell may be strong 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:19.349
 It changes not only the swell but also hair loss, so change the shampoo after kneading 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.590
 It became severe 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.060
 If there is no increase in the system , try a non-additive shampoo 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.930
 Please 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.700
 Since high-grade alcohol-based 6 shampoos can be manufactured inexpensively, they are widely distributed in the home 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.730
 But these 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:45.080
 Because the cleansing power is too strong, it will take sebum necessary for the scalp 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:52.100
 A kind of lost and spending is becoming overly secreting sebum 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:54.650
 It is easy to get stuck in the pores and it causes the hair to be formed, so it's in the room product you are using 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.330
 Please do give a target 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:03.050
 This is an example of a habit that makes your hair worse 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.560
 Then is today's summary part 1 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.099
 Sleep with wet hair 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:13.050
 2 Do not dry with a dryer after bath 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:17.430
 Straight Palmer with Iron 3 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:21.680
 The salt of the hair product which strengthens the 4 swell 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:27.440
 The above four are examples of habits that make prevention worse 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:31.430
 In particular, those who have had their hair not given enough science or worse their habitual hair 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:38.009
 There may be very many people using cheap goods 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:44.309
 Let's keep these in mind and make sure not to do bad habits that lead to prevention 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:46.860
 Summarize recommended shampoos and easy prevention and improvement techniques for those who have heavy hair 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:52.979
