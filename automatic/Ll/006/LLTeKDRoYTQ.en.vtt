00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello i am rebecca of elf child 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.370
 Berlin 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.710
 and no it is not fashionable 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.660
 accessory that is a towel turban 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.759
 I think we all know that wet 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.920
 hair you make somehow that 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.859
 towel drones and it keeps falling 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.630
 every artist drips and it annoys 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.740
 I show you today how to do it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.119
 He can just keep sewing 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.470
 what you need it once as 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.480
 cut pattern you can on 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.140
 download my blog then a piece 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.910
 what i 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.710
 there you can use by meter or 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.170
 also just an old towel here 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.820
 after the purchase you'll need it then 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.610
 you have some nice buttons i have 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.730
 related buttons here and you need 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.290
 oblique band and diagonal band there are 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.270
 now two different ones once this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.760
 normal that still has to be folded 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.190
 when sewing and then there are already finished 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.629
 Of course, that's what makes it folded 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.629
 sew a lot easier 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.940
 I have my toweling cloth 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.219
 laid out and fall to him now like that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.729
 I lay two has superimposed 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.560
 put my man cuts too if you 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.909
 not so tailoring scooter has left 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.100
 Of course, also wonderful with one 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 scissors almost there were in the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.030
 carve included if you but one 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.799
 that's a bit cheating too 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.450
 no problem at all the cut 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.000
 I have for you directly in two sizes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.950
 So erase once for small and once 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 for big people so once for mom 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.759
 and once for kinda i have that now 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.020
 pleased the fabric placed right to right 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.780
 which, of course , actually goes away 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.510
 does not matter because both sides are 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.030
 nice so 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.480
 just the nicer I take that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.630
 whole with a normal wheel stitch and 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:45.460
 with a stitch length of 25 and sewn 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.240
 now this side here is to 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.300
 left open 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.780
 thus feet take width easy 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.780
 getting started 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.009
 we have already done so and now 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.450
 Sewn everything it just needs to be taken care of 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.430
 It can be with a normal one 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.610
 zigzag stitch made or overlook 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.440
 be honest , it has to be partie too 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.660
 not necessarily be as you do not feel like it 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.920
 you can just leave it now 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.459
 The whole thing is on the nice side 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.800
 turned and here at the bottom 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.959
 where the nato is now that is oblique 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.280
 tape attached so sees the diagonal band 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.750
 from below 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.760
 this is now set to one works 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.290
 and pinned it will be easy 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.920
 sewn firmly again with a normal 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.920
 grad stands and after stitch length of 25 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.540
 Now we have reached the end now 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.430

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.430
 diagonally soon hidden by ryan 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:06.440
 if I'm back in front of something 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.440

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.879
 and once to the end money 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.860
 with this one piece we now lay 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:29.070
 here a bend and now the still 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.070
 times 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.390
 Now only the button has to be sewn on 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.850
 and then our towel is turbo 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.720
 already finished the button about 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.610
 fingernail wide and then sat here like this 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.620
 a bit of an emotional thing right now 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.190
 The nato is about again 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.540

 just once again found the misplaced it works 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:25.720
 so through the flabby 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.720

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.979
 so and finished is our towel turban 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.300
