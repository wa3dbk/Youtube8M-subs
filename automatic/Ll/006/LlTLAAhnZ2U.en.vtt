simple and all you have to do is get

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
simple and all you have to do is get
three<00:01:16.229> slifer<00:01:16.830> rifle<00:01:17.130> ribbons<00:01:17.550> and<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.090> also

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
three slifer rifle ribbons and you also

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.050 
three slifer rifle ribbons and you also
need<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.539> get<00:01:18.630> five<00:01:18.960> kills<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:19.619> c4<00:01:20.340> or<00:01:20.610> naval

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
need to get five kills with c4 or naval

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.040 
need to get five kills with c4 or naval
strike<00:01:21.390> Maps

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
strike Maps

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.590 
strike Maps
now<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.560> shouldn't<00:01:22.770> take<00:01:22.890> too<00:01:23.009> long<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.850> I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
now this shouldn't take too long and I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.480 
now this shouldn't take too long and I
think<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.380> does<00:01:25.440> not<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.160> be<00:01:26.250> done<00:01:26.460> in

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
think this does not have to be done in

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
think this does not have to be done in
one<00:01:26.700> round<00:01:27.150> because<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.900> states<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.799> can

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
one round because it states that you can

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.969 
one round because it states that you can
get<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.430> 5<00:01:29.670> c4<00:01:29.939> kills<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.630> naval<00:01:31.140> strike<00:01:31.439> maps

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
get to 5 c4 kills on naval strike maps

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.690 
get to 5 c4 kills on naval strike maps
with<00:01:32.759> plural<00:01:33.420> yeah<00:01:33.780> Maps<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.619> know<00:01:34.860> grammar<00:01:35.250> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
with plural yeah Maps I know grammar so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.330 
with plural yeah Maps I know grammar so
with<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.810> being<00:01:36.990> said<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.829> not<00:01:37.950> supposed

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
with this being said it's not supposed

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.670 
with this being said it's not supposed
to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.520> done<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.000> map<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.570> several<00:01:39.960> Maps

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to be done on one map but several Maps

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.069 
to be done on one map but several Maps
so<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> hope<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.909> made<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.299> clear<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> don't

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
so I hope I made that clear so I don't

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.210 
so I hope I made that clear so I don't
think<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.680> everything<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.159> one

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
think you have to do everything in one

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.800 
think you have to do everything in one
rod<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.729> good<00:01:45.060> because<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.479> second

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
rod which is good because in second

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.270 
rod which is good because in second
assault<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.409> China<00:01:46.770> rising<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.159> know

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
assault and China rising you know

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.069 
assault and China rising you know
applies<00:01:47.579> some<00:01:47.880> some<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> guns<00:01:48.720> had<00:01:48.960> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
applies some some of the guns had to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.630 
applies some some of the guns had to
have<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.619> unlocked<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.189> round<00:01:50.369> which

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
have to be unlocked in one round which

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.190 
have to be unlocked in one round which
was<00:01:50.820> kind<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.090> challenging<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> seems

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
was kind of challenging but it seems

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.050 
was kind of challenging but it seems
like<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> case<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.490> naval

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
like this is not the case in naval

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.910 
like this is not the case in naval
strike<00:01:54.299> at<00:01:54.479> least<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.869> slapper<00:01:55.259> rifle<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
strike at least for the slapper rifle so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
strike at least for the slapper rifle so
with<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> way<00:01:56.939> let<00:01:57.180> me<00:01:57.210> go<00:01:57.420> ahead

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
with that out of the way let me go ahead

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.270 
with that out of the way let me go ahead
and<00:01:57.750> shove<00:01:57.930> some<00:01:58.170> stats<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:58.950> throats

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and shove some stats down your throats

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
and shove some stats down your throats
because<00:01:59.490> some<00:01:59.909> people<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.240> stats<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.049> some

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
because some people like stats and some

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.899 
because some people like stats and some
people<00:02:01.530> don't<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.890> stats<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> want<00:02:02.850> to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
people don't like stats but I want to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.149 
people don't like stats but I want to
satisfy<00:02:03.360> everyone<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.500> go<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
satisfy everyone so here we go the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.219 
satisfy everyone so here we go the
maximum<00:02:05.549> damage<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.000> set<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.329> 15<00:02:06.750> drops<00:02:07.049> down

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
maximum damage is set to 15 drops down

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.979 
maximum damage is set to 15 drops down
to<00:02:07.439> 38<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.790> bullet<00:02:09.090> velocity<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.630> somewhere

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
to 38 the bullet velocity is somewhere

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.440 
to 38 the bullet velocity is somewhere
between<00:02:10.170> 500<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.280> 300<00:02:11.549> we're<00:02:12.090> not<00:02:12.209> quite<00:02:12.390> sure

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
between 500 and 300 we're not quite sure

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.120 
between 500 and 300 we're not quite sure
yet<00:02:12.690> because<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.290> don't<00:02:13.320> have<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:13.829> of<00:02:14.010> the

bullets you had in the magazine before

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.600 
bullets you had in the magazine before
reloading<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.410> also<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.769> ten<00:02:23.070> plus<00:02:23.250> one

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
reloading and you also have ten plus one

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.460 
reloading and you also have ten plus one
bullets<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.090> magazine<00:02:24.140> depending<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.320> how

many bullets you had in there child
before<00:02:27.150> reloading<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.590> now<00:02:28.769> let's<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.070> a

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
before reloading so now let's have a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.800 
before reloading so now let's have a
look<00:02:29.280> at<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.579> gun<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.030> why<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> think<00:02:30.359> it<00:02:30.690> is

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
look at this gun and why I think it is

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.140 
look at this gun and why I think it is
so<00:02:31.109> bad<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.889> what<00:02:32.340> kind<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.519> setup<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.940> would

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
so bad and what kind of setup I would

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.849 
so bad and what kind of setup I would
recommend<00:02:33.570> using<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.079> ever<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.650> use

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
recommend using if you ever want to use

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.100 
recommend using if you ever want to use
this<00:02:35.130> gun<00:02:35.370> so

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
this gun so

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.780 
this gun so
you<00:02:36.200> know<00:02:36.320> in<00:02:36.590> every<00:02:37.040> single<00:02:37.190> school<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.640> have

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
you know in every single school you have

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.190 
you know in every single school you have
this<00:02:37.940> kind<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.150> weird<00:02:38.210> kid<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.810> just<00:02:39.050> nobody

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
this kind of weird kid that just nobody

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.360 
this kind of weird kid that just nobody
understands

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
understands

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.460 
understands
I<00:02:40.400> think<00:02:40.670> this<00:02:41.210> gun<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.600> pretty<00:02:41.780> much<00:02:41.990> that<00:02:42.170> kid

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
I think this gun is pretty much that kid

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.230 
I think this gun is pretty much that kid
he's<00:02:42.650> trying<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.100> look<00:02:43.550> like<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.760> deer<00:02:44.030> mouse

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
he's trying to look like the deer mouse

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240 
he's trying to look like the deer mouse
but<00:02:44.480> he<00:02:44.570> just<00:02:44.780> cannot<00:02:45.110> do<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.710> he<00:02:46.040> just

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
but he just cannot do it and he just

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.790 
but he just cannot do it and he just
ends<00:02:46.490> up<00:02:46.610> being<00:02:46.670> being<00:02:47.510> crap<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.230> think<00:02:48.650> that's

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
ends up being being crap I think that's

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.680 
ends up being being crap I think that's
a<00:02:48.860> very<00:02:49.010> good<00:02:49.250> explanation<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.510> course

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
a very good explanation so of course

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.750 
a very good explanation so of course
with<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.110> fifty<00:02:51.560> maximum<00:02:52.070> damage<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:52.730> are

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
with the fifty maximum damage you are

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.090 
with the fifty maximum damage you are
able<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.270> one<00:02:53.630> hit<00:02:53.840> people<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.410> very<00:02:54.710> close

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
able to one hit people on very close

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.070 
able to one hit people on very close
range<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.640> would<00:02:55.700> say<00:02:55.970> within<00:02:56.330> maybe<00:02:56.600> seven

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
range I would say within maybe seven

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.190 
range I would say within maybe seven
meters<00:02:57.440> which<00:02:58.030> isn't<00:02:59.030> too<00:02:59.390> bad<00:02:59.630> so<00:02:59.870> if<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.050> go

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
meters which isn't too bad so if you go

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.080 
meters which isn't too bad so if you go
really<00:03:00.410> close<00:03:00.830> with<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.190> gun<00:03:01.460> you<00:03:01.640> can't<00:03:01.910> get

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
really close with this gun you can't get

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.060 
really close with this gun you can't get
it<00:03:02.209> one<00:03:02.420> hits<00:03:02.630> head<00:03:02.840> shots<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:03.709> there<00:03:03.980> really

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
it one hits head shots but there really

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.860 
it one hits head shots but there really
is<00:03:04.310> no<00:03:04.459> point<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.000> because<00:03:05.360> on<00:03:05.600> really

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
is no point to this because on really

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.840 
is no point to this because on really
close<00:03:06.110> range<00:03:06.470> getting<00:03:07.250> at<00:03:07.370> what<00:03:07.520> hit<00:03:07.670> head

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
close range getting at what hit head

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.370 
close range getting at what hit head
shot<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.120> really<00:03:08.450> hard<00:03:08.690> because<00:03:08.840> they<00:03:09.200> are

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
shot is really hard because they are

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.930 
shot is really hard because they are
really<00:03:09.560> close<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.190> their<00:03:10.340> head<00:03:10.580> will<00:03:10.790> be

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
really close and their head will be

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.790 
really close and their head will be
wobbling<00:03:11.420> forth<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.870> back<00:03:12.020> that's<00:03:12.530> kind<00:03:12.740> of

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
wobbling forth and back that's kind of

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800 
wobbling forth and back that's kind of
what<00:03:12.980> she<00:03:13.010> said<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.610> therefore<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.480> really

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
what she said and therefore it is really

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.330 
what she said and therefore it is really
hard<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.140> hit<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.380> mini<00:03:15.530> head<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.040> get<00:03:16.160> that

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
hard to hit the mini head and get that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.370 
hard to hit the mini head and get that
one<00:03:16.520> hit<00:03:16.670> kill<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.180> if<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.630> try<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.870> spam<00:03:18.230> it

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
one hit kill and if you try to spam it

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.930 
one hit kill and if you try to spam it
like<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> DMR<00:03:19.070> then<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.610> will<00:03:19.760> not<00:03:19.910> work

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
like a DMR then that will not work

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.360 
like a DMR then that will not work
because<00:03:20.720> your<00:03:21.080> bullets<00:03:21.380> will<00:03:21.560> literally<00:03:21.890> fly

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
because your bullets will literally fly

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.250 
because your bullets will literally fly
everywhere<00:03:23.270> and<00:03:23.420> totally<00:03:23.750> know<00:03:23.900> where<00:03:24.080> you

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
everywhere and totally know where you

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.110 
everywhere and totally know where you
are<00:03:24.440> aiming<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.040> that's<00:03:25.160> why<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:26.000> would

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
are aiming and that's why you would

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.060 
are aiming and that's why you would
rather<00:03:26.300> have<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.630> DMR<00:03:27.110> o<00:03:27.170> close<00:03:27.470> range<00:03:27.800> because

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
rather have a DMR o close range because

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.710 
rather have a DMR o close range because
that<00:03:28.250> would<00:03:28.430> do<00:03:28.580> what<00:03:28.820> Batson<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.390> can<00:03:29.540> just

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
that would do what Batson you can just

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.110 
that would do what Batson you can just
spam<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.140> but<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:30.440> gun<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:31.190> cannot<00:03:31.459> spam<00:03:31.850> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
spam it but this gun you cannot spam and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.180 
spam it but this gun you cannot spam and
and<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.540> kind<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.020> sucks<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.739> makes<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.130> a

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
and that kind of sucks and makes it a

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.100 
and that kind of sucks and makes it a
bit<00:03:34.340> worse<00:03:34.550> so<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.090> may<00:03:35.330> be<00:03:35.360> thinking<00:03:35.510> at<00:03:35.989> this

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
bit worse so you may be thinking at this

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.080 
bit worse so you may be thinking at this
point<00:03:36.170> ok<00:03:36.770> this<00:03:37.040> gun<00:03:37.280> might<00:03:37.520> be<00:03:37.730> good<00:03:37.970> on

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
point ok this gun might be good on

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.960 
point ok this gun might be good on
medium<00:03:38.570> range<00:03:38.780> no<00:03:39.470> it's<00:03:39.830> it's<00:03:40.100> even<00:03:40.549> worse<00:03:40.760> on

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
medium range no it's it's even worse on

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.000 
medium range no it's it's even worse on
medium<00:03:41.269> range<00:03:41.480> why<00:03:41.780> because<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.620> will<00:03:42.769> never

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
medium range why because you will never

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.860 
medium range why because you will never
get<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.400> one<00:03:43.730> hit<00:03:43.970> kill<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.450> head<00:03:44.660> you

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
get that one hit kill in the head you

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.870 
get that one hit kill in the head you
need<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.320> be<00:03:45.440> super<00:03:45.980> close<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.250> get<00:03:46.549> that<00:03:46.700> one

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
need to be super close to get that one

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.870 
need to be super close to get that one
hits<00:03:47.120> headshots<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:49.310> just<00:03:49.549> leaves<00:03:49.670> you

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
hits headshots and that just leaves you

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.300 
hits headshots and that just leaves you
to<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.150> crap<00:03:50.570> gun<00:03:50.900> but<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.200> found<00:03:51.530> that<00:03:51.920> if<00:03:52.280> you

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
to a crap gun but I found that if you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.430 
to a crap gun but I found that if you
really<00:03:52.790> just<00:03:52.820> if<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:53.510> for<00:03:53.840> some<00:03:53.959> reason<00:03:54.019> want

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
really just if you for some reason want

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.050 
really just if you for some reason want
to<00:03:54.530> use<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:54.860> gun<00:03:55.130> then<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.489> would<00:03:55.910> recommend

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
to use this gun then I would recommend

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.240 
to use this gun then I would recommend
using<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:56.690> on<00:03:56.810> medium<00:03:56.989> range<00:03:57.350> because<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.070> guess

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
using it on medium range because I guess

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.280 
using it on medium range because I guess
that's<00:03:58.489> where<00:03:58.700> it's<00:03:58.850> best<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.630> you<00:04:00.140> would

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
that's where it's best and you would

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.720 
that's where it's best and you would
rather<00:04:00.440> want<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.739> use<00:04:00.830> some<00:04:01.040> maybe<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.400> medium

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
rather want to use some maybe a medium

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.240 
rather want to use some maybe a medium
range<00:04:01.880> scope<00:04:02.299> or<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.540> 6<00:04:02.930> X<00:04:03.170> scope<00:04:03.620> but<00:04:03.860> I<00:04:03.890> never

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
range scope or the 6 X scope but I never

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.310 
range scope or the 6 X scope but I never
go<00:04:04.489> with<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.670> long<00:04:04.970> range<00:04:05.239> or<00:04:05.570> a<00:04:05.630> really<00:04:05.989> close

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
go with a long range or a really close

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.840 
go with a long range or a really close
range<00:04:06.560> scope<00:04:06.860> with<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.220> gun<00:04:07.430> because<00:04:07.670> that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
range scope with this gun because that

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.880 
range scope with this gun because that
just<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.480> just<00:04:08.510> wouldn't<00:04:08.959> work<00:04:09.110> this<00:04:09.470> gun<00:04:09.680> just

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
just it just wouldn't work this gun just

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.100 
just it just wouldn't work this gun just
it<00:04:10.190> doesn't<00:04:10.400> do<00:04:10.670> it<00:04:10.790> on<00:04:10.850> close<00:04:11.090> range<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:11.660> it

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
it doesn't do it on close range and it

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.449 
it doesn't do it on close range and it
just<00:04:12.320> doesn't<00:04:12.560> do<00:04:12.620> in<00:04:12.709> a<00:04:12.799> long<00:04:12.980> range<00:04:13.190> and

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
just doesn't do in a long range and

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.640 
just doesn't do in a long range and
medium<00:04:13.730> ranges<00:04:14.030> is<00:04:14.239> it's<00:04:14.959> where<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.380> shines

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
medium ranges is it's where it shines

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.860 
medium ranges is it's where it shines
but<00:04:16.160> it's<00:04:16.370> not<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.640> very<00:04:17.030> bright<00:04:17.299> shining<00:04:17.660> to

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
but it's not a very bright shining to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.870 
but it's not a very bright shining to
put<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.140> that<00:04:18.290> way<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:18.859> or<00:04:19.220> even<00:04:19.250> though<00:04:19.549> this

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
put it that way so or even though this

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.090 
put it that way so or even though this
gun<00:04:20.180> is<00:04:20.510> really<00:04:21.109> bad<00:04:21.290> and<00:04:21.500> I<00:04:21.590> will<00:04:21.769> probably

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
gun is really bad and I will probably

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.040 
gun is really bad and I will probably
never<00:04:22.520> ever<00:04:22.640> use<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.300> again<00:04:23.390> because<00:04:23.840> I

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
never ever use it again because I

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.250 
never ever use it again because I
absolutely<00:04:24.710> hate<00:04:25.430> it<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.150> cannot<00:04:26.840> use<00:04:27.229> it

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
absolutely hate it and I I cannot use it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.990 
absolutely hate it and I I cannot use it
maybe<00:04:27.650> there<00:04:27.950> is<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.220> one<00:04:28.430> guy<00:04:28.610> out<00:04:28.790> there

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
maybe there is that one guy out there

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.060 
maybe there is that one guy out there
who<00:04:29.150> thinks<00:04:29.450> this<00:04:29.570> gun<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:29.990> amazing<00:04:30.590> but

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
who thinks this gun is amazing but

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.670 
who thinks this gun is amazing but
honestly<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.240> truth<00:04:32.450> is<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:32.810> this<00:04:33.140> gun<00:04:33.410> is

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
honestly the truth is that this gun is

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.800 
honestly the truth is that this gun is
just<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.160> pile<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.550> crap<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.060> they<00:04:35.270> may<00:04:35.540> patch

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
just a pile of crap and they may patch

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.590 
just a pile of crap and they may patch
it<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.169> hope<00:04:36.800> they<00:04:37.010> patch<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.430> because<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:37.970> really

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
it I hope they patch it because I really

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.510 
it I hope they patch it because I really
don't<00:04:38.840> see<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.169> point<00:04:39.200> of<00:04:39.500> this<00:04:39.710> gun<00:04:39.919> at<00:04:40.400> the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
don't see the point of this gun at the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.880 
don't see the point of this gun at the
current<00:04:40.790> state<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.900> game<00:04:41.930> because<00:04:42.770> it

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
current state of the game because it

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.790 
current state of the game because it
just<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.220> doesn't<00:04:43.580> do<00:04:43.790> anything<00:04:44.030> good<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:45.380> just

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
just it doesn't do anything good it just

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.159 
just it doesn't do anything good it just
has<00:04:45.950> no<00:04:46.190> good<00:04:46.460> use<00:04:46.789> and<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.390> just<00:04:47.660> doesn't<00:04:47.840> fit

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
has no good use and it just doesn't fit

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.960
