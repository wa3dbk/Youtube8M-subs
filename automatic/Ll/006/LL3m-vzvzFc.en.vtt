that's<00:02:46.930> still<00:02:47.320> not<00:02:47.500> really<00:02:47.830> widely<00:02:48.040> used<00:02:48.400> at

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
that's still not really widely used at

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.180 
that's still not really widely used at
it's<00:02:49.420> basically<00:02:49.690> an<00:02:49.930> antenna<00:02:50.560> built<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:50.980> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
it's basically an antenna built in the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.150 
it's basically an antenna built in the
the<00:02:52.030> back<00:02:52.180> battery<00:02:52.630> door<00:02:52.780> here<00:02:53.020> which<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.890> as

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
the back battery door here which can as

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.700 
the back battery door here which can as
since<00:02:54.550> when<00:02:54.790> it's<00:02:55.000> near<00:02:55.210> some<00:02:56.050> kind<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.350> sensor

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
since when it's near some kind of sensor

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.980 
since when it's near some kind of sensor
so<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.940> typically<00:02:58.420> going<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.720> be<00:02:58.810> used

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
so this is typically going to be used

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.570 
so this is typically going to be used
for<00:03:00.870> wireless<00:03:01.870> payments<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.710> just<00:03:02.860> tap<00:03:03.430> on

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
for wireless payments so you just tap on

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.840 
for wireless payments so you just tap on
a<00:03:03.640> sensor<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.240> can<00:03:04.390> go<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:06.070> just

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
a sensor and you can go and and and just

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.940 
a sensor and you can go and and and just
walk<00:03:07.150> right<00:03:07.180> off<00:03:07.390> your<00:03:08.380> credit<00:03:08.500> cards<00:03:08.800> already

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
build and stuff like that but it can

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.800 
build and stuff like that but it can

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
also launch a web sites it can open up

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.270 
also launch a web sites it can open up

secure office doors and stuff like that

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.690

but<00:03:16.290> generally<00:03:17.290> speaking<00:03:17.320> it's<00:03:17.860> it's<00:03:18.340> kind<00:03:18.640> of

but generally speaking it's it's kind of

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.440 
but generally speaking it's it's kind of
a<00:03:18.940> niche<00:03:19.860> feature<00:03:20.860> for<00:03:21.190> now<00:03:21.420> definitely<00:03:22.420> a

a niche feature for now definitely a

been software locks on other carriers so
I<00:03:29.380> suspect<00:03:30.070> now<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.550> curve<00:03:30.850> 9360<00:03:31.630> is

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
optical trackpad in the middle here

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.310 
optical trackpad in the middle here
which<00:03:59.560> isn't<00:04:00.160> terrible<00:04:00.670> by<00:04:00.880> any<00:04:00.910> means<00:04:01.240> but<00:04:02.050> if

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
which isn't terrible by any means but if

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.910 
which isn't terrible by any means but if
you're<00:04:03.100> used<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.340> having<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.610> touchscreen<00:04:04.000> I

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
you're used to having a touchscreen I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.170 
you're used to having a touchscreen I
definitely<00:04:05.920> find<00:04:06.250> that<00:04:06.460> you're<00:04:06.610> tapping<00:04:07.090> the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
definitely find that you're tapping the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.670 
definitely find that you're tapping the
screen<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.600> being<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.780> little<00:04:08.080> bit<00:04:08.230> frustrated

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
screen and being a little bit frustrated

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.160 
screen and being a little bit frustrated
once<00:04:08.860> in<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:08.980> while<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:10.360> we'll<00:04:10.630> pull<00:04:10.810> up<00:04:10.900> into

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
once in a while so we'll pull up into

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.430 
once in a while so we'll pull up into
mobile<00:04:11.470> here<00:04:11.709> there's<00:04:12.250> no<00:04:12.370> flash<00:04:12.610> support<00:04:12.670> but

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
mobile here there's no flash support but

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.370 
mobile here there's no flash support but
the<00:04:14.440> blackberry<00:04:14.950> browser<00:04:15.130> has<00:04:16.049> come<00:04:17.049> leaps

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
the blackberry browser has come leaps

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.870 
the blackberry browser has come leaps
and<00:04:17.590> bounds<00:04:17.650> over<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.370> last<00:04:18.489> couple<00:04:18.670> of<00:04:18.820> years

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
and bounds over the last couple of years

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.330 
and bounds over the last couple of years
so

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
so

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.820 
so
the<00:04:20.430> new<00:04:20.549> 800<00:04:21.389> gigahertz<00:04:21.660> processor<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:22.530> here

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
the new 800 gigahertz processor in here

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.330 
the new 800 gigahertz processor in here
is<00:04:22.949> also<00:04:23.790> very<00:04:24.449> nice<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:25.260> got<00:04:25.350> 512<00:04:26.040> megs<00:04:26.220> of

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
is also very nice it's got 512 megs of

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.120 
is also very nice it's got 512 megs of
ram<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:26.970> things<00:04:27.960> run<00:04:28.139> relatively<00:04:28.800> smoothly

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
ram so things run relatively smoothly

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.550 
ram so things run relatively smoothly
maybe<00:04:30.030> not<00:04:30.240> quite<00:04:30.479> as<00:04:30.540> smoothly<00:04:30.810> as<00:04:30.930> some<00:04:31.530> the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
maybe not quite as smoothly as some the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560 
maybe not quite as smoothly as some the
top-of-the-line<00:04:32.160> stuff<00:04:32.550> but<00:04:32.880> for<00:04:33.510> an

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
top-of-the-line stuff but for an

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.850 
top-of-the-line stuff but for an
entry-level<00:04:33.810> model<00:04:34.290> i<00:04:34.350> find<00:04:34.590> this<00:04:34.710> is

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
entry-level model i find this is

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.520 
entry-level model i find this is
actually<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.540> really<00:04:36.540> really<00:04:36.990> respectable

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
actually a really really respectable

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.270 
actually a really really respectable
experience<00:04:38.040> so<00:04:39.260> obviously<00:04:40.260> not<00:04:40.680> having<00:04:41.070> touch

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
experience so obviously not having touch

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.909 
experience so obviously not having touch
on<00:04:41.490> here<00:04:41.760> is<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.570> bit<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.900> downer<00:04:43.050> but<00:04:43.260> there

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
on here is a bit of a downer but there

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.520 
on here is a bit of a downer but there
are<00:04:44.010> some<00:04:44.220> cool<00:04:44.910> shortcuts<00:04:45.449> to<00:04:45.660> make<00:04:45.840> the

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
are some cool shortcuts to make the

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.770 
are some cool shortcuts to make the
experience<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.949> little<00:04:47.010> bit<00:04:47.130> more<00:04:47.310> worthwhile

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
experience a little bit more worthwhile

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.090 
experience a little bit more worthwhile
for<00:04:48.780> example<00:04:49.110> if<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:49.260> hold<00:04:49.500> down<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.949> think

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
for example if you hold down I think

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.400 
for example if you hold down I think
it's<00:04:50.220> alt<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:51.479> scroll<00:04:51.780> up<00:04:51.930> or<00:04:52.020> down<00:04:52.080> on

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
it's alt and you scroll up or down on

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.500 
it's alt and you scroll up or down on
the<00:04:52.680> on<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.220> trackpad<00:04:53.790> it'll<00:04:54.030> zoom<00:04:54.210> in<00:04:54.389> and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
the on the trackpad it'll zoom in and

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.320 
the on the trackpad it'll zoom in and
out<00:04:57.740> now<00:04:58.740> it's<00:04:58.919> shrunken<00:04:59.639> along<00:04:59.940> just<00:05:00.150> a
