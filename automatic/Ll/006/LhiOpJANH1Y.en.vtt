00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.329
 you'll have to start doing it in the street by 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.409
 little boy we start with the tag that 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.759
 also almost a ugliness in the sense of ai 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:33.780
 eyes of so many people 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.720
 so the signature then evolves yes 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.900
 evolves into design evolves into graphics 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:45.090
 moves the message also arises this way 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.940
 almost like a little vandalism let's say 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.450
 hence the classic initial figure of the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.520
 writer who slightly authority 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.090
 decorating the walls with no exact yes 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.250
 the challenge that really opposes that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.070
 does the thing that you should not do ie in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.070
 meaning it is forbidden to write there then there 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.259
 will want to write if it were not life to a 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.500
 sir even if it happens so often 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.100
 in fact I want to say at the beginning it was born 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.430
 raitre with the figure of social protest 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.620
 connotation very precise weighed that is me 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.330
 picture of life rich 71 of the first is 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.240
 started on the street to do it then is 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.360
 became very famous and started a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.340
 draw all over the world though 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.240
 continuing to go to Istria where he went 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.360
 He was 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.659
 tokio london went to three at night 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.299
 however he always leaves his signature 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:44.130
 on the metros always left 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.140
 just need subscribers say i am 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.350
 been here and then you merged 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.080
 this passion within the studios 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:59.159
 however of the studies and then aging 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.220
 started to reason and reason about 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.530
 legal chart also because now the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.170
 companies and also are also mentioned i 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.319
 graffiti like them 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.450
 I worked with the municipality but contacted the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.569
 common to do graffiti on 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.400
 beach for example avoltri on vesuvio 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.250
 just a graffiti project 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.350
 legal I took a crew of kids 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.780
 almost all the minors who went by 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.370
 notes to write and inviolate the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.410
 possibility of prepared the fund me 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.420
 I am made to give them projects in the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.609
 sense then a study behind me however 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.470
 or hinted that nowadays there is a 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.829
 possibility of making legal graffiti 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.940
 so get paid for it to be 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.220
 in daylight and even have a 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.440
 personal sense advertising maybe can 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.450
 pass a person I like graffiti 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.000
 she comes to do us one on 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.120
 sluice that came to do at home 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.280
 if you go at night you pay yourself tea paints 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.799
 risks it seems to me on the 6 thousand euro fine 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.739
 now and then you can't see it anyway 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.140
 however, there is no visibility 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.299
 remaining narrow remains a niche and a 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.200
 little to sell a little out of the concept 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.700
 in my opinion, the writer starts it 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.829
 must be an evolution also in 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.720
 this case cannot be stopped here alone 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.220
 i only do a great deal van de poi e 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.150
 it ends there because it doesn't take you to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.380
 Nowhere 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.300
 perhaps the reason so with the breast that is from 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.990
 young people did not think so 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.580
 now so I wish the kids in fact 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.690
 I did this school here on purpose 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.950
 I would like the kids to learn how to 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.830
 have doors for the future too 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.960
 amaze to not even remain so 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.680
 then to go to make the writing 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.290
 run away from street art and society exists 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.440
 indeed it is wanted by because then you call one 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.810
 firm will make a wall of a spin color of 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.510
 a capital extinguishes a capital it does of 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.620
 a color then a gray brown one thing 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.240
 sad 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.780
 the next day there is the attack again 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.850
 above and how it costs you more than 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.130
 call some kids i'll do a 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.440
 drawing that indeed likes the walls that 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.390
 we did a year and a half that they are 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.380
 there no one ever did anything to us again 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.380
 track all kept as they are 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.620
 no one has vandalized them and therefore 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.360
 there is also common weight I spend less I do 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.750
 that I do a drawing I give a hand 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.090
 to young people so now it's thrown up 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.390
 the one that suits him more 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.150
 beautiful is also the less you spend 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.340
 arrived also saw to decorate the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.970
 interior of a cruise ship then 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.790
 far from the figure in fact 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.820
 from the archetype of the writer who writes 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.190
 on the walls at night so here is precisely a 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.560
 today this figure has a different meaning 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.230
 this type of art is a different sense 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.560
 point this cruise ship into the bridge 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.780
 Here 15 is still an important bridge 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.490
 the game room has been reproduced a little 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.480
 the street environment has been redone 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.620
 the walls of an adulate of sheet metal and ha 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.669
 wanted just through the fortress gallery 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.560
 through the wheel tunnels that got me 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.990
 contacted I wanted to reproduce 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.630
 a street environment even do 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.890
 there the graffiti and even a little store team 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:26.310
 populated not precise there is just there 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.310
 this desire here to reproduce these 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.050
 environments here that like not in the sense 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.820
 even in a space that will say that it is more 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.380
 formal so you can't because the 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.990
 cruise ship 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.750
 yes yes surely and now that you did me 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.449
 a brief overview of the techniques that 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:48.190
 use your favorite and the subjects 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:50.169
 because in any case you are very subject 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.350
 also the things we saw are different 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.600
 here they go from the portraits he saw on 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.229
 your site also abstract things in certain 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.800
 therefore very different things from one another 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:05.290
 assisi as he had lived it at 360 degrees 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.160
 never once maybe there were currents 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.889
 there was vanguard there was gone 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.870
 in certain alleys you couldn't even 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.110
 go out now you economy and art goes 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.810
 lived at 360 degrees there is in the setup a 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.860
 we have everything we have possibilities too 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:26.380
 with the pc of rivara everything then in my opinion 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.100
 he is an artist must express himself in all 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.930
 the abstract signatures in the figurative 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.720
 that is, he cannot say ah no this is not it 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.580
 I do because it is not part of my ie 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.770
 must have to use all the techniques 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.289
 possible and facts at least what 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.050
 i do i use oil painting use 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:47.710
 the airbrush I use the charcoal pencil 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:51.849
 that is, anything I can also use 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:55.150
 own couriers use the slopes more 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:57.160
 techniques and more use, however, it is me more alone 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.599
 i feel complete there is one thing to do 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.039
 a technique of your own that you prefer in 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:02.590
 which you feel most comfortable with or goes to 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.330
 periods had no technique you site rains 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.820
 aerography of course for are 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.830
 twenty years that I do it in my opinion is one 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:13.690
 exceptional and fast tool and succeeds 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.370
 to get the nuances that maybe he has 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.690
 It feels like it takes a day instead 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.120
 in five minutes ago and nuances 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.660
 which is also very close to the street 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.460
 Article 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.160
 because then like having a mini 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.330
 canister is the one I prefer 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.900
 definitely the one that 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.669
 the quirin domain I read about 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.199
 your site love our city and 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:35.870
 want to make gray better 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:38.629
 urban yes it is so is the message more 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:43.129
 important but yes I think there is a wall 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:45.949
 gray closes you treats then doesn't give you the 

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:48.500
 leisure possibilities and if a gray wall 

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:51.139
 Gray wall boom is one thing in front 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.569
 boom you are standing there a colored wall 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:56.300
 it looks like a wall that is not changing 

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:58.789
 structurally single same thing though 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:02.270
 colored wall gives you the chance to 

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:05.629
 think back to dreaming of having it because 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:08.000
 important fantasy if there is we close it 

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:12.849
 we put the chains to this fantasy 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.849
 here life is sadder in my opinion
