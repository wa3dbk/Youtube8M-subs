00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.360
 not what doctors do you are 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.260
 boys because up to half the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.930
 squad were good as earning the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.580
 own crucitas 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.720
 in looking for their place as the bull 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.810
 fernandez forward ulcer that begins 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.360
 they become lonely and Fernandez comes and 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.100
 out goes juan martín for 1 2 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.410
 rojiblanca being overcome by the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.430
 theoretical castelar takes advantage of 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.430
 colored nicolás 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.880
 before I have incorporated this season and 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.460
 one has to resign because 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.350
 is exceeded by the spending crucita appears 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.280
 the green car of melendi front 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.280
 Camilo Echevarria 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.830
 the opposite sector are going to see 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.120
 it was from the earth 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.120
 the public does not say 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.690
 in this scenario 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.690
 inside arrived 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.450
 i 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.450
 with that car 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.030
 started with everything being that this race did not 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.790
 we saw 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.730
 the semitrompo then 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.490
 for something that in fact spreads a 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.490
 little so one of the two more 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.830
 what's up with federico 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.830
 service 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.900
 so it runs 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:49.510
 crucita appears and grueling bruno 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.510
 why 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.530
 that has inside 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.640
 why 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.500
 the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.500
 alonso federico alonso 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.910
 the classifier 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:24.680
 for the dirty part so all of it 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.680
 to the thirteenth placement 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.470
 and from benedictis to as best 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.750
 where forward certain 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:47.630
 is maintained from the very beginning on 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.630
 doctors so much and here bruno 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.950
 but what's 29 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.269
 that continues with the team of the brothers 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.269
 the pretty 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.300
 good 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.930
 pit sector emanuel alifraco no 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.930
 watering 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.280
 the concept 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.819
 number 3 are played conserve lives of 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.819
 Benedict 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.650
 there are sinning ladies and gentlemen the 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.360
 seal difference 0 I had urinated by 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.500
 this situation of alan ruggiero that 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.500
 it was very close to the track 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.800
 of the etc also has remained to which 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.220
 I had already abandoned the race is a couple 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.220
 of laps 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.650
 the gap narrows 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.520
 with respect to man 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.039
 and so 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.950
 is the last chance they have of 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.710
 advance from getting inside the 10 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.040
 we wait because it would take one of the 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.110
 what is more advanced is 11th has exceeded 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.110
 open has surpassed it to crucita 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.810
 manuel pérez bravo at the race cobras 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.889
 the authority product of the appearance 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.889
 of pace car but 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:55.470
 emanuel alifraco comes slow by the 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.470
 autonomous paved centenaries 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:05.650
 On the other hand, it had also been 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:09.060
 bolt and torino de pedro pisandelli and 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.280
 atkinson fighting for a stick 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.880
 the little English bar every position looks 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.880
 how he attended 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.139
 where light already warns the curve that 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.139
 input 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.610
 the percentage loses 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.629
 to 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.629
 could not leave later 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.480
 it went accelerating and again the america and 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.680
 you do not go there is a car of difference ultime 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.750
 God 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.560
 d 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.850
 but if it's ending 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.850
 the jp pilot 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.679
 the result 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.080
 fastest of this adjusted with the 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:02.520
 centenary 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.520
