of research to find out which a plant
would<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.010> better<00:00:29.480> so<00:00:30.830> based<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:32.009> my<00:00:32.250> research

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
would be better so based on my research

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.600

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
foliage and the another one was a small

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.990 
foliage and the another one was a small

of<00:00:57.270> flowers<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.010> another<00:00:59.430> one

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
of flowers and there is another one

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
of flowers and there is another one
which<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.690> big<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.410> it

which is the really really big one it
has<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.250> probably<00:01:02.579> two<00:01:02.940> feet<00:01:02.969> big<00:01:03.949> leaves

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
has like probably two feet big leaves

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.640 
has like probably two feet big leaves
and<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.030> flowers<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.630> also<00:01:06.750> bigger<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.619> I

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and the flowers are also bigger but I

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.950 
and the flowers are also bigger but I
didn't<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.640> whether<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.150> blooms<00:01:09.510> here

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
didn't know that whether it blooms here

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.350 
didn't know that whether it blooms here
around<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.400> maintenance<00:01:11.820> about<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> I

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
around or the maintenance about it so I

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.780 
around or the maintenance about it so I
got<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> medium<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> level<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.430> I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
got the medium one with the level and I

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.170 
got the medium one with the level and I
ensured<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.979> bloom<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.850> around

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
ensured that it can bloom here around

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.320 
ensured that it can bloom here around
that<00:01:21.390> needs<00:01:21.689> low<00:01:22.170> light<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.250> peace<00:01:23.700> lily<00:01:24.090> has

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that needs low light so peace lily has

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.810 
that needs low light so peace lily has
this<00:01:24.600> long<00:01:24.990> elongated<00:01:25.409> green<00:01:26.070> foliage<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this long elongated green foliage and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.219 
this long elongated green foliage and
the<00:01:27.689> flowers<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:29.030> with<00:01:30.030> white<00:01:30.420> half<00:01:30.869> shipped

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the flowers are with white half shipped

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.060 
the flowers are with white half shipped
blooms<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.939> we<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.299> comes<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> chute<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.890> as

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
blooms and we it comes in a chute so as

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.910 
blooms and we it comes in a chute so as
you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.369> see<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.409> white

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you can see here this is the white

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
you can see here this is the white
flower<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:40.280> earlier<00:01:41.280> while<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:42.000> thinking

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
flower and earlier while I was thinking

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.920 
flower and earlier while I was thinking
that<00:01:43.100> when<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.340> flower<00:01:44.850> comes<00:01:45.270> out<00:01:45.570> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that when the flower comes out it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.350 
that when the flower comes out it
becomes<00:01:46.350> green<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.460> turns<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.060> white

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
becomes green and then it turns to white

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510 
becomes green and then it turns to white
but<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> other<00:01:49.560> way<00:01:50.009> around

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
but it's the other way around

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.450 
but it's the other way around
so<00:01:50.939> when<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.540> flower<00:01:51.780> comes<00:01:52.110> out<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.250> can

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
so when the flower comes out as you can

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.959 
so when the flower comes out as you can
see<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.420> flower<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.049> white<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
see the flower is white and then this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.889 
see the flower is white and then this
this<00:01:57.600> flower<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.170> probably<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:59.009> month<00:01:59.790> old<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
this flower is probably a month old so

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.810 
this flower is probably a month old so
it<00:02:01.020> stays<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> month<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.159> then<00:02:02.369> slowly

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
it stays for a month and then slowly

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.480 
it stays for a month and then slowly
turns<00:02:03.180> green<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.219> it's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
turns green you can see it here it's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.180 
turns green you can see it here it's
turning<00:02:06.000> green

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
turning green

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.029 
turning green
so<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.970> new<00:02:09.630> flower<00:02:09.929> shoot<00:02:10.350> is<00:02:10.470> coming<00:02:10.860> out

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
so here a new flower shoot is coming out

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.820 
so here a new flower shoot is coming out
and<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> shooter<00:02:12.930> which<00:02:13.620> is

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
and this is the shooter which is

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830 
and this is the shooter which is
probably<00:02:14.340> two<00:02:14.610> months<00:02:14.970> old<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.569> dried

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
probably two months old and it's dried

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.920 
probably two months old and it's dried
up<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.740> when<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.220> drying<00:02:17.550> or<00:02:18.000> any<00:02:18.270> dried<00:02:18.630> leaf

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
up so when it's drying or any dried leaf

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.430 
up so when it's drying or any dried leaf
you<00:02:19.890> need<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.310> prune<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.750> cut<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.170> from<00:02:22.350> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
you need to prune it so cut it from the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.210 
you need to prune it so cut it from the
bottom<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.100> throw<00:02:24.060> it

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
bottom and throw it

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.340 
bottom and throw it
so<00:02:26.220> basically<00:02:26.610> generally<00:02:27.150> has<00:02:27.570> white<00:02:27.990> half

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
so basically generally has white half

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.180 
so basically generally has white half
shade<00:02:28.650> blooms<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:30.330> as<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.110> see<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:31.770> this

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
shade blooms so as you can see but this

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.910 
shade blooms so as you can see but this
is<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.610> rarest<00:02:33.120> one<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.660> don't<00:02:34.290> know<00:02:34.560> how<00:02:34.770> it

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
is the rarest one I don't know how it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.330 
is the rarest one I don't know how it
became<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.900> has<00:02:37.140> as<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.890> see<00:02:38.160> it

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
became this so it has as you can see it

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.640 
became this so it has as you can see it
has<00:02:38.610> three<00:02:39.150> petals<00:02:39.720> instead<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:40.830> one<00:02:41.130> so

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
has three petals instead of just one so

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.060 
has three petals instead of just one so
this<00:02:43.650> looks<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.250> really<00:02:44.610> beautiful<00:02:46.070> so

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
this looks really really beautiful so

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.060 
this looks really really beautiful so
peacefully<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.720> need<00:02:49.019> really<00:02:49.440> really<00:02:49.890> low

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
peacefully you need really really low

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.490 
peacefully you need really really low
maintenance<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.940> need<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.660> just<00:02:51.900> water<00:02:52.170> them

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
maintenance you need to just water them

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.580 
maintenance you need to just water them
and<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.980> should<00:02:53.190> be<00:02:53.370> good<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.350> can<00:02:55.530> see

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
and it should be good and as you can see

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.759 
and it should be good and as you can see
this<00:02:56.160> level<00:02:57.019> actually<00:02:58.019> where<00:02:58.200> while<00:02:58.500> buying

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
this level actually where while buying

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.630 
this level actually where while buying
it<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.390> looked<00:03:00.390> at<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.720> level<00:03:01.019> as<00:03:01.200> well<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:02.190> in

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
it I looked at the level as well so in

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.940 
it I looked at the level as well so in
this<00:03:02.880> level<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.390> says<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.380> blooms<00:03:04.739> here

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
this level it says that it blooms here

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.699 
this level it says that it blooms here
around<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:06.239> requires<00:03:06.780> low<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.290> medium

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
around and it requires low to medium

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.420 
around and it requires low to medium
light<00:03:10.670> basically<00:03:11.670> also<00:03:12.530> Plains<00:03:13.530> indoor<00:03:14.220> air

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
light basically also Plains indoor air

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.990 
light basically also Plains indoor air
and<00:03:14.750> many<00:03:15.750> environmental<00:03:16.500> contaminants<00:03:17.250> like

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
and many environmental contaminants like

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.130 
and many environmental contaminants like
benzene<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.989> other<00:03:19.489> pollutants<00:03:20.489> so<00:03:21.480> peace

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
benzene and other pollutants so peace

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.539 
benzene and other pollutants so peace
lily<00:03:22.530> leaves<00:03:22.769> her<00:03:23.420> mildly<00:03:24.420> toxic<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.380> if<00:03:26.220> you

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
lily leaves her mildly toxic so if you

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.780 
lily leaves her mildly toxic so if you
have<00:03:26.880> kids<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.780> pits<00:03:28.110> in<00:03:28.380> your<00:03:28.560> house<00:03:28.799> you

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
have kids and pits in your house you

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.319 
have kids and pits in your house you
probably<00:03:30.620> it's<00:03:31.620> not<00:03:31.950> recommended<00:03:32.610> but<00:03:33.150> in

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
probably it's not recommended but in

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.030 
probably it's not recommended but in
fact<00:03:33.570> if<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.900> want<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.380> because<00:03:34.709> it's<00:03:34.890> a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
fact if you want it because it's a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.610 
fact if you want it because it's a
really<00:03:35.340> popular<00:03:35.549> house<00:03:36.060> plant<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:37.170> can<00:03:37.350> keep

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
really popular house plant you can keep

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.550 
really popular house plant you can keep
it<00:03:37.769> in<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.160> bit<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.790> height<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.930> can<00:03:40.230> harm

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
it in a little bit of height it can harm

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.120 
it in a little bit of height it can harm
if<00:03:40.860> ingested<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.329> make<00:03:43.049> sure<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.410> keep<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.890> out

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
if ingested so make sure you keep it out

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.800 
if ingested so make sure you keep it out
of<00:03:44.160> out<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.269> reach<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.540> your<00:03:45.930> pay<00:03:46.170> attention

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
of out of reach of your pay attention

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.130 
of out of reach of your pay attention
I<00:03:47.840> live<00:03:48.650> in<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:48.890> high-rise<00:03:49.130> as<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:49.970> can<00:03:50.180> see<00:03:50.480> so

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
I live in a high-rise as you can see so

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.490 
I live in a high-rise as you can see so
what<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.530> did<00:03:51.830> is<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.630> kept<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:53.870> next<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.350> my

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
what I did is I kept it next to my

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.640 
what I did is I kept it next to my
window<00:03:54.920> but<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.400> made<00:03:55.730> sure<00:03:55.970> there<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.300> no

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
window but I made sure there is no

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.820 
window but I made sure there is no
direct<00:03:57.650> sunlight<00:03:57.730> because<00:03:58.730> this<00:03:59.660> Lilly<00:04:00.080> don't

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
direct sunlight because this Lilly don't

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.420 
direct sunlight because this Lilly don't
like<00:04:01.310> direct<00:04:02.150> sunlight<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.110> in<00:04:03.800> case<00:04:04.190> there<00:04:04.400> is

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
like direct sunlight so in case there is

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.390 
like direct sunlight so in case there is
a<00:04:04.520> direct<00:04:04.940> sunlight<00:04:05.180> probably<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.400> foliage

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
a direct sunlight probably the foliage

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.270 
a direct sunlight probably the foliage
will<00:04:07.670> burn<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.270> turn<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.720> yellow<00:04:09.080> so<00:04:09.800> make

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
will burn and turn to yellow so make

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.870 
will burn and turn to yellow so make
sure<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:11.300> doesn't<00:04:11.630> get<00:04:12.020> direct<00:04:12.680> sunlight

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
sure it it doesn't get direct sunlight

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.300 
sure it it doesn't get direct sunlight
so<00:04:13.900> this<00:04:14.900> really<00:04:15.170> doesn't<00:04:15.500> require<00:04:15.920> too<00:04:16.160> much

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
so this really doesn't require too much

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.220 
so this really doesn't require too much
maintenance<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:17.209> basically<00:04:17.720> need<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.049> water

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
maintenance so basically need to water

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.890 
maintenance so basically need to water
them<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:19.730> make<00:04:19.910> sure<00:04:19.940> in<00:04:20.540> between

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
them and to make sure in between

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.520 
them and to make sure in between
watering<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.620> soil<00:04:21.890> is<00:04:22.070> little<00:04:22.370> bit<00:04:22.520> dry<00:04:22.790> and

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
watering the soil is little bit dry and

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.040 
watering the soil is little bit dry and
the<00:04:24.530> best<00:04:24.770> thing<00:04:25.040> about<00:04:25.430> is<00:04:25.669> that<00:04:26.050> basically

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
the best thing about is that basically

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.380 
the best thing about is that basically
when<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.800> needs<00:04:28.160> water

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
when it needs water

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.070 
when it needs water
it<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:30.350> leaves<00:04:31.040> will<00:04:31.430> kind<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.330> droop<00:04:32.750> and

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
it the leaves will kind of droop and

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.909 
it the leaves will kind of droop and
kind<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.770> sink<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.430> as<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.419> can<00:04:35.570> see<00:04:35.630> here<00:04:36.260> so

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
kind of sink and as you can see here so

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.010 
kind of sink and as you can see here so
you<00:04:37.010> know<00:04:37.310> that<00:04:37.490> it<00:04:37.640> needs<00:04:37.880> water<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.600> the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
you know that it needs water and the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.740
