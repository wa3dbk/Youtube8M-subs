 five buses of small capacity 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.629
 that is, the interval will be slightly longer 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.280

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 multiple routes let interval

 45 because it is enough with 1 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 March on the line on the 70th route will be all 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.989

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.040
 million driver's rubles new 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.930
 quite happy with the machines say to 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.060
 overclock like the old keyway 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.600
 It was a lot of effort and here 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.500
 everything is easier loaded cat 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.500
 the bus goes to the rise of old models 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.140
 heavy 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.120
 here they are running there for us the result though 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.400
 speed is now not the most important thing they say 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.470
 in the city department of transport the whole 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.150
 70 route will now be fully 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.830
 served by one commercial 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.330
 carrier in connection with this planned 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.220
 maximize 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.960
 and passenger safety bus 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.240
 which rides behind him arises 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.550
 it is tempting to overtake the front running 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.650
 buses themselves to collect passengers here 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.660
 when two carriers on the route is 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.710
 there is a phenomenon when the route is 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.800
 one carrier 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.960
 then we will leave this situation already 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.450
 clear timetable for all rolling 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.740
 The composition of this carrier boast 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.690
 New cars can not only 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.560
 capacity and security but also 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.750
 availability 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.729
 without difficulty can get inside and people with 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.440
 limited health 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.580
 buses are equipped with special 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.580
 hydraulic system 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.030
 townspeople innovations also had to 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.360
 frequent use passengers 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.070
 public transport is much cheaper 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.870
 use transport cards 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.050
 because I am leaving a lot of money 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.970
 half the scholarship even goes more on 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.620
 travel and I already knew the time when he 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.020
 comes therefore go always to that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.290
