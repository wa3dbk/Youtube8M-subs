dehumidifier secondly to control the
humidification<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.290> need<00:01:22.470> air<00:01:22.680> exchange<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
humidification you need air exchange you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
humidification you need air exchange you
want<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> proper<00:01:25.470> system<00:01:25.799> up<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
want to have a proper system up there a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
want to have a proper system up there a
bar<00:01:26.610> near<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> great<00:01:27.270> unit<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.780> out

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
bar near is a great unit that's out

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.310 
bar near is a great unit that's out
there<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.920> does<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.340> draws<00:01:30.320> warmer

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
there what that does is it draws warmer

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
there what that does is it draws warmer
air<00:01:31.530> from<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.860> upper<00:01:32.220> level<00:01:32.549> takes<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.270> down

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
air from the upper level takes it down

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.319 
air from the upper level takes it down
exchange<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.640> spot<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
exchange is it that's all take spot and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.530 
exchange is it that's all take spot and
helps<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:37.280> achieving<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.790> maintaining<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
helps in achieving and maintaining a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
helps in achieving and maintaining a
proper<00:01:39.750> relative<00:01:40.320> humidity<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.670> third<00:01:41.880> thing

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
proper relative humidity the third thing

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.389 
proper relative humidity the third thing
as<00:01:42.420> well<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:42.930> there<00:01:43.229> are<00:01:43.649> some<00:01:43.829> systems<00:01:44.189> out

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
as well is there are some systems out

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
as well is there are some systems out
there<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.820> are<00:01:44.850> designed<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.420> draw<00:01:45.960> moisture

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
there that are designed to draw moisture

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.950 
there that are designed to draw moisture
moisture<00:01:47.280> from<00:01:48.090> underneath<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
moisture from underneath the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.280 
moisture from underneath the
encapsulated<00:01:49.740> area<00:01:50.479> draw<00:01:51.479> moisture<00:01:51.869> out<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
encapsulated area draw moisture out of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.490 
encapsulated area draw moisture out of
the<00:01:52.409> soil<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.270> again<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:55.170> really

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the soil and again that's is really

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.410 
the soil and again that's is really
three<00:01:55.770> tools<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.520> controlling<00:01:57.030> relative

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
three tools and controlling relative

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.230 
three tools and controlling relative
humidity<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.320> want<00:01:58.590> d<00:01:59.009> modification<00:01:59.790> air
