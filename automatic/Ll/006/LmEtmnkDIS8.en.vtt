00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
you can go ahead and see alright so

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.330 
you can go ahead and see alright so
there's<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:09.840> hook<00:02:10.050> right<00:02:10.080> there

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
there's my hook right there

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.040 
there's my hook right there
and<00:02:11.430> then<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.239> said<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.510> already<00:02:12.660> fixed

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and then like I said it's already fixed

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.300 
and then like I said it's already fixed
so<00:02:13.140> you're<00:02:13.260> not<00:02:13.379> going<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> see<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.920> problem

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
so you're not going to see the problem

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.030 
so you're not going to see the problem
but<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.819> will<00:02:15.030> see<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.360> solution<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.860> my

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
but you will see the solution so when my

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.470 
but you will see the solution so when my
hook<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.930> going<00:02:22.040> clear<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.340> I'm<00:02:24.180> going

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
hook is going clear it is I'm going

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.940 
hook is going clear it is I'm going
slowly<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.290> can<00:02:25.349> see<00:02:25.620> an<00:02:26.280> action<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.950> what

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
slowly so you can see an action so what

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.039 
slowly so you can see an action so what
is<00:02:29.069> happening<00:02:29.610> like<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.940> explained<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:30.780> it's

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
is happening like I explained it's it's

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.869 
is happening like I explained it's it's
missing<00:02:31.410> its<00:02:31.560> opportunity<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.430> pick<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
missing its opportunity to pick up the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.570 
missing its opportunity to pick up the
street<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.660> what<00:02:34.379> basically<00:02:34.530> needs<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.160> happen

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
street so what basically needs to happen

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.699 
street so what basically needs to happen
is<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.510> hook<00:02:36.720> needs<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.290> enough<00:02:37.500> time

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
is it the hook needs to have enough time

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.559 
is it the hook needs to have enough time
to<00:02:37.860> pick<00:02:38.010> up<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.250> string<00:02:38.519> before<00:02:39.000> your<00:02:39.330> needle

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
to pick up the string before your needle

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.070 
to pick up the string before your needle
goes<00:02:39.720> up<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.970> one<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.269> working<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.870> there

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
goes up and this one is working so there

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.080 
goes up and this one is working so there
you<00:02:43.230> could<00:02:43.440> tell<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:43.890> relatively<00:02:44.670> closely

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
you could tell it's relatively closely

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.789 
you could tell it's relatively closely
and<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.599> probably<00:02:46.079> could<00:02:46.380> do<00:02:46.500> some<00:02:46.680> more

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
and I probably could do some more

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.319 
and I probably could do some more
tweaking<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.579> it's<00:02:47.790> working<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.150> me

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
tweaking to it but it's working for me

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.890 
tweaking to it but it's working for me
right<00:02:48.420> now<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:48.930> just<00:02:48.959> left<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.560> like<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:50.900> so

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
right now so I just left it like that so

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.420 
right now so I just left it like that so
pick<00:02:52.680> your<00:02:52.709> machine<00:02:53.220> back<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.890> already

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
pick your machine back up and I already

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.280 
pick your machine back up and I already
fell<00:02:56.610> off<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:56.940> me<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.269> it's<00:02:57.780> supposed<00:02:58.200> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
fell off for me but it's supposed to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.610 
fell off for me but it's supposed to
remove<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.920> calf<00:02:59.340> right<00:02:59.610> here<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:01.260> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
remove this calf right here and in the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.050 
remove this calf right here and in the
brother<00:03:01.860> machine<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.549> sounds<00:03:02.730> like<00:03:02.760> one

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
brother machine it just sounds like one

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.869 
brother machine it just sounds like one
screw<00:03:03.390> back<00:03:03.569> here<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.920> will<00:03:05.069> expose<00:03:05.489> all

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
screw back here and it will expose all

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.390 
screw back here and it will expose all
of<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:07.500> now<00:03:07.680> you're<00:03:08.069> gonna<00:03:08.220> go<00:03:08.670> ahead<00:03:08.730> and

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
of this so now you're gonna go ahead and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.900 
of this so now you're gonna go ahead and
look<00:03:11.400> right<00:03:11.579> here<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.950> guess<00:03:14.459> little<00:03:14.760> like

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
look right here this I guess little like

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.520 
look right here this I guess little like
pole<00:03:15.269> that's<00:03:15.630> holding<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:17.340> needle<00:03:18.319> follow<00:03:19.319> it

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
pole that's holding the needle follow it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.110 
pole that's holding the needle follow it
all<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.680> way<00:03:19.799> up<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.280> you're<00:03:20.760> going<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.940> see

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
all the way up and you're going to see

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.809 
all the way up and you're going to see
this<00:03:21.269> circle<00:03:21.750> thing<00:03:21.959> right<00:03:22.139> here<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.819> that

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
this circle thing right here and that

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.270 
this circle thing right here and that
would<00:03:24.060> be<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.870> loosening<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.680> tightening<00:03:25.739> of

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
would be the loosening and tightening of

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.610 
would be the loosening and tightening of
your<00:03:26.549> needle<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.599> loosen<00:03:28.079> it<00:03:28.230> what

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
your needle so if you loosen it what

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.800 
your needle so if you loosen it what
will<00:03:28.799> happen<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.549> will<00:03:30.000> actually<00:03:30.209> let<00:03:30.599> you

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
will happen is it will actually let you

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.740 
will happen is it will actually let you
move<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:31.440> up<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.980> down<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.549> then<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:33.660> you

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
move this up and down and then if you

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.360 
move this up and down and then if you
tighten<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.260> obviously<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.859> will<00:03:34.950> keep<00:03:35.099> it<00:03:35.280> in

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
tighten it obviously it will keep it in

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.599 
tighten it obviously it will keep it in
place<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:36.410> this<00:03:37.410> right<00:03:37.650> here<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:37.980> not<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.579> a

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
place and this right here is not like a

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.629 
place and this right here is not like a
regular<00:03:38.760> um<00:03:39.480> screw<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.650> actually<00:03:41.099> requires

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
regular um screw it actually requires

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.050 
regular um screw it actually requires
one<00:03:41.849> of<00:03:41.970> those<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.269> L<00:03:42.540> wrenches<00:03:44.060> because

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
one of those like L wrenches because

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.550 
one of those like L wrenches because
it's<00:03:45.209> one<00:03:45.359> of<00:03:45.450> those<00:03:45.569> so<00:03:45.870> you're<00:03:46.169> you<00:03:46.530> are

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
it's one of those so you're you are

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.379 
it's one of those so you're you are
gonna<00:03:46.980> need<00:03:47.130> one<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.310> those<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.730> take<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.150> to

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
gonna need one of those to take this to

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.390 
gonna need one of those to take this to
loosen<00:03:48.720> this<00:03:48.840> off<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.859> just<00:03:50.040> want<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> do

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
loosen this off and you just want to do

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.949 
loosen this off and you just want to do
it<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.549> little<00:03:50.700> bit<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.150> small<00:03:51.450> increments

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
it a little bit in small increments

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.150 
it a little bit in small increments
because<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.230> don't<00:03:52.410> want<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.620> like<00:03:52.799> loosen

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
because you don't want to like loosen

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.250 
because you don't want to like loosen
all<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.639> just<00:03:53.669> all<00:03:53.940> falls<00:03:54.120> apart<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.989> just

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
all and it just all falls apart so just

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.830 
all and it just all falls apart so just
you<00:03:55.440> know<00:03:55.500> one<00:03:56.220> or<00:03:56.340> two<00:03:56.489> turns<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.060> it's<00:03:57.690> going

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
you know one or two turns and it's going

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.339 
you know one or two turns and it's going
to<00:03:57.900> give<00:03:58.139> you<00:03:59.389> the<00:04:00.389> it's<00:04:00.870> going<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.139> allow<00:04:01.290> you

and then open up your look down here and

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.580 
and then open up your look down here and
you<00:04:10.560> want<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.829> make<00:04:10.980> sure<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.200> are<00:04:13.410> able

you want to make sure that you are able

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.120 
you want to make sure that you are able
to<00:04:13.799> time<00:04:14.400> them<00:04:14.880> just<00:04:15.569> how<00:04:15.720> mine<00:04:15.959> was<00:04:16.200> timed<00:04:16.560> how

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
to time them just how mine was timed how

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.219 
to time them just how mine was timed how
the<00:04:17.700> hook<00:04:17.970> was<00:04:18.269> going<00:04:18.539> right<00:04:18.720> when<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.989> needle

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
the hook was going right when the needle

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.300 
the hook was going right when the needle
was<00:04:19.289> going<00:04:19.560> you're<00:04:19.709> going<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:19.919> want<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.130> do

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
was going you're going to want to do

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.120 
was going you're going to want to do
that

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
that

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.560 
that
and<00:04:21.250> it's<00:04:21.670> going<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:21.910> take<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.150> little<00:04:22.360> bit<00:04:22.450> of

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
and it's going to take a little bit of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.330 
and it's going to take a little bit of
tweaking<00:04:22.750> you're<00:04:23.140> gonna<00:04:23.260> have<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.500> go<00:04:23.620> on<00:04:23.860> you

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
tweaking you're gonna have to go on you

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.800 
tweaking you're gonna have to go on you
know<00:04:24.460> move<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.210> little<00:04:25.240> up<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.720> down

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
know move it a little up and down

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.450 
know move it a little up and down
sometimes<00:04:26.410> but<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.330> keep<00:04:28.600> doing<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.460> you

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
sometimes but if you keep doing that you

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.910 
sometimes but if you keep doing that you
will<00:04:30.700> eventually<00:04:31.000> get<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:31.780> right<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.740> where

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
will eventually get it right to where

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.040 
will eventually get it right to where
the<00:04:32.950> perfect<00:04:33.490> timing<00:04:33.730> is<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:34.450> that<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.660> pick<00:04:34.930> up

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
the perfect timing is so that I pick up

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.020 
the perfect timing is so that I pick up
the<00:04:35.170> hook<00:04:35.350> it<00:04:35.530> was<00:04:35.770> literally<00:04:36.460> like<00:04:36.580> once<00:04:36.940> I

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
the hook it was literally like once I

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.020 
the hook it was literally like once I
figured<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.450> out<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:38.320> took<00:04:38.710> like<00:04:39.160> two<00:04:39.820> minutes

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
figured it out it took like two minutes

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.510 
figured it out it took like two minutes
to<00:04:40.420> figure<00:04:40.570> out<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:41.530> know<00:04:41.560> when<00:04:41.890> my<00:04:42.280> hook

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
to figure out you know when my hook

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.520 
to figure out you know when my hook
would<00:04:42.730> align<00:04:43.060> at<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.840> perfect<00:04:44.050> time<00:04:44.380> you

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
would align at the perfect time you

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.290 
would align at the perfect time you
would<00:04:44.680> like<00:04:44.830> me<00:04:45.010> with<00:04:45.460> my<00:04:45.580> needle<00:04:45.790> sorry

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
would like me with my needle sorry

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.570 
would like me with my needle sorry
and<00:04:46.390> now<00:04:47.290> so<00:04:47.830> after<00:04:48.070> I<00:04:48.130> did<00:04:48.310> that<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.550> first

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
and now so after I did that the first

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.730 
and now so after I did that the first
time<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:49.300> was<00:04:49.660> like<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:49.990> was<00:04:50.110> so<00:04:50.260> excited<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:50.650> I

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
time I was like I was so excited so I

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.680 
time I was like I was so excited so I
just<00:04:50.920> started<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.520> sew<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.060> then<00:04:52.180> I<00:04:52.270> noticed

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
just started to sew and then I noticed

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.240 
just started to sew and then I noticed
that<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:54.220> was<00:04:54.690> skipping<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.780> stitch<00:04:56.190> okay<00:04:57.190> so

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
that it was skipping a stitch okay so

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.710 
that it was skipping a stitch okay so
you<00:04:57.490> can<00:04:57.640> see<00:04:57.670> right<00:04:57.910> there<00:04:57.940> just<00:04:58.330> like<00:04:58.480> when

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
you can see right there just like when

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.570 
you can see right there just like when
like<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.900> long<00:04:59.290> time<00:04:59.710> without<00:04:59.890> doing<00:05:00.310> another

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
like a long time without doing another

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.460 
like a long time without doing another
stitch<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:01.600> can<00:05:01.750> see<00:05:01.930> all<00:05:02.080> these<00:05:02.230> they're

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
stitch and you can see all these they're

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.790 
stitch and you can see all these they're
kind<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:03.190> know<00:05:03.310> skipping<00:05:03.700> a<00:05:03.790> stitch<00:05:03.970> so

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
kind of you know skipping a stitch so

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.190 
kind of you know skipping a stitch so
what<00:05:05.800> happens<00:05:06.130> with<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.310> is<00:05:06.540> it's<00:05:07.540> actually

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
what happens with that is it's actually

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.160 
what happens with that is it's actually
um<00:05:08.560> either<00:05:09.550> going<00:05:09.940> either<00:05:10.300> your<00:05:10.570> needles<00:05:10.840> too

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
um either going either your needles too

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.230 
um either going either your needles too

you're going to do this same process

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.260 
you're going to do this same process
open<00:05:29.290> it<00:05:29.410> up<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:29.770> you're<00:05:30.760> going<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:30.940> try<00:05:31.150> to

open it up and you're going to try to
line<00:05:31.570> it<00:05:31.600> up<00:05:31.840> a<00:05:32.050> little<00:05:32.320> bit<00:05:32.560> better<00:05:32.710> because

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
line it up a little bit better because

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.960 
line it up a little bit better because
it's<00:05:35.050> obviously<00:05:35.680> not<00:05:36.010> what<00:05:36.340> not<00:05:36.520> working<00:05:36.880> in
