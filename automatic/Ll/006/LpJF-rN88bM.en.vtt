the<00:00:54.679> Game<00:00:54.829> Boy<00:00:54.949> Color<00:00:55.100> games<00:00:55.399> are<00:00:55.640> better<00:00:55.789> than

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
the Game Boy Color games are better than

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.500

much<00:01:15.230> it<00:01:15.560> works<00:01:15.850> like<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.880> normal<00:01:17.090> game<00:01:17.390> boy<00:01:17.510> you

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
much it works like a normal game boy you

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.970 
much it works like a normal game boy you
just<00:01:18.550> put<00:01:19.550> your<00:01:19.670> Gameboy<00:01:20.000> game<00:01:20.300> in<00:01:20.570> there<00:01:20.750> and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
go straight to use Ness but the cool

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.320 
go straight to use Ness but the cool
thing<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:27.040> like<00:01:28.040> of<00:01:28.250> course<00:01:28.280> like<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:29.120> just

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
thing is like of course like it just

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.760 
thing is like of course like it just
being<00:01:29.510> like<00:01:29.690> a<00:01:29.750> normal<00:01:30.140> just<00:01:30.350> gamble<00:01:30.590> again

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
being like a normal just gamble again

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.900 
being like a normal just gamble again
but<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.130> can<00:01:31.250> play<00:01:31.370> it<00:01:31.460> on<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.580> bigger<00:01:31.730> screen
