00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
getting a little bit over it myself

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.560 
getting a little bit over it myself
I<00:01:06.899> jumped<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.820> one<00:01:08.820> thing<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.420> got

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
I jumped in one thing that this has got

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.499 
I jumped in one thing that this has got
gone<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.560> only<00:01:10.850> 400<00:01:11.850> Microsoft

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
gone for it is it's only 400 Microsoft

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.960 
gone for it is it's only 400 Microsoft
Points<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.440> by<00:01:13.680> far<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.360> cheapest<00:01:15.860> DLC

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
Points it is by far the cheapest DLC

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
Points it is by far the cheapest DLC
content<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.390> came<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.840> dirt<00:01:19.409> 3<00:01:19.770> will

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
content that came out on dirt 3 will

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.149 
content that came out on dirt 3 will
probably<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> most<00:01:21.630> efficient<00:01:22.260> for<00:01:23.040> its

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
probably the most efficient for its

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.140 
probably the most efficient for its
price<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.140> mean<00:01:25.140> their<00:01:25.490> actual<00:01:26.490> car<00:01:26.729> packs<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
price I mean their actual car packs I

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.240 
price I mean their actual car packs I
think<00:01:27.330> we're<00:01:27.450> worth<00:01:27.570> more<00:01:27.840> than<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.440> mean

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
think we're worth more than that I mean

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.310 
think we're worth more than that I mean
anyway<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.790> comes<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.150> 2<00:01:30.299> tracks<00:01:30.510> for<00:01:30.960> routes

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
anyway it comes with 2 tracks for routes

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.710 
anyway it comes with 2 tracks for routes
which<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.400> basically<00:01:32.580> their<00:01:33.330> way<00:01:33.540> of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
which is just basically their way of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.600 
which is just basically their way of
trying<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.080> get<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.770> saying<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.310> two

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
trying to get out of saying that two

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
trying to get out of saying that two
tracks<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.330> do<00:01:36.450> them<00:01:36.570> forwards<00:01:37.080> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
tracks and you can do them forwards and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.990 
tracks and you can do them forwards and
backwards<00:01:37.409> which<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.580> you're<00:01:38.760> doing

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
backwards which is all you're doing

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
backwards which is all you're doing
basically<00:01:39.470> they're<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.590> both<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.010> them<00:01:41.340> are

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
basically they're all both of them are

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.359 
basically they're all both of them are
enclosed<00:01:41.850> both<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.390> them<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.990> feel<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
enclosed both of them have this feel of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.520 
enclosed both of them have this feel of
you<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> enclosed<00:01:45.450> kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.140> city

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you know the enclosed kind of city

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.950 
you know the enclosed kind of city
tracks<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:47.850> there's<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> short<00:01:48.720> one

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
tracks now there's like a short one

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
tracks now there's like a short one
which<00:01:49.259> probably<00:01:49.799> takes<00:01:50.130> about<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.340> minute<00:01:50.460> 30

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
which probably takes about a minute 30

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.850 
which probably takes about a minute 30
your<00:01:51.330> lap<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.840> then<00:01:52.080> you've<00:01:52.290> got<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> longer

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
your lap and then you've got the longer

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.020 
your lap and then you've got the longer
one<00:01:53.040> which<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.430> um<00:01:54.080> this<00:01:55.080> one<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:56.030> actually

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
one which is um this one here actually

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.340 
one which is um this one here actually
no<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.509> wouldn't<00:01:57.689> even<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:57.990> take<00:01:58.229> that

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
no this wouldn't even really take that

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.760 
no this wouldn't even really take that
long<00:01:58.470> did<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:58.680> yeah<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.520> other<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.770> thought

there's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.700> longer<00:02:05.909> one<00:02:06.350> they<00:02:07.350> were<00:02:07.409> they<00:02:08.040> both

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
there's a longer one they were they both

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.460 
there's a longer one they were they both
were<00:02:08.399> rallycross<00:02:09.769> only<00:02:11.299> tracks<00:02:12.299> so<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.260> got

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
were rallycross only tracks so you got

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.990 
were rallycross only tracks so you got
the<00:02:13.650> which<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.370> kind<00:02:14.549> of<00:02:14.579> good<00:02:14.700> idea<00:02:14.790> because

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the which is kind of good idea because

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.699 
the which is kind of good idea because
you<00:02:15.090> had<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.329> Montecarlo<00:02:15.780> pack<00:02:16.320> which<00:02:16.560> was

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
you had the Montecarlo pack which was

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.490 
you had the Montecarlo pack which was
all<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.100> rallies<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.019> got<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
all just rallies and now you got the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.620 
all just rallies and now you got the
this<00:02:20.130> one<00:02:20.370> here<00:02:20.610> which<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.120> rally<00:02:21.269> cross

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
this one here which is the rally cross

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.050 
this one here which is the rally cross
just<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.019> mix<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.320> up<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.530> little<00:02:22.650> bit<00:02:22.859> I<00:02:23.160> think

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
just to mix it up a little bit I think

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.520 
just to mix it up a little bit I think
it<00:02:24.209> brings<00:02:24.359> out<00:02:24.769> four<00:02:25.769> more

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
it brings out four more

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.100 
it brings out four more
two<00:02:26.920> events<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.819> one<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.390> each<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
two events so one for each of the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.300 
two events so one for each of the
seasons<00:02:31.110> again<00:02:32.110> it's<00:02:32.319> just<00:02:32.410> like<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.069> do<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
seasons again it's just like to do the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.460 
seasons again it's just like to do the
two<00:02:33.459> tracks<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:34.030> don't<00:02:34.270> eat<00:02:34.720> way<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.350> then

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
two tracks you don't eat way and then

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.350 
two tracks you don't eat way and then
you<00:02:35.800> know<00:02:35.920> by<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.340> time<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.730> get<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.150> last

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
you know by the time you get to the last

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.770 
you know by the time you get to the last
one<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.720> do<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.020> do<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.980> do<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.580> two<00:02:40.360> more<00:02:40.540> I'm

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
one you do you do you do to two more I'm

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.050 
one you do you do you do to two more I'm
doing<00:02:41.140> again<00:02:41.380> me<00:02:41.590> go<00:02:41.770> do<00:02:41.920> like<00:02:42.220> heaps<00:02:42.700> elapsed

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
doing again me go do like heaps elapsed

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.670 
doing again me go do like heaps elapsed
um<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.420> think<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.690> like<00:02:43.840> five<00:02:44.110> for<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.530> long

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
um I think it's like five for the long

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.979 
um I think it's like five for the long
one<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.040> ten<00:02:45.190> for<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.489> short<00:02:45.819> one<00:02:46.030> that's

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
one and ten for the short one that's

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.410 
one and ten for the short one that's
basically<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.830> Dino<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.610> depth<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.239> UM

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
basically the Dino the depth of the UM

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.500 
basically the Dino the depth of the UM
of<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.920> kind<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> kind<00:02:52.360> of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
of the of that kind of to a kind of

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.920 
of the of that kind of to a kind of
thing<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:52.840> not<00:02:52.959> very<00:02:53.200> exciting<00:02:54.130> at<00:02:54.220> all

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
thing it's not very exciting at all

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.729 
thing it's not very exciting at all
probably<00:02:56.280> gives<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.400> maybe<00:02:58.200> an<00:02:59.200> extra<00:02:59.709> a

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
probably gives you maybe an extra a

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.340 
probably gives you maybe an extra a
couple<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.370> hours<00:03:00.820> at<00:03:01.060> most

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
couple of hours at most

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.910 
couple of hours at most
replayability<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.550> mean<00:03:03.910> you've<00:03:04.360> got<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.600> four

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
replayability I mean you've got the four

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.940 
replayability I mean you've got the four
events<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.130> will<00:03:06.250> do<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.430> time<00:03:07.150> trial<00:03:07.660> race<00:03:08.410> on

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
events you will do a time trial race on

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.610 
events you will do a time trial race on
one<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.340> tracks<00:03:09.690> mean<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.019> choose<00:03:11.470> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
one of the tracks mean if you choose the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.050 
one of the tracks mean if you choose the
short<00:03:11.890> track<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.310> doesn't<00:03:12.580> take<00:03:12.700> very<00:03:12.730> long

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
short track that doesn't take very long

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.570 
short track that doesn't take very long
at<00:03:13.209> all<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.360> then<00:03:13.660> you've<00:03:13.780> got<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.989> win<00:03:14.140> on<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
at all and then you've got to win on the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.280 
at all and then you've got to win on the
Shibuya<00:03:16.110> track<00:03:17.110> in<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:18.370> jam<00:03:19.090> session<00:03:19.450> which

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
Shibuya track in a jam session which

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.229 
Shibuya track in a jam session which
depending<00:03:20.709> on<00:03:20.830> your<00:03:20.920> skill<00:03:21.220> level<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.850> if<00:03:22.120> you

depending on your skill level and if you
can<00:03:22.420> boost<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.840> lot<00:03:23.019> could<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.560> know<00:03:23.650> change

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
can boost a lot could you know change

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.160 
can boost a lot could you know change
the<00:03:24.459> how<00:03:24.760> long<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.180> will<00:03:25.269> take<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.810> went

in<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.590> rest<00:03:26.890> some<00:03:27.069> random<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:28.140> beat

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
in and just rest some random and beat

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.210 
in and just rest some random and beat
him<00:03:29.380> so<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.709> got<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:32.530> I'm<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:32.860> just<00:03:32.890> went
