that<00:03:10.050> size<00:03:10.320> would<00:03:10.350> be<00:03:10.620> perfect<00:03:11.190> for<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.430> laser

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
that size would be perfect for a laser

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700 
that size would be perfect for a laser
weapon<00:03:12.150> or<00:03:12.390> maybe<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.200> amplify<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
weapon or maybe to amplify the

if<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.280> could<00:03:17.430> amplify<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.150> mosque<00:03:18.570> you

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
if you could amplify the mosque you

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.020 
if you could amplify the mosque you
might<00:03:19.530> theoretically<00:03:19.740> be<00:03:20.340> able<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.670> transmit

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030

might theoretically be able to transmit
larger<00:03:21.510> objects<00:03:22.020> than<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.530> soldier<00:03:22.770> oh

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
larger objects than just a soldier oh

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.150 
larger objects than just a soldier oh
man<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.780> why<00:03:24.930> all<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.200> Cobra<00:03:25.650> chatter<00:03:25.920> about

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
man so why all the Cobra chatter about

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.680 
man so why all the Cobra chatter about
keeping<00:03:26.550> it<00:03:26.670> out<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.970> Sun<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.210> a<00:03:27.360> solar

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
keeping it out on the Sun like a solar

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.420 
keeping it out on the Sun like a solar
cell<00:03:27.990> maybe<00:03:28.650> they<00:03:28.800> needed<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.070> big<00:03:29.220> light

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
cell maybe they needed a big light

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.210 
cell maybe they needed a big light
source<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.970> test<00:03:30.210> refraction<00:03:30.840> right<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.100> they

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
source to test refraction right so they

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.920 
source to test refraction right so they
could<00:03:32.280> cut<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.760> facets<00:03:33.240> to<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.570> exact

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
could cut the facets to the exact

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.900 
could cut the facets to the exact
dimensions<00:03:34.590> necessary<00:03:35.400> for<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.700> laser
