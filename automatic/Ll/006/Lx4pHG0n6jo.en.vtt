00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:13.019
 we are in front of the new galaxy note 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:15.329
 pro 12.2 the new tablet for use 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.150
 professional samsung android a 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.500
 product really well made a product 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.360
 different from what they are on the market 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.990
 because in fact the first tablet from 12 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.060
 inches are considered living 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.870
 convert to trani with windows 8 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.280
 android of course 12 inches 2005 60 x 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.290
 1600 3gb of ram inside the processor 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.960
 I imagine quad core technical po 's 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.140
 camera and a really huge battery 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.520
 one thousand and 500 milliamperes a product 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.190
 complete with a totally interface 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.120
 new based on android 4.4 gem that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.220
 now we will explain to you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:00.899
 in detail and show all the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:01:02.700
 Secrets of this tablet explains to us 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.370
 but those who take want to come 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.900
 show all you can do 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.680
 tablet from the main interface 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.820
 so a really different interface 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.470
 we will comment on the main things you do 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.890
 he can still talk about the images 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.890
 speak for themselves 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:26.100
 it is called successive 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.140
 I want to stay here 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.520
 the basic concept is enough 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.800
 simple in the sense they noticed in 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.050
 samsung that on android tablet a lot 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.150
 space is not used 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.980
 actually if there is but a tablet e 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.200
 we don't have the widget on the ma ci 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.860
 we find with an often empty interface 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.840
 just a row of hearts on the left but 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.430
 little 1 little useful when the Rome was 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.320
 part of a portal of the whole tablet 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.000
 what did they do then they have 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.790
 thought of widget that allows us to 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.280
 manage and go beyond android widget 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.870
 configuring a 6x6 grid that can 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.440
 be enlarged or sized a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.820
 will 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.490
 we can create ourselves some home 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.960
 personalized with their widget 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.600
 dragging them into positions to us more 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.460
 congenial and thus exploiting it all 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.190
 space available on the tablet 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.680
 a kind of front shell in place 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.150
 of the com class of android that maybe from 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.350
 this view is a bit sparse 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.450
 because it leaves a lot of space available 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.450
 free and unused 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.819
 I built 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.379
 what was there today 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.120
 stone obviously uses all the space 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.670
 arrangement of the large screen 12 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.900
 inches for the new multi window samp 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.440
 multi windows on the not 8 on the galaxy s 4 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.150
 now multi window exchanges can be 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.770
 even repositioned by changing the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.120
 grid as you see answered four 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.530
 applications on the screen can 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.720
 also be less obviously and 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.910
 we can manage this with the selector 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.060
 proportion as best we think 4 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.130
 equal a smaller 3 in the part 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.380
 high with a main application 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.270
 so let's say an interface 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.590
 fully flexible modular going 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.120
 to take advantage of the big screen e 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.890
 obviously samsun there was a screen 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.420
 great respect we want to exploit it 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.600
 everything and tried to do it in the best 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.600
 of the ways 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.489
 meanwhile trying to explain what has 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.810
 done 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.820
 there is a new application called 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.460
 science inc 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.620
 if we have samsung products I imagine that 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.690
 who takes a tablet of Bulgarians also a 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.140
 galaxy s3 s4 we can synchronize 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.030
 automatically our smartphone on 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.490
 safe tablet lizzare means that 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.169
 we open an emulator called sensing lo 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.910
 we are opening at this moment that there 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.730
 will allow to see the videos available 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.500
 and to control them entirely with the 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.300
 our application 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.970
 now the network here is a bit slow has it 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.040
 found the galaxy notes in this case there 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.040
 we are accessing remotely as if it were 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.900
 a remote desktop access and open the 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.250
 our race yes 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.900
 virtualized the design is that of 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.450
 ours obviously a galaxy s 4 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.130
 virtualized however devices 13 that 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.130
 we can fully control 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.030
 then full device control 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.980
 we can reply the messages see the 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.980
 phonebook really do everything 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.190
 Hello 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.190
 now 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.580
 evening 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.350
 the demo itself is enough 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.790
 impressive however it is the first time 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.240
 a kind of check is done 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.770
 motorcycle between tablet and smartphone the android 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.570
 principle is not new because obviously 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.410
 with windows you have been doing it for a very long time 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.700
 this art of using applications that 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.800
 allow us to access remotely 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.020
 others all worked in the business field 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.970
 have both products controllable 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.570
 only with the tablet that is not a so 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.010
 small 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.120
 all the logic is interesting 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.990
 obviously it is managed by 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.990
 smartphone that we have in our pockets 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.159
 we can also write messages for 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.770
 example with our smartphone then 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:19.819
 use it as if it were a smartphone 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.819
 real 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.960
 obviously full control of ours 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.309
 device that is really fluid ie for 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.119
 be a 12 inch screen with a 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:31.819
 this resolution 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:31.819
 the speed is really impressive 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.539
 michael c 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.540
 follows 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.280
 it's not just synchronization because 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.080
 automatically if we do something on 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.640
 on your smartphone 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.130
 you see that the smartphone is strong 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.420
 is in use we have seen a mail to cinema 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.820
 the smartphone we find the smartphone 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.440
 already pointed to that email so yes 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.510
 believes perfect not just a vision 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.450
 remote but almost a control 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:06.150
 bi-directional good last thing 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.970
 related to the galaxy note pro from 12.2 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.940
 inch ie remote control shots 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.470
 you have your pc on at home you can 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.270
 check with the tablet 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.070
 entirely with the nib or with the 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.740
 keyboard and pc as you would be windows 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.410
 installed also with connection 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.940
 however 3g or wi fi the latency is minimal 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.500
 so if he says really check e 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.060
 access the documents and your own 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.680
 Windows programs 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.170
 if these were not available 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.090
 on android the interesting thing is not 

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.530
 so the function that is already available 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.750
 maybe with other applications but the 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.640
 made that samsung from all the apps that 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.590
 they already serve packed inside 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.810
 of the tablet so who buys it will already have 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.210
 for example the integrated office suite 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.490
 and all probability applications 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.380
 ready to work immediately so nothing 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.050
 to download but only to configure 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.950
 account turn on and ready you can 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.950
 Start to work 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.800
 this is the new galaxy note pro 12.2 

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:04.470
 screen resolution screen 

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.690
 android 4.4 we don't know when it will arrive 

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.550
 on the market and we don't even know the 

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.960
 list price a product anyway 

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.820
 business scope but we are sure that many 

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.449
 users will find it interesting is that 

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.449
 in the consumer sphere
