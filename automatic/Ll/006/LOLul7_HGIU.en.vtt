00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
because that just suits you so well

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.310 
because that just suits you so well
well<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.850> texture<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.449> wonderful<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.199> it's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
well the texture is wonderful and it's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.900 
well the texture is wonderful and it's
so<00:00:19.470> lightweight<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.189> looks<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.789> would<00:00:20.880> be

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
so lightweight it looks like it would be

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.240 
so lightweight it looks like it would be
big<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.390> heavy<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:21.930> not<00:00:22.260> well<00:00:23.010> that's

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
big and heavy but it's not well that's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250 
big and heavy but it's not well that's
because<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.670> use<00:00:23.850> ultra<00:00:24.269> light<00:00:24.449> as<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> core<00:00:25.109> of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
because I use ultra light as the core of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.859 
because I use ultra light as the core of
the<00:00:25.410> bead<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.180> it's<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.510> those<00:00:27.630> things

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the bead and it's one of those things

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.330 
the bead and it's one of those things
that<00:00:27.930> when<00:00:28.109> my<00:00:28.230> son<00:00:28.470> comes<00:00:28.680> out<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> visit<00:00:29.220> with

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
that when my son comes out to visit with

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.250

me<00:00:29.490> he<00:00:29.699> likes<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.119> roll<00:00:30.269> these<00:00:30.449> beads<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:31.109> me

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
me he likes to roll these beads for me

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
me he likes to roll these beads for me
and<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:32.130> take<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> clay<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.000> roll<00:00:33.210> it

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and I take the clay and I roll it

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.060 
and I take the clay and I roll it
through<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> pasta<00:00:33.750> machine<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.500> widest

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
through the pasta machine on the widest

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.160 
through the pasta machine on the widest
setting<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> nice

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
setting here so that I have a nice

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.799 
setting here so that I have a nice
uniform<00:00:37.710> piece<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> clay<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.660> order

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
uniform piece of clay and then in order

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.479 
uniform piece of clay and then in order
to<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> same<00:00:40.500> volume<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.010> make<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> beads

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
to get the same volume to make the beads

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.729 
to get the same volume to make the beads
the<00:00:41.700> same<00:00:41.910> size<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.480> use<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> cutter<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.620> it

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the same size I use a cutter and it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.500 
the same size I use a cutter and it
doesn't<00:00:44.100> matter<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.700> shape<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.120> size<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
doesn't matter what the shape or size of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.240 
doesn't matter what the shape or size of
your<00:00:45.660> cutter<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.260> long<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.010> use<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
your cutter is as long as you use the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.389 
your cutter is as long as you use the
same<00:00:47.610> amount<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.180> each<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.920> for<00:00:49.920> these<00:00:50.070> beads

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
same amount for each one for these beads

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.790 
same amount for each one for these beads
I<00:00:50.640> know<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.510> four<00:00:51.899> pieces<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.620> there

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
I know I use about four pieces in there

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
I know I use about four pieces in there
and<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.670> ultralite<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.300> kind<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.600> push<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and the ultralite you kind of push it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.200 
and the ultralite you kind of push it
together<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.379> little<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.000> roll

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
together a little bit and then just roll

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
together a little bit and then just roll
and<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.109> nothing<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.920> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and you just really nothing and so you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.369 
and you just really nothing and so you
could<00:00:59.370> use<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> larger<00:01:00.059> circle<00:01:00.600> cutter<00:01:00.870> sure

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
could use a larger circle cutter sure

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.770 
could use a larger circle cutter sure
smaller<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:02.489> sure<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.480> get<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
smaller just sure that way you get the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.240 
smaller just sure that way you get the
consistency<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> when<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:04.920> doing<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
consistency and when you're doing a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.340 
consistency and when you're doing a
gradated<00:01:05.820> size<00:01:06.090> necklace<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.200> can

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
gradated size necklace like that you can

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
gradated size necklace like that you can
start<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.920> largest<00:01:08.250> bead<00:01:08.549> maybe<00:01:08.820> seven

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
start with your largest bead maybe seven

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
start with your largest bead maybe seven
of<00:01:09.479> these<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> six<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.369> five

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
of these and then go to six and the five

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
of these and then go to six and the five
and<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> four<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.320> different

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and the four and you get your different

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.679 
and the four and you get your different
size<00:01:13.860> beads<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
size beads then when I have all the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.020 
size beads then when I have all the
beads<00:01:15.869> ready<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.259> bake<00:01:16.590> them<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.790> them

beads ready I bake them and I have them
here<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.540> coil<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> use<00:01:19.590> my

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
here in this coil because I use my

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.350 
here in this coil because I use my
larger<00:01:20.189> cutters<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.610> call<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:20.939> my<00:01:21.090> bead

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
larger cutters I call them my bead

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.120 
larger cutters I call them my bead
Corral's<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.200> such<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> great<00:01:22.590> tip<00:01:22.830> yeah

round beads your filler beads and things

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.399 
round beads your filler beads and things
that<00:01:26.369> keeps<00:01:26.880> them<00:01:27.119> corralled<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> oven<00:01:28.170> so

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that keeps them corralled in the oven so

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.020 
that keeps them corralled in the oven so
that<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.650> don't<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.159> beads<00:01:29.369> rolling<00:01:29.850> all

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that you don't have beads rolling all

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.660 
that you don't have beads rolling all
over<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> oven<00:01:30.810> which<00:01:30.960> I've<00:01:31.200> done<00:01:31.470> right<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670

son who is a master model painter has
taught<00:03:02.989> me<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.200> always<00:03:03.470> use<00:03:03.799> two<00:03:04.040> different

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
taught me to always use two different

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.850 
taught me to always use two different
colors<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.390> have<00:03:05.720> like<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> dark<00:03:06.230> mud<00:03:06.530> brown

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
on here too and you just sort of blot it

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.380 
on here too and you just sort of blot it
on<00:03:09.860> make<00:03:10.190> sure<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.549> get<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.819> down<00:03:11.000> into<00:03:11.269> all

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
on make sure you get it down into all

on make sure you get it down into all
those<00:03:11.750> deep<00:03:11.959> crevices<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.799> your<00:03:12.829> texture<00:03:13.660> once

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
those deep crevices of your texture once

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.120 
those deep crevices of your texture once
you<00:03:14.840> have<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.110> there<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.500> take<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.739> damp

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
you have it there it is take a damp

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.979 
you have it there it is take a damp
paper<00:03:16.340> towel<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.060> wipe<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.599> just<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.900> little

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
paper towel and wipe it just a little

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.710 
paper towel and wipe it just a little
bit<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.519> stays<00:03:19.790> into<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.269> textures

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
bit so that it stays into the textures

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.319 
bit so that it stays into the textures
like<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:21.109> isn't<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.680> neat<00:03:21.950> yes<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:22.910> it

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
like that isn't that neat yes it is it

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.210 
like that isn't that neat yes it is it
really<00:03:23.720> highlights<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:24.319> it<00:03:24.500> really<00:03:24.680> does<00:03:25.010> it

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
really highlights it it really does it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.910 
really highlights it it really does it
really<00:03:25.250> enhances<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.150> texture<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.930> once

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
really enhances the texture and once

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.520 
really enhances the texture and once
that<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.190> dry<00:03:28.549> I<00:03:28.970> like<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.750> back<00:03:29.959> he's<00:03:30.290> also

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
that is dry I like to go back he's also

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.740 
that is dry I like to go back he's also
taught<00:03:30.889> me<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.459> add<00:03:31.609> your<00:03:31.850> highlights<00:03:32.299> back<00:03:32.540> on

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
taught me to add your highlights back on

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.440 
taught me to add your highlights back on
so<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.500> take<00:03:33.829> my<00:03:33.859> metallic<00:03:34.340> stamp<00:03:34.819> pad<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.389> you

so I take my metallic stamp pad and you

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.210 
so I take my metallic stamp pad and you
can<00:03:35.630> literally<00:03:35.959> just<00:03:36.290> wipe<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.709> across<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
can literally just wipe it across the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.069 
can literally just wipe it across the
pad<00:03:37.430> if<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.730> want<00:03:37.910> to<00:03:38.120> really<00:03:38.660> brings<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.019> up

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
metallic clay I wouldn't have guessed

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.349 
metallic clay I wouldn't have guessed
that<00:03:42.109> you<00:03:42.290> are<00:03:42.440> highlighting<00:03:43.010> yeah<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:43.819> it's

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
a very subtle especially on the metallic

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.580 
a very subtle especially on the metallic
clays<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.790> do<00:03:46.940> this<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.750> can<00:03:47.930> use<00:03:48.109> your<00:03:48.230> finger

clays to do this you can use your finger
to<00:03:48.739> apply<00:03:48.769> it<00:03:49.069> or<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.519> can<00:03:49.700> just<00:03:49.850> take<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.090> just

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
to apply it or you can just take it just

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.420 
to apply it or you can just take it just
rub<00:03:50.660> it<00:03:50.750> across<00:03:50.840> there<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.500> can<00:03:51.709> see<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.160> adds

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
rub it across there you can see it adds

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.120 
rub it across there you can see it adds
those<00:03:52.760> beautiful<00:03:53.329> highlights<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.650> pretty<00:03:54.950> now

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
how do you make a hole I use a dremel at

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.379 
how do you make a hole I use a dremel at
home<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.950> drill<00:03:58.160> through<00:03:58.400> these<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:59.030> ultra

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
home to drill through these the ultra

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.270 
home to drill through these the ultra
light<00:03:59.569> clay<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.989> very<00:04:00.380> light<00:04:00.709> texture<00:04:01.069> it's

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
light clay is very light texture it's

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.920 
light clay is very light texture it's
very<00:04:01.459> easy<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:02.030> go<00:04:02.180> through<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:02.630> you<00:04:02.690> could

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
very easy to go through so you could

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.780 
very easy to go through so you could
actually<00:04:03.200> use<00:04:03.650> your<00:04:03.920> hand<00:04:04.190> drill<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.670> go

right through these - okay perfect yes
it's<00:04:07.549> great<00:04:07.609> well<00:04:07.819> let's<00:04:07.970> take<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.150> look<00:04:08.359> at<00:04:08.450> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
it's great well let's take a look at the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.240 
it's great well let's take a look at the
necklace<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:09.019> you<00:04:09.109> made<00:04:09.290> so<00:04:09.739> this<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.130> the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
necklace that you made so this is the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.559 
necklace that you made so this is the
graduated<00:04:10.819> pattern<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.239> you're<00:04:11.359> talking

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
graduated pattern that you're talking

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.330 
graduated pattern that you're talking
about<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.319> smaller<00:04:12.620> beads<00:04:12.829> at<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.040> back<00:04:13.220> and

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
about the smaller beads at the back and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.520 
about the smaller beads at the back and
that<00:04:13.400> makes<00:04:13.549> it<00:04:13.730> nice<00:04:13.849> to<00:04:14.030> wear<00:04:14.209> -<00:04:14.480> yeah<00:04:14.720> yeah

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
that makes it nice to wear - yeah yeah

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.409 
that makes it nice to wear - yeah yeah
and<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:15.919> I<00:04:15.950> started<00:04:16.430> with<00:04:16.579> about<00:04:16.609> eight<00:04:17.060> or

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
and so I started with about eight or

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.310 
and so I started with about eight or
nine<00:04:18.310> cuts<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.519> my<00:04:19.700> cutter<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:20.479> do<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.870> center

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
nine cuts of my cutter to do the center

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.020 
nine cuts of my cutter to do the center
bead<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.680> then<00:04:21.769> just<00:04:22.099> made<00:04:22.400> smaller<00:04:22.789> and

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
bead and then just made smaller and

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.850 
bead and then just made smaller and
smaller<00:04:23.300> amounts<00:04:23.720> after<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.680> what

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
smaller amounts after that and what

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.860 
smaller amounts after that and what
about<00:04:25.039> this<00:04:25.159> one<00:04:25.430> just<00:04:25.880> has<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.060> real

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.850 
like you dug this up yeah that's about
silver<00:04:29.419> clay<00:04:29.660> my<00:04:29.930> good<00:04:30.080> doing<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.410> same<00:04:30.650> type

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
silver clay my good doing the same type

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.040 
silver clay my good doing the same type
of<00:04:30.919> patterning<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.699> don't<00:04:32.330> think<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:32.630> used<00:04:32.660> my

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
of patterning I don't think I used my
