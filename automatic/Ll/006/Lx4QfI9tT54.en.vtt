00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.899
 smartphones as if it were raining 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.120
 here at mobile world congress on 01net 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.950
 tv and when there is more there is 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.240
 still we are on the stand asus where 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.099
 we will discover beer a new 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:22.740
 range of smartphones and even products 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:24.300
 rather unusual hybrids is yes had to get 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.769
 therefore launches on the market of the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.810
 mobile phone in France is a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.859
 novelty it's a novelty with no 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.990
 bad new products you said 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.430
 jérôme and we start with iphones 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.239
 who are there and who exists in three 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.149
 screen sizes 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.739
 here are 4 5 and 6 inches and their 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.780
 particularities of these three smartphones 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.579
 asus and well be careful 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.280
 attention attention sends the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.230
 drum bearings 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.890
 they are smartphones under processor 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.059
 intel in the back they managed have 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.430
 managed to fit a thesis no I'm 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.500
 nasty no it's rare it's true that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.030
 very little finally intel smartphones 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.850
 here in Basel congress zoo 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.199
 than anyway for some of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.049
 his collection decided to make 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.930
 trust intel whose processors 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.310
 quite respectable by the way 3 3 3 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.439
 types of processors at least three 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.210
 different powers since we are 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.159
 on three models then particularity to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.540
 level design we will find small 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.890
 interchangeable shells that allow 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.420
 to change color six colors 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.250
 different so here is also a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.840
 new interface an interface that has 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.880
 been completely reworked by asus 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.680
 which is called lazer night yes a 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.119
 overlay makes it a killer layer you there 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.650
 to give a little air a little more 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.240
 staff and how it is accessed and well 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.979
 you know that especially smartphones 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 android if we do that we have the center of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.850
 logical notifications and well there you 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.390
 do the same thing but in the corner 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.329
 right and hop we rolled out that's it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.460
 so asus has also improved the fact of 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.720
 able to take pictures with 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.680
 systems that make it even more necessary 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.479
 contrasted and so on 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.880
 we're going to say that it's still 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.020
 enough c 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.730
 classic and then the navigation in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.940
 the photo album ac the zoom system which 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.490
 is rather elegant too they have a 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.110
 organization system for your planning 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.390
 is called do it later finally brief 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.540
 small features but françois 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.380
 way a shock a shock again 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.270
 so maybe it's because 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.960
 these outlets are not equipped with 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.610
 intel processor 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.320
 they are not four I have friends and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.690
 not 4g on these products that 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.190
 will still be offered at prices not 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.690
 so low that that's about 150 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.640
 250 and 300 350 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.250
 this is for packaged smartphones 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.450
 it's a bit strange but what is 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.520
 certain is that in France we are 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.840
 shock because at the 4g is there she is 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.220
 arrived very fast here is read my father 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.010
 that they also have by free mobile etc 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.420
 who was we going to say allowed the users actually 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.530
 lower the prices of 4g rooms and 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.460
 in other countries were not yet 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.710
 went as fast 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.060
 a good argument then maybe it's 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.620
 also due to the fact that they are 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.570
 intel processors that is not 4g 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.070
 Here is what Intel is ready to 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.660
 crisps is 4g in his smartphones 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.190
 nothing is less sure maybe he 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.380
 a little late good so that's 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.150
 so for iphone 4 you follow us 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.830
 because we have another beauty very 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.320
 nice to show you here on the stand 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.209
 asus and here we show you the 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.950
 phone tabs so this is a concept that 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.500
 already existed a jérôme exactly one 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.540
 smartphone a tablet and the magic 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.030
 is that I put the smartphone in the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.650
 tablet and there I end up with a 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.390
 much wider screen a lot more 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.100
 comfortable and you said it's a 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.200
 product that actually is already out with 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.200
 this 10 inch tablet then 4g well 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.900
 sure that these two jewels made asus 1 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.890
 it will cost around 800 euros 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.870
 finally here it is the best of the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.480
 narcy technology and adding new 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.890
 of fun this is the model here is the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.650
 novelty is the 7 inch version 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.110
 so same system exactly a little 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.760
 smartphone that will be housed in the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.830
 tablet to benefit from a better 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.260
 screen and this time on a product 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.430
 good on a mini tablet since 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.350
 this is the big mode of tablets min 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.580
 so all the intelligence and in the 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.650
 phone if they wanted in the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.959
 tablet there in fact there is only one screen 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.450
 and the battery is really a party 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.010
 we will say here is processor etc 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.780
 everything is in the phone is in 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.890
 plugging in the phone you have a 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.860
 bigger screen it's pretty clever 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.540
 especially as the price 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.430
 and really very interesting very 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.600
 aggressive since it should be proposed 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.240
 from what we are animated is still 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.260
 a bit confidential around 300 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.580
 euros in France 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.590
 that's a good all of a sudden it's less 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.190
 confidential but it does not matter we have 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.210
 dropped the piece 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.890
 that's it but I think it's a 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.990
 nice concept because it's true that 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.220
 the smartphone is ultra mobility no 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.090
 for all but as soon as I arrive at your house 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.940
 or in the office or elsewhere 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.530
 well you feel like 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.290
 to benefit from a little more surface 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.980
 of display is there so we have this 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.480
 possibility 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.610
 see for example in the take 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.960
 the plane we are in the transports there we 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.340
 has a two in a year done that is rather 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.840
 malignant and so what is interesting 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.940
 is that of course as there is a 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.600
 battery there when the phone is 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.980
 almost empty 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.930
 just plug it in so that 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.430
 precisely he recharges himself there two 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.200
 batteries in fact in this device is 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.570
 a single package to operate 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.070
 the small and the big screen on the other hand 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.660
 particularity on all products 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.300
 that we come to show us well 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.250
 natively there are two sim cards one can 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.690
 put two sim cards his series of 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.880
 the unoci of big trends to this 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.060
 nice Baselese congress 2014 had a lot 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.440
 of phones have this dual sim to have 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.700
 to actually manage two subscriptions 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.710
 behind choice in May françois it is necessary 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.270
 specify this topic that despite everything and 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.320
 well we will not see them everywhere these 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.060
 mines phones in China because the 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.800
 operators do not want it and yes 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.360
 the French operator it scares them yes 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.280
 because they are afraid that you put 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.140
 a sim card at home and then another 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.490
 to another operator and his ouhlala 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.630
 it's not good and so that's good it's a 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.460
 little bit weak as reflection because 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.200
 that you could very well imagine having 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.640
 two subscriptions from the same operator on 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.930
 the same phone and he could 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.580
 just used to make specials 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.320
 and cheaper subscriptions if we 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.770
 takes two finally planned prone a perso 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.540
 etc. 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.770
 that was just a little here is a 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.780
 little trick for operators 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.120
 last thing about this device 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.370
 it is not 4g this one is it and the one 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.870
 this is only h + again because 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.280
 that it's intel processor and we 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.350
 returns to the problems that evoked 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.419
 just now this is all the case 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.740
 these little news asus that are 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.630
 rather not uninteresting 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.620
 thanks follow us from barcelona josé 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.620
 ronez tv has very quickly
