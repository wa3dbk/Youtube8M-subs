00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.850
 hello how about friends followers of 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.980
 Youtube 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.980
 today we are going to see 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.060
 a video about the mangosteen 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.710
 of this information 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.580
 we found very few 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.730
 the network on the internet 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:39.250
 well then today we meet 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.880
 in the city of ladybug tolima 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.050
 in the farm country house of the company 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.050
 carolina fish 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.180
 we are in the house lot 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.130
 where we have seeded 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.070
 and 1,225 trees which in this 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.300
 moment for today 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.659
 October 2, 2014 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.460
 they are in bloom for the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.630
 harvest will 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.630
 in mid- November 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.590
 December, January and part of February 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.070
 as you can observe 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.780
 we have some trees 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.430
 enough size 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.790
 and the trees are 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.790
 8 to 9 meters an average height 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.550
 this lot consists as I said 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.550
 previously of 1,225 trees 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.270
 which are well distributed by 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.740
 grooves 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.720
 it also consists 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.720
 with a sprinkler irrigation system 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.160
 we approach here to the part to 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.570
 Stem advance 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.560
 where we have the type of irrigation of 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.560
 people we use 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.140
 irrigation 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.130
 of the trees 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.130
 the slime mango 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.810
 It is a fruit that although it has been years 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.180
 roughly about 25 to 30 years 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.489
 here in colombia 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.390
 It is a fruit that still many 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.319
 people 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.319
 they do not know her 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.510
 even one goes to the Andean region 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.510
 to the Caribbean region 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.000
 there is no knowledge many people do not 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.830
 They know about 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.510
 of this sensational fruit 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.400
 mangoes and not as such has some 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.840
 Benefits 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:09.540
 very very good for health 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.540
 it's an antioxidant song 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.260
 an antioxidant like the grape 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.260
 that contain 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.140
 a series of elements that help 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.730
 the cell and to regenerate cells 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.290
 as I said earlier 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.680
 on the internet very little information 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.360
 is about the mangosteen and 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.360
 more since Colombia 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.430
 we carry 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.599
 22 years 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.599
 with this crop 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.230
 well after 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.349
 we have not been the pioneers in having 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.590
 this crop here in colombia although already 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.890
 there are quite a few extensions 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.400
 great in other parts of colombia like 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.040
 in the plains 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.720
 like in the choco that also already 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.250
 find 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.250
 find trees planted 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.099
 and as we can observe 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.930
 the fruit is beginning to have a 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:29.860
 fill 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.910
 and you will have to cover this entire part 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.910
 the part of the leaf 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.520
 covered by filling the fruit for 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:44.410
 it reaches its normal harvest size 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.410
 also the fruit 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:53.330
 it tends to have a characteristic a 

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:56.020
 look very similar to those that 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.750
 to the fruits of coffee 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.750
 they also do is like this process 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.160
 from harvest 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.390
 which when the coffee makers 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:17.580
 to his collection 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:20.260
 they find red coffee painter mature 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.689
 go with the mangosteen 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.119
 by the size of the trees 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.549
 it's quite complicated to do the 

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:32.309
 collection because the collection is 

00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:32.309
 makes manual through congo the 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.880
 it takes a lot of labor to 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.900
 do this process 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.550
 always tends to have 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.590
 a margin 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.990
 a very low percentage of fruit that 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.900
 I have that we have the trees and 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.590
 that with the passage of the days we are created 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.570
 because this is a route that matures 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.129
 very fast one can spend harvesting 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:01.449
 this lot for example today 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:04.669
 we heard the whole lot of the 1,225 trees 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.189
 and tomorrow it will be again 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.159
 harvest because when it starts its 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:12.889
 point to give harvest point daily and 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:15.909
 who does the collection 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.909
 over here we have
