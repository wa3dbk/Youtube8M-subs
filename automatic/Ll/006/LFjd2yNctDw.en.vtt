00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
start with an up or down I mean it

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.750 
start with an up or down I mean it
really<00:02:33.290> depends<00:02:33.710> on<00:02:33.740> how<00:02:33.860> i<00:02:33.890> feel<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.580> there's

no<00:02:34.850> date<00:02:35.090> set<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.990> here<00:02:36.140> we<00:02:36.170> go

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.840 

okay<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.460> second<00:02:52.460> part<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.640> comes

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
okay so second part is and that comes

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:05.630 
okay so second part is and that comes
out<00:02:55.970> through

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.370 

it's<00:03:06.640> just<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.910> hammer<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.380> after<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.500> nine<00:03:08.710> so

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:35.250 

wise<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.420> put<00:03:19.750> out<00:03:19.780> with<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.230> metronome

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:45.530 

next<00:03:36.260> part<00:03:36.610> so<00:03:37.610> sometime

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.030 

Oh

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.729 

so<00:03:54.040> that's<00:03:54.550> for<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.849> next<00:03:55.000> part<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:56.140> then<00:03:56.410> I

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
so that's for that next part and then I

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.170 
so that's for that next part and then I
think<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.069> ain't<00:03:57.190> variations<00:03:57.730> at<00:03:57.879> the<00:03:58.000> end

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
think you ain't variations at the end

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.550 
think you ain't variations at the end
instead<00:03:58.390> of<00:04:03.840> which<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:04.959> on<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.080> time<00:04:05.349> in<00:04:05.470> a

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
instead of which is on the time in a

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:30.779 
instead of which is on the time in a
second

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.580
