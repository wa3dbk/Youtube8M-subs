00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.940
 honestly attack the current one in a 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.610
 Jairus story based on World of

 from borland that maybe they have them in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.850

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.939
 Difficult game valued with a 7 out of 10 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.189
 textile and play through a game 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.949
 equivalent to a beautiful mansion full of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.560
 cheap furniture and one m / m 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.510
 with almost no social function a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.149
 multiplayer with chances to know 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.920
 people and a single player game with 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.379
 About a week of contents 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.230
 casual but if you can not resist 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.539
 this for a long time this spy 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.510
 pizzi promises to fix all this with 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.510
 three very lucrative letters of lc 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.940
 transformed into a guardian of the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.100
 galaxy no no 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.110
 those are great these guys 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.540
 presenting three races that do not have 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.550
 no difference and three classes that 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.280
 they have a slight difference by scarce 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.530
 minutes explores the solar system with a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.660
 even smaller version of Peter 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.670
 dinklage with the worst role played 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.050
 for a good actor from bill murray 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.050
 acting on ghost hunters 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.580
 try to get completely excited for a 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.880
 boring shot in sight while doing 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880
 its appearance 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.750
 with each other I can not skip this 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.050
 if a patient guardian while he does 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.050
 something 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.450

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.990
 only player about protecting the sick and 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.420
 magical space war that by no 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.610
 reason you 'll want to know too much about this 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.010
 silly story unlocking all the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.410
 story collecting space cards 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.600
 Get out of the game to clean yourself in bungee 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.460

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.180
 with rare information 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.160
 seriously nobody does that experience the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.590
 real game once your guardian 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.170
 reach level 20 when you go to fight 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.120
 with forces of evil where you will pay against 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.220
 a random generator system 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.770
 enemy where you will get the best 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.230
 items depending on your abilities or 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.690
 of the resistance of your enemies or the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.920

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.349

 wonderful graphics excellent music and 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.069
 an addictive gameplay but when you 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.140

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.400
 gross of your country to be developed 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.810
 it will be better to at least allow 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.000
 exchange items with other players 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.110
