how to make the best defense type

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.470 
how to make the best defense type
labeling<00:00:10.920> as<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.400> said<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:11.760> the<00:00:11.879> other<00:00:12.030> videos

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
labeling as I said in the other videos

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.379 
labeling as I said in the other videos
it's<00:00:12.750> not<00:00:12.809> going<00:00:13.199> to<00:00:13.379> be<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:14.490> very<00:00:14.670> best<00:00:14.760> one

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
it's not going to be the very best one

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.180 
it's not going to be the very best one
that<00:00:15.629> is<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:16.110> going<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.410> be<00:00:16.619> rough

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
that is just going to be rough

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.509 
that is just going to be rough
guidelines<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.750> let's<00:00:18.960> get<00:00:19.110> right<00:00:19.320> onto<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.949> as

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 
guidelines so let's get right onto it as

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.120 
guidelines so let's get right onto it as
in<00:00:20.820> all<00:00:20.939> my<00:00:21.089> other<00:00:21.359> videos<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> will<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.320> using<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
in all my other videos I will be using a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.859 
in all my other videos I will be using a
beyblade<00:00:23.910> v4<00:00:24.570> Stadium<00:00:25.730> made<00:00:26.730> by<00:00:26.939> Hasbro<00:00:27.509> I

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
beyblade v4 Stadium made by Hasbro I

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.130 
beyblade v4 Stadium made by Hasbro I
think<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.210> all<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> parts<00:00:30.839> I'll<00:00:31.019> be

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
think so here all the parts I'll be

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.860 
think so here all the parts I'll be
choosing<00:00:31.380> from<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.980> today's<00:00:32.279> video<00:00:32.750> from<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
face bolt as I said in all the other

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.910 
face bolt as I said in all the other
videos<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.420> doesn't<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.050> matter<00:00:37.379> which

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
videos it doesn't really matter which

energy<00:01:00.329> ring<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.840> am<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.649> choosing<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
energy ring I am going to be choosing a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.130 
energy ring I am going to be choosing a
nice<00:01:03.420> smooth<00:01:05.300> finish<00:01:06.300> one<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:09.140> will

nice smooth finish one because it will
it's<00:01:11.330> basically<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:13.230> stops<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.190> from<00:01:14.220> being

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
it's basically it stops it from being

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.210 
it's basically it stops it from being
hit<00:01:15.030> by<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.810> other<00:01:16.050> blade<00:01:16.320> blades<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.950> much

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
close-up on it but the metal wheel I'm

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.790 
close-up on it but the metal wheel I'm
going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> choose<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:25.430> nice<00:01:26.430> thick<00:01:27.300> one<00:01:27.930> very

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.660 
going to choose a nice thick one very
heavy<00:01:29.010> with<00:01:29.940> lots<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.710> bumps<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.160> not

spikes but bumps so if it hit gets hit

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.080 
spikes but bumps so if it hit gets hit
by<00:01:35.730> spike<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.420> will<00:01:36.570> deflect<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.260> very<00:01:37.530> well

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
by spike it will deflect it very well

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.330 
by spike it will deflect it very well
it's<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.360> close-up<00:01:40.430> just<00:01:41.430> all-around<00:01:42.200> good

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
it's your close-up just all-around good

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
it's your close-up just all-around good
for<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> spin<00:01:44.730> track<00:01:45.090> I'm<00:01:45.330> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.870> pick<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
nice big one with loads of spikes on it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.530 
nice big one with loads of spikes on it
it<00:01:55.020> helps<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> create<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.830> world<00:01:56.130> ball

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
finally for the tip I'm going to pick a

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.050 
finally for the tip I'm going to pick a
nice<00:02:02.010> thick<00:02:02.880> tip<00:02:03.860> that's<00:02:04.860> why<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.730> picking

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
nice thick tip that's why I'm picking

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.859 
nice thick tip that's why I'm picking
this<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.260> know<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.459> was<00:02:08.550> meant<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.879> be<00:02:08.970> spiky

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
this one I know it was meant to be spiky

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.429 
this one I know it was meant to be spiky
at<00:02:09.959> first<00:02:10.400> when<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.430> first<00:02:11.519> got<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:12.480> some

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
at first when I first got it but some

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.800 
at first when I first got it but some
reason<00:02:13.739> I've<00:02:13.890> lost<00:02:14.069> my<00:02:14.280> wide<00:02:14.459> ball<00:02:14.760> so

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
reason I've lost my wide ball so

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.260 
reason I've lost my wide ball so
here's<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.140> close-up<00:02:19.760> that's<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:20.970> dirty

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
here's a close-up that's right dirty

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.770 
here's a close-up that's right dirty
because<00:02:21.959> it's<00:02:22.170> been<00:02:22.590> spent<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.280> concrete<00:02:23.780> but

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
because it's been spent on concrete but

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.600 
because it's been spent on concrete but
it<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.110> that's<00:02:25.650> why<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.100> melt<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.760> bottom

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
it is that's why it's melt at the bottom

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.130 
it is that's why it's melt at the bottom
so<00:02:29.610> I've<00:02:29.700> built<00:02:29.940> up<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.330> beyblade<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.020> this

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
so I've built up the beyblade and this

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.660 
so I've built up the beyblade and this
is<00:02:31.290> basically<00:02:31.560> what<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.130> looks<00:02:32.310> like

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.050 

nice<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.030> thick<00:02:36.440> no<00:02:37.440> spikes<00:02:38.250> coming<00:02:38.760> out<00:02:38.850> of

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
nice and thick no spikes coming out of

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.490 
nice and thick no spikes coming out of
it<00:02:39.180> except<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:39.750> here<00:02:39.930> which<00:02:40.110> will<00:02:40.319> create

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
it except for here which will create

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.650 
it except for here which will create
overall<00:02:41.720> turnover<00:02:42.720> other<00:02:43.440> beyblades<00:02:44.010> away<00:02:44.660> so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
overall turnover other beyblades away so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.900 
overall turnover other beyblades away so
yeah<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.190> one<00:02:47.340> I'm<00:02:47.520> going<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.820> be

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
yeah this is the one I'm going to be

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.910 
yeah this is the one I'm going to be
using<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:49.080> best<00:02:49.290> defensive<00:02:49.800> type

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
using for the best defensive type

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.070 
using for the best defensive type
they've<00:02:50.130> played<00:02:50.370> with<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> blade<00:02:51.690> blade<00:02:51.870> I'm

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
they've played with a blade blade I'm

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.259 
they've played with a blade blade I'm
fighting<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.680> against<00:02:53.250> I'm<00:02:53.430> using<00:02:53.850> storm

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
fighting it against I'm using storm

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.920 
fighting it against I'm using storm
Pegasus<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:56.040> final<00:02:56.580> drive<00:02:56.930> instead

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
Pegasus but with a final drive instead

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.080 
Pegasus but with a final drive instead
of<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> robber<00:02:58.530> flat<00:02:58.860> tip<00:02:59.190> because<00:02:59.580> otherwise

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
of the robber flat tip because otherwise

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.449 
of the robber flat tip because otherwise
it<00:03:00.360> will<00:03:00.420> be<00:03:00.569> really<00:03:00.989> unfair<00:03:01.380> because<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.370> was

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
it will be really unfair because it was

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.970 
it will be really unfair because it was
only<00:03:02.610> last<00:03:02.880> couple<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.360> seconds<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.620> I'm

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
only last couple of seconds so I'm

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.850 
only last couple of seconds so I'm
guessing<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:06.180> called<00:03:06.569> big<00:03:07.319> bang

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
guessing this is called big bang

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.050 
guessing this is called big bang
Pegasus<00:03:08.400> now<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.150> think<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.870> don't<00:03:10.230> know<00:03:10.910> for<00:03:11.910> the
