Kobayashi for next year and that's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.270 
Kobayashi for next year and that's
something<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.600> could<00:01:21.600> happen<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
personally I think that Esteban

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.929 
personally I think that Esteban
Gutierrez<00:01:25.229> will<00:01:25.650> most<00:01:25.920> likely<00:01:26.159> take<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> seat

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
Gutierrez will most likely take the seat

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.170 
Gutierrez will most likely take the seat
at<00:01:27.119> Salva<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.170> he's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.950> young<00:01:29.189> driver<00:01:29.400> he

going to be moving to McLaren next year
which<00:02:27.090> obviously<00:02:27.480> left<00:02:27.930> an<00:02:28.110> open<00:02:28.410> seat<00:02:28.650> which

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
which obviously left an open seat which

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.770 
which obviously left an open seat which
Nico<00:02:29.220> Hulkenberg<00:02:29.670> took<00:02:29.910> from<00:02:30.209> his<00:02:30.510> force

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
india seat and that obviously leaves a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.630 
india seat and that obviously leaves a

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
which means that at force india I mean

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.740 
which means that at force india I mean
alguersuari<00:02:47.340> could<00:02:47.849> go<00:02:48.000> there<00:02:48.180> Sebastien
