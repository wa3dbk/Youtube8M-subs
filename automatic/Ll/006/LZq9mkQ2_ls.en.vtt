as you said seems the the vehicles tend
to<00:00:59.129> shudder<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.180> lack<00:01:00.719> acceleration<00:01:01.710> seems

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
to shudder and lack acceleration seems

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.560 
to shudder and lack acceleration seems
like<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> lot<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> problems<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.510> been

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
like a lot of the problems have been

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
like a lot of the problems have been

what<00:01:05.670> I'm<00:01:05.790> understanding<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.530> has<00:01:07.710> been<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
what I'm understanding but it has been a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.910 
what I'm understanding but it has been a
problem<00:01:08.479> looking<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> f-150<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
problem looking at the f-150 but it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.850 
problem looking at the f-150 but it
would<00:01:11.070> expand<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.240> sure<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.750> other<00:01:12.930> fruits

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
would expand I'm sure to other fruits

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.219 
would expand I'm sure to other fruits
that<00:01:13.950> use<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> EcoBoost<00:01:15.060> engine<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.110> get

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
that use that EcoBoost engine so we get

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
that use that EcoBoost engine so we get
the<00:01:16.290> EcoBoost<00:01:16.890> engine<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.430> ford<00:01:17.729> flex

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the EcoBoost engine and the ford flex

this<00:01:30.689> size<00:01:31.110> tap<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> problem<00:01:32.430> that's

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
this size tap is a problem that's

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.960 
this size tap is a problem that's
emanating<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:34.380> EPA<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.700> just

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
emanating from an EPA that is just

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.560 
emanating from an EPA that is just
putting<00:01:36.240> such<00:01:36.720> strict<00:01:37.590> requirements<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.759> fuel

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
putting such strict requirements on fuel

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200 
putting such strict requirements on fuel
standards<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.740> manufacturers<00:01:41.729> are<00:01:41.909> having

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
standards that manufacturers are having

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.690 
standards that manufacturers are having
a<00:01:42.299> hard<00:01:42.540> time<00:01:42.630> keeping<00:01:43.290> up<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.890> technologies

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
a hard time keeping up the technologies

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
a hard time keeping up the technologies
are<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:45.899> ready<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.439> meet<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.159> rising

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
are not ready to meet the rising

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.330 
are not ready to meet the rising
requirements<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.170> seems<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.860> these<00:01:50.009> cars

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
requirements so it seems like these cars

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.770 
requirements so it seems like these cars
are<00:01:50.520> hitting<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.790> roads<00:01:51.090> before<00:01:51.390> they've

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
are hitting the roads before they've

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.280 
are hitting the roads before they've
been<00:01:51.930> properly<00:01:52.380> tested<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.549> safety<00:01:54.290> and

Nitsa was a little slow on particularly

the<00:03:04.770> lithium-ion<00:03:05.340> batteries<00:03:06.060> looks<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:06.930> we

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
the lithium-ion batteries looks like we

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.510 
the lithium-ion batteries looks like we
had<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.320> same<00:03:07.350> pattern<00:03:07.980> there<00:03:08.190> where<00:03:08.370> these

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
had the same pattern there where these

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.790 
had the same pattern there where these
things<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.970> hit<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.330> road<00:03:09.540> before<00:03:09.870> that

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
things just hit the road before that

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.940 
things just hit the road before that
they<00:03:10.980> were<00:03:11.010> properly<00:03:11.580> tested<00:03:12.590> before<00:03:13.590> they

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
they were properly tested before they

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.390 
they were properly tested before they
are<00:03:14.070> properly<00:03:14.489> tested<00:03:15.230> now<00:03:16.230> I'd<00:03:16.410> say<00:03:16.680> all<00:03:16.950> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
are properly tested now I'd say all the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.979 
are properly tested now I'd say all the
commercials<00:03:17.910> are<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.269> has<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:21.269> best<00:03:21.540> on<00:03:21.750> gas

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
commercials are for has the best on gas

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.810 
commercials are for has the best on gas
mileage<00:03:22.530> because<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.070> can<00:03:23.250> give<00:03:23.489> them<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.640> run

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
mileage because it can give them a run

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.910 
mileage because it can give them a run
and<00:03:25.519> their<00:03:26.519> junk<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.299> mean<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.290> got<00:03:28.560> no<00:03:28.650> more<00:03:28.830> to

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and their junk I mean I got no more to

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.900 
and their junk I mean I got no more to
say<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.160> guys<00:03:29.480> later<00:03:30.480> oh<00:03:31.340> yeah<00:03:32.340> if<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.610> watch
