00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
today I'm going to show you how to clean

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.809 
today I'm going to show you how to clean
an<00:00:02.220> inter<00:00:02.520> core<00:00:02.929> 10th<00:00:03.929> aerosol<00:00:04.470> cell<00:00:04.830> let<00:00:05.759> me

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
an inter core 10th aerosol cell let me

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.280 
an inter core 10th aerosol cell let me
go<00:00:05.910> over<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.120> lights<00:00:06.299> real<00:00:06.569> quick<00:00:06.839> right<00:00:07.140> now

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
go over the lights real quick right now

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.850 
go over the lights real quick right now
this<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.740> showing<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.280> one<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.580> clean

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
this is showing that this one is clean

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.759 
this is showing that this one is clean
this<00:00:11.210> cell-like<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.420> flashing<00:00:12.809> green<00:00:13.170> that

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
this cell-like is flashing green that

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.589 
this cell-like is flashing green that
means<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.370> sensor<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.790> here<00:00:15.000> says<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
means that the sensor in here says the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.810 
means that the sensor in here says the
cell<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.990> dirty<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:17.010> sometimes<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.670> doesn't

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
cell is dirty but sometimes it doesn't

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.880 
cell is dirty but sometimes it doesn't
work<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.690> cells<00:00:18.900> dirty<00:00:19.140> regardless<00:00:19.710> one

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
work in the cells dirty regardless one

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.080 
work in the cells dirty regardless one
way<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.100> know<00:00:20.279> if<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.430> cell<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.789> actually

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
way to know if the cell is actually

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.910 
way to know if the cell is actually
dirty<00:00:21.420> too<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.810> if<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.050> salt<00:00:22.260> level<00:00:22.590> starts<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
dirty too is if the salt level starts to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.400 
dirty too is if the salt level starts to
drop<00:00:23.210> before<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.420> ever<00:00:24.570> add<00:00:24.779> any<00:00:24.990> salt<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
drop before I ever add any salt to a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.290 
drop before I ever add any salt to a
boil<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.769> clean<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> cell<00:00:26.609> because<00:00:26.910> sometimes

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
boil I clean the cell because sometimes

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.500 
boil I clean the cell because sometimes
it<00:00:27.480> will<00:00:27.689> show<00:00:27.930> yellow<00:00:28.439> or<00:00:29.220> red<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.880> it's

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
it will show yellow or red and it's

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.690 
it will show yellow or red and it's
actually<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:30.960> dirty<00:00:31.170> not<00:00:31.529> producing<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
actually just dirty not producing the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.690 
actually just dirty not producing the
salt<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.480> sells<00:00:33.690> dirty<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.700> really

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
salt because it sells dirty so really

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.430 
salt because it sells dirty so really
you<00:00:35.790> should<00:00:35.940> never<00:00:36.059> add<00:00:36.329> salt<00:00:36.809> until<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you should never add salt until you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
you should never add salt until you
check<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.980> make<00:00:38.129> sure<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.460> salt<00:00:38.640> cell<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
check to make sure the salt cell is

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
check to make sure the salt cell is
clean<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> an<00:00:40.140> accurate

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
clean and that this is an accurate

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.830 
clean and that this is an accurate
reading<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:41.489> some<00:00:41.670> times<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.360> more<00:00:42.660> than

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
reading because some times or more than

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.270 
reading because some times or more than
likely<00:00:42.989> after<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.350> clean<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> cell<00:00:43.920> if

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
likely after you clean the cell if

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.860 
likely after you clean the cell if
you're<00:00:44.460> showing<00:00:44.579> yellow<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.090> will<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you're showing yellow it will go back to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.529 
you're showing yellow it will go back to
green<00:00:46.230> good<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.910> had<00:00:48.030> too<00:00:48.180> much<00:00:48.210> salt

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
green good and if you had too much salt

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.200 
green good and if you had too much salt
to<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:48.780> pool<00:00:49.340> this<00:00:50.340> good<00:00:50.700> light<00:00:50.910> will<00:00:51.059> start

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
to your pool this good light will start

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.299 
to your pool this good light will start
flashing<00:00:51.300> green<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.829> simply<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.250> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
flashing green and you simply have to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.770 
flashing green and you simply have to
drain<00:00:53.550> some<00:00:53.730> water<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.420> add<00:00:54.539> some<00:00:54.750> more

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
drain some water out and add some more

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.689 
drain some water out and add some more
water<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> kind<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.590> dilute<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.160> salt<00:00:56.489> never

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
water to kind of dilute it salt never

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
water to kind of dilute it salt never
evaporates<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.539> pool<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.350> have

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
evaporates in your pool so you just have

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
evaporates in your pool so you just have
actually<00:00:59.010> take<00:00:59.190> some<00:00:59.370> water<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.670> at<00:01:00.000> fresh

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
actually take some water out at fresh

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.260 
actually take some water out at fresh
water<00:01:00.600> get<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.590> light<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.760> blink<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.180> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
water get that light not to blink if it

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.310 
water get that light not to blink if it
is<00:01:03.359> blinking<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.899> means<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.229> not

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
is blinking that means it's not

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.170 
is blinking that means it's not
producing<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.760> cell<00:01:06.030> light<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.420> also

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
producing if the cell light is also

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.210 
producing if the cell light is also
flashing<00:01:09.180> green<00:01:09.560> right<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:10.979> black

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
flashing green right now just what black

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.480 
flashing green right now just what black
is<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.400> flashing<00:01:11.610> green<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:13.560> won't<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
is a flashing green it won't be just you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.190 
is a flashing green it won't be just you
know<00:01:14.760> will<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.119> producing<00:01:15.509> salt<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.049> is

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
know will not be producing salt this is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.020 
know will not be producing salt this is
flashing<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.340> very<00:01:17.490> important<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.790> clean

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
flashing it was very important to clean

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
flashing it was very important to clean
it<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.390> flashing<00:01:18.689> otherwise<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it when that's flashing otherwise it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
it when that's flashing otherwise it
will<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:20.070> producing<00:01:20.250> anything

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
will not be producing anything

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.720 
will not be producing anything
and<00:01:21.930> these<00:01:22.050> lights<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.740> good<00:01:22.920> indicators<00:01:23.310> but

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
and these lights are good indicators but

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.940 
and these lights are good indicators but
I<00:01:23.790> generally<00:01:24.120> clean<00:01:24.600> cell<00:01:24.990> cell<00:01:25.260> right<00:01:25.590> before

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I generally clean cell cell right before

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
I generally clean cell cell right before
I<00:01:25.980> add<00:01:26.160> salt<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.820> summertime<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.020> right

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
I add salt in the summertime and right

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.540 
I add salt in the summertime and right
now<00:01:28.260> it's<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.740> April<00:01:29.010> next<00:01:29.340> month

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
now it's going to be April next month

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.860 
now it's going to be April next month
that's<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.030> usually<00:01:30.180> clean<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
that's when I usually clean all the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.650 
that's when I usually clean all the
cells<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:32.190> then<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.370> add<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> salt<00:01:32.880> after<00:01:33.150> if

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
cells and then I add the salt after if

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.970 
cells and then I add the salt after if
it<00:01:33.780> needs<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.560> I'll<00:01:34.650> show<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.830> how<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
it needs it and I'll show you how to

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.370 
it needs it and I'll show you how to
check<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.280> salt<00:01:35.490> level<00:01:35.790> also<00:01:36.260> you're<00:01:37.260> going

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
check the salt level also you're going

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.320 
check the salt level also you're going
to<00:01:37.440> need<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> gallon<00:01:37.980> of<00:01:38.040> neurotic<00:01:38.670> acid<00:01:39.120> I

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
to need a gallon of neurotic acid I

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.030 
to need a gallon of neurotic acid I
never<00:01:39.870> put<00:01:40.050> it<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.230> directly<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.800> ground

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
never put it out directly on the ground

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.340 
never put it out directly on the ground
because<00:01:41.340> it'll<00:01:41.580> actually<00:01:41.760> stain<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.930> cement

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
because it'll actually stain the cement

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.260 
because it'll actually stain the cement
so<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.620> usually<00:01:43.770> put<00:01:44.010> it<00:01:44.190> somewhere<00:01:44.430> you're

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so I usually put it somewhere you're

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.710 
so I usually put it somewhere you're
going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> need<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:46.460> five<00:01:47.460> two<00:01:47.700> oh<00:01:47.730> six<00:01:48.030> seven

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
going to need this five two oh six seven

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.680 
going to need this five two oh six seven
zero<00:01:48.750> kit<00:01:49.650> for<00:01:50.040> cleaning<00:01:50.370> and<00:01:50.550> it's<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
zero kit for cleaning and it's so you

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.120 
zero kit for cleaning and it's so you
pick<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.050> up<00:01:52.110> your<00:01:52.260> pool<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.860> basically

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
pick it up your pool so it's basically

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.490 
pick it up your pool so it's basically
just<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.580> bottom<00:01:54.030> thing<00:01:54.960> when<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.229> set<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
just a bottom thing when you set the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.740 
just a bottom thing when you set the
cell<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.160> a<00:01:56.190> little<00:01:56.520> bow<00:01:56.790> ring<00:01:57.120> to<00:01:57.600> keep

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
cell in with a little bow ring to keep

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420 
cell in with a little bow ring to keep
the<00:01:57.870> water<00:01:58.080> in<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.890> you'll<00:01:59.010> set<00:01:59.190> it<00:01:59.220> on<00:01:59.370> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the water in and you'll set it on the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060 
the water in and you'll set it on the
ground<00:01:59.490> cell<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.810> into<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.890> don't

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
ground cell right here into it you don't

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.710 
ground cell right here into it you don't
want<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.310> immerse<00:02:02.550> this<00:02:02.850> particular<00:02:03.150> cell<00:02:03.600> in

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
want to immerse this particular cell in

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.850 
want to immerse this particular cell in
a<00:02:03.750> bucket<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.050> water<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.620> it's<00:02:04.740> all

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
a bucket of water because it's all

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.890 
a bucket of water because it's all
electronic<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.670> you'll<00:02:06.150> definitely<00:02:06.270> damage

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
electronic and you'll definitely damage

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.540 
electronic and you'll definitely damage
it<00:02:07.050> if<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.320> immerse<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.160> bucket<00:02:08.490> of

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
it if you immerse it in a bucket of

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.010 
it if you immerse it in a bucket of
water<00:02:08.760> to<00:02:08.970> clean<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.540> need<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.899> get

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
water to clean it you just need to get

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.560 
water to clean it you just need to get
that<00:02:10.280> adapter<00:02:11.280> at<00:02:11.370> your<00:02:11.490> pool<00:02:11.700> store<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.360> clean

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
that adapter at your pool store to clean

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.430 
that adapter at your pool store to clean
and<00:02:12.690> I'll<00:02:12.750> show<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.930> how<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.080> hook<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.320> up

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and I'll show you how to hook this up

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.530 
and I'll show you how to hook this up
right<00:02:13.620> now<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.880> first<00:02:15.030> thing<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.240> want<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.420> do

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
right now the first thing you want to do

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.020 
right now the first thing you want to do
is<00:02:15.660> turn<00:02:15.780> off<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.020> system<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.650> course<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
is turn off the system of course and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
is turn off the system of course and
I'll<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.330> right<00:02:18.630> now<00:02:18.840> okay<00:02:19.740> with<00:02:19.860> this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
I'll do that right now okay with this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.860 
I'll do that right now okay with this
particular<00:02:20.280> system<00:02:20.640> when<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> turn<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.330> off<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
particular system when I turn it off the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.500 
particular system when I turn it off the
actual<00:02:22.230> power<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.010> cell<00:02:23.250> goes<00:02:23.790> off<00:02:24.000> also

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
actual power to the cell goes off also

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.570 
actual power to the cell goes off also
you<00:02:25.080> may<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.440> pool<00:02:25.739> that's<00:02:26.010> not<00:02:26.220> connected

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
you may have a pool that's not connected

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.550 
you may have a pool that's not connected
this<00:02:26.880> way<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.959> when<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.140> turn<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.410> power

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
this way and so when you turn the power

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.930 
this way and so when you turn the power
off<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.070> pump<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.800> panel<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.489> may<00:02:32.700> not

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
off to the pump and the panel it may not

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.400 
off to the pump and the panel it may not
turn<00:02:33.300> these<00:02:33.450> lights<00:02:33.630> off<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:33.900> what<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.290> need

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
turn these lights off so what you need

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.350 
turn these lights off so what you need
to<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.680> actually<00:02:34.860> come<00:02:35.160> over<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.640> power

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
to do is actually come over to the power

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.070 
to do is actually come over to the power
unit<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.050> actually<00:02:37.470> unscrew<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:39.600> connector

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
unit and actually unscrew the connector

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.600 
unit and actually unscrew the connector
and<00:02:40.110> take<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.590> off<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:41.010> cannot<00:02:41.220> clean<00:02:41.430> this

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and take it off you cannot clean this

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.729 
and take it off you cannot clean this
cell<00:02:41.910> with<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.330> power<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.630> otherwise<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.680> will

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
cell with the power on otherwise it will

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.070 
cell with the power on otherwise it will
never<00:02:43.950> reset<00:02:44.340> itself<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.540> must<00:02:45.750> clean<00:02:45.930> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
never reset itself so you must clean the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.570 
never reset itself so you must clean the
cell<00:02:46.290> all<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.440> time<00:02:46.769> with<00:02:46.980> no<00:02:47.010> power<00:02:47.310> so

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
cell all the time with no power so

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.670 
cell all the time with no power so
simply<00:02:47.880> disconnect<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.870> make<00:02:49.560> sure

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
simply disconnect that and make sure

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.930 
simply disconnect that and make sure
there's<00:02:49.860> no<00:02:49.950> power<00:02:50.160> at<00:02:50.370> all<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.700> cell

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
there's no power at all to the cell

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.180 
there's no power at all to the cell
before<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.360> clean<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.739> then<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.010> just

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
before you clean it and then you just

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.009 
before you clean it and then you just
simply<00:02:53.340> unscrew<00:02:53.880> these<00:02:54.030> unions<00:02:54.570> here<00:02:54.900> and

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
simply unscrew these unions here and

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.900 
simply unscrew these unions here and
they<00:02:55.080> should<00:02:55.230> be<00:02:55.350> hand<00:02:55.560> tight<00:02:55.800> only<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.790> in

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
they should be hand tight only and in

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.400 
they should be hand tight only and in
the<00:02:57.000> cell<00:02:57.209> would<00:02:57.330> pop<00:02:57.660> right<00:02:57.840> off<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.170> one<00:02:58.320> in

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the cell would pop right off the one in

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.720 
the cell would pop right off the one in
the<00:02:58.470> front<00:02:58.680> one<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.070> back<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.459> there's<00:02:59.670> an

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
the front one in the back and there's an

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.160 
the front one in the back and there's an
o-ring<00:02:59.820> in<00:03:00.090> each<00:03:00.209> one<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.600> be<00:03:00.720> careful<00:03:01.080> when

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
o-ring in each one so be careful when

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.690 
o-ring in each one so be careful when
you<00:03:01.260> reinstall<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.220> o-ring<00:03:02.550> in

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
you reinstall it have the o-ring in

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.960 
you reinstall it have the o-ring in
there<00:03:03.500> okay<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.560> I'm<00:03:04.709> going<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.920> put<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.370> on

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
there okay so I'm going to put this on

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.640 
there okay so I'm going to put this on
the<00:03:06.150> bottom<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.720> I'm<00:03:07.019> going<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.200> screw<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.470> on

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
the bottom and I'm going to screw it on

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.979 
the bottom and I'm going to screw it on
right<00:03:07.890> now<00:03:08.060> okay<00:03:09.060> there's<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.510> sensor<00:03:09.959> that

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
right now okay there's a sensor that

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.660 
right now okay there's a sensor that
tells<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.530> when<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.800> all<00:03:11.010> cell<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.370> dirty

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
tells you when this all cell is dirty

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.030 
tells you when this all cell is dirty
and<00:03:12.000> gives<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.450> readings<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.739> usually

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
and gives you readings and I usually

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.620 
and gives you readings and I usually
leave<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.580> top<00:03:14.790> when<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.000> clean<00:03:15.239> as<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.480> can

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
leave it on top when I clean as you can

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.150 
leave it on top when I clean as you can
see<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:16.050> see<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> calcium<00:03:16.620> built<00:03:17.010> up

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
see you can see the calcium built up

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.580 
see you can see the calcium built up
inside<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.730> cell<00:03:18.000> there's<00:03:18.989> quite<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.170> bit<00:03:19.380> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
inside the cell there's quite a bit of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.340 
inside the cell there's quite a bit of
calcium<00:03:20.130> buildup<00:03:20.610> inside<00:03:20.970> those<00:03:21.350> plates

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
calcium buildup inside those plates

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.930 
calcium buildup inside those plates
right<00:03:22.620> there<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.220> I'll<00:03:23.310> show<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.489> how<00:03:23.610> much<00:03:23.700> as

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
right there so I'll show you how much as

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.890 
right there so I'll show you how much as
to<00:03:24.090> add

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
to add

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.850 
to add
can't<00:03:26.900> make<00:03:26.990> sure<00:03:27.170> that's<00:03:27.319> nice<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.800> tight

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
can't make sure that's nice and tight

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.500 
can't make sure that's nice and tight
that<00:03:28.370> when<00:03:28.490> the<00:03:28.610> water<00:03:28.790> will<00:03:28.970> leak<00:03:29.090> out<00:03:29.270> would

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
that when the water will leak out would

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.720 
that when the water will leak out would
acid<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.470> what<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.620> generally<00:03:30.800> do<00:03:31.190> there's<00:03:31.400> all

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
acid and what I generally do there's all

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.160 
acid and what I generally do there's all
kinds<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.000> guidelines<00:03:32.150> how<00:03:32.540> much<00:03:32.690> acid<00:03:33.050> that

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
kinds of guidelines how much acid that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.040 
kinds of guidelines how much acid that
add<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.920> like<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.550> add<00:03:34.670> water<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.240> it<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:35.750> an<00:03:35.900> add

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
add I like to add water to it in an add

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.420 
add I like to add water to it in an add
a<00:03:36.080> little<00:03:36.230> bit<00:03:36.350> acid<00:03:36.800> until<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.130> seen<00:03:37.310> it

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
a little bit acid until I seen it

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.309 
a little bit acid until I seen it
bubbling<00:03:37.819> that<00:03:38.150> way<00:03:38.270> I<00:03:38.480> don't<00:03:38.720> add<00:03:38.930> too<00:03:39.170> much

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
bubbling that way I don't add too much

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.530 
bubbling that way I don't add too much
acid<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:40.310> can<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:40.700> ruin<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:41.000> salt<00:03:41.300> cell

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
acid you can really ruin the salt cell

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.030 
acid you can really ruin the salt cell
by<00:03:41.750> putting<00:03:42.020> too<00:03:42.110> much<00:03:42.230> acid<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.709> there<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:42.980> I'm

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
by putting too much acid in there so I'm

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.400 
by putting too much acid in there so I'm
really<00:03:43.280> careful<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:44.360> add<00:03:44.510> more<00:03:44.750> water<00:03:44.990> and

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
really careful to add more water and

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.870 
really careful to add more water and
then<00:03:45.770> I'll<00:03:45.860> dump<00:03:46.040> some<00:03:46.220> water<00:03:46.250> out<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:46.790> add<00:03:46.850> a

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
then I'll dump some water out and add a

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.490 
then I'll dump some water out and add a
little<00:03:47.090> more<00:03:47.209> acid<00:03:47.390> until<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.840> see<00:03:48.050> bubbling

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
little more acid until I see bubbling

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.050 
little more acid until I see bubbling
and<00:03:49.040> I'll<00:03:49.130> show<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.370> how<00:03:49.459> that's<00:03:49.640> done<00:03:49.850> right

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
and I'll show you how that's done right

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.780 
and I'll show you how that's done right
now<00:03:50.709> okay<00:03:51.709> as<00:03:51.770> you<00:03:51.890> can<00:03:51.950> see<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.160> filled<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.610> up

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
now okay as you can see I filled it up

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.360 
now okay as you can see I filled it up
almost<00:03:53.270> always<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.750> top<00:03:53.989> with<00:03:54.170> water<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.980> I'm

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
almost always the top with water and I'm

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.800 
almost always the top with water and I'm
going<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.520> add<00:03:55.640> some<00:03:55.790> acid<00:03:56.209> in<00:03:56.300> there<00:03:56.450> teeth<00:03:56.690> of

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
going to add some acid in there teeth of

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.540 
going to add some acid in there teeth of
bubbles<00:03:57.760> okay<00:03:58.760> it's<00:03:59.180> bubbling<00:03:59.600> and<00:04:00.459> let<00:04:01.459> me

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
bubbles okay it's bubbling and let me

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.800 
bubbles okay it's bubbling and let me
see<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:01.820> mean<00:04:02.060> I'm<00:04:02.239> gonna<00:04:02.360> dump<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.540> little<00:04:02.600> bit

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
see I mean I'm gonna dump a little bit

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.930 
see I mean I'm gonna dump a little bit
out<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.170> add<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.290> little<00:04:03.410> bit<00:04:03.530> more<00:04:03.739> acid<00:04:03.940> to

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
out and add a little bit more acid to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.330 
out and add a little bit more acid to
get<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.180> going<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.480> little<00:04:05.570> more<00:04:05.980> if<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.070> acid

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
get it going a little more if the acid

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.790 
get it going a little more if the acid
is<00:04:07.430> very<00:04:07.640> strong<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.209> I<00:04:08.269> recommend<00:04:08.690> getting

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
is very strong and I recommend getting

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.729 
is very strong and I recommend getting
this<00:04:09.800> kind<00:04:10.040> of<00:04:10.130> acid<00:04:10.550> from<00:04:10.700> my<00:04:10.850> pool<00:04:11.090> store

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
this kind of acid from my pool store

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.100 
this kind of acid from my pool store
versus<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.950> one<00:04:13.070> at<00:04:13.220> Home<00:04:13.370> Depot<00:04:13.790> because

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
versus the one at Home Depot because

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.659 
versus the one at Home Depot because
that<00:04:15.110> doesn't<00:04:15.650> have<00:04:15.800> as<00:04:15.890> much<00:04:16.040> power<00:04:16.100> as<00:04:16.519> this

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
that doesn't have as much power as this

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.990 
that doesn't have as much power as this
acid<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.440> tends<00:04:18.890> not<00:04:19.160> at<00:04:19.489> work<00:04:19.579> as<00:04:19.790> well

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
acid and it tends not at work as well

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.789 
acid and it tends not at work as well
you<00:04:20.570> can<00:04:20.690> see<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.930> bubbling<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:21.470> that's<00:04:21.590> what

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
you can see it bubbling and that's what

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.210 
you can see it bubbling and that's what
you<00:04:21.919> want<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:23.000> don't<00:04:23.060> want<00:04:23.180> too<00:04:23.600> much<00:04:24.160> acid<00:04:25.160> in

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
you want you don't want too much acid in

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.290 
you want you don't want too much acid in
there<00:04:25.400> because<00:04:25.550> again<00:04:25.640> it<00:04:25.850> will<00:04:25.940> ruin<00:04:26.090> the

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
there because again it will ruin the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.610 
there because again it will ruin the
cell<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:26.690> wanted<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.080> bubble<00:04:27.320> like<00:04:27.440> that

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
cell you just wanted to bubble like that

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.680 
cell you just wanted to bubble like that
gently<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.940> will<00:04:29.060> clean<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.390> in<00:04:29.479> about

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
gently and that will clean it in about

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.090 
gently and that will clean it in about
10<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.290> 15<00:04:30.650> minutes

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
10 to 15 minutes

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.710 
10 to 15 minutes
we'll<00:04:31.729> come<00:04:31.880> back<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.270> see<00:04:32.419> how<00:04:32.540> it

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
we'll come back and see how it

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.920 
we'll come back and see how it
progresses<00:04:33.229> after<00:04:33.680> this<00:04:34.540> as<00:04:35.540> you<00:04:35.720> can<00:04:35.750> see

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
progresses after this as you can see

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.840 
progresses after this as you can see
after<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.200> few<00:04:36.290> minutes<00:04:36.710> no<00:04:37.070> but<00:04:37.370> five<00:04:37.580> minutes

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
after a few minutes no but five minutes

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.340 
after a few minutes no but five minutes
I've<00:04:37.970> gone<00:04:38.090> has<00:04:38.330> gone<00:04:38.479> by<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:38.750> it's<00:04:38.960> bubbling

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
I've gone has gone by and it's bubbling

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.530 
I've gone has gone by and it's bubbling
a<00:04:39.440> lot<00:04:39.590> less<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.250> it's<00:04:40.940> getting<00:04:41.180> all<00:04:41.300> that

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
a lot less and it's getting all that

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.630 
a lot less and it's getting all that
calcium<00:04:42.110> buildup<00:04:42.380> out<00:04:42.560> of<00:04:42.680> there<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.070> of

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
calcium buildup out of there and of

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.159 
calcium buildup out of there and of
course<00:04:44.030> it's<00:04:44.180> not<00:04:44.210> leaking<00:04:44.570> because<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.050> have

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
course it's not leaking because I have

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.420 
course it's not leaking because I have
that<00:04:45.320> unruly<00:04:45.890> tight<00:04:46.220> at<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.400> bottom

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
that unruly tight at the bottom

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.890 
that unruly tight at the bottom
sometimes<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:47.240> don't<00:04:47.390> put<00:04:47.479> it<00:04:47.570> on<00:04:47.630> right

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
sometimes you don't put it on right

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.180 
sometimes you don't put it on right
it'll<00:04:48.140> actually<00:04:48.470> drain<00:04:48.710> all<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.890> way<00:04:49.040> out

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
it'll actually drain all the way out

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.860 
it'll actually drain all the way out
you'll<00:04:49.400> know<00:04:49.550> that<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.760> have<00:04:49.790> to<00:04:49.970> reattach

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
you'll know that you have to reattach

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.830 
you'll know that you have to reattach
the<00:04:51.260> bottom<00:04:51.530> part<00:04:51.770> correctly<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:53.570> that's<00:04:53.720> the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
the bottom part correctly and that's the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.210 
the bottom part correctly and that's the
older<00:04:54.050> guy<00:04:54.169> talked<00:04:54.470> about<00:04:54.740> when<00:04:54.919> you<00:04:54.950> put<00:04:55.130> it

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
older guy talked about when you put it

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.680 
older guy talked about when you put it
back<00:04:55.310> together<00:04:55.460> sometimes<00:04:56.030> when<00:04:56.180> they<00:04:56.300> plumb

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
back together sometimes when they plumb

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.600 
back together sometimes when they plumb
these<00:04:56.900> they<00:04:57.050> put<00:04:57.229> it<00:04:57.320> really<00:04:57.410> tight<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.430> have

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
these they put it really tight you have

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.490 
these they put it really tight you have
no<00:04:58.760> leeway<00:04:59.000> but<00:04:59.540> this<00:04:59.660> actually<00:04:59.900> is<00:05:00.320> good

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
no leeway but this actually is good

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.600 
no leeway but this actually is good
because<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:00.740> can<00:05:00.860> actually<00:05:00.979> move<00:05:01.220> this<00:05:01.430> back

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
because I can actually move this back

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.700 
because I can actually move this back
pipe<00:05:01.910> back<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.330> forth<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:03.169> get<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.410> on<00:05:03.500> there

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
pipe back and forth to get it on there

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.740 
pipe back and forth to get it on there
good<00:05:03.910> so<00:05:04.910> you<00:05:05.000> might<00:05:05.150> have<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.450> actually

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
good so you might have to actually

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.210 
good so you might have to actually
squeeze<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.140> in<00:05:06.229> there<00:05:06.350> sometimes<00:05:06.800> thing<00:05:07.100> and

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
squeeze it in there sometimes thing and

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.980 
squeeze it in there sometimes thing and
how<00:05:07.310> they<00:05:07.430> plugged<00:05:07.700> it<00:05:07.820> in<00:05:07.940> and<00:05:08.120> that<00:05:08.690> over<00:05:08.930> it

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
how they plugged it in and that over it

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.510 
how they plugged it in and that over it
needs<00:05:09.169> to<00:05:09.229> be<00:05:09.350> on<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.470> little<00:05:10.100> leak<00:05:10.280> all<00:05:10.490> over

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
needs to be on a little leak all over

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.610 
needs to be on a little leak all over
the<00:05:10.789> place<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.750> if<00:05:11.840> this<00:05:11.960> thing<00:05:12.140> is<00:05:12.260> leaking

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
the place and if this thing is leaking

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.100 
the place and if this thing is leaking
it<00:05:12.740> will<00:05:12.860> not<00:05:13.010> produce<00:05:13.190> salt<00:05:13.520> either<00:05:14.110> check

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
it will not produce salt either check

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.480 
it will not produce salt either check
how<00:05:15.350> we<00:05:15.410> check<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.800> salt<00:05:15.979> level<00:05:16.250> you<00:05:16.340> can

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
how we check the salt level you can

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.279 
how we check the salt level you can
actually<00:05:16.520> get<00:05:16.940> these<00:05:17.120> aqua<00:05:17.570> check<00:05:17.840> install

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
actually get these aqua check install

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.860 
actually get these aqua check install
test<00:05:18.740> strips<00:05:19.039> these<00:05:19.250> are<00:05:19.370> pretty<00:05:19.520> accurate<00:05:19.870> if

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
test strips these are pretty accurate if

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.960 
test strips these are pretty accurate if
you<00:05:21.020> have<00:05:21.200> your<00:05:21.470> integral<00:05:22.400> hooked<00:05:22.610> up<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:22.940> your

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
you have your integral hooked up to your

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.779 
you have your integral hooked up to your
pen<00:05:23.360> tear<00:05:23.740> until<00:05:24.740> a<00:05:24.770> touch<00:05:25.039> system<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:25.729> the

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
pen tear until a touch system and the

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.940 
pen tear until a touch system and the
control<00:05:26.060> panel<00:05:26.300> they<00:05:26.419> should<00:05:26.660> have<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.710> salt

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
control panel they should have the salt

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.860 
control panel they should have the salt
reading<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.460> lot<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.210> people<00:05:29.390> don't<00:05:29.479> have<00:05:29.600> this

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
reading a lot of people don't have this

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.300 
reading a lot of people don't have this
and<00:05:30.080> you<00:05:30.110> have<00:05:30.229> to<00:05:30.289> kind<00:05:30.470> of<00:05:30.530> just<00:05:30.710> guess<00:05:30.950> salt

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
and you have to kind of just guess salt

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.339 
and you have to kind of just guess salt
level<00:05:31.640> but<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.270> can<00:05:32.450> actually<00:05:32.570> use<00:05:32.780> this<00:05:33.050> the

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
level but you can actually use this the

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.960 
level but you can actually use this the
way<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.530> do<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.800> also<00:05:34.039> is<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.310> like<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.580> taste<00:05:34.789> of

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
way I do it also is I like the taste of

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.740 
way I do it also is I like the taste of
water<00:05:35.180> and

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.360 

should<00:05:38.750> be<00:05:38.900> just<00:05:39.080> a<00:05:39.200> little<00:05:39.350> bit<00:05:39.590> less<00:05:40.070> salt

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
should be just a little bit less salt

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.790 
should be just a little bit less salt
saltier<00:05:40.910> than<00:05:40.970> sweat<00:05:41.420> and<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:42.320> can<00:05:42.470> taste<00:05:42.620> it

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
saltier than sweat and I can taste it

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.070 
saltier than sweat and I can taste it
it's<00:05:42.950> not<00:05:43.220> that<00:05:43.670> salty<00:05:43.970> that's<00:05:44.870> some<00:05:44.960> of<00:05:45.020> the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
it's not that salty that's some of the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.510 
it's not that salty that's some of the
way<00:05:45.200> you<00:05:45.260> can<00:05:45.350> test<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.830> waters<00:05:46.190> just<00:05:46.370> by

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
way you can test the waters just by

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.610 
way you can test the waters just by
actually<00:05:46.670> tasting<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:47.330> it's<00:05:47.510> not<00:05:48.380> going<00:05:48.560> to

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
actually tasting it it's not going to

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.460 
actually tasting it it's not going to
hurt<00:05:48.830> you<00:05:49.010> or<00:05:49.160> anything<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:50.290> so<00:05:51.290> those<00:05:51.440> are

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
hurt you or anything and so those are

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.510 
hurt you or anything and so those are
the<00:05:51.590> two<00:05:51.740> ways<00:05:51.860> you<00:05:51.980> can<00:05:52.100> test<00:05:52.280> it<00:05:52.370> with<00:05:52.490> the

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
the two ways you can test it with the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.920 
the two ways you can test it with the
test<00:05:52.760> strip<00:05:52.970> we're<00:05:53.090> just<00:05:53.240> actually<00:05:53.540> tasting

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
test strip we're just actually tasting

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.500 
test strip we're just actually tasting
the<00:05:54.020> water<00:05:54.730> now<00:05:55.730> if<00:05:55.790> there<00:05:55.910> was<00:05:56.000> too<00:05:56.120> much<00:05:56.240> salt

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
the water now if there was too much salt

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.670 
the water now if there was too much salt
in<00:05:56.660> there<00:05:56.780> you<00:05:56.900> would<00:05:57.020> really<00:05:57.230> taste<00:05:57.560> that

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
in there you would really taste that

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.410 
in there you would really taste that
salt<00:05:58.100> it<00:05:58.760> would<00:05:58.880> taste<00:05:59.060> like<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.360> ocean

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
salt it would taste like the ocean

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.660 
you an accurate reading and like I said
also<00:06:07.550> at<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.150> control<00:06:08.600> at<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:09.410> unit<00:06:10.340> itself

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
also at the control at the unit itself

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.760 
also at the control at the unit itself
if<00:06:10.970> you<00:06:11.060> have<00:06:11.150> too<00:06:11.270> much<00:06:11.390> salt<00:06:11.660> in<00:06:11.840> there<00:06:12.050> it'll

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
if you have too much salt in there it'll

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.250 
if you have too much salt in there it'll
flash<00:06:13.070> green<00:06:13.600> so<00:06:14.600> you'll<00:06:14.750> know<00:06:14.870> you<00:06:14.930> have<00:06:15.050> too

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260 
flash green so you'll know you have too
much<00:06:15.410> right<00:06:15.650> there<00:06:15.830> at<00:06:15.890> that<00:06:16.010> point<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:16.820> again

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
much right there at that point and again

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.370 
much right there at that point and again
you<00:06:17.390> don't<00:06:17.510> want<00:06:17.630> to<00:06:17.690> add<00:06:17.750> salt<00:06:18.050> until<00:06:18.230> you

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
you don't want to add salt until you

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.690 
you don't want to add salt until you
clean<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.680> salt<00:06:18.890> still<00:06:19.100> and<00:06:19.250> make<00:06:19.340> sure<00:06:19.550> you

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
clean the salt still and make sure you

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.610 
clean the salt still and make sure you
get<00:06:19.790> an<00:06:19.880> accurate<00:06:19.970> reading<00:06:20.420> they<00:06:21.290> dumped<00:06:21.560> all

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
get an accurate reading they dumped all

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.500 
get an accurate reading they dumped all
the<00:06:21.740> water<00:06:21.920> out<00:06:22.190> and<00:06:22.460> as<00:06:22.880> you<00:06:23.060> can<00:06:23.120> see<00:06:23.180> the

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
the water out and as you can see the

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.700 
the water out and as you can see the
salt<00:06:23.720> steadily<00:06:24.050> is<00:06:24.140> pretty<00:06:24.350> clean<00:06:24.560> there's

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
salt steadily is pretty clean there's

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.840 
salt steadily is pretty clean there's
still<00:06:24.890> a<00:06:24.920> little<00:06:25.070> bit<00:06:25.220> of<00:06:25.310> calcium<00:06:25.700> in<00:06:25.760> the

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
still a little bit of calcium in the

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.460 
still a little bit of calcium in the
very<00:06:26.030> middle<00:06:26.270> sometimes<00:06:27.110> you're<00:06:27.230> gonna<00:06:27.320> have

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
very middle sometimes you're gonna have

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.690 
very middle sometimes you're gonna have
to<00:06:27.560> split<00:06:27.710> it<00:06:27.860> together<00:06:28.100> with<00:06:28.310> a<00:06:28.340> little<00:06:28.550> bit

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
to split it together with a little bit

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.980 
to split it together with a little bit
in<00:06:28.790> there<00:06:28.970> but<00:06:29.150> long<00:06:29.270> as<00:06:29.360> you<00:06:29.420> get<00:06:29.570> the<00:06:29.690> bulk<00:06:29.840> of

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
in there but long as you get the bulk of

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.780 
in there but long as you get the bulk of
it<00:06:30.110> out<00:06:30.260> it's<00:06:30.530> going<00:06:30.710> to<00:06:30.770> work<00:06:31.460> really<00:06:31.640> well

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
it out it's going to work really well
