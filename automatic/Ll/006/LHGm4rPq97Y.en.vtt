00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.679

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.150
 that changing is our humble home yes 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.150
 exactly as well 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.220
 very happy on Fridays a little 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.840
 destroyed but look today on Mondays 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.550
 and the Friday that comes in I do not know what 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.439
 good that we have today we enter 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.000
 from home I want to start doing a review 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.710
 of everything we've talked about in these 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.320
 incredible months that we have been together 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.180
 make an exact year end like a 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.920
 very nice performance everything we have 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.170
 talked about then I want to talk a 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.790
 little of the house dramas of the 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.500
 beginners of all those people who are 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.899
 he just moved but he still has not 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.530
 much idea of what the thing is going and that 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:54.249
 some things are very basic 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.890
 then the first is not to keep cans 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:01:00.010
 spoons knives in the fridge because the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.079
 food is oxidized number one very 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.330
 important never obviously what they are 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.100
 seeing there in the cans 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.420
 Exactly everything then the cans do not have 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.860
 no problem but the typical one is 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.270
 europe is read that gets into the cake 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.300
 drama makes the knife and you go 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.380
 cutting there to give you a come quote 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.990
 there is nothing at all of spoons nor 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.790
 Knives the second is hot food 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.829
 refrigerator and refrigerator makes a 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.810
 shock when you get hot stuff 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.549
 because he has to work twice as much 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.899
 you imagine that the refrigerator its 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.119
 nature is cold you get something 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:40.110
 hot has to work 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:42.610
 in the engine and spoils the food to 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.860
 beginners not what we are seeing 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.560
 the bread the bread has to go in bags of 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.909
 plastic so it does not get hard there 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.060
 to store the bread in sachets 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.060
 hermetic 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.200
 there were those who had helped for example 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.509
 when they go down their see and buy you what 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.329
 put in these bags like brown 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.189
 Exactly that they make hard airs and bars so 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.329
 hard and if you put them in a bag of 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.819
 plastic 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.250
 that the guys that's why the boxed bread 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.720
 come plastic bags then there are 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.430
 to save it, you have to be careful that 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.709
 do not put on air because if you do not do it very 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.040
 very easy because it is well hermetic 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.170
 then a kitchen towel has to be 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.840
 unique in your area nothing else has to be 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.450
 this cloth there wash it very well with 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:31.950
 chlorine every day at the end of the day and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:34.590
 let it dry and the smell of wet puppy 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.299
 caught nasty from the kitchen suddenly 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.829
 clean the milk that fell but the 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:43.709
 soup but coffee and a balance of odors 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.180
 many the few after the sponge does not 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.340
 forget that the sponge has 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.190
 To disinfect, disinfect the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.349
 sponge in the microwave there comes in more 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.269
 of the hook antonio has many 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.830
 bacteria have bacteria bacteria 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.660
 potential for development 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.100
 salmonelosis then you have to have 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.570
 very careful and nobody the fabrics 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.680
 in the microwave how much time two 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.470
 minutes in the microwave in water in a 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.690
 deep dish with water two minutes nothing 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.700
 more because and they are already drying with a 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.360
 sponge for the dishes a sponge for 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.940
 the glasses ok but he managed to rotate before the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.520
 microwaves also inside they are not 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.170
 forget every two weeks you have to wash the 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.810
 microwave inside very well equal 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.030
 a few droplets of chlorine you have to let 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.190
 the entire surface is super clean 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.080
 so you do not keep odors so you do not 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.900
 it spoils we do not have to wash 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.580
 very well the rubs around then 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.270
 is sometimes heated in the microwave 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.740
 from the dining room here 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.970
 I do not have to go to disinfect the sucres 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:56.150
 that when some meatballs are exploited 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:59.450
 which is the most exploited in which 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.610
 the bananas if bananas do not have 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.070
 to join with any other guaje fruit 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.500
 that this novel is well the shell of 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.030
 banana oxidizes the rest of the fruit 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.640
 then if you leave the banana 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.590
 maturing with the rest of the fruit bowl now 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.490
 I understand that the fruits are lost 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.490
 Too much faster 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.990
 I'm not a lady, a girl 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.600
 the egg the egg the egg also the 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.700
 egg equal links with the egg to 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.550
 just like sponges have to be washed 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.860
 before before cooking them before 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.110
 put them in the fridge the shell is fine 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.300
 dangerous if you think about the 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.800
 story of where the egg comes from as 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.960
 where it has gone makes you sense that 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.030
 you have to wash it then I'm not going to 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.570
 give more details I will not do it 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.300
 guacara more or less pretty good the 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.150
 huevito roncero well washed please 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.940
 before and another thing that we also talk about 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.490
 at some point here is that a 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.470
 teaspoon in a cup of fabric softener 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.960
 water in an atomizer can save you from 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.790
 many troubles panties ironing something 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.500
 fast this is a solution that 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.600
 automatically iron your clothes 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.000
 cotton example the dress that I bring the 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.009
 that was very wrinkled very well that's why 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.169
 I always come very ironed 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.439
 a teaspoon of sun and a teaspoon 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.439
 of salt 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:27.180
 and finally super important for the 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.219
 recently moved never go to sleep 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.559
 without checking that all the knobs on the 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:34.169
 oven are well closed that there is a 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:35.759
 open window about gas and that does not 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.339
 there are candles lit there is absolutely no 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.889
 no trace of fire to avoid some 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:43.469
 accident while they sleep because everything 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.300
