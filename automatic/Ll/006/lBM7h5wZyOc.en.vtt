00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
look although actually once you look at

it<00:01:12.500> closely<00:01:12.799> it's<00:01:13.640> really<00:01:13.880> just<00:01:14.000> three

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
it closely it's really just three

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.980 
it closely it's really just three
different<00:01:15.439> colors<00:01:15.860> on<00:01:16.100> one<00:01:16.340> strand<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.420> I

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
different colors on one strand and I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.830 
different colors on one strand and I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.420 
like the frosted and and the shape I
just<00:01:20.869> thought<00:01:21.200> would<00:01:21.409> be<00:01:21.560> interesting<00:01:22.250> and

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
just thought would be interesting and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
actually I'm going to separate them into

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.130 
actually I'm going to separate them into
three<00:01:54.140> piles<00:01:54.380> because<00:01:55.869> when<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:56.990> first

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
three piles because when you first

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.599 
three piles because when you first
looked<00:01:57.409> at<00:01:57.560> when<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.770> first<00:01:58.039> looked<00:01:58.219> at<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.490> in

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
looked at when I first looked at it in

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.190 
looked at when I first looked at it in
the<00:01:58.640> store<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.179> thought<00:01:59.630> oh<00:01:59.810> I've<00:01:59.990> got

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
the store I thought oh I've got

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.440 
the store I thought oh I've got
gradations<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:01.399> once<00:02:01.789> I've<00:02:02.000> looked<00:02:02.179> at<00:02:02.329> it

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
gradations but once I've looked at it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.359 
gradations but once I've looked at it
more<00:02:02.570> closely<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.200> realized<00:02:03.649> it's<00:02:03.920> just<00:02:04.159> three

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
more closely I realized it's just three

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.419 
more closely I realized it's just three
different<00:02:04.490> colors<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:06.950> notice<00:02:07.249> they

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
different colors and you notice they

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.310 
different colors and you notice they
string<00:02:07.820> them<00:02:07.999> with<00:02:08.179> these<00:02:08.360> little<00:02:08.539> seed<00:02:08.960> beads

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
string them with these little seed beads

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.940 
string them with these little seed beads
which<00:02:09.800> kind<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.810> fills<00:02:11.810> out<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.230> Strand<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.770> bit

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
which kind of fills out the Strand a bit

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.510 
which kind of fills out the Strand a bit
more<00:02:14.050> but<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.080> can<00:02:15.290> save<00:02:15.590> those<00:02:15.830> seed<00:02:16.220> beads

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
more but you can save those seed beads

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.030 
more but you can save those seed beads
and<00:02:16.819> use<00:02:17.060> them<00:02:17.360> for<00:02:17.390> another<00:02:18.110> project<00:02:18.470> they're

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
and use them for another project they're

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.220 
and use them for another project they're
good<00:02:19.250> fillers

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.170 

so<00:02:24.230> here<00:02:24.440> we<00:02:24.560> have<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:26.540> beads<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.790> actually

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
so here we have the beads and actually

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.480 
so here we have the beads and actually
I'm<00:02:29.300> just<00:02:29.330> going<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.750> start<00:02:29.990> playing<00:02:30.490> I'm

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
I'm just going to start playing I'm

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:39.220 
I'm just going to start playing I'm
going<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.000> try<00:02:33.040> doing<00:02:34.040> two<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.460> each<00:02:34.760> color<00:02:38.230> and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
going to try doing two of each color and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
going to try doing two of each color and
what's<00:02:40.070> nice<00:02:40.280> about<00:02:40.340> these<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.180> other

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
what's nice about these and other

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.360 
what's nice about these and other
similarly<00:02:43.250> similar<00:02:44.150> shaped<00:02:44.630> beads<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:46.130> that

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
similarly similar shaped beads is that

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.590 
similarly similar shaped beads is that
they<00:02:46.520> kind<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.790> snap<00:02:47.150> together<00:02:48.910> as<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:50.240> thread

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
they kind of snap together as you thread

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.990 
they kind of snap together as you thread
them<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:52.210> see<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.400> kind<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.640> push<00:02:55.820> them

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
them on see you can kind of push them

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.300 
them on see you can kind of push them
down<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.480> then<00:02:56.600> they<00:02:56.630> make<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.310> interesting

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
down and then they make that interesting

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.120 
down and then they make that interesting
shape<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.870> that's<00:03:02.990> one<00:03:03.290> way<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.710> it<00:03:03.860> could<00:03:04.010> be

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
shape so that's one way that it could be

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.250 
shape so that's one way that it could be
done<00:03:04.340> I'm<00:03:05.120> not<00:03:05.300> sure<00:03:05.480> if<00:03:05.570> I'm<00:03:05.690> thrilled<00:03:06.050> with

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
done I'm not sure if I'm thrilled with

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.790 
done I'm not sure if I'm thrilled with
that<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:08.000> let's<00:03:08.030> try<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.990> different<00:03:09.380> way

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
that so let's try it a different way

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.780 
that so let's try it a different way
let's<00:03:10.070> try<00:03:10.520> one<00:03:13.180> do<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:14.390> one<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:16.550> there's

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
let's try one do this one and there's

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.540 
let's try one do this one and there's
more<00:03:17.030> yellow<00:03:17.390> green<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:19.240> the<00:03:20.240> blue<00:03:20.450> green

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
more yellow green and the blue green

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:30.740 
more yellow green and the blue green
back<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.910> turquoise

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.500 

now<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.320> can<00:03:31.560> kind<00:03:31.710> of<00:03:31.740> like<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:32.010> better<00:03:32.580> so

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
now I can kind of like that better so

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.700 
now I can kind of like that better so
one<00:03:33.630> thing<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.900> can<00:03:34.050> do<00:03:34.230> when<00:03:34.440> you're<00:03:34.590> making

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
one thing you can do when you're making

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.270 
one thing you can do when you're making
jewelry<00:03:35.340> don't<00:03:35.490> be<00:03:35.670> afraid<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.300> experiment

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
jewelry don't be afraid to experiment

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.190 
jewelry don't be afraid to experiment
often<00:03:38.280> it's<00:03:38.490> just<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.910> materials<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:39.900> are

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
often it's just the materials that are

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.430 
often it's just the materials that are
inspiring<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.190> as<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.550> put<00:03:41.760> them<00:03:41.940> together

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
inspiring and as you put them together

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.020 
inspiring and as you put them together
you'll<00:03:43.440> see<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.860> ways<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.670> like<00:03:44.850> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
you'll see the ways that you like the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.500 
you'll see the ways that you like the
best

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
best

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.350 
best
I<00:03:45.540> think<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.900> like<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.110> better<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.970> that's<00:03:47.970> it

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
I think I like that better and that's it

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.930 
I think I like that better and that's it
that's<00:03:49.020> all<00:03:49.230> there<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.250> I'm<00:03:50.460> just<00:03:50.520> going

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's all there is to it I'm just going

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.390 
that's all there is to it I'm just going
to<00:03:51.000> make<00:03:51.240> sure<00:03:51.270> that<00:03:51.690> they're<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:53.100> narrow

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
to make sure that they're the narrow

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.460 
to make sure that they're the narrow
ends<00:03:53.850> are<00:03:53.970> all<00:03:54.090> together<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:54.900> they<00:03:55.020> make<00:03:55.230> that

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
ends are all together so they make that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.390 
ends are all together so they make that
pattern<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:57.680> then<00:03:58.680> I'm<00:03:58.860> going<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.190> make<00:03:59.370> a

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
pattern and then I'm going to make a

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.570 
pattern and then I'm going to make a
loop<00:03:59.640> by<00:04:00.180> grabbing<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.990> with<00:04:01.020> my<00:04:01.530> round<00:04:01.950> chain

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
loop by grabbing it with my round chain

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.630 
loop by grabbing it with my round chain
nose<00:04:02.820> pliers<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:07.170> bend<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.590> at<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.800> 90<00:04:07.950> degree

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
nose pliers and bend it at a 90 degree

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.630 
nose pliers and bend it at a 90 degree
angle<00:04:12.200> grab<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.380> with<00:04:13.530> my<00:04:13.560> round<00:04:13.890> nose<00:04:14.100> pliers

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
angle grab it with my round nose pliers

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.670 
angle grab it with my round nose pliers
right<00:04:15.150> at<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.420> bend<00:04:15.650> hold<00:04:16.650> nice<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.100> tight

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
right at the bend hold nice and tight

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.320 
right at the bend hold nice and tight
wrap<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.950> around<00:04:19.980> as<00:04:20.580> far<00:04:20.760> as<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:21.150> will<00:04:21.269> go

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
wrap that around as far as it will go

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.170 
wrap that around as far as it will go
and<00:04:24.920> then<00:04:25.920> reposition<00:04:26.670> your<00:04:26.850> round<00:04:26.910> nose

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
pliers and finish your loop use your

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:42.280

wire<00:04:32.970> cutters<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.510> cut<00:04:33.780> off<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.910> excess

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.290 

and<00:04:43.290> then<00:04:43.770> use<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.160> flat<00:04:44.430> part<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.970> your<00:04:45.060> round

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
nose pliers to make that loop nice the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.689 
nose pliers to make that loop nice the
final<00:04:50.460> step<00:04:50.820> is<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.530> open<00:04:52.530> up<00:04:53.360> your<00:04:54.360> ear<00:04:54.630> wire

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
final step is to open up your ear wire

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:02.320 
final step is to open up your ear wire
with<00:04:56.699> chain<00:04:56.940> nose<00:04:56.970> pliers<00:04:58.280> pop<00:04:59.280> on<00:04:59.520> your<00:04:59.760> loop
