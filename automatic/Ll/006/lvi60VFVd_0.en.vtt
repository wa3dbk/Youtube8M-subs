00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.880
 Welcome to my channel this time 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.180
 we will do the unboxing to the playstation 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.180
 vita 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.880
 looking at the box we see that it is 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.879
 of a special drum because it includes two 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.579
 games and a memory of 4 gb games 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.920
 they are uncharted golden abyss and playstation 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.870
 all starz battle royale 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.519
 now if we proceed to open the box 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.260
 removing the warranty seals are 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.379
 normally the first box is 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.030
 promotional ie we took a look 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.190
 what this point brings 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.379
 because surely we will find another 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.629
 box with the console and it's vital how 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.649
 we see below and it also brings the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.649
 games already mentioned 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.089
 this package seems pretty 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.970
 outstanding since it includes two games 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.040
 exclusive of playstation one of them is 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.930
 uncharted a game that we met in 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.610
 playstation3 and that is synonymous with 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.800
 excellent graphics amazing 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.380
 gameplay and good story the other one is 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.060
 playstation all starz a concept more or 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.400
 less similar to the one we saw in super 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.900
 smash bros mini but that collects all 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.900
 the stars of sony entertaiment 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.360
 now if we proceed to open the box in 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.060
 where is our system 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.280
 playstation vita but before we 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.440
 we found a welcome message in 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.920
 two different languages Spanish and 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.020
 Portuguese 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.939
 we find a slot in which 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.400
 all the basic accessories of the 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.130
 playstation vita like this adapter 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.799
 current with the logo of are and here 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.460
 we see the two entrances to here 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.460
 current cable 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.570
 next we see the data cable 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.880
 this data cable is very important already 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.970
 that with him we can connect the foot 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.790
 psvita to the computer or playstation 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.650
 3 in the case of playstation 3 happens 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.230
 something very important because with this 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.030
 cable we can synchronize all our 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.320
 multimedia content ie the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.320
 music and free images 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.100
 Finally we find a guide 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.020
 Quick start type brochure and it's for 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.370
 that you give color of all the functions 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.370
 that has your new portable console 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.550
 and the last element that we find in 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.950
 the box is a safety guide in it 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.630
 gives us advice that we should not do 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.630
 with our vital playstation 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.959
 and now if you want we found the console 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.610
 What really interests us 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.349
 we see that it follows the same line as its 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.480
 predecessor the pcpe with the pair of 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.330
 directions a left trigger and a 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.150
 right trigger the select and start button 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.280
 the classic square triangle buttons 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.010
 X and circle on top 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.920
 we found the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.890
 button the close the button to learn 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.230
 the console and the upload buttons and 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.930
 lower the volume we also find a 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.569
 slot for the game cards that are in 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.700
 where the game cards will go in the 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.610
 back we found a panel 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.650
 capacitive type multitact and a camera 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.420
 this playstation vita has two 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.420
 cameras one front and one back 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.690
 when turning on the console we realize 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.930
 of the quality that your screen offers us 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.970
