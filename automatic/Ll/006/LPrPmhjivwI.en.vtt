price less chemically free so it's a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
chicken that's not free-range I don't

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.799 
chicken that's not free-range I don't
like<00:01:01.140> because<00:01:01.350> I'm<00:01:01.590> taste<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> flavors

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
and the great thing we have free range

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.469 
and the great thing we have free range
is<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> spend<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.210> lot<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.360> their

is that because I spend a lot of their

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.330 
is that because I spend a lot of their
time<00:01:06.600> outdoors<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.619> basically<00:01:07.950> makes<00:01:08.189> them

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
time outdoors it basically makes them

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.710 
time outdoors it basically makes them
taste<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.850> holler<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.270> makes<00:01:09.420> me<00:01:09.510> look<00:01:09.600> more

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720

all we do is just run it down the breast

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.870 
all we do is just run it down the breast
okay<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.500> there's<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> bone<00:01:50.130> right<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.640> the

comes<00:01:55.439> down<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> wishbone<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.640> all

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
comes down to the wishbone that we all

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.789 
comes down to the wishbone that we all
know<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.299> love

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
yep just like the knife to the work

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.240 
yep just like the knife to the work
it'll<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.270> run<00:02:00.509> down<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.860> follow<00:02:02.070> down

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it'll just run down and just follow down

it'll just run down and just follow down
next<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> wishbone<00:02:03.000> let<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> meat<00:02:03.869> folic

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
next to the wishbone let the meat folic

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.050 
next to the wishbone let the meat folic
gravity<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.740> its<00:02:04.770> thing<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.790> you're<00:02:05.939> just

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.730 
we're just removing the cage and it's
the<00:02:38.970> important<00:02:39.360> bit<00:02:39.540> because<00:02:40.050> what<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:40.350> don't

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
the important bit because what we don't

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.710 
the important bit because what we don't
want<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.040> do<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.580> pierce<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.270> skin<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.660> want

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
want to do is pierce the skin you want

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.410

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
to keep that skin intact so it keeps the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.400 
to keep that skin intact so it keeps the
whole<00:02:45.600> chicken<00:02:45.900> intact<00:02:46.170> when<00:02:46.290> you're

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
whole chicken intact when you're

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.350 
whole chicken intact when you're
roasting<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.670> all<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.030> want<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.209> do<00:02:48.270> is

roasting it so all you want to do is
lift<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.600> up<00:02:48.720> again<00:02:48.870> let<00:02:49.170> go<00:02:49.320> let<00:02:49.530> gravity<00:02:49.739> do

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
lift it up again let go let gravity do

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.070 
lift it up again let go let gravity do
its<00:02:50.040> thing<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.970> all<00:02:51.120> sort<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.360> fall<00:02:51.570> away<00:02:51.690> so

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
its thing that all sort of fall away so

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.780 
its thing that all sort of fall away so
you're<00:02:52.200> trying<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.530> get<00:02:52.590> between<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.459> the
