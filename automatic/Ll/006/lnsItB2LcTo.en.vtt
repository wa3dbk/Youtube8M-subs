sets<00:01:18.579> so<00:01:19.270> literally<00:01:19.659> you're<00:01:20.140> just<00:01:20.320> ripping

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
sets so literally you're just ripping

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.560 
sets so literally you're just ripping
them<00:01:20.770> right<00:01:20.920> out<00:01:21.100> of<00:01:21.130> there<00:01:21.399> putting<00:01:22.329> it<00:01:22.420> in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
them right out of there putting it in

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.649 
them right out of there putting it in
shaping<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.649> then<00:01:24.430> dispensing<00:01:25.119> back<00:01:25.329> into

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
shaping and then dispensing back into

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.929 
shaping and then dispensing back into
the<00:01:25.780> very<00:01:25.990> side<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:27.130> they'll<00:01:27.250> be<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.399> constant

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
the very side and they'll be a constant

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.510 
the very side and they'll be a constant
so<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.380> grates<00:01:29.649> actually<00:01:30.780> setup<00:01:32.130> slots<00:01:33.130> to

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
so the grates actually setup slots to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.810 
so the grates actually setup slots to
put<00:01:33.549> your<00:01:33.789> hands<00:01:34.240> in<00:01:34.420> each<00:01:34.450> one<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.640> hole

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
put your hands in each one it's a hole

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.899 
put your hands in each one it's a hole
that's<00:01:36.969> gonna<00:01:37.179> go<00:01:37.359> down<00:01:37.570> into<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.049> stations

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that's gonna go down into the stations

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.830 
that's gonna go down into the stations
so<00:01:39.909> when<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.329> come<00:01:40.539> down<00:01:40.570> here

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.330 

you'll<00:01:46.840> be<00:01:47.049> able<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.350> feed<00:01:47.649> something<00:01:48.009> down

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
you'll be able to feed something down

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
from Poly science and circulate a an

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.359 
from Poly science and circulate a an
aquarium<00:01:54.369> bath<00:01:54.609> of<00:01:54.819> ice<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:55.479> one<00:01:55.719> is<00:01:56.710> bottles

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
aquarium bath of ice this one is bottles

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.240 
aquarium bath of ice this one is bottles
right<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.969> bottles<00:01:58.270> are<00:01:58.359> gonna<00:01:58.479> stick<00:01:58.750> out
