for<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> few<00:02:25.860> minutes<00:02:26.160> then<00:02:27.060> switching<00:02:27.570> to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
for a few minutes then switching to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.260 
for a few minutes then switching to
easier<00:02:28.140> exercises<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.980> recover<00:02:29.340> then

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
easier exercises to recover then

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.510 
easier exercises to recover then
switching<00:02:30.780> back<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> higher<00:02:31.560> intensity<00:02:32.130> and

switching back to a higher intensity and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.540 
switching back to a higher intensity and
