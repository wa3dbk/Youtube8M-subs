00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.360
 Eat your own vegetables 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.700
 ...cheap, healthy, you will feel happy 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.830
 Writer Toor de Haas wrote a book called "Simple Happiness" on this subject. 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.580
 This is New Zealand spinach... 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.370
 Can only eat its leaves 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.450
 Very delicious this is cucumber spice... 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.430
 Blue flower borage tastes like cucumber 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.900
 All dishes with broccoli can add sea kale 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.970
 Sage, if you go to the store to buy it, you have to spend a lot of money... 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.990
 My garden is full of sage, very delicious! 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.870
 You can even enjoy those weeds 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.980
 The leaves of dandelion are very healthy, especially in the spring, but they can still be eaten now. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.150
 "Weeds" sounds like a very strange word. 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.520
 I still call them "spices" 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.500
 Because they contain a lot of good ingredients 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.170
 ...and itâ€™s free 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.960
 Toor said that everyone can eat their own vegetables and fruits... 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.450
 ...life consciously and cheaply... 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.550
 ...whether you have a big garden or a small balcony 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.260
 There are many kinds of vegetables that can be climbed... 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.050
 ...almost all the beans are like this... 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.940
 ...they only need very little space. 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.840
 There are also many fruit varieties that can grow along the wall. 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.260
 Her own dinner tonight is a pasta with basil and pumpkin seeds. 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.940
 ...sweet is green yogurt plus multi-gland raspberry 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.290
 Except for pasta and yogurt, all other materials come from homes. 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.730
 So very cheap 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.230
 very delicious. With tomato salad... 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.840
 ...you can have a very healthy dinner. 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.360
 Her book is full of healthy recipes that cost no more than 50 euro cents. 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.340
 But this book is not written for the poor only. 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.790
 It is far more than just a recipe... 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.840
 .. it is about how you get along with the world, how to treat yourself... 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.590
 ...how to take care of yourself... 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.590
 ...and of course you need to add the vitamins you need 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.970
 So it also involves culture, religion and nature 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.770
 I think those who work long hours... 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.410
 ...may have a lot of money, l they have been doing this 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.160
 They sometimes never content 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.380
 Taking some time to peel and peel the beans will make you feel calm and 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.210
 ... will also let you slow down the rhythm 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.890
 In the evening, the pesto with pasta is ready. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.490
 I want to add spaghetti, which still costs 50 euro cents. 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.100
 Writer Toor de Haas lives very consciously 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.990
 ...it's no wonder she chose "simple happiness" as its title 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.310
 This means you can live a high quality life with very little money. 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.600
 You will enjoy it 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.130
 Very enjoyable, this is an incalculable wealth. 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.880
 At least if you are not rich 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.350
 I think this is even more important. 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.190
 If you can enjoy one thing, what else do you need? 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.440
 That's it.
