00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.000
So today’s a snow day.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.160
Well, a lot of it’s melted now, but from
yesterday evening until this morning, pretty

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.240
good snow day.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.200
And then this weekend, we’re gonna have
more snow and ice.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.840
I don’t like winter.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.440
I don’t like the cold weather.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.560
I like looking at snow and I think it’s
really, really pretty, but I don’t like

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.060
being involved in it.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.840
The guy I’m currently dating and I, we have
this little thing while we’re watching Gilmore

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.340
Girls. I’m Lorelai, he’s Luke, and if
you watch Gilmore Girls, you know that Lorelai

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920
really loves the snow.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.880
Lorelai and I are very similar. We have the
same kind of personality, the same kind of

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.250
wit.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.480
The same coffee addiction, but if there’s
one thing the two of us don’t agree on,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.410
it’s snow. I just. Again. It’s pretty,
but I hate being involved in it and I don’t

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.450
get so excited when I see it and go out in
it.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.860
In fact, I went to check the mail today and
slipped a few times.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.140
All for nothing in my mailbox, by the way.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.280
Except bills, but nobody likes bills.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.200
I don’t like the wind.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.740
I like a little breeze, but I don’t like
the full … wind.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.240
Very fast and angry wind.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.900
I don’t like wearing a lot of clothes.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.900
I like the look of sweaters, but I don’t
like wearing them.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.460
If you’ve been following me since my mostly
makeup vlogging days, I have very dry skin

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.190
and the winter does not help that.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.680
My nose and around my nose, it gets very,
very dry. My mouth gets very dry, so right

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.439
now, I am wearing a shit ton of Jack Black
lip balm and even that’s not really helping.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.320
When I do makeup videos, people always compliment
on the glow on my skin and what have you.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.920
It’s the sun and the window. The light that
comes through while I do these videos.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.180
I just really love Spring. I like Summer.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.420
I don’t like it when it’s so hot, but
I just - I love tank tops, okay. Tank tops

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.069
are my favourite article of clothing to wear.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.189
They’re very light. Blah, blah, blah. I
don’t like sleeves.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.060
I like iced coffee and I will drink iced coffee
during the winter, but it’s so much better

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.869
when it’s warm.

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:25.169
I love the sun. And the sun always feels so
much better when it’s warmer.

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:31.820
I am a complete weather nerd so spring time
means the first tornado season and active

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.659
weather season even though I don’t like
actually being involved with that kind of

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:43.299
weather, if it happens somewhere and it’s
not causing a whole lot of crap, I love reading

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.819
about it. I like tracking it.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.340
I’m waiting for March 20th to come by.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.200
That doesn’t really mean a whole lot since
it could still get cold in March, but…

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.620
I don’t like winter.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.480
I don’t like the cold. And I just thought
I would take this snow day to complain about

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.060
it.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.480
But I know I’m not alone, so please, those
of you who love Spring and Summer just as

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.869
much as I do, please, whine with me.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.300
Plus, my birthday is in July, so, come on,
Summer. Come on.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.620
So if you’re at the end of this video, comment
down below and tell me what your favourite

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.780
season is.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.140
If it’s winter for you and you don’t mind
the cold, I need your superpowers.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.680
I just. I can’t handle it.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.200
The winter just makes me so much more depressed.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.920
Okay. Until next time. Bye.
