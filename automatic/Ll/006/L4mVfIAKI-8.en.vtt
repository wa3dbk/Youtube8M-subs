00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.459
 foppa salute we talk about wisdom teeth 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:06.689
 and we do it with i 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.899
 Dr. Antonio dentist guide 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:11.040
 German rt 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.030
 let's say because they are called that 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.869
 here you can also call the wisdom teeth of the suspect 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.919
 so the last molars are the third molars 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.210
 elected herman derivative of excellence wisdom Latin inscription 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.340
 because it was those teeth that usually popped up 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.449
 eh between the ages of 16 and 24 for years about the age of rachel berry judgment that he 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.460
 cancer but if you believe dl 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.350
 In the place of never losing hope I put this here 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.230
 in nature there are reasons for which there are reasons why 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.570
 prehistoric napoca 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 we had very large mouths that were used to chew complicated cds 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.230
 not cooked very hard 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.300
 then what happened that during the evolution 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.750
 eh we started cooking foods to eat softer foods more 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.650
 refined and we have had less and less need to develop the mandible 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.580
 what happened so that over the years the teeth always remained 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.840
 hence the bones shrunk in these teeth today 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.270
 rarely find room for and break up and clinic 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.110
 lenny create problems because in fact it becomes no problems when 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.650
 it's long their eruption finds nonostant property 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.170
 if the wisdom tooth finds its post rompen arcade and maybe does not bite 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.720
 a little bigger finds its correct position 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 there are 3 modaris to the upper chewing 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.990
 it is certainly a nice thing to have them absolutely no nada espero bien 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.370
 something absolutely 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.800
 and while something different when you re 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.260
 it is identical and they become the first studies as they say in jelly this month 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.170
 and pathologies with 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.810
 we laugh local picontite paradontite so we say a gingivitis a nuisance 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.750
 continues in the area that from continence mazzoni that require therapy 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.780
 inflammatory 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.350
 prism then when 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.110
 the symptomatology a little stronger you can have the blockage of the opening 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.020
 of the mouth 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.340
 then you can have a 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.700
 a swelling and you can have it 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.899
 emp also a potential movement of the teeth due to this sixth thrust 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.780
 is towards the adjacent teeth or this case we see is a decay from 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.329
 Alberese compression a wisdom tooth that 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.260
 exerting its pressure on the walls of the second decent molar 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:20.430
 complimentoni resulted in reabsorption of the root then in 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.639
 that extraction state I buy and I am just wisdom tooth 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.159
 but also the tooth the center will be Italy 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.560
 we speak in this case because it is said 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.420
 it is better to remove it sert so many times they are fine PV plants celebrates the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.959
 more often than not text then why is it advised then is recommended to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.870
 extract it when chronic inflammations occur in practice when 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.260
 you never succeed 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.649
 to eradicate this inflammation 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.089
 the term 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:50.229
 when and we have already talked about possible damage to adjacent teeth or 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:54.809
 when in any case we say roughly the infectious phenomena or those which are i 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.659
 nuisances tooth-derived pains go beyond 2 3 episodes damage to cogni 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:59.459
 pisodio 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.459
 generally requires antibiotic therapy for resolution 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.579
 for which also from a general medical point of view it is good not to abuse 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.920
 antibiotics or when there is need to recover space for endodontic reasons 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.359
 yours 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.809
 you can get to you too 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.959
 sometimes not born nothing sometimes not born for new father is not formed 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:17.720
 done 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.419
 ethics yes 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.549
 is an already done falcon apple surgery is thinking about annozero 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.089
 you are afraid that he would not throw judgment as he takes off if you want him to 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.969
 also makes fun of people in this campaign 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.530
 android is called scario 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.369
 tooth hello everyone is not going from the desert 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:39.299
 and willingly pine forest - only painful remedy I changed the techniques 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.679
 also called extraction first of all vi 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.320
 let's say there are some principles that must be followed 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.000
 therefore an accurate locoregional anesthesia then an adequate one 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.070
 local anesthesia that not only intends to numb the tissues web 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.270
 surrounding conor malmente is done but you are canasta fan nestesia called tronculare 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.859
 practically anesthesia is done 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.550
 va padtab torment the whole nervous trunk then 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.620
 all the branches that can injure this tooth are blocked so that 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.209
 we are sure that the intervention is painless 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.060
 another branch I need 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.230
 deejay another principle that of you and in earth is essentially these 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.440
 teeth often have rather complicated roots it's finished is like 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.800
 a tree with many roots that sinks into the ground 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.190
 to simplify intervention, making it much less invasive, it is enough for me to separate the 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.000
 its roots in single components as well 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.010
 it is essentially the difference between eradicating an oak tree with all its 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.800
 digitazioni or a simple carrot with its single renders in this way 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.810
 it simplifies the problem and becomes extremely less invasive free then 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.759
 let's say 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.809
 nutria made us a real example today as it happens where extractions 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.689
 it's painful then 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.650
 the post effect forrester the trend sometimes 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.660
 yesterday there is always here antibiotic work in practice this 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.030
 grafin pain here then the pain we manage to fight it absolutely 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.660
 well 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.560
 and we take the principles for anesthesia already we have talked about 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.200
 however, the one that has antibiotic prophylaxis is also important 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.370
 do not use antibiotic to treat an infection 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.169
 but use the antibiotic to prevent possible infections for which eh 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:24.009
 an association of drug therapy and above all is reduced invasiveness 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.690
 surgical artiste meaning 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.870
 hahaha sometimes not a tiny incision appears rather do a little 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.819
 an extremely precise engraving 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:38.300
 but more extensive that allows us to reposition the gingival tissues 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.960
 exactly where they were and after the intervention and we can over rights 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.090
 obviously extractions 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.439
 the thesis program therefore here 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:50.110
 but then even if you are 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.830
 to indicate the whole process to do the others but 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.930
 help to avoid cruises offers brands with the classic moment when you 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.449
 presents the patient doggy style 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.580
 for swelling and pain there is in those cases we must always solve one 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.860
 antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.830
 t the level of precision we manage to keep surgery in 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.100
 absence of symptoms in the absence of infection and inflammation 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.940
 extremely better than when urgent action is taken of which 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.480
 it is usually always preferable 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.820
 wait for the asymptomatic phase of the shell 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.930
 mediaworld in the appropriate iveco 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.150
 after all we have said what we can give with you advise me cysts 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.960
 if you feel problems or those are i'm fine sol city car checks i don't know 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.319
 talk let's say that 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.500
 air an x-ray 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.980
 overview of control and fun room is definitely recommended 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.790
 of the and in that case we can also bring possible relative damages 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.490
 teeth 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.860
 adjacent another thing and how we talked about risk-benefit ratio 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.199
 of the extraction because we know that next to the tooth 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:59.270
 there are sensitive anatomical structures are nerds in vessels 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.610
 that never make an extraction impossible because it is always possible 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.349
 with good knowledge 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:09.359
 anatomical radiological investigations, however, the important weighing 

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:12.770
 killer risk the annoyance of surgery 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.789
 compared to the possible 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:16.860
 and benefits order tooth extraction 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.819
 so we talked about the wisdom teeth we did with the doctor 

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:23.389
