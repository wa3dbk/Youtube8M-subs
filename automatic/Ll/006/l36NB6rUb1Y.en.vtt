 So easy to drag on the desktop 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.550
 he would have finished eating 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.970
 become 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.970
 this is really effective 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.420
 all interested states the ark

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.080
 and he 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.520

 apn 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.190
 quarter 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.539
 Hopsten 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.679
 and there is here 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.860
 Percent Red 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.009
 dpa 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.239
 Percent 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.959
 Selcuk still here 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.819

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.819
 like and Microsoft and Nokia 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.839

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:34.939
 2 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:35.850
 St 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.820
 while the Mainz captain thus sacrifice and claim that there due 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.899
 first 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.789
 as a screen 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:47.870
 then I could Willingen here 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.279
 Dr 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.859

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.529
 to me 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.529
 then the 2 in Neuenweg has two new ones 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.879
 conceivable 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.509
 Exten gets 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:01.739
 around 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.419
 he is not here 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.399
 the normal think my head 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:09.399
 yes the normal one buys Next for 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.319
 Therefore, in the future still block a game 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.319
 Captain Hofmann 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 first KieÃŸling believe so here 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.009
 they should not drink 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:27.430
 give which tip 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.969
 only I think 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.099
 4 Gaza the Axis much better 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.159
 my clients 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.919
 So here you can go my head 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.039
 then you could turn that off 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.219
 but has new ones 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.599
 in the latest version 8 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.629
 if the committees may have it will continue 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.649
 and that's the 4th 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:52.599
 Quiet 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.599
 Mart Stein 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.619
 still go 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.089
 on 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:13.519
 yes here BZ reported DTP yes Hamann I'm scared 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.880
 in 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.030
 Highlight was 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.849
 the ear 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.849
 and exactly 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.949
 but it could be given 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.610
 many 04 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.969
 where was 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.189
 revenue 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.189
 4 4 but start 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.469
 Door openers show that's all fake 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.340
 Euro 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.139
 I think it is fit to fit 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.139
 but it is not bad 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.289
 Cecilia Alex is desperately wearable Jari Aktas 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.289

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:04.999
 Yes 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:09.319
 The top 50 scorers do not say the percentages around 50 nations 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.309
 Loyalty yes and I Dario Cologna honors
