00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.990
 yes I want to look like my first 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.480
 don't start well today and come up with one 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.590
 another I ask how you feel so you can 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.049
 Others 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.400
 to grow under it but yes I am disappointed 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.560
 really huge 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.970
 and yes I sat so was so close so yes 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.920
 all went well actually i did i 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.869
 I was a good race neutered 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.609
 summer i find the good i am my 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.099
 really a block quickly 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.810
 I have accelerated a second half in between 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.110
 I tapped doing it I figured this out 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.280
 is so this is it this is just it 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 just 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180
 So once he had to do that and he 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.469
 grows then you don't know what you once got one 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 look at really certain safer can me 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.489
 proposals started as good gold on the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.050
 relay and then yes the numbers young 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.780
 numbers that must come by 100 and the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.210
 50 and then things are not going well for you 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.530
 to grind from how can it go to with 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.420
 the hundreds 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.110
 that really should blame myself, I do 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.690
 really made a mistake but well i was 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.450
 then very bottom yourself my you above 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.450
 now a vaguely disappointed and 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.240
 exploiting you know i have a little bit 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.770
 sit and think about how it is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.790
 that marleen in Eindhoven as 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.369
 swam great 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.690
 you from here does not save my theory 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.850
 maybe but maybe very 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.320
 banana is that that you from him 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.820
 did not come out well you were like 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.790
 one of the few countries there 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 focused in own country own swimming pool 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.250
 and maybe two peaks in one 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.830
 season that there is something too much 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.590
 asked about the ring here we know 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.030
 if you are in very good eh yes there 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.159
 I was very good but the did not matter 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.780
 quiet so no taping that 's just 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.979
 during training so I have that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.979
 stolen 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.030
 although a lot were the whole but 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.470
 maybe my preparation should be there 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.590
 look something else next time 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.060
 but he still takes just my next 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.649
 times just a pity 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.840
 Now weird is that you have an ordinary one 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.979
 pay you go home and did it anyway 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.479
 have a bad feeling 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.700
 yes that they have this tonight 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.610
 homage in the holland heineken house 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.850
 and they have the number down I think 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.200
 the queen waits well as a couple 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.450
 days later it is all very nice 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.250
 lamers unless i am olympic 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.150
 vacancy view is olympic 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.370

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.989

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.829
 considered London is still an option 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.530
 He is a bit of an early ask for 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.690
 now yes set the kura but I to achja 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.950
