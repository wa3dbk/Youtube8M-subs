surprised by whatever

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.389 
surprised by whatever
you<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.410> someone<00:00:46.620> else<00:00:46.800> good<00:00:46.950> question<00:00:47.190> yes

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you know someone else good question yes

you know someone else good question yes
a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:47.879> bit

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.050 

I<00:00:50.690> didn't<00:00:51.140> expect<00:00:51.379> it<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.590> be<00:00:51.680> is

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.540 

but<00:00:55.420> at<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.630> same<00:00:55.840> time<00:00:56.110> we've<00:00:56.500> been

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.840 

one

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
one

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.820 
one
so<00:01:02.780> I<00:01:02.809> think<00:01:03.379> you'll<00:01:03.469> be<00:01:03.500> displayed

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so I think you'll be displayed

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
so I think you'll be displayed
what<00:01:05.160> he<00:01:05.280> tells<00:01:05.520> I<00:01:05.700> jiggles<00:01:06.090> involving<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
what he tells I jiggles involving the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.920 
what he tells I jiggles involving the
type<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.870> you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.160 

brother<00:01:10.930> was

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
brother was

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.410 
brother was
was<00:01:12.740> killed<00:01:12.979> by<00:01:13.159> gash<00:01:13.400> on<00:01:13.610> who<00:01:13.790> was<00:01:13.909> hired<00:01:14.180> by

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
was killed by gash on who was hired by

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.270 
was killed by gash on who was hired by
night

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
night

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.000 
night
so

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.890 

matrice<00:01:18.790> that<00:01:18.910> he<00:01:18.970> hasn't<00:01:19.360> taken

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
matrice that he hasn't taken

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.890 
matrice that he hasn't taken
and<00:01:21.260> that's<00:01:21.740> that's<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.280> big<00:01:22.430> battery

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900
