00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.590
 newer and so we come to our program 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.620
 is also the proposal of Finance Minister Steinbrück 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.860
 the state should be forced by law to stop debting 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 not to mention that's certainly never going to happen 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.429
 meaning that we have more to cede to the Treasury 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.800
 a hair-raising idea 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.189
 When did you get the impression of our region anyway? 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.900
 Finances lost any relation to the citizens they cheer highest notes 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.949
 about the magnificent tax revenues 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.949
 but the row citizen remains on the track 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.380
 Henning Walther on his tax return 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.090
 as a development engineer, he earns quite well 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.170
 depending on bonuses Petra between 44 and 2 46 thousand euros per year 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.800
 but only to income tax 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.479
 Soli and church tax 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.889
 since he was an unmarried employee about ten thousand euros in taxes per year 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.740
 to come the social contributions 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.629
 in principle 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.869
 how much you are currently satisfied in logs when I look at 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.400
 How much of this remains with the tax office 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.600
 how strict the tax office has meanwhile become how little I claim there 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.370
 can make 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.640
 when I look at it 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.230
 how the prices have increased in recent years 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.090
 then I ask myself, for example 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.990
 what should i do so i could mean 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.950
 Pension plan strike 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.320
 In fact, the citizens have less and less in their pockets 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.300
 according to calculations of the Federal Statistical Office, the net wages of the 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.010
 Employees in 2006, adjusted for price 1, get 8 percent 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.600
 and in the first half of 2007 by 0 come 9 percent 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.900
 experts are particularly interested in the unprecedented tax hike 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.380
 Measures lately 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.090
 that is among other things 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.810
 the increase therefore would be the insurance tax 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.890
 from 16 to 19 percent 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.890
 the reduction of saver deductions by almost half 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.120
 the probably unconstitutional reduction of the commuter tax 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.470
 the increase of the top tax rate 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.190
 and the Swede has badly defended the domestic workroom 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.689
 According to estimates, these and other measures mean the federal government 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.969
 tens of billions more revenue for the treasury 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.459
 moreover, the state is only benefiting from rising consumer prices 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.229
 example 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.229
 The price of crude oil today is at a historic high 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.010
 that makes gasoline prices go up 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.940
 beneficiary 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.940
 is the city 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.929
 at a gasoline price of one euro 37 for the liter super 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:43.589
 The Treasury catches almost two-thirds of the total price with 87 cents 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.389
 about 65 cents of mineral oil including the property tax and 22 cents on top 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:51.859
 value added tax 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.180
 the high gasoline price is good for the state treasury 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.539
 The victims are the citizens 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:02.449
 Given an income tax burden, scooters will be over 53 percent 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.109
 Demands for tax cuts are getting louder 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.110
 Oberstdorf overwhelmed Kaufhof buy cheap 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.800
 that the old state of the commuter commute is restored 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.959
 second, we demand a reduction of the solidarity surcharge 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.459
 and third, we want that to be fair 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.479
 but it is worthwhile guys soon lowered even lower than before 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.540
 in the medium term so experts 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.350
 The citizens must finally be relieved in the context of an income tax reform 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.530
 Pfaff why nothing happens despite bubbling tax revenues 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.349
 We are driving in the Federal Ministry of Finance 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.129
 you do not want to know about tax cuts here 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.809
 Reason is the enormous national debt of about one point 5 trillion euros 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.629
 this sees no room for maneuver 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.010
 in addition, the state budget would develop well 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.650
 but that applies above all to municipalities and the Länder and not to the 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.779
 Federal budget 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.229
 but the numbers look very different 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:02.529
 For 2007, worthy federal revenues of less than 250 billion euros 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:03.539
 estimated 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:08.729
 Of which 220 billion by taxes and already in the first half of the year, there was one 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:12.349
 Tax revenue plus a whopping 18 point 4 percent 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.509
 with fiscal consolidation and tax relief »are at the same time 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:18.299
 possible 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.150
 so the opinion of many experts 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.150
 however, in Basel the Institute for the World Economy in Kiel 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.949
 The renowned scientist is a member of the working group 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.139
 Tax estimates of the Federal Ministry of Finance 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.000
 the Bund 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.320
 can achieve both goals at the same time the household can be governed and so 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.330
 the income tax for all can be lowered that is assuming that 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.710
 Spending cuts will probably be enough 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.690
 while not new additional issues would be resolved issues 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.060
 which are unnecessary and in their effect on the overall economy in many 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.409
 Be harmful to cases 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.649
 yet unimpressed by it, the federal government sets its policy of high 

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:04.129
 Taxes and ever-increasing expenses 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.169
 That brings, according to experts, another risk 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.620
 the high taxes are a pronounced economic slowdown 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.699
 because the income tax rates for all would be lowered by one percentage point 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.999
 then you can expect that he throws that economic growth 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:27.080
 Humboldt comma 1 percentage points larger fails show all »effect 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.710
 minimal but it is a lasting effect and also for 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.610
 In the medium term one could also expect that the 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.240
 Income tax receipts are higher than if you do nothing 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.490
 in the current legislative period 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.910
 but as long as the federal government does not finally reconsider and continue to do more and more 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.689
 Expenditure financed by the mark over taxes 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:54.089
 Citizens like Henning Walther will have less and less in their pockets and the 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:55.069
 Economy 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:56.719
 and the labor market
