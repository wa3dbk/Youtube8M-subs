00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.839
 hello today we're going 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.839
 discover the compass app 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.450
 that's when the set is not 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:19.380
 available just run 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:21.009
 the iphone so that they cover 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:31.430
 the totality 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:36.460
 the ideal is to rotate also 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:41.860
 the time of simply I close 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:46.040
 nation and I activate 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.370
 just wait a little bit and 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:56.500
 the application will automatically switch to 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.500
 after a few seconds a little bit 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.360
 semi opera is therefore the application 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.630
 pass compass in place and you 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.420
 turn the iphone and you see that 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.850
 the indication of the direction is 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.460
 accurate and a little novelty 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.350
 interesting you press the center 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.240
 of the compass and you freezes and a 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.720
 position and in rotation 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.610
 you see with the small red area 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.539
 the gap that you have with respect to the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.409
 position position you have fixed 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:36.840
 quickly on the center you free 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.640
 I will redo with another shadow 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.829
 see that the landais position so 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:48.909
 currently is positioned at 168 degrees 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:53.170
 and turning the red zone tells me 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:02:02.189
 the difference from the 168 created here is 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:05.970
 in the sense and in the other direction here 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.440
 I pressed the center to release him 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.039
 a little novelty you see on the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.799
 trough 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.090
 there is a small point as specified 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.690
 that they would support more when when 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.030
 precisely I break on the side and there 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.209
 you see a very complete level 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.160
 so the level can have two 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.799
 uses either the use as 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.010
 so it's to measure an angle on 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.560
 the flat part the slice of your 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.390
 iphone you see that English is 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.660
 displayed 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.560
 there you have in the horizon also 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.330
 because you have the angle of zero on the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.810
 black goes through glass to tell you 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.680
 that you have arrived at the optimum so 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.700
 the horizontal putting the iphone 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.709
 vertical the same way the same plane 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.140
 and as for the depositions the zero on 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:05.140
 get the green plan that's another 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.010
 possibility with this level which is he has 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.959
 shown and practical 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.190
 suppose you wanted to take a plan 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.470
 reference is that you 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.250
 position on your reference plane 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.560
 you press on the screen of an iphone the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.140
 0 is yours and when you 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.239
 move you also see the angle 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.209
 compared to the reference number of 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.830
 references created in red and that 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.780
 do you want to come from 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.820
 again so if I leave a little bit 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.760
 offset from the horizon because 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.540
 I put myself in relation to the reference the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.239
 red turns into glass so here 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.310
 the same way with the iphone the tikal 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.650
 to release the reference plane just 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 she was leaning on the center of 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.820
 iphone the iphone screen 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.840
 automatically we come back with the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:56.019
 absolute zero position 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.560
 the second level use and posing 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.769
 the iphone on a surface and from 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.390
 there we visualize and the gap with these 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.640
 two circles that move more 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.160
 the angle is important plus the circles 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.510
 are discarded and you see in by one 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.820
 moving the iphone that position 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.979
 of the two circles gives you the meaning of 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.680
 the inclination relative to the iphone to 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.919
 national center 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.820
 the angle measurement and when we 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.389
 we find an angle of zero degree of 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.770
 the same way 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:36.630
 the screen of the green ua instead of the right 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.789
 as for the part the use of the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.780
 level on a slice 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:44.460
 suppose I put on the plane of 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.100
 reference a support on the iphone the 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.690
 positioning red and measuring angles 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.250
 is now done because we have between 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.250
 reference point and inclination of 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.009
 joys the same way if you get there 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:00.000
 to put a value that plan of 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:06.539
 reference the red turns into this 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.430
 case there in the air to free it is enough 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.490
 to repudiate on the center is there the 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.650
 big black anti indicating that we use 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.770
 more reference plan and the reason 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.720
 relative to absolute zero 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.300
 so a very very simple application 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.120
 but that can be very practical and which 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.099
 replaces who will replace the majority of 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.699
 other small style apps 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:34.729
 high level by sliding the screen over the 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.729
 right we get back to where alone 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:41.180
 this little demonstration of 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:44.500
 the soil application is finished and I 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.500
 Thank you for your attention
