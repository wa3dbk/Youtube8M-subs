00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
with horses done by this method we

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.350 
with horses done by this method we
should<00:00:55.620> start<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:56.190> right<00:00:56.640> where<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.910> left<00:00:57.090> off

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360

methods<00:01:03.480> where<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.049> use<00:01:04.350> whips<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.920> force

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
methods where you use whips and force

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.520 
methods where you use whips and force
the<00:01:08.010> next<00:01:08.340> day<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.580> start<00:01:09.180> almost<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.260> where

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the next day you start almost back where

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.929 
the next day you start almost back where
you<00:01:10.619> started<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> day<00:01:11.250> before<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
you started the day before and then you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.700 
you started the day before and then you
work<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.420> way<00:01:12.450> back<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.290> only<00:01:13.439> make

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
work your way back up but you only make

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.719 
work your way back up but you only make
progress<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.430> inches<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:16.430> often<00:01:17.430> say<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
progress in inches I often say that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.870 
progress in inches I often say that
horses<00:01:18.479> learn<00:01:18.689> while<00:01:18.960> they're<00:01:18.990> sleeping<00:01:19.880> if

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
horses learn while they're sleeping if

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
horses learn while they're sleeping if
you<00:01:21.119> take<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> violence<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:22.580> because<00:01:23.580> they

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you take the violence out because they

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.530 
you take the violence out because they
will<00:01:24.060> learn<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:25.820> you're<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> hurt

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
will learn that you're not going to hurt

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.920 
will learn that you're not going to hurt
them

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
them

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.530 
them
they<00:01:28.710> come<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> next<00:01:29.490> day<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:30.270> she's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
they come out the next day now she's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020 
they come out the next day now she's
much<00:01:30.840> faster<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> smaller<00:01:32.340> circle<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
much faster with a smaller circle in the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.620 
much faster with a smaller circle in the
year<00:01:33.920> everything<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.390> much<00:01:36.570> faster

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
year everything is going so much faster

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.850 
year everything is going so much faster
today<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:39.030> amazing<00:01:39.650> when<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.829> use

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
today and it's just amazing when you use

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.700 
today and it's just amazing when you use
no<00:01:41.369> violence<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.090> how<00:01:42.869> much<00:01:43.079> faster<00:01:43.350> they

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
no violence at all how much faster they

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.410 
no violence at all how much faster they
learn<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:46.020> horses<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.799> start<00:01:47.420> that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
learn and the horses that we start that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.969 
learn and the horses that we start that
is<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.720> say<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> first<00:01:49.259> saddle<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.740> first

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
is to say the first saddle and first

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.880 
is to say the first saddle and first
Rider<00:01:50.960> happens<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.110> about<00:01:52.350> thirty<00:01:52.649> minutes

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
Rider happens at about thirty minutes

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.330 
Rider happens at about thirty minutes
and<00:01:53.399> that's<00:01:54.329> equal<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.380> about<00:01:55.649> four<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> six

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and that's equal to about four to six

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.840 
and that's equal to about four to six
weeks<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.869> traditional<00:01:58.380> methods<00:01:58.850> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
weeks in the traditional methods and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.319 
weeks in the traditional methods and
then<00:02:00.770> after<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> first<00:02:02.040> week<00:02:02.399> you're<00:02:03.000> already

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
then after the first week you're already

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.190 
then after the first week you're already
walking<00:02:03.689> trotting<00:02:04.530> countering

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
walking trotting countering

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.300 
walking trotting countering
maybe<00:02:06.830> even<00:02:07.370> asking<00:02:07.850> for<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.149> proper<00:02:08.509> lead<00:02:09.050> oh

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
maybe even asking for the proper lead oh

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.309 
maybe even asking for the proper lead oh
that's<00:02:10.310> too<00:02:10.700> fast<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.420> don't<00:02:11.600> think<00:02:11.840> any<00:02:12.050> horse

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
that's too fast I don't think any horse

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.449 
that's too fast I don't think any horse
can<00:02:12.590> learn<00:02:12.740> that<00:02:13.010> fast<00:02:13.340> right<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:15.160> these<00:02:16.160> kids

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
can learn that fast right and these kids

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.180 
can learn that fast right and these kids
can<00:02:16.700> learn<00:02:16.880> fast<00:02:17.270> either<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.890> I've<00:02:19.010> been

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
can learn fast either but I've been

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.410 
can learn fast either but I've been
studying<00:02:19.459> education<00:02:20.290> more<00:02:21.290> volume<00:02:22.180> they<00:02:23.180> want

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
studying education more volume they want

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.240 
studying education more volume they want
more<00:02:23.630> volume<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.380> I'm<00:02:24.500> not<00:02:24.620> sure<00:02:24.920> we<00:02:25.100> can

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
more volume but I'm not sure we can

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.870 
more volume but I'm not sure we can
handle<00:02:25.430> it
