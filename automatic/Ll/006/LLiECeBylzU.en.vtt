00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.449 
see it's kind of coming up as well
that's<00:02:25.380> just<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.739> little<00:02:26.010> bit<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> adhesive

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
that's just a little bit of the adhesive

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.100 
that's just a little bit of the adhesive
left<00:02:27.030> apparently<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.569> can<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:27.870> keep<00:02:28.080> going

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
left apparently you can just keep going

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.130 
left apparently you can just keep going
back<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.920> forth<00:02:29.250> but<00:02:29.760> that's<00:02:29.880> all<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.569> takes

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
back and forth but that's all it takes

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.520 
back and forth but that's all it takes
I'm<00:02:31.350> not<00:02:31.620> sure<00:02:31.800> how<00:02:31.950> I'm<00:02:32.010> going<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.160> remove<00:02:32.400> the

I'm not sure how I'm going to remove the
Downtowner<00:02:34.530> hat<00:02:34.830> or<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.760> one<00:02:35.880> that's

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
Downtowner hat or just the one that's

Downtowner hat or just the one that's
damaged<00:02:36.540> up<00:02:36.720> here<00:02:37.050> but<00:02:37.620> literally<00:02:38.519> it's<00:02:38.670> just

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
damaged up here but literally it's just

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.850 
damaged up here but literally it's just
a<00:02:39.330> few<00:02:40.110> minutes<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.980> didn't<00:02:41.580> last<00:02:42.060> day<00:02:42.860> maybe

a few minutes I didn't last day maybe

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.190 
a few minutes I didn't last day maybe
after<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> nice<00:02:44.489> long<00:02:44.820> ride<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.900> need<00:02:46.050> some

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
you can just return those if they break

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.009 
you can just return those if they break
directly<00:03:30.329> with<00:03:30.450> Shimano<00:03:30.630> or<00:03:31.079> Shimano<00:03:33.019> dealer

so don't worry too much about that but

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.039 
so don't worry too much about that but
again<00:03:37.769> yes<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.850> was<00:03:39.030> your<00:03:39.180> frame<00:03:39.390> warranty<00:03:39.840> but

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
again yes it was your frame warranty but

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.490 
again yes it was your frame warranty but
