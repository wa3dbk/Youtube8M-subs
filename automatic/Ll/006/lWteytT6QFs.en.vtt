00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.310
 very good to all welcome once 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.620
 more to the channel of the strangest things and 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.190
 We are here today to talk about 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.349
 the rarest hotels in the world after 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.410
 to investigate I made a list a 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.509
 compilation with the five most hotels 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.599
 rare that can be found in the 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:25.900
 planet earth hotels only hotels 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.779
 creative original hotels that 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.460
 It really is worth visiting 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.850
 only bad is that some of them are 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.820
 really expensive or maybe they spend a 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.309
 little bit of the line, look at what 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.190
 I say because in the following photos you go 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.550
 to check it we have first of all a 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.420
 hotel 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.510
 called the propeller island city what 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.149
 is in berlin in germany and that 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.720
 includes 45 rooms each more 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.940
 original some change color other 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.059
 they are floating others are surrounded by 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.820
 mirrors but the most curious thing is that for 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.119
 sleep instead of beds offer you two 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.899
 coffins you imagine the feeling of 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.729
 Sleeping inside a lucky coffin 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.970
 these coffins have small holes 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.470
 to breathe but still I think 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.560
 that the feeling has to be 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.360
 scary not basically it would be about 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.660
 sleep in the same place where a 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.840
 person dies in second place we have 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.720
 another hotel also quite strange in 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.480
 Denmark called can sleep 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.260
 with rooms composed of cans 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.160
 beer giants located in groups 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.220
 of 6 each can measure about 380 meters 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.070
 height and 2 floors and on the ground floor there 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.050
 a small living room and a minibar and 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.420
 going up you get to the bedroom that 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.450
 has a round double bed and a 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.000
 Skylight as you can see this kind of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.580
 hotel is not exactly luxurious 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.080
 but if it is original and for those 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.440
 people who are lovers of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.679
 soda and beer no doubt this 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 type of hotel will convince them in third 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.250
 place we have another curious hotel a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.820
 hotel that gives a little bit of a bit of a grimace 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.940
 the alcatraz hotel in kaiserlautern 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.360
 located in germany is exactly one 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.090
 real jail that has 56 rooms 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.690
 with bars in the windows and it's 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.660
 surrounded by barbed wires 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.820
 the alcatraz hotel in the alcatraz hotel 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.150
 Guests are welcomed as 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.100
 delinquents and they are condemned to 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.280
 stay in the cell during the time 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.100
 who have chosen to feel like a 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.710
 true prisoner costs 70 dollars the 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.400
 night what I could not imagine is 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.400
 that people would pay to catch 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.500
 a room in a prison no 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.630
 I just find it funny and a 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.700
 little fool no but good to try 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.950
 new experiences to know what is 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.310
 feels inside a prison because it is 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.780
 all right 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:16.250
 in fourth place we have another hotel 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.830
 the plane jumbo hostel rather the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.110
 hotel located in sweden that presents 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.440
 Innovative rooms where you can 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.020
 sleep in the cockpit in addition 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.380
 has air internet access 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.650
 minibar and television by 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.230
 cable as you can see a pretty hotel 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.010
 original but the hotel that undoubtedly 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.730
 take the prize 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.620
 the hotel perhaps the most amazing the best 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.540
 hotel that you can find in terms of 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.330
 level of romanticism if you want to take 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.350
 your partner is an underwater hotel 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.830
 which is called poseidÃ³n anders and is a 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.140
 five - star hotel under the sea 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.860
 located on the fiji islands 20 meters from 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.950
 depth this hotel has 220 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.980
 Transparent suites with views of the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.100
 depth of the sea to corals and 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.080
 tropical fish this kind of 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.990
 Accommodation is obviously the most expensive 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.420
 romantic and special 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.780
 if you want an advice of all these 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.340
 unique and original hotels you have to 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.140
 go to the submarine 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.390
 If you ever have enough money 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.010
 saved do not hesitate to go because if 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.860
 It is simply an experience 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.810
 unforgettable to see the corals that 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.580
 precisely in that area they are the 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.730
 most beautiful on the planet earth 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.320
 with all kinds of fish passing by 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.900
 of the room is something that there is not 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.400
 way to pay I do not think that neither 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.390
 You would not even have to pay with money 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.720
 because it's something that 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.970
 that a normal person does not have no no 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.760
 can you imagine is not an experience 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.520
 so pretty and so unique that no doubt 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.920
 mark the people who are going and good here 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.500

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:10.190
