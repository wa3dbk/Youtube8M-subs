positions on both are extremely

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.950 
positions on both are extremely
respectable<00:00:38.640> positions<00:00:39.120> are<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.600> health<00:00:39.840> care

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
practitioner at least um I was hoping

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.930 
practitioner at least um I was hoping
that<00:00:49.680> maybe<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> guys<00:00:50.700> could

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that maybe one of you guys could

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.979 
that maybe one of you guys could
actually<00:00:50.969> educate<00:00:51.629> me<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.980> um<00:00:53.960> what<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989

actually educate me as to um what the
difference<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.670> hear<00:00:56.940> through

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
difference is because you hear through

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.420 
difference is because you hear through
the<00:00:57.210> grapevine<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.660> PA<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.530> NP<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:58.980> almost

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the grapevine that PA and NP are almost

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.389 
the grapevine that PA and NP are almost
like<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> same<00:01:00.120> level<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.800> are<00:01:01.920> two

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
like at the same level but there are two

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.929 
like at the same level but there are two
completely<00:01:03.120> different<00:01:03.660> areas<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.939> learning

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
completely different areas of learning

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.649 
completely different areas of learning
medicine<00:01:06.330> same<00:01:06.930> concept<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.070> kind<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.369> like

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
medicine same concept it's kind of like

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.179 
medicine same concept it's kind of like
it's<00:01:09.659> kind<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:09.990> same<00:01:10.290> church<00:01:10.710> different

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it's kind of like same church different

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.210 
it's kind of like same church different
pew<00:01:11.520> almost<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.299> um<00:01:12.540> from<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.560> I've<00:01:13.710> heard<00:01:13.740> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
pew almost but um from what I've heard I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
pew almost but um from what I've heard I
understand<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.150> nurse<00:01:15.720> practitioners<00:01:16.380> are

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
understand that nurse practitioners are

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.179 
understand that nurse practitioners are
considered<00:01:18.619> independent<00:01:19.619> practitioners

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
considered independent practitioners

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.550 
considered independent practitioners
which<00:01:20.340> means<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.909> they're<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:22.020> do

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
which means that they're they can do

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.050 
which means that they're they can do
what<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:22.740> want<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.280> their<00:01:23.460> own<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.850> don't

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
what they want on their own they don't

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.730 
what they want on their own they don't
need<00:01:24.890> supervision<00:01:26.090> more<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> say<00:01:27.740> they

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
need supervision more so to say they

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
need supervision more so to say they
obviously<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.729> write<00:01:29.880> prescriptions<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
obviously can write prescriptions like a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.289 
obviously can write prescriptions like a
PA<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.100> also<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.670> their<00:01:32.850> own<00:01:32.970> practice

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
PA they can also on their own practice

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.719 
PA they can also on their own practice
which<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.470> thing<00:01:34.710> pas<00:01:35.070> cannot<00:01:35.520> do

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
which I know is one thing pas cannot do

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.100 
which I know is one thing pas cannot do
um<00:01:35.990> however<00:01:37.520> both<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:39.360> completely

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
um however both are a completely

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.190 
um however both are a completely
different<00:01:40.320> branch<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.450> nurse<00:01:42.450> practitioners

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
different branch so nurse practitioners

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.170 
different branch so nurse practitioners
are<00:01:43.409> taught<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> nursing<00:01:44.460> model<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.000> then

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
are taught in the nursing model and then

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
are taught in the nursing model and then

physician assistants are taught with the

physician assistants are taught with the
medical<00:01:47.250> model<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.270> where<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> get

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
medical model now this is where I get

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.999 
medical model now this is where I get
confused<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.320> don't<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> difference

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
confused I don't know the difference

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.539

pas<00:04:09.880> can<00:04:10.390> start<00:04:10.900> in<00:04:11.170> New<00:04:11.410> York<00:04:11.620> State<00:04:12.540> roughly

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
pas can start in New York State roughly

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.729 
pas can start in New York State roughly
around<00:04:13.660> like<00:04:13.990> maybe<00:04:14.459> it's<00:04:15.459> like<00:04:15.750> 79<00:04:16.750> like<00:04:17.200> 85<00:04:17.709> I

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
around like maybe it's like 79 like 85 I

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.070 
around like maybe it's like 79 like 85 I
think<00:04:18.160> is<00:04:18.250> like<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.430> median<00:04:19.030> /<00:04:19.510> starting

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
think is like the median / starting

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.560 
think is like the median / starting
salary<00:04:20.470> um<00:04:20.680> but<00:04:21.520> they<00:04:21.640> can<00:04:21.790> go<00:04:21.940> in<00:04:22.060> upwards<00:04:22.450> of

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
salary um but they can go in upwards of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.050 
salary um but they can go in upwards of
like

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
like

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.560 
like
101<00:04:23.840> 10<00:04:24.050> maybe<00:04:24.350> even<00:04:24.500> 120<00:04:25.190> um<00:04:25.570> nurse

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
101 10 maybe even 120 um nurse

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.870 
101 10 maybe even 120 um nurse
