00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
cards the 512 bit interface that's what

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.680 
cards the 512 bit interface that's what
held<00:01:24.220> back<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.460> GX<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:25.030> quite<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.300> bit<00:01:25.510> was<00:01:25.660> a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
held back the GX to quite a bit was a

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.460 
held back the GX to quite a bit was a
256<00:01:26.530> 128<00:01:27.510> require<00:01:28.510> it<00:01:28.660> really<00:01:28.870> sucked<00:01:29.170> because

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
256 128 require it really sucked because

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.130 
256 128 require it really sucked because
it<00:01:30.400> held<00:01:30.700> back<00:01:30.940> a<00:01:30.970> memory<00:01:31.240> quite<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.630> bit<00:01:31.900> and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
it held back a memory quite a bit and

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.660 
it held back a memory quite a bit and
then<00:01:32.290> slowed<00:01:32.530> down<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.830> car<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.250> make<00:01:33.430> and

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
then slowed down the car and make and

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.480 
then slowed down the car and make and
the<00:01:34.300> cards<00:01:34.630> had<00:01:34.780> really<00:01:34.990> bad<00:01:35.140> stuttering<00:01:35.680> so

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
the cards had really bad stuttering so

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.850 
the cards had really bad stuttering so
these<00:01:36.910> cards<00:01:37.330> are<00:01:37.480> single<00:01:37.810> GPUs<00:01:38.230> I<00:01:38.500> shouldn't

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
these cards are single GPUs I shouldn't

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.860 
these cards are single GPUs I shouldn't
have<00:01:38.980> any<00:01:39.220> multi-gpu<00:01:39.880> prom<00:01:40.390> like<00:01:40.750> the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
have any multi-gpu prom like the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.960 
have any multi-gpu prom like the

8800 gtx into my computer or the
stuttering<00:01:48.159> pretty<00:01:48.430> much<00:01:48.550> stopped<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.420> knew

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
stuttering pretty much stopped so I knew

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.940 
stuttering pretty much stopped so I knew
is<00:01:49.870> this<00:01:50.020> dual<00:01:50.320> GPU<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.530> what<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.740> looks

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
is this dual GPU this is what it looks

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.970 
is this dual GPU this is what it looks
like<00:01:54.220> when<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.820> first<00:01:55.240> open<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.720> box<00:01:56.020> hog
