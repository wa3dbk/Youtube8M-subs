00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
hi guys in this episode I'd like to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.680 
hi guys in this episode I'd like to
cover<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.860> prusik<00:00:14.309> sty<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.120> girth<00:00:15.360> hitch

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
cover the prusik sty in the girth hitch

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.540 
cover the prusik sty in the girth hitch
and<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.560> chicken<00:00:16.920> loop<00:00:17.070> well<00:00:17.250> go<00:00:17.340> ahead<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and the chicken loop well go ahead and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.680 
and the chicken loop well go ahead and
kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.730> cover<00:00:17.910> all<00:00:18.090> these<00:00:18.240> together<00:00:18.449> because

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
kind of cover all these together because

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.859 
kind of cover all these together because
they're<00:00:18.900> all<00:00:18.990> very<00:00:19.170> similar<00:00:19.820> not<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
they're all very similar not so the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.300 
they're all very similar not so the
concept<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.500> how<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.619> utilize<00:00:22.890> them<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.279> very

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
concept and how you utilize them is very

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.519 
concept and how you utilize them is very
similar<00:00:23.760> we'll<00:00:24.689> start<00:00:24.900> out<00:00:24.990> kind<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
similar we'll start out kind of with the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.740 
similar we'll start out kind of with the
base<00:00:25.740> knot<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:26.609> which<00:00:27.240> would<00:00:27.330> actually<00:00:27.630> be

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
base knot here which would actually be

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.269 
base knot here which would actually be
the<00:00:27.900> girth<00:00:28.080> hitch<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.590> about<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> only<00:00:29.010> place

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the girth hitch in about the only place

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.589 
the girth hitch in about the only place
we're<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> utilize<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.240> girth<00:00:30.390> hitch

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
we're going to utilize the girth hitch

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.049 
we're going to utilize the girth hitch
on<00:00:30.900> our<00:00:30.929> team<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.219> do<00:00:32.340> tend<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> utilize

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
on our team as we do tend to utilize

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.299 
on our team as we do tend to utilize
these<00:00:33.270> when<00:00:33.870> tying<00:00:34.200> into<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> Stokes<00:00:35.070> basket

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
these when tying into the Stokes basket

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.520 
these when tying into the Stokes basket
itself<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.350> come<00:00:37.469> over

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
itself I'm going to kind of come over

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.250 
itself I'm going to kind of come over
here<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> Stokes<00:00:38.100> basket<00:00:38.340> rail<00:00:38.910> okay<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
here to the Stokes basket rail okay and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.540 
here to the Stokes basket rail okay and
when<00:00:40.410> you're<00:00:40.530> positioning<00:00:40.980> yourself<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
when you're positioning yourself on the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.479 
when you're positioning yourself on the
Stokes<00:00:41.850> basket<00:00:42.230> will<00:00:43.230> usually<00:00:43.350> take<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.250> tie

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
Stokes basket will usually take and tie

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.010 
Stokes basket will usually take and tie
into<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> Stokes<00:00:45.090> basket<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.719> girth

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
into the Stokes basket with the girth

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.940 
into the Stokes basket with the girth
hitch<00:00:46.370> by<00:00:47.370> taking<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.600> knot<00:00:48.809> itself<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
hitch by taking the knot itself and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
hitch by taking the knot itself and
poking<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.489> through<00:00:50.520> kind<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> these

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
poking it through kind of one of these

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.279 
poking it through kind of one of these
areas<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.680> rail<00:00:53.239> where<00:00:54.239> these<00:00:54.629> little<00:00:54.809> tie

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
areas on the rail where these little tie

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.990 
areas on the rail where these little tie
ends<00:00:55.530> are<00:00:55.829> that'll<00:00:56.370> keep<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.579> from<00:00:56.699> sliding

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
ends are that'll keep you from sliding

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.049 
ends are that'll keep you from sliding
up<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.329> down<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> rail<00:00:57.809> too<00:00:58.079> far<00:00:58.350> okay<00:00:59.070> what

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
up and down the rail too far okay what

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.130 
up and down the rail too far okay what
you'll<00:01:00.180> end<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.359> doing<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.660> poking<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
you'll end up doing is poking that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.599 
you'll end up doing is poking that
through<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.469> letting<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.739> drop<00:01:02.129> through

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
through and letting this drop through

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.870 
through and letting this drop through
the<00:01:02.730> backside<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.660> okay<00:01:04.580> when<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> pull

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the backside here okay when you pull

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.700 
the backside here okay when you pull
this<00:01:06.060> kind<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> pull<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.930> side<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
this kind of pull it on one side and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.580 
this kind of pull it on one side and
you'll<00:01:08.430> create<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.170> which<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you'll create this right here which is a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.250 
you'll create this right here which is a
basic<00:01:11.070> girth<00:01:11.280> hitch<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.140> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
basic girth hitch and then we will you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.660 
basic girth hitch and then we will you
actually<00:01:13.409> utilize<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.340> tie<00:01:14.520> yourself

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
actually utilize this to tie yourself

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.929 
actually utilize this to tie yourself
into<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> harness<00:01:15.689> okay<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.729> basic

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
into the harness okay so that is a basic

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
into the harness okay so that is a basic
girth<00:01:18.360> hitch<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.009> be

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
girth hitch right there it can be

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.380 
girth hitch right there it can be
created<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> few<00:01:20.700> different<00:01:20.970> ways<00:01:21.030> by<00:01:21.270> either

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
created a few different ways by either

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.969 
created a few different ways by either
wrapping<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> around<00:01:22.049> an<00:01:22.439> object<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.860> we

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
wrapping it around an object like we

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
wrapping it around an object like we
just<00:01:23.159> showed<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.600> way<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> create<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
just showed the other way to create a

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.469 
just showed the other way to create a
simple<00:01:25.740> girth<00:01:26.100> hitch<00:01:26.340> would<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.360> you'd

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
simple girth hitch would if you'd

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.200 
simple girth hitch would if you'd
actually<00:01:27.630> take<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> loop<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:29.090> invert<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
actually take a loop like this invert it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.969 
actually take a loop like this invert it
over<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.600> itself<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.470> kind<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.710> pull<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
over on itself and just kind of pull it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.310 
over on itself and just kind of pull it
through<00:01:32.520> okay<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.810> create<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.140> small

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
through okay and you can create a small

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
through okay and you can create a small
girth<00:01:34.740> hitch<00:01:35.090> which<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.329> wrapped<00:01:36.570> around

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
girth hitch which can be wrapped around

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.140 
girth hitch which can be wrapped around
an<00:01:37.079> object<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.740> tighten<00:01:38.430> down<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.850> this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
an object and tighten down like this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.550 
an object and tighten down like this
okay

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
okay

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.410 
okay
these<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:41.009> also<00:01:41.310> oftentimes<00:01:41.640> very<00:01:41.880> useful

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
these are also oftentimes very useful

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.210 
these are also oftentimes very useful
when<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.200> restrain<00:01:43.530> hands<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
when you have to restrain hands on a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
when you have to restrain hands on a
combative<00:01:44.700> patient<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.299> something<00:01:45.600> along

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
combative patient or something along

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.039 
combative patient or something along
those<00:01:45.899> lines<00:01:46.350> okay<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.250> very<00:01:47.520> useful<00:01:47.810> hitch<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
those lines okay so very useful hitch to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.050 
those lines okay so very useful hitch to
know<00:01:49.229> okay<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.130> that's<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> common<00:01:50.880> girth

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
know okay so that's the common girth

piece of
okay<00:02:07.369> what<00:02:08.369> we're<00:02:08.490> trying<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.880> do<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.300> is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
okay what we're trying to do here is

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.920 
okay what we're trying to do here is
create<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:10.110> locking<00:02:10.830> mechanism<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.750> be

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
create a locking mechanism that can be

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
create a locking mechanism that can be
used<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:14.700> either<00:02:15.330> ascend<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.170> rope<00:02:16.350> or<00:02:16.590> is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
used to either ascend to the rope or is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.310 
used to either ascend to the rope or is
some<00:02:17.160> type<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.550> safety<00:02:17.820> on<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.360> rope<00:02:18.570> okay

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
some type of a safety on the rope okay

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.770 
some type of a safety on the rope okay
and<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.310> you'll<00:02:20.460> notice<00:02:20.490> with<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.540> it's

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
and what you'll notice with this is it's

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.690 
and what you'll notice with this is it's
very<00:02:21.840> easy<00:02:22.230> once<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.770> tied<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.190> slide<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.610> up

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
very easy once it's tied to slide it up

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.440 
very easy once it's tied to slide it up
and<00:02:23.820> down<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.240> rope<00:02:24.500> okay<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.070> but<00:02:26.850> if

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
and down the rope okay like so but if

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.200 
and down the rope okay like so but if
you<00:02:27.780> weight<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.500> from<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.160> either<00:02:29.340> side<00:02:29.850> at<00:02:30.090> an

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
you weight it from the either side at an

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.330 
you weight it from the either side at an
angle<00:02:30.600> you'll<00:02:31.050> note<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.560> locks<00:02:31.800> off<00:02:32.070> on

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
angle you'll note that it locks off on

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.680 
angle you'll note that it locks off on
the<00:02:32.430> rope<00:02:32.550> because<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.910> kind<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.180> grips<00:02:33.510> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the rope because it kind of grips it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.660 
the rope because it kind of grips it
around<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.170> rope<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.860> either<00:02:35.160> direction

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
around the rope so either direction

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.330 
around the rope so either direction
you'll<00:02:36.270> see<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:37.290> grips<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.950> rope<00:02:38.130> and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
you'll see this this grips the rope and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.960 
you'll see this this grips the rope and
creates<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.760> lock<00:02:39.000> okay<00:02:40.520> when<00:02:41.520> we're<00:02:41.670> tying

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
creates a lock okay when we're tying

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.140 
creates a lock okay when we're tying
this<00:02:42.980> within<00:02:43.980> our<00:02:44.160> team<00:02:44.520> we've<00:02:44.760> got<00:02:44.940> two

coil<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> outside<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.620> then<00:03:37.739> wrap<00:03:37.980> around

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
coil to the outside and then wrap around

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.060 
coil to the outside and then wrap around
so<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.269> would<00:03:39.420> be<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.780> wrap<00:03:40.050> rusick<00:03:40.709> for

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
so this would be a to wrap rusick for

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.060 
so this would be a to wrap rusick for
personal<00:03:41.670> use<00:03:41.940> or<00:03:42.209> single<00:03:43.110> person<00:03:43.560> use<00:03:43.800> if

personal use or single person use if

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.979 
personal use or single person use if
you've<00:03:44.640> got<00:03:44.670> more<00:03:45.060> than<00:03:45.120> one<00:03:45.269> person<00:03:45.810> or<00:03:45.959> a

rescue load on a pro six type system

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.009 
rescue load on a pro six type system
we'd<00:03:49.709> actually<00:03:49.890> prefer<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.700> do<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.019> third

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
we'd actually prefer that you do a third

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.440 
we'd actually prefer that you do a third
wrap<00:03:52.290> with<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.830> okay<00:03:53.519> so<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.090> only<00:03:54.150> real

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
wrap with that okay so the only real

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.690 
wrap with that okay so the only real
difference<00:03:54.870> with<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.430> I'm<00:03:56.430> gonna<00:03:56.549> go<00:03:56.670> ahead

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
difference with that I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.070 
difference with that I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:56.820> tie<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.299> start<00:03:57.570> over<00:03:57.690> just<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.019> you

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
and tie this and start over just so you

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.870 
and tie this and start over just so you
can<00:03:58.200> see<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.040> one<00:03:59.220> little<00:03:59.400> change<00:03:59.730> there

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
can see that the one little change there

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.220 
can see that the one little change there
is<00:04:00.590> that<00:04:01.590> when<00:04:02.280> you're<00:04:02.400> wrapping<00:04:02.790> your<00:04:02.910> rope

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
is that when you're wrapping your rope

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.199 
is that when you're wrapping your rope
you<00:04:04.230> just<00:04:04.440> do<00:04:04.620> one<00:04:05.160> okay<00:04:06.049> to<00:04:07.489> three<00:04:08.489> wraps<00:04:08.760> and

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
you just do one okay to three wraps and

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.670 
you just do one okay to three wraps and
then<00:04:09.660> once<00:04:09.840> again<00:04:09.900> we're<00:04:10.170> going<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.350> pull<00:04:10.560> it

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
then once again we're going to pull it

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.480 
then once again we're going to pull it
off<00:04:10.920> set<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.030> knot<00:04:12.420> does<00:04:12.690> not<00:04:12.840> end

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
off set so that knot does not end

off set so that knot does not end
in<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.610> middle<00:04:13.970> okay<00:04:14.830> we're<00:04:15.830> still<00:04:15.980> gonna

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
in the middle okay we're still gonna

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.250

this<00:05:02.450> is<00:05:02.540> what<00:05:02.630> we<00:05:02.720> call<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.020> chicken<00:05:03.230> loop

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
this is what we call the chicken loop

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.740 
this is what we call the chicken loop
when<00:05:04.070> we're<00:05:04.220> sending<00:05:04.610> a<00:05:04.820> rope<00:05:05.000> will<00:05:05.270> actually

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
when we're sending a rope will actually

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.260 
when we're sending a rope will actually
tie<00:05:06.530> in<00:05:06.680> several<00:05:07.130> of<00:05:07.220> these<00:05:07.310> pro<00:05:07.640> six<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.090> use

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
tie in several of these pro six and use

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.180 
tie in several of these pro six and use
them<00:05:08.510> alternating<00:05:09.170> to<00:05:09.230> work<00:05:09.410> our<00:05:09.590> way<00:05:09.650> up<00:05:09.950> a

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
them alternating to work our way up a

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.950 
them alternating to work our way up a
rope<00:05:10.430> okay

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
rope okay

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.510 
rope okay
oftentimes<00:05:12.440> we'll<00:05:12.740> find<00:05:12.950> it<00:05:13.040> useful<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.430> have

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
oftentimes we'll find it useful to have

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.610 
oftentimes we'll find it useful to have
a<00:05:13.640> very<00:05:13.850> long<00:05:14.090> press<00:05:14.480> six<00:05:14.690> like<00:05:14.870> this<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.380> use

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
a very long press six like this to use

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.880 
a very long press six like this to use
as<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.830> foot<00:05:16.160> loop<00:05:16.400> okay<00:05:17.210> what<00:05:18.200> we'll<00:05:18.320> often<00:05:18.560> do

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
as a foot loop okay what we'll often do

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.040 
as a foot loop okay what we'll often do
is<00:05:19.160> do<00:05:19.460> what<00:05:19.610> I<00:05:19.670> call<00:05:19.850> a<00:05:19.910> chicken<00:05:20.150> loop<00:05:20.480> where

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
is do what I call a chicken loop where

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.480 
is do what I call a chicken loop where
you<00:05:21.080> create<00:05:21.410> a<00:05:21.440> small<00:05:21.620> girth<00:05:21.980> hitch<00:05:22.190> at<00:05:22.400> the

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
you create a small girth hitch at the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.640 
you create a small girth hitch at the
end<00:05:22.670> of<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:22.940> rope<00:05:23.120> okay<00:05:23.810> so<00:05:24.200> we've<00:05:24.320> got<00:05:24.500> this

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
end of the rope okay so we've got this

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.680 
end of the rope okay so we've got this
tighten<00:05:25.040> it<00:05:25.100> as<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> press<00:05:25.490> six<00:05:25.670> at<00:05:25.790> one<00:05:25.970> end<00:05:26.150> and

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
tighten it as a press six at one end and

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.090 
tighten it as a press six at one end and
we'll<00:05:26.840> create<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.140> small<00:05:27.350> girth<00:05:27.620> hitch<00:05:27.830> at<00:05:28.010> the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
we'll create a small girth hitch at the

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.090 
we'll create a small girth hitch at the
other<00:05:28.250> end<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.670> then<00:05:29.150> actually<00:05:29.540> taken<00:05:29.990> to<00:05:30.170> put

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
other end and then actually taken to put

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.750 
other end and then actually taken to put
this<00:05:31.250> on<00:05:31.490> our<00:05:31.670> boot<00:05:31.910> itself<00:05:32.750> okay<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:34.520> can<00:05:34.670> do

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
this on our boot itself okay you can do

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.800 
this on our boot itself okay you can do
this<00:05:34.880> a<00:05:34.910> couple<00:05:35.210> different<00:05:35.300> ways<00:05:35.480> you<00:05:35.720> can

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
this a couple different ways you can

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.870 
this a couple different ways you can
either<00:05:35.990> tighten<00:05:36.410> it<00:05:36.470> in<00:05:36.620> just<00:05:37.340> around<00:05:37.520> your

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
either tighten it in just around your

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.500 
either tighten it in just around your
boot<00:05:38.120> like<00:05:38.870> this<00:05:39.010> okay<00:05:40.010> which<00:05:40.910> I<00:05:41.030> find<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.390> be<00:05:41.420> a

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
boot like this okay which I find to be a

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.740 
boot like this okay which I find to be a
little<00:05:41.750> bit<00:05:41.900> less<00:05:42.140> safe<00:05:42.560> than<00:05:43.390> taking<00:05:44.390> one<00:05:44.630> of

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
little bit less safe than taking one of

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.230 
little bit less safe than taking one of
these<00:05:45.160> two<00:05:46.160> parts<00:05:46.430> of<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.580> girth<00:05:46.760> hitch<00:05:47.000> and

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
these two parts of the girth hitch and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.880 
these two parts of the girth hitch and
taking<00:05:47.660> it<00:05:47.750> around<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:48.140> back<00:05:48.410> of<00:05:48.440> the<00:05:48.740> boot

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
taking it around the back of the boot

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.000 
taking it around the back of the boot
okay<00:05:49.720> if<00:05:50.720> you<00:05:50.900> create<00:05:51.170> this<00:05:51.380> type<00:05:51.650> of<00:05:51.680> thing

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
okay if you create this type of thing

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.650 
okay if you create this type of thing
it's<00:05:52.520> really<00:05:52.730> going<00:05:52.910> to<00:05:52.970> want<00:05:53.180> to<00:05:53.270> walk<00:05:53.420> in

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
it's really going to want to walk in

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.900 
it's really going to want to walk in
that<00:05:53.690> boot<00:05:54.140> and<00:05:54.590> if<00:05:54.950> your<00:05:55.160> other<00:05:55.370> ascender

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
that boot and if your other ascender

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.840 
that boot and if your other ascender
devices<00:05:56.390> were<00:05:56.540> to<00:05:56.690> fail<00:05:56.960> in<00:05:57.170> any<00:05:57.290> way<00:05:57.850> you

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
devices were to fail in any way you

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.490 
devices were to fail in any way you
would<00:05:58.970> end<00:05:59.120> up<00:05:59.210> being<00:05:59.600> inverted<00:06:00.110> but<00:06:00.260> at<00:06:00.380> least

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
would end up being inverted but at least

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.040 
would end up being inverted but at least
you<00:06:00.710> would<00:06:00.860> not<00:06:01.010> you<00:06:01.370> know<00:06:01.490> fall<00:06:01.910> in<00:06:02.870> this

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
you would not you know fall in this

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.720 
you would not you know fall in this
situation<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:03.830> you<00:06:03.920> have<00:06:04.040> your<00:06:04.190> your<00:06:04.520> boot

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
situation so you have your your boot

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.030 
situation so you have your your boot
tied<00:06:05.030> in<00:06:05.210> you<00:06:05.330> can<00:06:05.480> use<00:06:05.630> this<00:06:05.840> is<00:06:06.560> a<00:06:06.620> good<00:06:06.890> way

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
tied in you can use this is a good way

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.250 
tied in you can use this is a good way
of<00:06:07.070> you<00:06:07.970> know<00:06:08.060> assisting<00:06:08.570> you<00:06:08.720> and<00:06:08.840> ascending

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
of you know assisting you and ascending

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.810 
of you know assisting you and ascending
the<00:06:09.290> rope<00:06:09.500> and<00:06:09.740> it<00:06:10.070> gives<00:06:10.250> you<00:06:10.340> one<00:06:10.520> extra

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
the rope and it gives you one extra

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.640 
the rope and it gives you one extra
piece<00:06:11.030> of<00:06:11.210> safety<00:06:11.660> where<00:06:12.110> you're<00:06:12.230> tied<00:06:12.470> into

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
piece of safety where you're tied into

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.410 
piece of safety where you're tied into
the<00:06:12.800> rope<00:06:12.980> as<00:06:13.160> well<00:06:13.370> so<00:06:13.910> this<00:06:14.060> would<00:06:14.210> be<00:06:14.300> the

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
the rope as well so this would be the

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.980 
the rope as well so this would be the
chicken<00:06:14.690> loop<00:06:14.990> here<00:06:15.350> all<00:06:15.800> right
