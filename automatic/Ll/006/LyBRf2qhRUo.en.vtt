00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 the oven bake one of my recipes 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.540
 favorite of all time 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.480
 It is very easy to make the ingredients 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.070
 are simple and texture something 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.230
 between a cake and a pudding is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.359
 wonderful this recipe also makes 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.220
 part of my book is also in all 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.199
 the shops you can buy in your city 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 or in the virtual stores that I will leave the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.380
 link in the description for those who 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 interesting in the description also has the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.550
 written recipe link with all 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.579
 ingredients then let's make our mother 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.070
 mix in the blender or mix and two 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.620
 cans of green corn without water 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.670
 a 200 ml bottle of milk of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.480
 coco ho and half a cup of sugar 4 eggs 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 25 grams or half integers package 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.530
 grated parmesan cheese 4 tablespoons 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.530
 wheat flour soup 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.100
 at the end add a tablespoon 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.210
 of baking powder and is sufficient for 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.100
 mix 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.440
 place in a greased 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.650
 floured and bake in preheated oven 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.440
 180 degrees to the surface that fit 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.060
 I've done it so many times this time. 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.950
 recipe that over time I 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.600
 I realized that sometimes even using the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.840
 same amount of sugar 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.340
 she was sweeter - sweet then 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.340
 that I realized that some companies 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.740
 change the amount of salt that goes into 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.990
 brine where corn is preserved 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.890
 then you have more salty corn and less 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 salty 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.360
 so I changed the original recipe that 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.220
 indicated two cups of sugar to 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.869
 a cup and a half because even if she 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.670
 do not look so sweet yet she is 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.920
 I like it hotter than it is 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.690
 a lot of pain so I advise a cup and 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.810
 subject half before showing this 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.759
