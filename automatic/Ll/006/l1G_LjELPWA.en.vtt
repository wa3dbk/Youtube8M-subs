we<00:00:03.030> have<00:00:03.210> established<00:00:03.510> that<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:05.310> figure

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
we have established that in this figure

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.600 
we have established that in this figure
in<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.290> vertical<00:00:07.740> plane<00:00:09.290> points<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.380> B<00:00:10.800> C<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.340> D

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
in the vertical plane points a B C and D

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.200 
in the vertical plane points a B C and D
are<00:00:11.849> all<00:00:12.500> coplanar<00:00:13.670> meaning<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.030> all

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
are all coplanar meaning that they all

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.779 
are all coplanar meaning that they all
lie<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.660> same<00:00:15.839> plane<00:00:16.640> we<00:00:17.640> also

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
lie in the same plane we also

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.150 
lie in the same plane we also
established<00:00:18.020> that<00:00:19.020> some<00:00:19.289> lines<00:00:19.529> are<00:00:19.830> coplanar

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
established that some lines are coplanar

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.689 
established that some lines are coplanar
within<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> vertical<00:00:21.090> plane<00:00:21.410> line<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.680> B<00:00:23.189> and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
within the vertical plane line a B and

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.500 
within the vertical plane line a B and
line<00:00:24.510> ad<00:00:27.980> now<00:00:28.980> there<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> third<00:00:29.789> line<00:00:30.119> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
line ad now there is a third line that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.770 
line ad now there is a third line that
is<00:00:30.720> coplanar<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:31.679> these<00:00:32.099> two<00:00:32.340> lines<00:00:32.780> it's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
is coplanar with these two lines it's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.530 
is coplanar with these two lines it's
the<00:00:33.960> line<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.880> line<00:00:35.880> CD<00:00:37.489> line<00:00:38.489> CD<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.090> kind<00:00:39.420> of

the line here line CD line CD is kind of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.860 
the line here line CD line CD is kind of
tricky<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> understand<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:40.860> line<00:00:41.219> CD

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
tricky to understand because line CD

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.540 
tricky to understand because line CD
technically<00:00:42.870> lies<00:00:43.050> within<00:00:43.410> both<00:00:43.800> planes<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
technically lies within both planes of

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.900 
technically lies within both planes of
our<00:00:44.700> figure<00:00:45.170> line<00:00:46.170> CD<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> intersection

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
our figure line CD is the intersection

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.709 
our figure line CD is the intersection
of<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.930> vertical<00:00:49.379> plane<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:51.420> horizontal

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
of this vertical plane in the horizontal

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.200 
of this vertical plane in the horizontal
plane<00:00:52.079> down<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> line<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> B<00:00:55.860> line<00:00:56.399> ad<00:00:56.730> and

plane down here so line a B line ad and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.529 
plane down here so line a B line ad and
line<00:00:57.600> CD<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.640> coplanar<00:00:59.640> lines<00:00:59.850> within

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539

line CD are all coplanar lines within
the<00:01:00.780> vertical<00:01:01.410> plane<00:01:03.710> now<00:01:04.710> let's<00:01:04.949> examine<00:01:06.260> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the vertical plane now let's examine the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.120 
the vertical plane now let's examine the
second<00:01:07.619> plane<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.920> our<00:01:08.040> picture<00:01:12.799> this<00:01:13.799> plane

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
second plane in our picture this plane

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.830 
second plane in our picture this plane
here<00:01:19.220> we<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.400> start<00:01:20.640> off<00:01:20.759> by<00:01:20.790> saying<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
here we can start off by saying that

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.039 
here we can start off by saying that
there<00:01:22.080> are<00:01:22.200> three<00:01:22.650> coplanar<00:01:23.520> points<00:01:24.030> point<00:01:24.840> e

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
there are three coplanar points point e

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:35.480 
there are three coplanar points point e
Point<00:01:26.040> C<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> point<00:01:27.390> P<00:01:34.009> also<00:01:35.009> within<00:01:35.189> this

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
Point C and point P also within this

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
Point C and point P also within this
plane<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.689> line<00:01:36.900> CD<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.710> could

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
plane we have the line CD so we could

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.289 
plane we have the line CD so we could
say<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.720> point<00:01:45.720> E<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.820> coplanar<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:49.040> line

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
say that point E is coplanar with line

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.410 
say that point E is coplanar with line
CVS<00:01:54.170> either<00:01:55.170> one<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> those<00:01:55.710> things<00:01:56.040> are

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
CVS either one of those things are

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.909 
CVS either one of those things are
equally<00:01:57.420> correct<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.170> say<00:01:58.909> and
