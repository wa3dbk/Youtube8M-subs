pedal board here which we brought in

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.870 
pedal board here which we brought in
here<00:02:48.080> for<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.320> demonstration<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.670> like

the EP booster which is another type of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.000 
the EP booster which is another type of
clean<00:02:53.360> boost<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:53.840> an<00:02:53.960> exotic<00:02:54.260> EP<00:02:54.830> booster

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
clean boost is an exotic EP booster

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.030 
clean boost is an exotic EP booster
that's<00:02:55.370> on<00:02:55.520> my<00:02:55.640> live<00:02:55.850> pedal<00:02:56.840> board<00:02:57.080> which<00:02:57.680> kind

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
that's on my live pedal board which kind

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.130 
that's on my live pedal board which kind
of<00:02:58.190> does<00:02:58.400> up<00:02:58.700> it's<00:02:59.300> like<00:02:59.480> running<00:02:59.720> through<00:02:59.870> an

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
of does up it's like running through an

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.080 
of does up it's like running through an
Echoplex<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.890> warms<00:03:01.220> up<00:03:01.370> your<00:03:01.430> tone<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.850> little

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
Echoplex it warms up your tone a little

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.510 
Echoplex it warms up your tone a little
bit<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:03.200> gives<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.500> some<00:03:03.740> gain<00:03:04.010> but<00:03:04.400> it's

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
bit and it gives you some gain but it's

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.090 
bit and it gives you some gain but it's
still<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.760> clean<00:03:05.150> boost<00:03:05.480> but<00:03:06.290> for<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.560> purposes

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
still a clean boost but for the purposes

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.760 
still a clean boost but for the purposes
of<00:03:07.160> talking<00:03:07.760> about<00:03:08.170> recording<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.410> playing

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
of talking about recording and playing

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.030

live I've brought along my my valuable

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.640 
live I've brought along my my valuable
RC<00:03:13.460> booster<00:03:13.700> here<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.450> maybe<00:03:14.960> I'll<00:03:15.140> start<00:03:15.440> and

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
RC booster here and maybe I'll start and

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.230 
RC booster here and maybe I'll start and
demonstrate<00:03:16.160> that<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.430> little<00:03:16.760> bit<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.060> show

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240

demonstrate that a little bit and show
you<00:03:17.890> how<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:18.920> works<00:03:19.460> and<00:03:21.430> probably

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
you how that works and probably

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.700

everybody<00:03:22.670> knows<00:03:23.030> all<00:03:23.780> about<00:03:23.840> these<00:03:24.260> pedals

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
everybody knows all about these pedals

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.850 
everybody knows all about these pedals
because<00:03:24.830> everybody<00:03:25.430> has<00:03:25.700> them<00:03:25.910> but<00:03:26.860> quick

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
you're if you have a clean guitar part

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.440 
you're if you have a clean guitar part
you<00:03:34.220> know<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.640> you're<00:03:34.730> just<00:03:34.760> kind<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.180> playing

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
you know and you're just kind of playing

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:51.320 
you know and you're just kind of playing
some<00:03:35.780> kind<00:03:36.500> of

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.230 

that's<00:03:52.260> completely<00:03:52.740> clean<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.760> sounds<00:03:54.090> pretty

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
that's completely clean it sounds pretty

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.010 
that's completely clean it sounds pretty
good<00:03:54.500> but<00:03:55.500> if<00:03:56.280> I'm<00:03:56.820> going<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.120> play<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.840> want

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
good but if I'm going to play and I want

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.260 
good but if I'm going to play and I want
to<00:03:58.110> get<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.590> little<00:03:58.620> bit<00:03:59.280> more<00:03:59.730> sustain

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
to get just a little bit more sustain

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.390 
to get just a little bit more sustain
from<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.720> notes<00:04:00.960> or<00:04:01.620> sometimes<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.100> can't

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
from the notes or sometimes you can't

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.600 
from the notes or sometimes you can't
even<00:04:02.490> really<00:04:02.880> hear<00:04:03.870> what<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:04.830> doing<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.400> just

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
even really hear what it's doing it just

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.670 
even really hear what it's doing it just
feels<00:04:06.060> better<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.690> play<00:04:06.930> you've<00:04:07.110> got<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> little

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
feels better to play you've got a little

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.150 
feels better to play you've got a little
more<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.840> notes<00:04:10.110> are<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.320> little<00:04:10.440> squishier

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
more the notes are a little squishier

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.100 
more the notes are a little squishier
and<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.730> can<00:04:11.940> sustain<00:04:12.210> the<00:04:12.630> notes<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.960> little

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
and you can sustain the notes a little

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.250 
and you can sustain the notes a little
bit<00:04:13.290> longer<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:15.600> great<00:04:15.870> thing<00:04:16.110> about

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
bit longer and the great thing about

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.940 
bit longer and the great thing about
that<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.950> lets<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.540> forget<00:04:18.540> about<00:04:18.930> trying<00:04:19.739> to

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
that it lets you forget about trying to

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.610 
that it lets you forget about trying to
play<00:04:20.250> in<00:04:20.610> just<00:04:21.450> playing<00:04:21.780> because<00:04:22.110> it<00:04:22.350> feels

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
play in just playing because it feels

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.010 
play in just playing because it feels
good<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.250> if<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.460> turn<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:24.210> this<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.570> what<00:04:24.930> I'm

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
good so if I turn so this is what I'm

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.240 
good so if I turn so this is what I'm
saying<00:04:25.200> is<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.590> what<00:04:25.710> happens<00:04:26.040> when<00:04:26.190> you

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
saying is this is what happens when you

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.460 
saying is this is what happens when you
turn<00:04:26.400> on<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.610> RC<00:04:27.030> booster<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:27.870> if<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.170> turn<00:04:28.440> on

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
turn on the RC booster so if I turn on

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:45.900 
turn on the RC booster so if I turn on
my<00:04:28.650> RC<00:04:29.130> booster<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.610> just<00:04:29.970> get

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.270 

a<00:04:46.060> little<00:04:46.720> bit<00:04:46.810> more<00:04:47.020> sustained<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.800> because

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
a little bit more sustained and because

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.800 
a little bit more sustained and because
I'm<00:04:48.400> playing<00:04:48.880> through<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.030> really<00:04:49.300> small<00:04:49.540> amp

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
I'm playing through a really small amp

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.870 
I'm playing through a really small amp
that's<00:04:50.020> miked<00:04:50.320> up<00:04:50.470> in<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:51.040> other<00:04:51.160> room<00:04:51.280> it

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
that's miked up in the other room it

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.550 
that's miked up in the other room it
actually<00:04:52.330> is<00:04:52.510> giving<00:04:52.810> me<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.930> little<00:04:53.200> bit<00:04:53.440> of

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
actually is giving me a little bit of

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.280 
actually is giving me a little bit of
grit<00:04:53.860> that<00:04:54.490> sounds<00:04:54.880> good<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.330> know<00:04:55.480> so<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:59.020> can

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
grit that sounds good you know so I can

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.470 
grit that sounds good you know so I can
play<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.470> single<00:04:59.800> note<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.670> a<00:05:00.760> track<00:05:01.120> that's

play a single note and in a track that's

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.810 
play a single note and in a track that's
still<00:05:01.720> going<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.930> sound<00:05:02.170> really<00:05:02.800> clean<00:05:03.250> from

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
still going to sound really clean from

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.180 
still going to sound really clean from
playing<00:05:04.090> a<00:05:04.180> gig<00:05:04.390> on<00:05:04.540> stage<00:05:04.990> there's<00:05:05.710> bass<00:05:05.950> and

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
drums this got a little bit of grit but

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.850
