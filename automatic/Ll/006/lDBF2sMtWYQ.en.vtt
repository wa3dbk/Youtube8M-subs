 in the middle poblano priism 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.540
 but I'm going to realize it in how I'm going to look for it where it says 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.540
 the unknown gender world 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:43.140

 be here this little tutorial is all done very fast 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:28.399

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.189
 the other musicians 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.290

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.189
