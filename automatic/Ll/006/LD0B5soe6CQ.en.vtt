it's awesome but it's still a risk and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.609 
it's awesome but it's still a risk and
you<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> website<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.500> the

it<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.619> though<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.130> never<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.820> good

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
it is though it's never really a good

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
it is though it's never really a good
idea<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.140> eggs<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.710> basket

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829

takes a long time to make decisions so I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.330 
takes a long time to make decisions so I
feel<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.150> from<00:02:18.330> my<00:02:18.480> dad<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:19.340> it

goes you know it's just something that I
feel<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.080> not<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.290> good<00:02:22.440> idea<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.739> do<00:02:22.860> to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
feel like it's not a good idea to do to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.130 
feel like it's not a good idea to do to
quit<00:02:23.400> school<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.970> YouTube<00:02:24.720> matter<00:02:24.959> what

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
you're doing and this kind of goes

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.250 
you're doing and this kind of goes
people<00:02:27.120> quitting<00:02:27.360> their<00:02:27.450> job<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.930> because<00:02:28.170> you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
people quitting their job to because you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.449 
people quitting their job to because you
do<00:02:28.410> see<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.830> community<00:02:29.190> somebody

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
do see that in the community somebody

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.250 
do see that in the community somebody
will<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> job<00:02:29.910> already<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.510> then<00:02:31.050> they

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
will have a job already and then they

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.750 
will have a job already and then they
quit<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.800> YouTube<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.250> that's<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.550> as

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
quit it for YouTube and that's not as

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.759 
quit it for YouTube and that's not as
bad<00:02:32.790> because<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.930> obviously<00:02:34.080> already<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.739> a

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
bad because you obviously already have a

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.290 
bad because you obviously already have a
degree<00:02:34.950> or<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.400> have<00:02:35.519> experience<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.239> a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
degree or you have experience you have a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300 
degree or you have experience you have a
trade<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.959> then<00:02:37.440> if<00:02:37.590> anything<00:02:37.890> goes<00:02:38.040> south

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
trade and then if anything goes south

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.150 
trade and then if anything goes south
you<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:38.819> always<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.209> get<00:02:39.360> another<00:02:39.450> job<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.800> I

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
you can always just get another job so I

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.750 
you can always just get another job so I
feel<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.489> that's<00:02:41.730> probably<00:02:42.450> not<00:02:43.380> as<00:02:44.099> bad<00:02:44.580> is

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
feel like that's probably not as bad is

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.009 
feel like that's probably not as bad is
not<00:02:44.790> going<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.269> school<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:45.989> you're

couple<00:02:50.010> jobs<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:51.660> don't<00:02:51.810> really<00:02:51.959> have<00:02:52.080> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
couple jobs you don't really have a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.410 
couple jobs you don't really have a
trade<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.980> you're<00:02:53.489> just<00:02:53.730> gonna<00:02:53.819> quit<00:02:53.910> school

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
trade and you're just gonna quit school

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.150 
trade and you're just gonna quit school
it's<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:55.260> not<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.440> good<00:02:55.500> idea<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:56.010> my<00:02:56.130> opinion

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
it's just not a good idea in my opinion

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.300 
it's just not a good idea in my opinion
and<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.330> still<00:02:57.510> weird<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:58.019> me<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:59.069> think

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
and it's still weird to me that to think

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.400 
and it's still weird to me that to think
that<00:02:59.489> somebody<00:02:59.730> would<00:03:00.110> would<00:03:01.110> do<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.349> to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
that somebody would would do that to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.080 
that somebody would would do that to
give<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.799> up<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:02.910> not<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> good

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
give that up and I it's just not a good

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.670 
give that up and I it's just not a good
idea<00:03:03.269> in<00:03:03.630> my<00:03:03.720> opinion<00:03:03.750> like<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.319> said<00:03:04.530> some

idea in my opinion like I said some

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.229 
idea in my opinion like I said some
