00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.420 
you can see the attention to detail
let's<00:02:26.660> compare<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.160> original<00:02:28.160> twelve

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
let's compare this to original twelve

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.759 
let's compare this to original twelve
twelve<00:02:28.970> back<00:02:29.150> figure<00:02:29.840> for<00:02:30.019> making<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.380> me<00:02:30.500> and

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
twelve back figure for making to me and

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.370 
twelve back figure for making to me and
this<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.000> c-3po<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.959> can<00:02:33.049> see<00:02:33.200> how<00:02:33.260> much

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
this is c-3po you can see how much

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.410 
this is c-3po you can see how much
bigger<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.950> figure<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.430> mean<00:02:34.640> it's<00:02:35.150> huge

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
bigger the figure is I mean it's huge

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.270 
bigger the figure is I mean it's huge
but<00:02:35.690> looking<00:02:36.350> at<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.620> kind<00:02:36.799> of<00:02:36.890> doomed<00:02:37.100> out

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
but looking at it kind of doomed out

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.890 
but looking at it kind of doomed out
it's<00:02:37.819> hard<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.150> compare<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:38.510> size<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.780> so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
it's hard to compare the size and so

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.720 
it's hard to compare the size and so
I'll<00:02:39.200> put<00:02:39.230> up<00:02:39.410> there<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.799> as<00:02:39.890> far<00:02:40.069> as<00:02:40.130> size

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
I'll put up there and as far as size

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.340 
I'll put up there and as far as size
comparison<00:02:41.209> goes<00:02:41.359> you<00:02:41.780> see<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:41.989> attach<00:02:42.230> a

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
comparison goes you see the attach a

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.690 
comparison goes you see the attach a
detail<00:02:42.680> though<00:02:42.829> they<00:02:42.980> have<00:02:43.100> everything<00:02:43.370> from

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
detail though they have everything from

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.699 
detail though they have everything from
this<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.630> four<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:44.959> up<00:02:45.049> this<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.290> forty<00:02:45.680> nine

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
this is four and up this is forty nine

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.069 
this is four and up this is forty nine
up<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.160> they<00:02:46.280> changed<00:02:46.609> the<00:02:46.640> age<00:02:47.209> there<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.989> had

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
up so they changed the age there you had

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.990 
up so they changed the age there you had
the<00:02:48.109> price<00:02:48.440> hit<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.799> number<00:02:49.069> there<00:02:49.250> even<00:02:49.940> in

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
the price hit the number there even in

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.849 
the price hit the number there even in
the<00:02:50.090> bottom<00:02:50.390> corner<00:02:50.750> right<00:02:50.900> corner<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.680> both

with some package but I think it's a
really<00:03:40.989> good<00:03:41.139> job<00:03:41.489> packaging<00:03:42.489> but<00:03:42.609> you<00:03:42.669> can

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
really good job packaging but you can

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.099 
really good job packaging but you can
actually<00:03:42.849> open<00:03:43.000> take<00:03:43.329> off<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.689> shell<00:03:43.900> here

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
actually open take off the shell here
