00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.469
 able for example to create pizzas 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.089
 in space with a certain advantage 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.129
 the conservation of food inks 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.570
 could go up to 30 years and 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.339

 childbirth is like it's like 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.550

 birth is not uncommon in China 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.500
 because of the child's politics 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.500
 unique

 there is no bias in the study as 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.710
 they say because they are men of 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.930
 18 to 22 years so it could not be 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.000
 age who were incriminated for example 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.130
