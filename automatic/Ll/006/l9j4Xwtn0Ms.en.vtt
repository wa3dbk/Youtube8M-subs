00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
pretty close together we're not being

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.260 
pretty close together we're not being
too<00:00:45.320> specific<00:00:45.470> on<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.070> but<00:00:46.910> that's<00:00:47.060> sort<00:00:47.180> of

too specific on it but that's sort of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.300 
too specific on it but that's sort of
the<00:00:47.390> channel<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.260> we're<00:00:48.710> a<00:00:48.740> little<00:00:48.980> bit<00:00:49.160> more

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
the channel so we're a little bit more

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.400 
the channel so we're a little bit more
advanced<00:00:49.790> technology<00:00:50.450> wise<00:00:50.600> than<00:00:50.960> was<00:00:51.290> in

updated<00:00:53.420> a<00:00:53.450> little<00:00:53.480> bit<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.840> weapons<00:00:54.170> a

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
updated a little bit the weapons a

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.600 
updated a little bit the weapons a
little<00:00:54.740> bit<00:00:54.830> better<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.070> motion<00:00:55.310> Drucker's<00:00:55.580> a

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
little bit better the motion Drucker's a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.450 
little bit better the motion Drucker's a
little<00:00:55.790> bit<00:00:55.880> better<00:00:56.530> but<00:00:57.530> we're<00:00:58.040> not<00:00:58.160> taking

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
little bit better but we're not taking

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.250 
little bit better but we're not taking
it<00:00:58.550> too<00:00:58.640> far<00:00:58.670> ahead<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.330> so<00:00:59.900> we're<00:01:00.020> not<00:01:00.080> sort

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
it too far ahead and so we're not sort

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.470 
it too far ahead and so we're not sort
of<00:01:00.320> into<00:01:00.530> resurrection<00:01:01.160> instead<00:01:01.640> but<00:01:02.150> the

you've<00:01:12.259> still<00:01:12.439> got<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.770> basic<00:01:13.189> stare<00:01:13.429> you've

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
you've still got the basic stare you've

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.179 
you've still got the basic stare you've
got<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.999> the<00:01:14.240> main<00:01:14.749> trunk<00:01:15.289> of<00:01:15.499> the<00:01:15.649> story<00:01:15.950> is

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
got the the main trunk of the story is

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.249 
got the the main trunk of the story is
the<00:01:16.460> marine<00:01:16.850> story<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.350> then<00:01:18.530> your<00:01:20.049> alien<00:01:21.049> and

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
the marine story and then your alien and

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.349 
the marine story and then your alien and
predator<00:01:21.649> campaigns<00:01:22.399> kind<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:22.909> interlink

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
predator campaigns kind of interlink

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.239 
predator campaigns kind of interlink
with<00:01:23.569> that<00:01:23.749> so<00:01:24.049> if<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.499> play<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.890> game<00:01:25.039> as<00:01:25.219> a

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
with that so if you play the game as a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:28.020 
with that so if you play the game as a
marine<00:01:25.549> and<00:01:25.789> then<00:01:26.539> as<00:01:26.689> an<00:01:26.810> alien<00:01:27.170> you'll<00:01:27.530> see

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
marine and then as an alien you'll see

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.999 
marine and then as an alien you'll see
bits<00:01:29.030> as<00:01:29.299> an<00:01:29.539> alien<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:30.319> were<00:01:30.619> attacked

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
bits as an alien that you were attacked

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.669 
bits as an alien that you were attacked
by<00:01:31.569> playing<00:01:32.569> as<00:01:32.749> the<00:01:32.780> marine<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.380> it'll<00:01:33.530> go

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
by playing as the marine and it'll go

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.129 
by playing as the marine and it'll go
wow<00:01:34.039> that's<00:01:34.340> how<00:01:34.639> the<00:01:34.700> aliens<00:01:35.149> got<00:01:35.329> to<00:01:35.509> me<00:01:35.630> you

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.139 
wow that's how the aliens got to me you

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.109 
wow that's how the aliens got to me you
know<00:01:36.229> it'll<00:01:36.409> kind<00:01:36.649> of<00:01:36.740> explain<00:01:37.549> a<00:01:37.579> bit<00:01:37.819> for<00:01:38.090> the

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
know it'll kind of explain a bit for the

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.109 
know it'll kind of explain a bit for the
marine<00:01:38.389> story<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.170> whole<00:01:40.069> thing<00:01:40.579> is<00:01:40.850> is

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
marine story so the whole thing is is

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.039 
marine story so the whole thing is is
one<00:01:41.600> game<00:01:41.990> interlinked<00:01:42.859> if<00:01:43.069> you<00:01:43.429> like<00:01:43.579> it

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
one game interlinked if you like it

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.239 
one game interlinked if you like it
you'll<00:01:45.049> get<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.380> best<00:01:45.560> out<00:01:45.770> of<00:01:45.799> game<00:01:46.069> if<00:01:46.219> you

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249 
you'll get the best out of game if you

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:48.489 
you'll get the best out of game if you
play<00:01:46.490> all<00:01:46.729> three<00:01:47.240> species<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:48.200> game<00:01:48.350> it's

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
play all three species the game it's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.349 
play all three species the game it's
obviously<00:01:48.859> very<00:01:49.069> challenging<00:01:49.700> but<00:01:50.209> the

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
obviously very challenging but the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.459 
obviously very challenging but the
actual<00:01:50.630> mechanics<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.139> we're<00:01:51.319> developing

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
actual mechanics that we're developing

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.020 
actual mechanics that we're developing
to<00:01:52.310> make<00:01:53.209> each<00:01:53.389> species<00:01:54.130> feel<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.459> black

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
to make each species feel and black

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.699 
to make each species feel and black
players<00:01:56.299> maximize<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.079> benefit<00:01:57.469> of<00:01:57.499> each

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
players maximize the benefit of each

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.590 
players maximize the benefit of each
species<00:01:57.950> we're<00:01:58.609> really<00:01:58.759> focusing<00:01:59.179> on<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.420> so

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
species we're really focusing on that so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.819 
species we're really focusing on that so
with<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.869> predator<00:02:00.229> we've<00:02:00.380> got<00:02:00.499> like<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.619> fuck

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
with the predator we've got like a fuck

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.919 
with the predator we've got like a fuck
asleep<00:02:01.189> where<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.729> can<00:02:01.850> basically<00:02:01.999> pick<00:02:02.719> any

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
asleep where you can basically pick any

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.090 
asleep where you can basically pick any
point<00:02:03.079> in<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.319> environment<00:02:03.529> and<00:02:03.799> just<00:02:03.950> leap

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
point in the environment and just leap

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.340 
point in the environment and just leap
straight<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.609> it<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.270> we've<00:02:05.539> solved<00:02:06.200> the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
straight to it so we've solved the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.680 
straight to it so we've solved the
inherent<00:02:07.100> issue<00:02:07.219> of<00:02:07.429> how<00:02:08.030> difficult<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.569> is<00:02:08.600> to

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
inherent issue of how difficult it is to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.190 
inherent issue of how difficult it is to
accurately<00:02:08.899> jump<00:02:09.470> somewhere<00:02:09.860> in<00:02:09.950> a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and a first-person shooter because it's

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.540 
and a first-person shooter because it's
not<00:02:12.959> about<00:02:13.200> making<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.830> specific<00:02:14.250> Jim<00:02:14.400> we're

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
not about making that specific Jim we're

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.130 
not about making that specific Jim we're
not<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> platform<00:02:15.120> game<00:02:15.150> we're<00:02:15.660> again<00:02:15.900> where

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
not a platform game we're again where

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.040 
not a platform game we're again where
it's<00:02:16.379> about<00:02:16.590> being<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.040> trees<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.790> about

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
it's about being in the trees it's about

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.479 
it's about being in the trees it's about
stalking<00:02:19.050> your<00:02:19.319> prey<00:02:19.410> waiting<00:02:20.160> for<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> right

moment to strike and then as a Marine

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.800 
moment to strike and then as a Marine
it's<00:02:23.250> about<00:02:23.370> adding<00:02:24.269> light<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
it's about adding light to the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.350 
it's about adding light to the
environment<00:02:25.050> creating<00:02:25.769> my<00:02:26.060> looking<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.239> those

shadows<00:02:27.750> cloning<00:02:28.440> flow<00:02:28.620> into<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.040> checking

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
shadows cloning flow into it checking

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.370

checking<00:02:29.790> those<00:02:30.239> corners<00:02:30.630> see<00:02:31.140> if<00:02:31.260> there's

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
checking those corners see if there's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.050 
checking those corners see if there's
any<00:02:31.530> aliens<00:02:31.920> working<00:02:32.370> wanting<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> bite<00:02:32.940> your

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
know the balance between the three

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.729 
know the balance between the three
that's<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.360> kind<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.660> difficult<00:02:49.260> thing<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.530> do

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
that's a kind of difficult thing to do

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.620 
that's a kind of difficult thing to do
especially<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.340> multiplayer<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:51.450> you

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
especially in multiplayer have you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.630 
especially in multiplayer have you

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
worked a lot with her well in the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.520 
worked a lot with her well in the
original<00:02:53.790> what<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.360> did<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.660> we<00:02:54.690> bias<00:02:55.319> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
original what we did is we bias the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.830 
original what we did is we bias the
points<00:02:55.920> because<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.030> can't<00:02:57.269> really<00:02:57.540> make<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
points because you can't really make a

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.920 
points because you can't really make a
week<00:02:58.110> predator<00:02:58.650> or<00:02:59.190> pathetic<00:03:00.030> alien<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.720> just

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
week predator or pathetic alien it just

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.979 
week predator or pathetic alien it just
isn't<00:03:01.230> right<00:03:01.819> they<00:03:02.819> are<00:03:02.970> tough<00:03:03.360> creatures<00:03:03.810> so

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
isn't right they are tough creatures so

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.569 
isn't right they are tough creatures so
because<00:03:04.620> we're<00:03:04.739> working<00:03:05.010> with<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.160> license

those<00:03:50.400> are<00:03:50.609> very<00:03:50.700> very<00:03:50.940> challenging<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:51.600> it's

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
those are very very challenging so it's

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.849 
those are very very challenging so it's
not<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:53.120> slugging<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.180> out

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
not just the slugging it out

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.470

although there is that mode in there

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.550 
although there is that mode in there
you've<00:03:59.519> got<00:03:59.720> species<00:04:00.720> deathmatch<00:04:01.139> and<00:04:01.470> you've

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
you've got species deathmatch and you've

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.289 
you've got species deathmatch and you've

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
composed of different types you can have

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.129 
composed of different types you can have
a<00:04:05.519> predator<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.180> alien<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.599> a<00:04:06.660> marine<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.079> the

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
a predator and alien and a marine in the

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.580 
a predator and alien and a marine in the
team<00:04:07.380> against<00:04:08.280> another<00:04:09.019> predator<00:04:10.019> alien<00:04:10.500> a

team against another predator alien a

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.849 
team against another predator alien a
marine<00:04:10.829> team<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.730> that's<00:04:11.880> kind<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.150> nice<00:04:12.799> so<00:04:13.799> we

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
marine team so that's kind of nice so we

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.470 
marine team so that's kind of nice so we
sort<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.069> balance<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.459> out<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.790> way<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.359> can

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
sort of balance it out that way you can

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.120 
sort of balance it out that way you can
bias<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.930> scoring<00:04:16.380> as<00:04:16.500> well<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:16.979> could

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
bias the scoring as well so you could

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.800 
bias the scoring as well so you could
say<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.820> know<00:04:17.910> if<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.060> take<00:04:18.239> down<00:04:18.390> a<00:04:18.450> fully

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
say you know if you take down a fully

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.240 
say you know if you take down a fully
armored<00:04:19.169> predator<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:19.739> get<00:04:19.890> more<00:04:20.010> points

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
armored predator you get more points

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.320 
armored predator you get more points
that<00:04:20.489> if<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.640> take<00:04:20.789> down

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
that if you take down

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.100 
that if you take down
an<00:04:22.689> alien<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:24.509> different<00:04:25.509> people<00:04:25.900> love

it<00:04:28.330> also<00:04:28.479> sort<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.870> depends<00:04:29.169> on<00:04:29.259> what<00:04:29.409> mood

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
it also sort of depends on what mood

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.499 
it also sort of depends on what mood
you're<00:04:29.710> in<00:04:29.830> as<00:04:29.979> well<00:04:30.129> as<00:04:30.310> you're<00:04:30.490> in<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.669> moving

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
this sort of cooperative team you know a

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.550 
this sort of cooperative team you know a
bunch<00:04:45.639> of<00:04:45.789> Marines<00:04:45.939> trying<00:04:46.689> to<00:04:46.840> survive<00:04:47.139> then

I<00:04:47.770> find<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.460> marine<00:04:48.729> gameplay<00:04:48.909> the<00:04:49.360> most

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
I find the marine gameplay the most

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.959 
I find the marine gameplay the most
easily<00:04:49.930> understood<00:04:50.620> there's<00:04:51.490> let's<00:04:51.669> face<00:04:51.819> it

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:51.969 
easily understood there's let's face it

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:53.879 
easily understood there's let's face it
how<00:04:52.090> many<00:04:52.150> games<00:04:52.419> have<00:04:52.629> had<00:04:53.050> colonial<00:04:53.650> Marines

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
how many games have had colonial Marines

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.830 
how many games have had colonial Marines
in<00:04:54.129> them<00:04:54.400> but<00:04:54.819> haven't<00:04:54.940> caught<00:04:55.270> them<00:04:55.389> colonial

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
in them but haven't caught them colonial

in them but haven't caught them colonial
Marines<00:04:56.080> I<00:04:56.259> mean<00:04:56.409> it's<00:04:56.560> probably<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.889> most

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
Marines I mean it's probably the most

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.760

in history in terms of gameplay we are

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.570 
in history in terms of gameplay we are
making<00:05:03.789> a<00:05:04.150> violent<00:05:04.659> adult<00:05:05.219> aggressive<00:05:06.219> game

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
making a violent adult aggressive game

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.909 
making a violent adult aggressive game
that<00:05:07.180> probably<00:05:07.509> won't<00:05:07.900> get<00:05:08.080> sold<00:05:08.349> in<00:05:08.500> Germany

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.490 
that probably won't get sold in Germany
I<00:05:09.460> can't<00:05:10.360> imagine<00:05:10.629> how<00:05:10.780> one<00:05:10.990> would<00:05:11.169> get<00:05:11.319> past

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
I can't imagine how one would get past

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.800 
I can't imagine how one would get past

Uranus in inter species war so we've

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.170 
Uranus in inter species war so we've
we've<00:05:26.529> taken<00:05:26.770> all<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.190> ideas<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:27.610> we<00:05:27.969> had

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
we've taken all the ideas that we had

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.300 
we've taken all the ideas that we had
when<00:05:28.419> try<00:05:28.599> to<00:05:28.659> put<00:05:28.870> in<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.050> original<00:05:29.310> and

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
when try to put in the original and

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.649 
when try to put in the original and
we've<00:05:30.729> gone<00:05:30.909> further<00:05:31.210> obviously<00:05:31.599> the

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
we've gone further obviously the

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.089 
we've gone further obviously the
graphics<00:05:32.050> are<00:05:32.169> better<00:05:32.199> the<00:05:32.500> engines<00:05:32.800> better

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
graphics are better the engines better

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.809 
graphics are better the engines better
the<00:05:34.029> game<00:05:34.240> is<00:05:34.449> more<00:05:34.949> sophisticated<00:05:35.949> the

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
the game is more sophisticated the

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.740 
the game is more sophisticated the
storytelling<00:05:37.979> components<00:05:38.979> are<00:05:39.389> richer<00:05:40.389> and

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
storytelling components are richer and

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.570 
storytelling components are richer and
deeper<00:05:41.400> take<00:05:42.400> these<00:05:42.610> sort<00:05:42.849> of<00:05:42.909> the<00:05:43.449> franchise

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
deeper take these sort of the franchise

00:05:44.580 --> 00:06:05.540 
deeper take these sort of the franchise
expand<00:05:45.580> it

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550
