00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.759

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.049

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:38.970
 hard not suitable not suitable so 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:48.370
 no, it doesnâ€™t fit and now we are talking 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:50.530
 wait a second now sorry sorry 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.200

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.380
 opened let's see what he has 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.380
 inside 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:19.090
 this one is some kind of fatal frankly 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.430
 for the taste of the stew seems to have it all 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.690
 feel 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.420
 so how about me really 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.080
 dohera 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.270
 as for me white fat should also be 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.570
 in the second pieces should be visible 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:45.840
 cast but here it's still not clear 50 on 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.989
 50 but well done 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.530
 Belarus 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:56.680
 and still a stew for 100 rubles too 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.160
 It would cocks here somehow falls 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.970
 survive 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:08.760
 interrupt before the meat is full on fat 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.760
 white should be like me 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:22.909
 so thank you all for your attention stew 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:26.739
 sense only Belarusian well there is not 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:34.329
 somewhere made by belarus on 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:38.720
 stew really good but but for 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:45.349
 the fact that there is no white is hot and the fact that it is not 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:47.569
 cash pieces aren't like that for me 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:54.010
 excellent stew but i am the same buying 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:59.139

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.139
