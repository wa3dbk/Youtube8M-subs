00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
39 degrees a couple of minutes ago but

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.820 
39 degrees a couple of minutes ago but
roughly<00:01:24.120> about<00:01:24.210> 40<00:01:24.660> degrees<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.470> know<00:01:25.560> but

this<00:01:25.980> was<00:01:26.220> down<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.820> 38<00:01:27.210> degrees<00:01:27.510> before

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this was down to like 38 degrees before

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
this was down to like 38 degrees before
and<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:28.830> what<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.220> was<00:01:29.370> advertised<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and that's what it was advertised the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
and that's what it was advertised the
deal<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> highest<00:01:30.780> setting<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
deal on the highest setting so if you

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.830 
deal on the highest setting so if you
were<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.580> put<00:01:32.760> like<00:01:32.910> say<00:01:33.150> another<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.660> two

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
were to put like say another like two

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.330 
were to put like say another like two
ice<00:01:34.020> packs<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.980> would<00:01:35.160> definitely

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
ice packs in there it would definitely

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.530 
ice packs in there it would definitely
bring<00:01:35.730> it<00:01:35.880> down<00:01:36.030> even<00:01:36.300> more

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
bring it down even more

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.810 
bring it down even more
the<00:01:37.200> cooling<00:01:37.710> element<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> all<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.700> in

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the cooling element is all the way in

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490 
the cooling element is all the way in
the<00:01:38.940> back<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.600> top<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.260> there's<00:01:40.410> a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the back on the top and then there's a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.660 
the back on the top and then there's a
little<00:01:40.740> bit<00:01:40.830> of<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.010> shelf<00:01:41.310> where<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
little bit of a shelf where the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.740 
little bit of a shelf where the
compressor<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.240> hidden<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.750> back<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:44.750> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
compressor is hidden in the back so it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
compressor is hidden in the back so it
could<00:01:45.870> certainly<00:01:46.080> stay<00:01:46.470> down<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.010> high

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
could certainly stay down in the high

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.090 
could certainly stay down in the high
