00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.149
 no 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.599
 at 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.800
 Hello everyone 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.720
 by their side of his client in the world 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.820
 it's a field of wheat reading to be harvested not very long 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.360
 2 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.310
 first hitch 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.310
 first water holes jules currency any ambiguity 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.360
 so it's really more 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.420
 it's obviously an old 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.420
 but will also be soho 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.250
 it's a sonotone is completed 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.950
 good a notch hours 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.870
 who's here 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.870
 I think yes she is old enough 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.840
 that's what killed the brain 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.180
 great cleaning 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.560
 so this is the first hike after a strong to an end and kate 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.910
 the next fifteen minutes I still believe 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.050
 it could in money 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.050
 I 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.730
 that I picked up the runner from the Isle of Man 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.130
 in my 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.950
 so I continued 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.070
 and then here I am proud I found it interesting 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.320
 I wanted to show 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.320
 so see you later 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.739
 new its new currency 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.179
 after 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.179
 in the light of the whole 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:29.719
 his saga men the module s accentuates the napoleon 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.899
 for laurent 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.899
 to see what it gives to cleaning 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.279
 this time I see 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.279
 at 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.079
 we see nothing in fact 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.249
 to try to pay for it too much and we'll see what happens to these areas 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.959
 if she is beautiful 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.779
 I am happy 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.729
 everyone that I will show them actually the coach of the blues in 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.049
 the water 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.049
 I still wonder if they are all 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.319
 final illegible I would say 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.339
 I think 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.339
 I am like that side at the end of video or photo co 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.739
 it's a shame because it's good in usb 2 the world 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.769
 for a good cleaning I continue 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.089
 it's long khouribga 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.089
 see you later 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.079
 target is a moment together without trovoada reinforcement 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.859
 this is good 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.909
 why a quarter of an hour half an hour before for them 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.909
 the association 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.359
 and it is precisely on this post 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.359
 these currencies 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.079
 the investigator at torreon potions 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.150
 I have trouble 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.889
 10 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:42.809
 okay 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:45.699
 facing reactions 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.460
 I think it was 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.520
 a tournament denier or 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.969
 so we always put in shape 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.969
 we know 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.159
 we refer to nothing 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.789
 it's a bar of soap 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:10.569
 the continuity 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.979
 I will not stop during the Papandreou game 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.529
 the pressure on 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:16.620
 borges 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.620
 worth to rescue 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.139
 in the art of covering oneself 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.629
 the following 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.439
 the weirdoids 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.249
 it's weird 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.249
 but since the film is in question 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.219
 I'm not too much to linger about this stay takes an hour 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:50.919
 inter milan 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.269
 the hard chemical action I learned nothing and I can still there 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.770
 so 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.449
 I take a hand him 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.599
 snow the sides but I'll see if any more finds 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.830
 ask for other assignments 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.080
 a plot as a source 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.240
 There are others 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.030
 could I continue more 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.460
 I'm going to miss soon so 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.119
 it's something to make you see 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:19.139
 and then if not I go back I'll clean the three men were found 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.539
 pm 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.669
 and then how is it safe? 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.110
 I will be the detour 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.229
 for 100 e yes I also meant was held while I think about it 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.229
 a little message in e 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.039
 poutine only about him 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:45.439
 according to it's so that 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:47.639
 then 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.800
 I find it weird that at the moment so much water by more than social 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.759
 on the Internet 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:59.020
 because it was still someone who is a lot of books 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.029
 many ignore it 

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:05.309
 on detection he was director I believe in the country 

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:06.399
 2 

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:09.539
 for the time there was robustness plus a few weeks after aurÃ©lie 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:10.889
 texier have I believe 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:11.819
 others 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.309
 I do not know what it is 

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:17.169
 had written them a book on la rochelle que be of rossillon 

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:22.329
 in normandy the only this fragment the writings by iran does 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.310
 blair so he died 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.249
 2 the subject in the loiret 

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:31.559
 she will play it is a little thomas I do because my darling 

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:34.629
 pity that we hear no more about this fund than this canton in which 

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:35.569
 that important 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:37.419
 in the middle of the detection 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:39.680
 locke 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.910
 the left continues the pills the oci lamented a bath I mean to the 

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.360
 next exit
