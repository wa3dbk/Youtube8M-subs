breast<00:01:34.900> on<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.530> bone<00:01:35.740> or<00:01:36.400> what<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:36.820> can<00:01:36.970> do<00:01:37.180> is

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
breast on the bone or what you can do is

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.870 
breast on the bone or what you can do is
you<00:01:37.780> can<00:01:38.020> take<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.710> breast<00:01:38.920> off<00:01:39.159> first<00:01:39.670> we're

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
you can take the breast off first we're

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.310 
you can take the breast off first we're
going<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.119> start<00:01:40.390> with<00:01:40.570> keeping<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.110> breast

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
going to start with keeping the breast

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.289 
going to start with keeping the breast
on<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.590> carcass<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:42.250> you<00:01:42.580> want<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:42.970> take<00:01:43.150> your

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
on the carcass so you want to take your

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.660 
on the carcass so you want to take your
fork<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:44.200> can<00:01:44.229> stick<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:44.979> like<00:01:45.189> that<00:01:45.369> or

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
fork you can stick it in like that or

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.100 
fork you can stick it in like that or
you<00:01:45.820> could<00:01:45.970> just<00:01:46.000> push<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:46.630> along<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.960> edge

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
you could just push it along the edge

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.109 
you could just push it along the edge
it's<00:01:47.409> mostly<00:01:47.710> just<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.100> stabilize<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.880> bird

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
it's mostly just to stabilize the bird

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's mostly just to stabilize the bird
and<00:01:49.360> then<00:01:49.930> you're<00:01:50.110> just<00:01:50.229> going<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.590> slice

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
and then you're just going to slice

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.550 
and then you're just going to slice
straight<00:01:51.280> down<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:52.330> as<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.810> get<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.110> slices

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
straight down and as you get the slices

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.350 
straight down and as you get the slices
you<00:01:53.979> can<00:01:54.130> put<00:01:54.310> them<00:01:54.430> right<00:01:54.700> onto<00:01:54.909> your<00:01:55.119> platter

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
you can put them right onto your platter

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.300 
you can put them right onto your platter
but<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.930> problem<00:01:56.380> with<00:01:56.500> that<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:56.799> you<00:01:56.830> can<00:01:57.070> see

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
but the problem with that is you can see

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.910 
but the problem with that is you can see
right<00:01:57.820> here<00:01:58.150> it<00:01:58.479> falls<00:01:58.840> apart<00:01:59.229> more<00:01:59.470> easily

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
right here it falls apart more easily

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.080 
right here it falls apart more easily
because<00:02:00.220> you're<00:02:00.369> cutting<00:02:00.729> with<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.060> grain

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
because you're cutting with the grain

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.700 
because you're cutting with the grain
and<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.810> you're<00:02:01.960> going<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.200> end<00:02:02.409> up<00:02:02.590> with

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
and so you're going to end up with

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.950 
and so you're going to end up with
smaller<00:02:03.100> pieces<00:02:03.430> like<00:02:03.610> this<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.659> you'll<00:02:04.780> just

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
smaller pieces like this and you'll just

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.570 
smaller pieces like this and you'll just
keep<00:02:05.140> right<00:02:05.409> on<00:02:05.439> going<00:02:05.560> until<00:02:06.009> you<00:02:06.220> get<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
keep right on going until you get to the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.279 
keep right on going until you get to the
breastbone<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.600> don't<00:02:07.780> have<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:07.990> worry<00:02:08.170> about

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
breastbone you don't have to worry about

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.379 
breastbone you don't have to worry about
going<00:02:08.709> all<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.220> way<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.549> bone<00:02:09.759> that's<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:10.389 
going all the way to the bone that's the

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.179 
going all the way to the bone that's the
meat<00:02:10.599> that<00:02:10.719> you<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:10.989> say<00:02:11.260> for<00:02:11.529> your<00:02:11.620> leftovers

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:12.189 
meat that you can say for your leftovers

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:13.150 
meat that you can say for your leftovers
for<00:02:12.430> making<00:02:12.760> south

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
for making south

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.670 
for making south
or<00:02:13.340> sandwiches<00:02:13.880> or<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.600> use<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.990> suit<00:02:15.230> now

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
or sandwiches or to use in a suit now

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.990 
or sandwiches or to use in a suit now
I'm<00:02:15.770> going<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.070> show<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> other<00:02:16.550> method

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
I'm going to show you the other method

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.940 
I'm going to show you the other method
of<00:02:17.180> slicing<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.230> breasts<00:02:18.440> which<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.830> to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
of slicing the breasts which is to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.550 
of slicing the breasts which is to
remove<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.490> breast<00:02:19.760> from<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.870> carcass<00:02:21.290> so

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
remove the breast from the carcass so

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.100 
remove the breast from the carcass so
I'm<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.310> going<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.520> turn<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.970> around<00:02:23.120> I'm

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
I'm just going to turn this around I'm

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.890 
I'm just going to turn this around I'm
going<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.440> grab<00:02:24.980> hold<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:26.000> leg<00:02:26.210> with<00:02:26.720> my

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
going to grab hold of the leg with my

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.650 
going to grab hold of the leg with my
fork<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.410> then<00:02:28.010> slice<00:02:28.370> into<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.880> skin<00:02:29.270> until

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
fork and then slice into the skin until

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.490 
fork and then slice into the skin until
I<00:02:29.810> find<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.380> opening<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:33.020> we<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.350> that

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
I find that opening so we have that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.040 
I find that opening so we have that
separated<00:02:34.250> now<00:02:34.880> we<00:02:34.940> can<00:02:35.210> cut<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.570> breast<00:02:35.810> off

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
separated now we can cut the breast off

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.020 
separated now we can cut the breast off
find<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.800> breast<00:02:37.010> bone<00:02:37.190> which<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.580> just<00:02:37.790> going

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
find the breast bone which is just going

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.760 
find the breast bone which is just going
to<00:02:38.120> be<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:38.390> line<00:02:38.780> right<00:02:39.050> down<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.290> center<00:02:39.440> of

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
to be the line right down the center of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.230 
to be the line right down the center of
the<00:02:39.980> bird<00:02:40.160> we're<00:02:40.490> going<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:40.970> start

the bird we're going to just start
slicing<00:02:41.570> right<00:02:41.990> in<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.380> don't<00:02:42.560> necessarily

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
slicing right in you don't necessarily

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.280 
slicing right in you don't necessarily
need<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.340> get<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.730> full<00:02:44.060> breast<00:02:44.390> off<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:45.080> there

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
need to get the full breast off of there

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.900 
need to get the full breast off of there
it's<00:02:45.470> okay<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.860> leave<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.130> little<00:02:46.370> bit<00:02:46.490> of<00:02:46.700> meat

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
it's okay to leave a little bit of meat

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.060 
it's okay to leave a little bit of meat
on<00:02:46.940> now<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.840> have<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.200> breast<00:02:48.410> grab

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
on now that you have the breast grab

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.860 
on now that you have the breast grab
hold<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.520> with<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.670> fork<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.120> just<00:02:50.600> slice

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
hold of it with a fork and just slice

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.190 
hold of it with a fork and just slice
and<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> much<00:02:52.280> neater<00:02:52.610> slice<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.930> meat

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and this is a much neater slice the meat

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.050 
and this is a much neater slice the meat
will<00:02:54.410> stay<00:02:54.680> together<00:02:54.950> much<00:02:55.460> better<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:56.030> you

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
will stay together much better and you

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.060 
will stay together much better and you
get<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.600> little<00:02:56.900> bit<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.110> crispy<00:02:57.350> skin<00:02:57.770> with

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.100 
get a little bit of crispy skin with
each<00:02:58.190> slice<00:02:58.520> now<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.660> whole<00:02:59.810> thing<00:03:00.080> is

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
each slice now that the whole thing is

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.230 
each slice now that the whole thing is
slice<00:03:00.470> just<00:03:00.950> slide<00:03:01.250> your<00:03:01.280> knife<00:03:01.580> right
