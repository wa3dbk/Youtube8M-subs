these<00:00:54.510> purely<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> moment<00:00:56.219> I've

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
these purely because at the moment I've

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.770 
these purely because at the moment I've
been<00:00:56.370> using<00:00:56.670> non-lethal<00:00:57.120> kill<00:00:57.480> streets

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
been using non-lethal kill streets

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.000 
been using non-lethal kill streets
throughout<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.170> entirety<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.800> account

throughout the entirety of this account

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.220 
throughout the entirety of this account
almost<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.579> her<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.090> about<00:01:00.270> ten<00:01:00.870> percent

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
almost I think her for about ten percent

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
almost I think her for about ten percent
of<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.379> games<00:01:01.739> ten<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.219> fifteen<00:01:02.520> percent<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.879> my

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
of my games ten to fifteen percent of my

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.359 
of my games ten to fifteen percent of my
games<00:01:03.149> I've<00:01:03.359> been<00:01:03.510> using<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.500> lethal<00:01:05.189> kill

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
games I've been using the lethal kill

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.710 
games I've been using the lethal kill
streaks<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> rest<00:01:06.210> I've<00:01:06.390> been<00:01:06.540> using

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
streaks and for the rest I've been using

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.539 
streaks and for the rest I've been using
non-lethal<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.560> why<00:01:07.710> my<00:01:08.250> kid<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
non-lethal so that's why my kid is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.429 
non-lethal so that's why my kid is
slightly<00:01:08.909> low<00:01:09.180> well<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.659> lower<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.320> know

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
slightly low well not lower but you know

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.710 
slightly low well not lower but you know
lower<00:01:10.680> than<00:01:10.890> white<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.640> imagine<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
lower than white will be I imagine that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.690 
lower than white will be I imagine that
I<00:01:12.750> will<00:01:13.080> actually<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> around<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> 5.5

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I will actually get that to around a 5.5

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
I will actually get that to around a 5.5
to<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> six<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> used<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> having

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to a six like what I used to having

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.719 
to a six like what I used to having
black<00:01:16.560> ops<00:01:16.740> 2<00:01:16.950> once<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.670> get

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
black ops 2 once I do actually get

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.609 
black ops 2 once I do actually get

might have had high stats oh I did
anyway<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.960> had<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> twenty<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.740> loss

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
anyway I had like a twenty one loss

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.889 
anyway I had like a twenty one loss
ratio<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.939> guys<00:01:48.090> wanted<00:01:48.360> noticed<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.840> you

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
had very little losses that when you

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.770 
had very little losses that when you
actually<00:01:50.310> did<00:01:50.670> get<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> loss<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> horse<00:01:51.540> -

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
black ops 1 the loss would actually be

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.069 
black ops 1 the loss would actually be

have been an awesome feature because in

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.130 
have been an awesome feature because in
my<00:02:11.099> opinion<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.970> really<00:02:12.090> really<00:02:12.660> pointless

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

per<00:04:16.260> game<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.070> game<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.459> struggle<00:04:18.060> to

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
per game and in this game I struggle to

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.570 
per game and in this game I struggle to
get<00:04:18.299> like<00:04:18.450> 15<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.109> 30<00:04:19.320> kills<00:04:19.650> with<00:04:20.280> kill

get like 15 to 30 kills with kill
streaks<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.090> that's<00:04:21.239> just<00:04:21.420> how<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.840> just<00:04:22.320> don't

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
streaks and that's just how I just don't

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.930 
streaks and that's just how I just don't
think<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.770> fits<00:04:22.979> in<00:04:23.100> this<00:04:23.190> game<00:04:23.370> but<00:04:23.490> ideally<00:04:23.790> I

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
think it fits in this game but ideally I

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.220 
think it fits in this game but ideally I
will<00:04:24.180> want<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.510> try<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.900> get<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.140> like<00:04:25.260> top<00:04:25.470> 40

but with toughness added back on and
instead<00:06:52.900> of<00:06:53.050> this<00:06:53.139> answer<00:06:53.560> I<00:06:53.590> just<00:06:53.740> have<00:06:54.129> the

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
instead of this answer I just have the

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.790 
instead of this answer I just have the
red<00:06:54.490> dot<00:06:54.699> and<00:06:54.909> the<00:06:55.090> stalk<00:06:55.689> and<00:06:55.930> the<00:06:56.469> scope<00:06:56.650> and

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
red dot and the stalk and the scope and

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.140

Evo with the silence and the extended

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.490 
Evo with the silence and the extended
mag<00:06:58.330> and<00:06:58.599> this<00:06:58.750> is<00:06:58.900> the<00:06:58.990> only<00:06:59.139> one<00:06:59.259> where<00:06:59.379> it

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
mag and this is the only one where it

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.320 
mag and this is the only one where it
really<00:06:59.650> changes<00:07:00.189> on<00:07:00.400> my<00:07:00.580> shotguns<00:07:01.060> I<00:07:01.180> use

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
really changes on my shotguns I use

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.959 
really changes on my shotguns I use
hardline<00:07:01.810> like<00:07:02.020> where<00:07:02.520> scavenger<00:07:03.520> dexterity

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:03.969 
hardline like where scavenger dexterity

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:05.399 
hardline like where scavenger dexterity
and<00:07:04.030> extreme<00:07:04.330> conditioning<00:07:04.780> normally<00:07:05.169> along

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409 
and extreme conditioning normally along

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.140

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
with long barrel and extended mag but as

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.249 
with long barrel and extended mag but as
you<00:07:07.210> can<00:07:07.330> see<00:07:07.449> I<00:07:07.479> don't<00:07:07.599> have<00:07:07.840> that<00:07:07.960> unlocked

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259

you can see I don't have that unlocked
at<00:07:08.379> the<00:07:08.439> moment<00:07:08.740> so<00:07:08.830> I<00:07:08.860> do<00:07:08.979> have<00:07:09.280> toughness<00:07:09.639> on

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789 
at the moment so I do have toughness on

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:11.279

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289 
there but that's why I would use when I

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:12.749 
there but that's why I would use when I
