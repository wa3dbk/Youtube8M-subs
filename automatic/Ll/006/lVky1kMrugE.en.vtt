 I'm going to see them now and I'm going to take you 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.430
 with me 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.800
 Esteva was wounded 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:57.370
 with living in me and yes, but 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.370
 I live 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 efe 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.909
 I 'm going to see 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.909
 yes 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.770
 of the beast 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.760
 I grew up 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.810
 and this thing 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.300
 It's been raining for two days 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.410
 that has recorded a bit and I'm 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.170
 recording at home because it's me 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.090
 wet the camera but I'll try to go 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.820
 to see the flaw that I like the most that is 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.320
 the fault of the pillar and mascletÃ  is worth 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.320
 see if time allows me 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.520
 I'll see 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.520
 7 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.360
 will come 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.610
 allison a bayly that takes that measure 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.310
 I could not record anymore because the time 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.460
 did not accompany spent two days raining 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.310
 without stopping but they were very festive 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.380
 nice, even if passed by water and 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.240
 how I have been short the video 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.830
 I will take advantage and answer some of 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.140
 the questions of the corner because I have 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.760
 a few you left me many 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.440
 first you have left me many already 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.760
 I have answered the description then 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.920
 of the video I leave the list of 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.960
 reproduction of all the videos of the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.670
 corner of questions to not be 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.130
 repetitive and answer questions that already 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.660
 I have answered let's start with the 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.640
 first you would like the next 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.760
 expansion beyond supernatural thematic 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.820
 or season is difficult because I like them 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.760
 the two but I think that to begin with it would be 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.850
 better stations do not see the weather in the 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.830
 64 there's some little thing more though 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.840
 introduce the expansion and then if 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.450
 then follow supernatural please 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.920
 because I love all they have 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.570
 to do with the supernaturals in the 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.720
 sims have always liked a lot if 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.360
 do you believe in extraterrestrial life I believe 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.670
 that the universe is too big to 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.580
 that our planet is the only 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.670
 that allows life there must be more 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.830
 planets out there that allow it 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.840
 so if I think that it does have to 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.180
 have extraterrestrial life somewhere 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.660
 gatti fits me as a girl who wanted to be 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.240
 higher 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.630
 I have wanted to be many things but 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.000
 the one that had the most strength was the idea of 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.100
 be a veterinarian because I love the 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.840
 animals so that's what I wanted to be 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.520
 when I was little, you prefer to play more 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.760
 itself or with personalized content 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.770
 how you edit and which program you use and 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.690
 you prefer the sims 4 for its quality of 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.820
 graphics or the sims 3 for the variety of 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.620
 things that still does not have the last 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.900
 edition I prefer the base game with a 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.330
 little personalized content not much 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.220
 I do not like to put a lot because it can give 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.590
 problems to a slower game but the 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.480
 base game normally since it has 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.600
 little things and after playing a 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.530
 time like you get tired of repeating 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.120
 use the same hairstyles the same clothes 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.810
 then yes with a little bit of content 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.300
 personalized 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.220
 the program that I use to record 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.500
 always from the beginning is the chant 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.900
 and study 7 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.310
 to record and edit is the one 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.360
 I started using and I still use 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.010
 just use the midi list for the 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.690
 first episodes of the series of 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.270
 sims 2 because he was not able to 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.360
 reach me I will record it but it shows 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.670
 worse the graphic and sound quality and 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.160
 then I got the singing 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.200
 will record so everything achieved and edited it 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.930
 with the same program you sing me 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.550
 study 7 and between 64 and 63 me 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.180
 I remain with the 64 even though I have less 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.490
 objects and come with expansions 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.050
 the illustrious ones I really like the problem 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.710
 of the sims 3 is the number of errors 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:29.760
 they give you and the one that the sims themselves like 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:33.120
 characters are the least funny or 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.550
 less crazy I like more the 64 because 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.050
 it looks like the sims 2 have 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.570
 much funnier interactions 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.300
 so I'm keeping the 64 though 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.160
 have less things yet but already 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.080
 will arrive would you like them to get a 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.540
 expansion so there are animals in the 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.520
 64 is not that I like the idea is that 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.949
 I need pets 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.110
 I doubt very much that the 64 do not include them 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.930
 because throughout the saga there has always been 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.849
 Pets also know that we like that 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.009
 We're going to love them and we 're going to 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:06.539
 ask and if you realize in the 64 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:08.310
 they are aware of what we are asking for and we 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:10.740
 they are giving it many things of 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.680
 Free with updates 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.810
 so the pets will arrive 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.430
 of course I am almost convinced of 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.530
 that will see pets if you had to 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.509
 choose one of your sims from any of 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.849
 the channel series for companion of 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:25.620
 house which would you choose well this question 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:27.930
 is the one that I usually throw at you 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.970
 because he has made me funny and I for my 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:34.139
 part would choose samantha I think it would be 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:36.120
 a great funny roommate 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:37.889
 and if you have a problem, she is already 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.750
 and to remove the wand and become 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:42.240
 Toad anyone who bothers you 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.770
 so if I would choose samantha and good 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.020
 in the comments leave me your 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.659
 answer you can leave me more questions and 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.150
 although I have many still but let me 

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:52.620
 leave me more if you think of more things 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.139
 what to ask 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.729
 I hope you liked it as always 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:58.320
