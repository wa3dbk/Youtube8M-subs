okay here we are in the banks of our
local<00:02:04.980> River<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.970> it's<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.710> just

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
local River here it's just this is just

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.770 
local River here it's just this is just
a<00:02:08.040> random<00:02:08.460> river<00:02:08.670> that's<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:09.300> near<00:02:09.570> our

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
a random river that's that's near our

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.400 
a random river that's that's near our
house<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:11.450> wherever<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.750> live<00:02:12.990> there's

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
house and wherever you live there's

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.760 
house and wherever you live there's
probably<00:02:13.830> some<00:02:14.250> water<00:02:14.550> that's<00:02:14.940> close<00:02:15.570> by<00:02:15.840> it's

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
probably some water that's close by it's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.850 
probably some water that's close by it's
always<00:02:17.040> best<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.490> pull<00:02:17.730> water<00:02:17.940> out<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.300> a

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
always best to pull water out of a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.110 
always best to pull water out of a
running<00:02:19.860> river<00:02:20.130> that's<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.520> little<00:02:20.760> bit<00:02:20.880> better

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
running river that's a little bit better

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.930 
running river that's a little bit better
so<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.660> get<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.810> little<00:02:21.960> bit<00:02:22.110> cleaner<00:02:22.350> but

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
so you can get a little bit cleaner but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.150 
so you can get a little bit cleaner but
anywhere<00:02:24.200> anywhere<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.380> can<00:02:25.560> find<00:02:25.590> water

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
anywhere anywhere you can find water

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.520 
anywhere anywhere you can find water
it'll<00:02:26.490> work<00:02:26.730> now<00:02:26.910> I've<00:02:27.060> got<00:02:27.240> my<00:02:27.420> MSR<00:02:28.020> filter

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
it'll work now I've got my MSR filter

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.940 
it'll work now I've got my MSR filter
just<00:02:28.740> pulling<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.190> out<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.490> bag<00:02:30.590> no<00:02:31.590> bells
