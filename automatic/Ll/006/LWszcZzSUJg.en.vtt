00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.719
 t 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.529
 we are welcome to another new mission 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.880
 of Creole horses today to share 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.650
 with all of you dear friends 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.440
 our visit here to the cottage face to 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.420
 face of the sieber family in the party 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.610
 of almost the province of santa fe is not 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.440
 move from there I recommend horses 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.440
 criollos begins in this way 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.510
 let's now enter a description 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.120
 alca in the park of this lot of mares 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.360
 and obviously also supporting a 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.640
 foal that I really emphasized it to you 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.570
 father a son of the bolichero is not not like that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.970
 that are really giving a lot of tab and 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.430
 considered that it is so but let's go 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.520
 for example in the mother's group that 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.820
 they entered the face that is this rpt 114 by 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.310
 good example doing 14 the winged face 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.470
 face to give to that is the daughter of the symbol 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 national villero that simulation 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.360
 novillero is the son of the fa with the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 captive that the captive is wintering to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.289
 novillero with the calderita if badly 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.630
 I remember and the mother the mare that is a 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.180
 daughter of bichi man that with mother crag 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.800
 it's a mare that we also have the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.140
 put chips because they also have 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.490
 very good excellent blood mounted by 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.660
 there is not as advanced as we would like 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 because his nation that was in Mendoza 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.550
 in service with the pooch here 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.009
 with the bolichero then we fell behind 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.590
 a little but it's already that year and 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.880
 you would have more advanced plot but it is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.430
 as to go out to compete the year that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.530
 comes I think it's going to come out is the end of 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.810
 circuit of it as it would be now and the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.310
 that is to continue to fix it and see the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.080
 next year so it is or is 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.330
 we do not have to say of filly 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.220
 is is going to be for such a thing not with 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.200
 the noise mamo we started to train and there 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.519
 on the fly we see how many and 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.810
 can not walk well for the corral this 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.209
 another may be good for running 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.360
 we want to get into the brake also of a 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.950
 little bit or I always talk to him I saw 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.390
 with my father we deal with a not me 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.600
 you are always far away 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.850
 and to fulfill the goals to fulfill already 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.050
 long term not go crazy or say good 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.750
 between months we have to be the same 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.080
 has to be competing or is not 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.160
 try and slow or quiet and 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.020
 firm step that I can say of the 115 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.570
 good to 115 it came to me it goes 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.520
 preferred that is also the novillero 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.020
 with the expensive face neither hold on to him 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.770
 Arica the gypsy with a mare 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.390
 with crime a mare also beautiful me 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.100
 love and I love running what 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.070
 it happens that it's more or less like the 114 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.020
 he was two years three years in 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.730
 service and it's also a came to 6 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.250
 years ago and I started running now two 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.019
 months and well we already executed one 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.550
 run for 15 days just like walked 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.810
 pretty good for being the debut to be 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.760
 running with another came to new also 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.920
 and well now let's keep running 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.739
 here at home but I think we do 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.959
 it's very interesting yes I think so 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.959
 entering now into this father and stressed 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:45.190
 that obviously mother is the son of 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.769
 the 115 114 the 114 the 50 valley 114 with 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.360
 the bolillero with vinegar witcher or good 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.390
 He is also a stallion who will be 3 years old 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.520
 in December 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.290
 and we also have a lot of faith because either 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.480
 it's very nice looking let's see how 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.069
 continues to develop but I think it's going to 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.250
 be a very interesting horse in the 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.980
 morphological and functionally it would not have 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.700
 how to fail everything can fail but I think 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.800
 that is one it would be very possible that he passes away 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.740
 slight horse characteristic that part of 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.270
 good in its nice structure and everything and the 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.730
 structure that you have is a horse that a 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.600
 this age is one meter forty and 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.690
 medium has 21 scania and has 175 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.210
 ribs that is has a group 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.930
 interesting to me I do not end up convincing 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.270
 why a little bit the head but I think 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.370
 that by the blood that it has is more than 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.050
 interesting and I marked a cabin like you 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.400
 I said it seems like a bit of time, we give Diego 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.560
 service per year 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.200
 I the bolichero we take out that we change 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.720
 with nicotra four services that is 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.700
 four services I get that foal or 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.669
 be it for us it is very important not 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.260
 is that we gave 60 services to understand that is 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.880
 we much to lung to the 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.090
 Our selection is 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.010
 about if nothing almost nothing surely 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.570
 of course if we enter now in this in 349 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.420
 the bulb was really a daughter of 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.360
 the 115 good scenes came to 115 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.300
 with the pooch here is also another 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.490
 very interesting filly I love the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.980
 rump that has the mare eye I do not know anything 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.780
 I do not know much about morphology but me 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.240
 I really like the rump that has 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.680
 Chicho be here and good for my taste 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.880
 fails a little in the head in the 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.080
 ear for me they are a little long but 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.320
 also very interesting because we come back 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.570
 to the same we clash I must have 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.130
 89 females we are talking about a 10 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.490
 percent of production in the 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.590
 that you see me get a filly like this is 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.900
 a good production I think more than 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.810
 you have before with that comb also and with 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.580
 that morphology I also see it entering 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.410
 in a daily work topic of what 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.400
 is the cabin like how you work today 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.810
 here in the cabin good in the cabin 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.910
 training we are Luis and I 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.900
 we boot good we are practically 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.010
 seven in the morning good now 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.430
 we are starting a while before with 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:06.760
 clean 7 in the morning to 7 in the afternoon 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.670
 and we have Father Luis Pablo Dure who 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.470
 it does not make us the beds and it feeds and 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.320
 Well, we trained him all day 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.820
 has just finished training the 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.140
 training depends on training 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.230
 that the animal needs there are animals that 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.480
 we are training double shift there 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.330
 animals that we train only once 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.740
 a day and good and then depends if it is 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.110
 to run or for the part are the 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.650
 exercises or bumping or not butt hoop go to 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.180
 work the field run goes to the box 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.120
 Well, we have other demands too 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.700
 and we also throw them with the work of 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.500
 our livestock with the wolf end 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.020
 continually that set aside animals 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.060
 fat vaccinate and good while we're 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.270
 working we also do a little bit 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.430
 the horses to the field but if we would have 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.740
 to give this opening let's say for the 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.690
 public that wants to come to know them and 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.330
 it really says good we are interested 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.560
 in coming here to the cabin the cottage 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.030
 also offers the service of the 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.170
 stallions that have 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.580
 yes for now we do not have something armed but 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.980
 that is, we still do not have anything armed 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.830
 but the idea is to build something out there 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.110
 when queries arise a little bit 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.750
 something we can go arming but yes yes or 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.340
 let's say you have an animal disposition 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.190
 it's fine is also 66 and 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.680
 continuously yes yes yes yes there is always and 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.720
 castrated fillies and good services 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.670
 also available yes yes yes 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.440
 continuously there is if a question I'm going 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.960
 that he had armed with the service issue 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.230
 we do not have anything armed but with the 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.800
 idea in the future or is going arming 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.800
 also that alternative
