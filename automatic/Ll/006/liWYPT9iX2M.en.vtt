that<00:01:16.470> point<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.860> view<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.130> pretty

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
that point of view it's pretty

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.690

significant<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.950> obviously<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.399> chance<00:01:20.579> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
significant and obviously the chance to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.609 
significant and obviously the chance to
play<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.880> blood<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.479> game<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.200> Tokyo<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
reasons but this one in particular

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.910

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
body lost the lettuce like what's the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.870 
body lost the lettuce like what's the
approach<00:01:43.910> when<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:44.900> take<00:01:45.080> on<00:01:45.260> yourself<00:01:45.880> or

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
approach when you take on yourself or

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.690 
approach when you take on yourself or
without<00:01:47.600> actually<00:01:48.380> sitting<00:01:49.040> down<00:01:49.250> yet<00:01:49.490> and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
without actually sitting down yet and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.750 
without actually sitting down yet and
discussing<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.480> I<00:01:51.340> think<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.400> just<00:01:52.430> got<00:01:52.700> to

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
discussing it I think you just got to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.000 
discussing it I think you just got to
approach<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:54.020> know<00:01:54.110> really<00:01:54.530> with<00:01:54.710> nothing

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
approach it you know really with nothing

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.370 
approach it you know really with nothing
to<00:01:55.130> lose<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.550> go<00:01:55.940> there<00:01:55.970> Beck<00:01:56.390> ourselves<00:01:56.900> we've

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
to lose I go there Beck ourselves we've

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.100 
to lose I go there Beck ourselves we've
got<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.560> young<00:01:57.710> squad<00:01:58.150> so<00:01:59.150> just<00:01:59.420> reinforcing

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
got a young squad so just reinforcing

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.240 
got a young squad so just reinforcing
confidence<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.680> getting<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> play<00:02:01.130> the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
confidence and getting the play the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.300 
confidence and getting the play the
natural<00:02:01.550> game<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:02.300> think<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:03.220> think<00:02:04.220> that

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
natural game I think I think that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.620 
natural game I think I think that
mentality<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.820> we've<00:02:05.000> got<00:02:05.120> nothing<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.479> lose

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
mentality that we've got nothing to lose

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.000 
mentality that we've got nothing to lose
he's<00:02:06.050> probably<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.440> biggest<00:02:06.620> thing<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:06.860> we

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
he's probably the biggest thing that we

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.710 
he's probably the biggest thing that we
need<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.190> take<00:02:07.400> him<00:02:07.520> there<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.179> looking<00:02:08.509> for

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
need to take him there and looking for

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.900 
need to take him there and looking for
revenge<00:02:08.810> after<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.560> loss<00:02:09.830> Monty<00:02:10.340> well

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
revenge after that loss Monty well

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.510 
revenge after that loss Monty well
definitely<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.330> think<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.720> know<00:02:11.840> we<00:02:12.220> we<00:02:13.220> lost<00:02:13.400> a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
definitely I think you know we we lost a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.310 
definitely I think you know we we lost a
little<00:02:13.640> bit<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:14.000> pride<00:02:14.570> in<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.900> game<00:02:15.140> so

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
little bit of a pride in that game so

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.590 
little bit of a pride in that game so
it's<00:02:15.920> all<00:02:16.070> about<00:02:16.100> regaining<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.820> and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
it's all about regaining that and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.699 
it's all about regaining that and
hopefully<00:02:18.020> getting<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.040> win<00:02:19.930> Rocky<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.260> his<00:02:21.530> own

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
hopefully getting a win Rocky is his own

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.610 
hopefully getting a win Rocky is his own
man<00:02:22.690> how<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.840> think<00:02:23.989> because<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.530> have

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
man how do you think because we have

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.490 
man how do you think because we have
reacted<00:02:25.130> he<00:02:25.760> delivers<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.300> instructions<00:02:26.900> I

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
reacted he delivers the instructions I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500 
reacted he delivers the instructions I
think<00:02:28.489> everyone's<00:02:28.790> got<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:28.970> lot<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.150> respect

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
think everyone's got a lot of respect

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.490 
think everyone's got a lot of respect
for<00:02:29.630> rock<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.670> know<00:02:31.730> that's<00:02:31.850> obviously

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
for rock so you know that's obviously

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.720 
for rock so you know that's obviously
I'm<00:02:33.500> happy<00:02:33.800> for<00:02:33.830> rock<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.280> either<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.640> got

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
I'm happy for rock that either you got

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.400 
I'm happy for rock that either you got
his<00:02:34.880> opportunity<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.510> think<00:02:35.900> he's<00:02:36.020> more<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.320> a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
his opportunity I think he's more of a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.930 
his opportunity I think he's more of a
less<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.010> talker<00:02:37.250> he's<00:02:37.459> more<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:37.670> a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
less of a talker he's more just a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.390 
less of a talker he's more just a
lettuce<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.360> think<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.890> know<00:02:39.950> he<00:02:40.100> said<00:02:40.310> it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
lettuce I think you know he said it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800 
lettuce I think you know he said it
before<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.790> he<00:02:40.850> leads<00:02:41.030> with<00:02:41.120> his<00:02:41.239> actions<00:02:41.630> so

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
before that he leads with his actions so

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.150 
before that he leads with his actions so
I'm<00:02:42.170> sure<00:02:42.470> that's<00:02:42.650> what<00:02:42.769> he'll<00:02:42.920> do<00:02:43.040> it

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.250 

he<00:02:48.160> said<00:02:48.400> tinkering<00:02:49.210> on<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.660> new<00:02:50.080> balance<00:02:52.260> bit

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
he said tinkering on a new balance bit

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260 
he said tinkering on a new balance bit
down<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.830> exactly<00:02:54.790> sure<00:02:54.970> what<00:02:55.150> you're

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
can fix with but i think you know now is

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.970 
can fix with but i think you know now is
the<00:03:04.600> time<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.810> we<00:03:05.020> really<00:03:05.230> need<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.440> settle

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
the time that we really need to settle

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.800 
the time that we really need to settle
those<00:03:06.190> out<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.670> work<00:03:07.180> out<00:03:07.360> who's<00:03:07.570> going<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.720> be

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
those out and work out who's going to be

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.210 
those out and work out who's going to be
where<00:03:07.990> and<00:03:08.200> how<00:03:08.290> we're<00:03:08.410> going<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.560> place<00:03:08.770> up<00:03:09.010> I
