00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.730 
so I put it in my external ide enclosure
and<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.299> see<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.380> still<00:01:19.710> works

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and I'm gonna see if it still works

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.100

because<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.880> said<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.090> may<00:01:21.420> still<00:01:21.689> work<00:01:21.869> but

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
because you said it may still work but

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.219 
because you said it may still work but
who'd<00:01:22.500> want<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.770> 10<00:01:22.979> gig<00:01:23.159> hard<00:01:23.340> drive<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.229> I'm

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
who'd want a 10 gig hard drive and I'm

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
who'd want a 10 gig hard drive and I'm
going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.560> hopefully<00:01:26.070> watch<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.640> seek<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
going to hopefully watch it seek and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.149 
going to hopefully watch it seek and
maybe<00:01:28.110> i'll<00:01:28.470> copy<00:01:29.280> some<00:01:29.520> data<00:01:29.700> over<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.659> its

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
maybe i'll copy some data over if its

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.399 
maybe i'll copy some data over if its
format<00:01:32.570> formatted<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:33.900> Mac<00:01:34.110> can

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
format formatted that my Mac can

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.480 
format formatted that my Mac can
recognize<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.500> go<00:01:37.530> let's<00:01:38.130> cross<00:01:38.340> your

recognize so here we go let's cross your
fingers<00:01:38.759> hopefully<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.840> will<00:01:39.960> seek<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:42.170> and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170

that<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.560> moves<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.220> who<00:02:59.580> can<00:02:59.760> fast<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
that just moves so who can fast that is

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.670 
that just moves so who can fast that is
amazing<00:03:01.050> how<00:03:01.530> fast<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:02.010> new<00:03:03.470> disc<00:03:04.470> is

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
amazing how fast that new disc is

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.430 
amazing how fast that new disc is
spinning<00:03:04.830> probably<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.670> guess<00:03:06.000> maybe<00:03:06.320> 5400<00:03:07.320> or

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
spinning probably I guess maybe 5400 or

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.260 
spinning probably I guess maybe 5400 or
7200<00:03:07.890> RPM<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:10.520> actually<00:03:11.520> have<00:03:11.820> another<00:03:11.970> hard

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
7200 RPM I actually have another hard

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.770 
7200 RPM I actually have another hard
drive<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.570> i<00:03:12.660> dismantled<00:03:13.290> hear<00:03:13.770> some<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.040> the

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
drive that i dismantled hear some of the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.110 
drive that i dismantled hear some of the
the<00:03:15.780> platter<00:03:16.020> one<00:03:16.680> platter<00:03:16.920> since<00:03:17.730> I've<00:03:17.880> had

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
the platter one platter since I've had

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.480 
the platter one platter since I've had
it<00:03:18.470> key<00:03:19.470> clatters<00:03:21.680> pink<00:03:22.680> that's<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.220> head

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
it key clatters pink that's the head

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.380 
it key clatters pink that's the head
from<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.910> other<00:03:24.060> hard<00:03:24.360> drive<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.940> one<00:03:27.180> has

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
from that other hard drive this one has

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.380 
from that other hard drive this one has
four<00:03:27.840> arms<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.400> see<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:31.410> head

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
four arms on it see that this head

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.990 
four arms on it see that this head
probably<00:03:33.390> cannot<00:03:33.990> see<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.730> think<00:03:35.760> my

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
probably cannot see and I think my

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.940 
probably cannot see and I think my
cameras<00:03:36.390> going<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.630> focus<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.290> only<00:03:37.470> has<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.860> be

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
cameras going to focus it only has to be

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.300 
cameras going to focus it only has to be
armed<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.940> was<00:03:39.150> going<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.390> make<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> clock<00:03:40.310> out

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
armed so I was going to make a clock out

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.480 
armed so I was going to make a clock out
of<00:03:41.550> this<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:43.260> think<00:03:43.410> I'll<00:03:43.890> use<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.340> head

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
of this and I think I'll use the head

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.620 
of this and I think I'll use the head
with<00:03:44.640> forearm<00:03:45.180> for<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.720> minute<00:03:46.380> hand<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
with forearm for the minute hand and the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.850 
with forearm for the minute hand and the
head<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:48.930> just<00:03:49.170> three<00:03:49.320> arms<00:03:49.590> for<00:03:49.710> the<00:03:49.740> hour

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
head with just three arms for the hour

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.070 
head with just three arms for the hour
hand<00:03:50.130> because<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.430> just<00:03:50.460> makes<00:03:50.790> sense<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:53.340> I

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
hand because that just makes sense and I

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.240 
hand because that just makes sense and I
think<00:03:55.080> I'm<00:03:55.470> actually<00:03:55.590> going<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.920> build<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
think I'm actually going to build the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.680 
think I'm actually going to build the
clock<00:03:56.460> into<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:56.880> case<00:03:57.210> because<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:57.570> so

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
clock into this case because it's so

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.720 
clock into this case because it's so
beautiful<00:03:58.170> it's<00:03:58.380> round<00:03:58.740> if<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.100> can<00:03:59.490> see<00:03:59.700> that

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
beautiful it's round if you can see that

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.150 
beautiful it's round if you can see that
it<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.660> very<00:04:00.960> interesting<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.950> had<00:04:02.130> the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
it is very interesting it had the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.420 
it is very interesting it had the
plastic<00:04:02.730> cover<00:04:03.210> on<00:04:03.300> it<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:04.340> formed<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
plastic cover on it and that formed the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.110 
plastic cover on it and that formed the
square<00:04:05.880> corners<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:08.910> case<00:04:09.090> is

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
square corners and so this case is

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.680 
square corners and so this case is
around<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.870> flippin<00:04:10.350> gorgeous<00:04:10.380> I

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
can't believe how beautiful it is I

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.770 
can't believe how beautiful it is I

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.620 

I'm<00:04:28.790> back<00:04:30.610> apparently<00:04:31.610> finder<00:04:32.000> is<00:04:32.120> kind<00:04:32.510> of

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
I'm back apparently finder is kind of

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.629 
I'm back apparently finder is kind of
finicky<00:04:32.990> right<00:04:33.290> now<00:04:33.470> with<00:04:34.540> USB<00:04:35.540> drives<00:04:35.810> I

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
finicky right now with USB drives I

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.240 
finicky right now with USB drives I
always<00:04:37.639> use<00:04:37.820> firewire<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:39.260> I'm<00:04:39.620> try<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.889> skin

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
always use firewire so I'm try the skin

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:49.090 
always use firewire so I'm try the skin
I<00:04:40.460> want<00:04:40.729> to<00:04:40.820> see<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.150> rewrites<00:04:41.540> and<00:04:41.690> data<00:04:42.310> on<00:04:43.310> up

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.660 

waiting<00:04:50.650> as<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:51.830> can<00:04:51.980> see<00:04:52.100> there's<00:04:52.310> probably

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
waiting as you can see there's probably

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.810 
waiting as you can see there's probably
definitely<00:04:53.060> something<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.350> little<00:04:55.190> wrong<00:04:55.520> with

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
definitely something a little wrong with

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.810 
definitely something a little wrong with
it<00:04:57.040> that<00:04:59.350> is<00:05:00.350> taking<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:00.980> wherever<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.640> to

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
it that is taking it wherever it to

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:10.530 
it that is taking it wherever it to
mount

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.550 

because<00:05:11.140> normally<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.940> would<00:05:13.120> not<00:05:13.510> take<00:05:13.780> any

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
because normally it would not take any

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:23.380 
because normally it would not take any
of<00:05:14.740> my<00:05:14.860> hard<00:05:15.070> drive<00:05:15.280> this<00:05:15.550> long<00:05:15.790> to<00:05:16.030> mount

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.900 

so<00:05:23.990> maybe<00:05:24.230> but<00:05:24.590> it's<00:05:24.740> almost<00:05:24.890> dead<00:05:25.340> but<00:05:25.370> on

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
so maybe but it's almost dead but on

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.610 
so maybe but it's almost dead but on
your<00:05:26.180> knee<00:05:26.330> death<00:05:26.540> clicks<00:05:26.900> or<00:05:27.110> anything<00:05:27.470> of

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
your knee death clicks or anything of

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.030 
your knee death clicks or anything of
the<00:05:27.650> sort<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:28.550> who<00:05:29.090> knows<00:05:29.470> it<00:05:30.470> is<00:05:30.590> an<00:05:30.710> old<00:05:30.830> hard
