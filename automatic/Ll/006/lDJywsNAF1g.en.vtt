real handy anyway first step is

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.859 
real handy anyway first step is
obviously<00:00:22.560> take<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> string<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:24.359> thread<00:00:24.720> it

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
obviously take the string you thread it

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.740 
obviously take the string you thread it
through<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.230> hole<00:00:25.580> then<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.760> take<00:00:27.000> about<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
through the hole then you take about the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.839 
through the hole then you take about the
you<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.199> an<00:00:28.320> extra<00:00:28.740> about<00:00:29.010> four<00:00:29.400> inches

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

you have an extra about four inches
right<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.859> you<00:00:31.859> take<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.250> string<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.910> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
right here you take the string and you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.979 
right here you take the string and you
underneath<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.110> string<00:00:34.440> right<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.989> you

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
underneath the string right here and you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.500 
underneath the string right here and you
have<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> loop<00:00:37.469> there<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.910> cross<00:00:39.270> over

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
have a loop there and you cross over

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.479 
have a loop there and you cross over
here<00:00:40.190> under<00:00:41.930> under<00:00:42.930> again<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.950> normally<00:00:44.190> do

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
here under under again and I normally do

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.119 
here under under again and I normally do
three<00:00:44.850> times<00:00:45.469> then<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.680> pull<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.100> tight<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
three times then you pull it tight and

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
three times then you pull it tight and
pull<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> until<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.730> taut<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.390> okay

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
let's go up to the machine ahead of the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700 
let's go up to the machine ahead of the
tuning<00:00:54.300> key<00:00:54.719> whatever<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.440> call<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
tuning key whatever you want to call it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
tuning key whatever you want to call it
and<00:00:56.660> what<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.270> thread<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and what I like to do is you thread it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.780 
and what I like to do is you thread it
through<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.220> will<00:01:05.489> allow

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
through here and if if if it will allow

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.969 
through here and if if if it will allow
you<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.060> thread<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> again<00:01:07.220> one<00:01:08.220> more<00:01:08.400> time<00:01:09.979> just

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
you I thread it again one more time just

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.649 
you I thread it again one more time just
kind<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.610> these<00:01:11.790> big<00:01:12.060> shows<00:01:12.390> here

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
kind of like one of these big shows here

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.420 
kind of like one of these big shows here
so<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.720> thread<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.140> through<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.710> twice<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
so you thread it through there twice and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.050 
so you thread it through there twice and
that<00:01:17.549> helps<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> lock<00:01:18.330> lock<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.820> okay<00:01:20.820> then

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that helps it lock lock it on okay then

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.080 
that helps it lock lock it on okay then
then<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.689> pull<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> tight<00:01:22.610> then<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.850> our

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
then you pull it tight then we get our

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
then you pull it tight then we get our
nifty<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:24.840> dilly<00:01:25.650> barber<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.110> what
