lower speed this ball is for you tell us
why<00:01:07.570> scoops<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:08.200> as<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.759> medium<00:01:09.759> high<00:01:10.090> RG

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
why scoops it as a medium high RG

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.779 
why scoops it as a medium high RG
symmetric<00:01:11.619> core<00:01:11.830> which<00:01:12.039> means<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.430> goes<00:01:12.520> down

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
symmetric core which means it goes down

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.040 
symmetric core which means it goes down
a<00:01:12.820> little<00:01:12.940> bit<00:01:13.060> farther<00:01:13.300> before<00:01:13.509> tribes<00:01:13.869> up

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
a little bit farther before tribes up

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.719 
a little bit farther before tribes up
and<00:01:14.470> it<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.649> a<00:01:14.680> high<00:01:14.920> differential<00:01:15.580> which

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
and it is a high differential which

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.670 
and it is a high differential which
means<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.030> has<00:01:16.149> a<00:01:16.180> high<00:01:16.360> flare<00:01:16.630> potential<00:01:17.050> yeah

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
means it has a high flare potential yeah

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.980 
means it has a high flare potential yeah

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
said you can see it's a very gentle move

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.320 
said you can see it's a very gentle move
to<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.830> pocket<00:02:30.330> yep<00:02:31.330> I'm<00:02:31.540> very<00:02:31.840> smooth<00:02:32.680> um

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
to the pocket yep I'm very smooth um

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.970 
to the pocket yep I'm very smooth um
gets<00:02:34.330> down<00:02:34.570> there<00:02:34.780> far<00:02:35.050> before<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.470> breaks<00:02:35.680> in

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
gets down there far before it breaks in

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.699 
gets down there far before it breaks in
and<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:37.600> way<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.810> we've<00:02:37.930> had<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.200> drilled<00:02:38.440> is

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
and the way that we've had it drilled is

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.729 
and the way that we've had it drilled is
so<00:02:39.070> it's<00:02:39.220> not<00:02:39.400> super<00:02:40.120> angular<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:41.260> allows<00:02:41.709> us

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
so it's not super angular this allows us

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.140 
so it's not super angular this allows us
to<00:02:41.920> play<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> little<00:02:42.310> bit<00:02:42.489> more<00:02:42.670> into<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> oil

to play a little bit more into the oil

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.600 
to play a little bit more into the oil
without<00:02:43.540> having<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.110> overreact<00:02:44.769> yeah<00:02:45.400> if<00:02:45.519> we

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
without having it overreact yeah if we

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.570 
scoops has been working on his hand a
little<00:04:25.110> bit<00:04:25.259> and<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.100> really<00:04:26.280> increased

his<00:04:26.729> Rev<00:04:26.940> rate<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.750> he's<00:04:27.900> been<00:04:28.050> having<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.560> move

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
his Rev rate so he's been having to move

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.589 
his Rev rate so he's been having to move
farther<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.039> farther<00:04:29.220> in<00:04:29.520> this<00:04:30.030> ball<00:04:30.300> allows

the beating up the Leia and he can still

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.080 
the beating up the Leia and he can still
get<00:04:37.949> that<00:04:37.979> angle<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.490> entry<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.910> pocket

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.860 
get that angle of entry to the pocket
keep<00:04:39.750> my<00:04:39.900> line<00:04:40.139> longer<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.539> said<00:04:42.539> this<00:04:42.660> ball

is<00:04:43.020> nice<00:04:43.229> for<00:04:43.590> allies<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.310> goes<00:04:44.490> down<00:04:44.729> nice

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
is nice for allies so it goes down nice

is nice for allies so it goes down nice
and<00:04:45.240> clean<00:04:45.630> gets<00:04:46.259> through<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.560> heads<00:04:47.990> that

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
and clean gets through the heads that

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.020 
and clean gets through the heads that
was<00:04:49.139> a<00:04:49.169> little<00:04:49.410> tighter<00:04:49.699> but<00:04:50.699> see<00:04:50.820> that's<00:04:50.970> the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
was a little tighter but see that's the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.640 
was a little tighter but see that's the
nice<00:04:51.180> thing<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:52.110> gets<00:04:52.289> into<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.620> oil

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
nice thing is it gets into the oil

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.310 
nice thing is it gets into the oil

playing it nice yeah it's a little bit
further<00:05:37.889> out<00:05:38.190> than<00:05:38.220> you<00:05:38.490> have<00:05:38.639> been<00:05:38.789> playing

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
further out than you have been playing

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.529 
further out than you have been playing
um<00:05:40.009> which<00:05:41.009> is<00:05:41.159> good<00:05:41.370> different<00:05:42.360> look

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
um which is good different look

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.499 
um which is good different look
different<00:05:43.530> angle<00:05:43.830> yeah<00:05:44.430> now<00:05:44.699> I<00:05:44.729> have<00:05:45.270> a<00:05:45.300> lot<00:05:45.479> of

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
different angle yeah now I have a lot of

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.710 
different angle yeah now I have a lot of
access<00:05:45.900> tilt<00:05:46.199> so<00:05:46.520> my<00:05:47.520> ball<00:05:47.729> tends<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.210> jump<00:05:48.539> off

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
access tilt so my ball tends to jump off

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.850 
access tilt so my ball tends to jump off
the<00:05:49.909> wet<00:05:50.909> when<00:05:51.240> it<00:05:51.330> hits<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:51.599> dry<00:05:51.810> and<00:05:52.110> move

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
the wet when it hits the dry and move

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.800 
the wet when it hits the dry and move
left<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:53.759> this<00:05:53.880> really<00:05:54.300> allows<00:05:54.389> me<00:05:54.690> to<00:05:54.780> have

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
left and this really allows me to have

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.620 
left and this really allows me to have
something<00:05:55.169> very<00:05:55.349> smooth<00:05:55.889> I<00:05:56.729> can<00:05:57.210> play<00:05:57.330> in

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
something very smooth I can play in

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.779 
something very smooth I can play in
there<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:57.930> can<00:05:58.199> also<00:05:58.349> move<00:05:58.680> out<00:05:58.919> farther<00:05:59.370> and

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
there I can also move out farther and

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.390 
there I can also move out farther and
play<00:06:00.599> up<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.780> boards<00:06:01.050> if<00:06:01.169> I<00:06:01.259> have<00:06:01.470> to<00:06:01.710> you<00:06:02.310> can
